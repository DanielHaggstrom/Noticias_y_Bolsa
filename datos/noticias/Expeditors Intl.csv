The index dipped from positive to negative territory late in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve cut US growth forecasts and offered no hope that there would be another round of monetary stimulus.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent to 12,109.67 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,669.19.According to Investment Company Institute, the last two week were the worst fortnight for equity outflow since May 2010, the week of the flash crash. This did not help the mood in the markets.Wall Street was hurt by a move in the dollar, which edged higher after the Bernanke press conference. This weighed on the industrial, energy and material sectors.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, although these losses were pared somewhat by L-3 Communications, which spiked 4.6 per cent to $86.21 after reports that investors were pushing the defence company to spin off some units.The S&P energy and material sectors were both down 0.4 per cent.In the materials sector, CF Industries was down 2.8 per cent to $142.25 while Allegheny fell 2.5 per cent to $59.91.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.9 per cent to $142.25 while EOG Resources lost 0.8 per cent to $101.34.But the technology sector was the worst performing in the session, led lower by Adobe Systems, the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500.The software company that makes the Photoshop and Illustrator programs for media and internet professionals gave a disappointing earnings forecast, which dragged the stock down 6.3 per cent to $30.01.These losses came despite the fact that the company reported a 54 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings.Many analysts were still upbeat about the software maker in the long term.Analysts at Citigroup said that there were “lots of small things to quibble about” but that the “big picture [was] still bright”.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Autodesk was down 1.5 per cent to $36.47 while Juniper Networks lost 2.4 per cent to $29.53.The S&P technology index was down 0.8 per cent, although losses were pared by strong gains from Jabil Circuit. The electronics contractor was up 3.2 per cent to $19.45 after reporting powerful earnings and a share buy-back.Homebuilders also saw gains after home prices as tracked by the Federal Housing Finance Agency rose 0.8 per cent in April from the previous month, which was better than the 0.3 per cent fall that had been expected. PulteGroup was up 0.4 per cent to $7.49 while DR Horton added 1.4 per cent to $11.54.Consumer staples stocks also suffered, led by Lorillard Tobacco, which was down 1.7 per cent to $110.01.In the previous session, the US Food and Drug Administration released nine warnings on the ill-effects of smoking – combining graphic images and text – that must appear on cigarette packets as well as in advertisements no later than September 2012.The S&P consumer staples index was down, 0.7 per cent.CarMax, the used-car dealer, enjoyed the strongest gains on the S&P 500 after reporting first-quarter earnings up 25 per cent, beating analysts’ expectations. Its shares were up 7 per cent to $32.66 as earnings came in at $126.3m, or 55 cents a share, which was ahead of the 47 cents expected.AeroVironment’s fourth-quarter earnings rose 20.6 per cent on a jump in contract-services, leaving shares in the maker of unmanned aircraft up 19.6 per cent to $34.51.
1;EXPD;Expeditors Intl;2011-03-17T21:50:47Z;Wall Street led by industrial gains;;Industrial and commodity stocks led a rebound on Wall Street following strong manufacturing data and a sense that the sharp sell-off in the previous session had been overdone.The S&P 500 bounced back 1.3 per cent to 1,273.72, paring some of the 2 per cent losses in the previous session, boosted by news that the Philadelphia Fed business activity index had showed its best monthly reading since January 1984.The index climbed 7.3 points in March to 43.4, far surpassing the 28.8 reading expected by economists.Also lifting sentiment was separate figures showing that weekly unemployment claims had declined by 16,000 to 385,000. “The downtrend in initial jobless claims is undeniable,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The data helped industrial stocks post some of the strongest gains in the session, recovering from some of the sharp losses earlier in the week. General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant in Japan, added 1.4 per cent to $19.22, paring back the 3.4 per cent losses seen in the previous session. The stock is down 5.6 per cent over the week, however.The S&P industrial index was up 1.6 per cent, reducing some of the 3.9 per cent losses suffered in the past five days. 3M was up 1.3 per cent to $88.69 while Honeywell was 1.6 per cent higher to $55.21 in the session.Elsewhere in the sector, FedEx saw gains after giving a strong fourth-quarter profit forecast. The package delivery company predicted a profit of $1.66 to $1.83 a share, topping the $1.66 estimated by analysts.This bright outlook overshadowed a reported 3.3 per cent fall in third-quarter profits and the shares were up 3.1 per cent to $87.89.Shares in rival UPS were up 1.8 per cent to $71.61 while Expeditors added 1.2 per cent to $47.11.Energy stocks saw the most powerful gains, however, as oil and gas prices jumped due to the turmoil in Japan and Bahrain.Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, was up 4.8 per cent to $87.06 while ConocoPhillips, the energy group, added 4 per cent to $76.72. The S&P energy sector jumped 3.1 per cent.Material stocks also saw strong gains. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, was up 3.4 per cent to $52 as copper prices rose due to subsiding global panic. Cliff Natural Resources was up 5.8 per cent to $88.60.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.4 per cent higher to 11,774.51 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,636.05 in the session.Still, strategists warned that this was not the end of the pullback in US equities and the market was still in a corrective phase. “The averages will probably work their way a bit lower in the coming weeks, but we are probably more than halfway through the corrections,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The S&P is still down 5.2 per cent since its mid-February high before the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa. The index is down 2.3 per cent over the week, but still up 1.3 per cent since the start of the year. The previous session saw the index fall into negative territory for the year for the first time.The Vix index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was down 10.4 per cent in the session. It is up 30.8 per cent over the week and 60 per cent above mid-February lows. Elsewhere, technology stocks saw gains, rebounding from a week of sharp losses.Qualcomm, which lost 4.7 per cent in the previous session, was up 3.6 per cent to $52.32 after the mobile-phone chipmaker said it sees limited impact from the Japanese disaster.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Apple was up 1.4 per cent to $334.64 while Hewlett-Packard gained 3.2 per cent to $41.40. The S&P technology index was up 1 per cent, paring some of the 2.7 per cent fall previously in the week.In corporate news Winnebago Industries, the motor home manufacturer, reported a surprising 3.6 per cent decline in second- quarter revenue, sending the stock down 12 per cent to $13.37. The company blamed weakening consumer confidence caused by volatility in gas prices for the fall. Elsewhere Guess, the clothing retailer, gave a weak outlook both for earnings this year and for the current quarter’s results. The company also reported lower comparable sales at its larger US retail business declined. Shares were down 14 per cent to $37.71.
2;EXPD;Expeditors Intl;2011-02-01T22:09:14Z;Wall Street matches 2008 mark;;"US equities broke through a series of technical barriers as a series of strong earnings reports from industry heavyweights and promising manufacturing data set a buoyant mood.The S&P 500 closed above 1,300 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 12,000 as Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, reported that its fourth-quarter profit more than tripled from a year earlier. This sent shares in the company up 5.5 per cent to $19.22.The industry bellwether posted income of $2.89bn, or 36 cents a share, up from $767m, or 10 cents a share a year earlier. Optimism over the stock was muted slightly, however, as the company gave a 2011 profit forecast that was below analysts’ expectations.Nevertheless, the news helped lift the rest of the pharmaceutical sector. Mylan, one of the world’s largest generic drugs companies, was up 1.6 per cent to $23.54 while Merck gained 2.5 per cent to $34.But the best performing sector on Wall Street was the materials sector, which was lifted by data showing booming manufacturing activity in the US and around the world.The S&P materials index was up 2.8 per cent to 246.02 as the ISM manufacturing composite index jumped to 60.8 in January, up 2.3 from December and ahead of the median forecast of 58. This was its highest level since May 2004.“Today’s report is another very strong signal regarding near-term manufacturing activity. To sustain this strength, much will depend on the consumer,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Among the stocks to gain were Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore and coal miner, which was up 4.9 per cent to $89.64 and Alcoa, an aluminium producer, which added 4.5 per cent to $17.32.This helped the S&P 500 close 1.7 per cent higher to 1,307,59 busting through the technically significant 1,300 mark that the markets struggled with last week.The S&P index lost 1.8 per cent late last week on disappointing GDP figures and concerns that the Suez Canal might be shut down due to the protests in Egypt. But the markets have now completely bounced back from those losses after two consecutive sessions of strong gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3 per cent to 12,040.16, the first time the index closed above 12,000 since June 2008. Last month, the index saw its best January performance since 1997. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.9 per cent to 2,751.19 in the session.Central to investor confidence in the session was a string of healthy earnings reports. Archer Daniels Midland, the world’s largest grain processor, reported that second-quarter earnings had jumped 29 per cent in the second quarter due to high grain prices and strong global demand. This sent shares in the company up 6.2 per cent to $34.70.ADM reported a net profit of $732m, or $1.14 per share, compared with a profit of $567m, or 88 cents per share, a year earlier and way ahead of analysts’ estimates of 78 cents per share.United Parcel Service also saw strong results, reporting a 48 per cent jump in profits due to strong demand over the holiday period. The logistics group also forecast that 2011 will see record earnings, eclipsing the 2007 peak in earnings. The news lifted the shares 4.2 per cent to $74.59.Fedex, another global delivery company, added 2.6 per cent to $92.69.Also helping to liven the S&P index were energy stocks, which saw strong gains as the Brent crude oil price hit $100 a barrel in the previous session for the first time since October 2008.ExxonMobil, the giant of the energy sector, was up another 4 per cent to $83.91 in the session. The company posted earnings on Monday close to the 2008 record, which sent the shares up 2.1 per cent. The stock is up 36 per cent since the start of September.Murphy Oil was up 3.1 per cent to $68.37 while the S&P energy index added 1.9 per cent to 554.13.Lexmark International, which makes laser and inkjet printers, saw some of the strongest gains on the S&P index, rising 13.2 per cent to $39.45 after predicting strong first-quarter
profits.Baidu saw strong gains after the Chinese internet-search group said revenue had doubled in the fourth quarter and net earnings had increased by 171 per cent, beating analyst and company expectations. The stock was up 9.3 per cent to $118.73. Rival Google rose 1.8 per cent to $611.04"
3;EXPD;Expeditors Intl;2007-05-14T20:13:02Z;Straight talk and the quest for greatness;;"I’m afraid I’m never going to be a great man. Here’s why. I was talking to an analyst at one of the top two banks the other day and he was describing to me why a particular chief executive was “great” and hence his company was a potential buy. “He even flies coach everywhere,” the analyst said.Huh, I thought to myself, this is really not good for me. For instance, if I only had $500 to my name and coach was $300 but business class was $600 I would stand on a corner, hat in hand and beg until I raised the $100 so I could fly business class. Not that I’m a snob. But I like the extra attention I get for what would be an otherwise miserable five-hour trip. Not to mention the extra leg room for my 5ft 9in frame.Why is someone great if he flies coach, particularly if he is chief executive of
a $10bn company? If I were a shareholder I’d want my chief executive to be comfortable. Heck, I’d want him to fly a private jet so he could get work done!Why is it always so great to be an ascetic? Here are some other examples of greatness:● “He only makes $1 a year salary.” This includes guys such as Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Steve Jobs and Richard Kinder. All of these guys might be great (Mr Kinder in particular) but believe me they make billions in every other way so raising them to $100,000 wouldn’t make a dent one way or the other.● “He answers his own phone.” A friend of mine recently called Charlie Munger, the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett’s right-hand man. Mr Munger picked up his phone. That’s incredible. He picked it up with his own hands. People are lucky if I return their messages, let alone pick up the phone.● “Not giving earnings guidance.” Great men can’t give guidance. Mr Buffett doesn’t do it. Mr Page and Mr Brin don’t do it. Microsoft gives guidance but for 15 years people haven’t picked up on the fact that it always plays down the next year, “it’s not going to be as good next year as last”. Mr Buffett also does that. This is called underpromising and overdelivering. It’s a useful skill if you can do it. I can’t do it. I tend to overpromise and then have to work extra hard to over deliver. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. It’s spotty at best but I’m usually excited about whatever it is I’m promising on. That combined with lack of self-control puts me in a bad spot.A corollary of the above is the “straight shooter”. Check out the 8K filings for Expeditors International. The chief executive publishes a Q&A with analysts. He is brutal. I mean, if you ask a dumb question be prepared to have it plastered all over that 8K filing for everyone to read. That said, his 8K fillings are filled with greatness.In the last one, someone asked why the company doesn’t buy back more shares. In his answer, Peter Rose, chief executive, said: “We are not ignorant of the theory of how increasing financial leverage results in maximising returns. That having been said, over the years, we’ve seen repeated examples of others in this business who’ve fallen under the spell of erudite consultants and investment bankers, all using the right buzzwords espousing the benefits of some financial transaction, buttressed by financial theories that in reality only supported what we call ‘the clandestine rule of finance’. Once in their clutches, these erstwhile competitors got talked into doing things that in finance textbooks made perfect sense, but in the real world had catastrophic effects on their business.“Yogi Berra never went to Harvard Business School, but he did understand one important principle. To quote Yogi: ‘In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is’.”Other examples of greatness: driving the Buick in which you were conceived. Still living in an apartment you share with five roommates and two dogs. Scheduling all your own appointments. Only eat what you kill. And so on.Now, reading this over it seems like I’m being a little snarky. Like I don’t believe these men are great and I’m making fun of them.Actually, I do think they are great. I wish I were like any of the chief executives mentioned above and had any of these attributes. It’s admirable and I like all of their companies and all of their stocks. Heck, I wrote the book on Mr Buffett.And Mr Brin and Mr Page have taken a unified philosophy of “technology + customer satisfaction” to create the greatest company in the world. And Mr Kinder left asset-less Enron to build the best pipeline company in the world that he’s now taking private.And Mr Jobs changed my life by allowing me to watch Desperate Housewives on the train every day. I’ve been waiting for something like that since 1978 and on $1-a-year salary he was able to finally do it.And if you want a textbook study of how to run a public company, Expeditors’ 8Ks (next to Mr Buffett’s straight-shooting annual letters and any talk given by Mr Munger) are must-reads.I wish I were as great as these chief executives. But I’m not.james@formulacapital.com"

9;EXPD;Expeditors Intl;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
