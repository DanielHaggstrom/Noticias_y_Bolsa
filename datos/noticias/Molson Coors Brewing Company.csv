0;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2019-07-31T13:40:22Z;Beer maker Molson Coors’ chief executive to retire;Blue Moon brewer blames weak demand and poor weather for disappointing sales;Molson Coors said its chief executive Mark Hunter will retire this year, as the brewer posted disappointing quarterly revenues blaming weak demand and poor weather.The company behind brands like Coors Light and Blue Moon said on Wednesday Mr Hunter, who has been at the helm since 2015, will retire in September after 30 years in the beer business to spend more time with his family.The brewer named Gavin Hattersley, who has led Molson’s US business for the last four years, as his successor.The news of his departure came alongside disappointing second-quarter results that showed net sales fell 4.4 per cent from a year ago to $2.95bn in the second quarter. That was shy of forecasts for $3.03bn, according to a Refinitiv survey of Wall Street analysts.“After a solid start in the first four months of the year, May and June were challenging reflecting unfavourable weather and weak industry demand across our major geographies, resulting in a disappointing volume performance in the quarter,” Mr Hunter said.Shares in the Denver-based company fell 8.6 per cent to $52 in early New York trade.Sales in the US, its largest market, fell 2.9 per cent from a year ago, while sales in Canada declined 6.1 per cent. “US brand volume remains in persistent decline, falling by 4.8 per cent in 2Q versus -2.2% expectations,” said Kevin Grundy, analyst at Jefferies.The results come after peer Anheuser-Busch InBev reported upbeat quarterly earnings but noted the US, its biggest market, remains a weak spot.Mass market beer makers have encountered stiff competition in the US from craft brewers and shifting consumer tastes as more people are opting for wine and liquor. To boost sales Molson Coors has lifted investments in its products and plans to introduce new drinks like its Truss cannabis infused non-alcoholic beverage portfolio in Canada later this year.Earlier this year the company warned of “material weakness” in its financial reporting after the brewer identified accounting errors stemming from a $12bn deal it struck with the UK’s SABMiller three years ago.Molson Coors said its profits slid in the second quarter as it reported net income of $329.4m or earnings of $1.52 a share, down from $424.1m or earnings of $1.96 a share in the year ago quarter. That also missed analysts’ expectations. The company noted its net income in the US slid because of lower volume, higher marketing costs as well as “unrealised mark-to-market losses in the current year compared to gains on our commodity positions in the prior year”.Molson Coors shares were up less than 2 per cent year-to-date as of Tuesday’s close.
1;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2019-02-12T18:25:48Z;Molson Coors shares fall after accounting error revealed;Brewer restates financial results and warns of weaker demand in US and Canada;Molson Coors has warned of “material weakness” in its financial reporting after the brewer identified accounting errors stemming from a $12bn deal it struck with the UK’s SABMiller three years ago.Shares were down 9.5 per cent by midday in New York after the company — whose brands include Blue Moon, Carling and Cobra — restated financial results and also reported weaker demand for beer in the US and Canada.Executives said the accounting problems originated in the group’s purchase of the 58 per cent stake it did not already own in MillerCoors, its joint venture with SABMiller. The deal paved the way for SABMiller’s takeover by Anheuser-Busch InBev.The company identified problems with previously issued financial statements that arose from the treatment of so-called deferred tax liability (DTL) — taxes owed, but not yet paid — in the joint venture.For 2016, deferred tax liability and income tax expense had been understated. This meant the net profits number the company had reported for that year was almost $400m higher than it should have been.The problem the following year was further complicated by US corporate tax cuts. For 2017, the company had understated net income by more than $150m. Taken together, the company said, it had understated the value of the DTL on its balance sheet by $248m and, as a result, overstated its total equity by the same amount.“A material weakness existed in that we did not design and maintain effective controls over the completeness and accuracy of the accounting for, and disclosure of, the income tax effects of acquired partnership interests,” the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Management and members of the board’s audit committee are evaluating the company’s “policies and procedures related to the accounting for income taxes”, the filing stated.Molson Coors disclosed the accounting problems alongside quarterly results that underlined the pressures on mass market beer makers. The industry has encountered stiff competition from craft brewers. More consumers are also opting for wine and liquor.Net sales in the last three months of 2018 fell 6.2 per cent from the same period a year ago to $2.42bn. That reflected a 7 per cent drop in US sales, an 8.8 per cent drop in Canada and a 1.9 per cent decline in Europe.Net income fell sharply to $76m from $717m in the year-ago quarter, when the results were flattered by the US tax overhaul. Adjusting for one-time items, however, the company reported earnings of 84 cents a share, up from 62 cents last time.Mark Hunter, chief executive, said cost savings had helped insulate the company from weaker demand in North America and higher than expected input inflationary pressures. Molson Coors plans to reduce expenses by $200m this year.
2;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2018-05-02T16:39:16Z;US beer buzzkill sends Molson Coors to 4-year low;;Bottoms up? Not so much, at least in the US. Molson Coors shares touched a four-year low on Wednesday after the beer giant behind brands like Coors Light, Miller Lite, Molson Canadian and Blue Moon reported slipping sales, blaming a “softer-than-anticipated” start to the year in its largest market.The earnings report put shares of Denver-based Molson Coors — which completed its takeover of rival MillerCoors in 2016 — on track for their biggest one-day drop since 2005, down 12.3 per cent to touch a four-year low of $62.01, as fears rise about whether liquor and craft beer will continue to grab market share from mainstream brews.According to its earnings report earlier on Wednesday, Molson Coors’ sales dropped 4.8 per cent in the three months to the end of March, coming in at $2.33bn. Net income was up 33 per cent to $278.1m, or $1.28 a share, thanks in part to a cash payment related to its acquisition of the Miller International business. Adjusted for special items, earnings were down 40 per cent, to $104.3m, or 48 cents a share.Analysts had been looking for revenue of $2.43bn and adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents, according to Zacks.Molson Coors chief executive Mark Hunter tried to assuage investors’ fears, noting that the first quarter is typically its least profitable and that the company did not see the current results as an omen for the remainder of 2018. He pointed to three factors weighing on its results:“The US beer industry had a softer-than-anticipated start to the year, which impacted both top- and bottom-line performance and which, when coupled with the US distributor inventory destocking and the anticipated cycling of the indirect tax provision benefit in Europe last year, led to an underlying ebitda reduction of 18.5 per cent for our company in the first quarter.”While the European tax issue is now behind it, and the company said it expects the inventory issue — which saw US sales to wholesalers drop 6.7 per cent versus last year — the third, “overall industry softness” could prove tougher to shake off.Molson Coors said that in the US, its brand volume dropped 3.8 per cent during the quarter, driven primarily by its “premium light” segment, including some of its best-known brands like Miller Lite and Coors Light.The company also cited “poor weather” this winter for soggy performance in the industry overall. At the same time, its cost of goods per hectolitre in the US rose 3.5 per cent, driven in part by higher prices for aluminium — used to make beer cans — and freight and fuel costs.The question on investors’ minds, as better beer-drinking weather returns, is whether drinkers will keep reaching past well-known American brews for either spirits or craft beers, a trendier option that caters to younger consumers’ thirst for less mainstream names.The trends are not encouraging for Molson Coors. UBS analysts, citing Nielsen data, said in a report on Tuesday US beer sales have continued to weaken during the four weeks to April 21. Sales were down 2.2 per cent from a year ago, deeper than the 1.1 per cent year-over-year drop seen over the past 12 weeks. US craft beer sales, meanwhile, fell just 0.8 per cent, reversing a 1.4 per cent advance in the past 12 weeks, while spirit growth was relatively steady at 2.8 per cent.In fact, UBS analysts showed that the US beer market’s decline is accelerating, rather than abating:Including today’s decline, Molson Coors shares are down 23.3 per cent so far this year, after dropping 15.6 per cent over 2017.Chart: UBS
3;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2018-01-20T04:00:30Z;British cider makers under threat from sweeter imports;Decade of rapid sales growth fuelled by Magners craze loses fizz;The orchards of England’s west country this week shook to the sound of annual wassail, as growers danced and caroused among their apple trees, a medieval ritual meant to ensure a bountiful harvest.This year, however, more apples is the last thing the cider industry needs.An increase in orchard acreage, combined with improvements in farm productivity, has coincided with a slowdown in UK cider sales, as drinkers switch to sweeter, imported alternatives using other fruit.Heineken, the largest cider producer, is in negotiations to buy back the contracts it has with some of its farmers, while some independent British producers are selling up.“I think Heineken got carried away thinking they could export huge quantities of cider. That’s proved to be much more difficult,” said Charles Pudge, chairman of the Herefordshire cider fruit growers association, who farms near Ledbury and is in discussions with Heineken about compensation to buy out contracts. He predicts many of the orchards planted in anticipation of future growth will have to be dug up.Strong growth in the decade to 2013 — fuelled by the repositioning of cider as a trendy “over-ice” drink led by the Irish-owned brand, Magners — has come to an end, according to market research group, Mintel. Sales by volume have declined for each of the past four years and are projected by the group to continue falling until 2021. Sales by value rose a modest 0.3 per cent in 2016 and are forecast to have risen 1.7 per cent last year, reflecting a move to more premium production.40%Proportion of global cider sales accounted for by thirsty Britons“The Magners effect has passed. What we’re all looking for is a new idea” said Julian Temperley, who runs the Somerset Cider Brandy company. “At the moment the industry’s going through a very rough patch”.The UK is the world’s thirstiest cider-drinking country with annual sales of £3.2bn in 2016, about 40 per cent of the global market.There are close to 500 companies, from Heineken, which owns the Strongbow and Bulmers brands, to a multitude of small craft-based farmhouse manufacturers.Many of the big brewers entered the market on the back of the Magners craze, with AB InBev launching Stella Cidre, Carlsberg with Somersby and Molson Coors with Carling British.Most are now retrenching. Sales of Stella Cidre for example fell 36 per cent last year, according to the 2017 Westons report on cider.Approached by the FT for a comment on its plans, Carlsberg said: “Cider is not a key focus in the current UK strategy.”The exception is the US brewer, Molson Coors, which this month announced it had bought British Aspalls in a £40m deal, ending the Chevallier Guild family’s 300-year ownership of the cider and cider vinegar brand based on the Suffolk coast.“We’re likely to see further consolidation this year,” Helen Thomas, chair of the National Association of Cider Makers, told a meeting of the all party parliamentary cider group at Westminster on Tuesday.Aston Manor Brewery, best known for its high-strength, value product, Frosty Jack, has appointed Lazards to find a buyer, after owner Doug Ellis, the former chairman of Aston Villa, put the company up for sale.With Aspalls sold, there are just a handful of independent producers left.“The big are getting bigger and bigger” said Geoff Bradman, commercial director of Westons, a family-owned company in Herefordshire’s Much Marcle, which produces the Stowford Press brand.The challenge for all producers, as Aspalls found, is that cider making is a capital-intensive business, with the presses in use for just a few weeks a year and farmers contracted under long-term, 25-year supply contracts.“We invested very heavily but it was clear that for the next stage of growth, the family had exhausted all the resources it had”, said Barry Chevallier Guild.One problem for the UK makers is the growth in demand for products using alternative fruits, including mangos and raspberries, from countries such as Sweden. These drinks — with Kopparberg the market leader — now account for about a quarter of cider sales in the UK, and four of the top five ciders sold in supermarkets. Heineken’s own Strongbow Dark Fruit is the second most popular draught cider.The annual Westons report on the cider sector says: “Fruit cider has been a growth trend for far too many years to be dismissed as a shortlived fad.”Some UK producers are still going strong. Martin Thatcher, managing director of Thatchers in Somerset, the official cider of the Glastonbury festival, has no plans to sell. “I’m the fourth generation and we’re training up the fifth”, he said.Mr Temperley accepted that cider “is losing its mystique” but claimed that it would “come back”.“After all, the good drinkers of Birmingham know it isn’t mangos we grow in our orchards. It’s still going to be apples.”
4;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Shares in Molson Coors fall on earnings miss;;Investors continued to cool on Molson Coors as the US-Canadian brewer missed earnings estimates as competition from craft breweries continued to weigh on sales volume.The world’s third largest brewer reported net sales in the second quarter had decreased 0.6 per cent to $3.09bn, dragged lower by sagging volume.Higher prices helped increase net income 4 per cent to $321.7m, or $1.49 per shares. However analysts had expected $1.58 per share, on sales of $3.1bn.Shares during pre-market trading fell 1.4 per cent to $87.99, adding to its losses for the year. Shares were down 8.3 per cent year to date by the close of trading on Tuesday.The stock has suffered since the company’s investor day in June when it said its costs would increase for the year as it invests in promoting its core brands like Coors Light, Miller Lite, Leinenkugel’s. With the rise of craft beers and breweries, the company has faced increased competition and declining volume levels.Since completing its $12bn deal to takeover its MillerCoors joint venture with SABMiller in 2016, the brand has been investing heavily to reverse declining volume levels, especially in its Blue Moon Belgian wheat which is competitive with craft beers.The addition of its Miller global brands business helped worldwide volume increase 2.3 per cent. However financial volume, a key metric for the group, decreased 0.4 per cent, weighed by lower contract brewing volume.The group aims to achieve flat volume sales by 2018.
5;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2017-06-07T22:29:20Z;Molson Coors drops most in 11 months after investor day;;Investors gave Molson Coors a chilly reception on Wednesday.Shares in the US-Canadian brewer fell as much as 8 per cent in late afternoon trading – their worst day since last July – after the company said its cost base will rise this year and issued new guidance on ebitda margin.The group, which transformed itself into the world’s third largest beer maker after it struck a $12bn deal to buy out the 58 per cent of the MillersCoors joint venture it does not own two years ago, said underlying marketing, general and administrative spending is expected to come in at about $170m this year, or $50m more than the amount spent last year.Management also said in its investor day presentation that underlying capital expenditure will total about $750m this year and will remain at an elevated level for 2018 before normalising to a long-term rate of about $650m a year.Other costs include a rise in underlying depreciation and amortisation to $790m this year, compared to the $735.8m recorded last year.As a result it sees underlying ebitda margins rising 50-60 bps per year for next three years.Molson has said in the past that 2017 will be a transition year as it completes the MillerCoors acquisition and would need to ramp up investments in order to drive long term growth.Shares in the group closed down 6.5 per cent at $89.78, taking its losses over the past 12 months to over 12 per cent.
6;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2016-12-19T18:32:45Z;Craft beer: many hoppy returns;If the market starts to saturate, pricing power for brewers will be key;The beer market in the United States has been in a ferment. Commodity markets are responding. The US Department for Agriculture reports a 44 per cent increase in the total value of this year’s hop crop compared to last year. A higher acreage planted with more specialised strains is responsible. Craft brewers prefer these, so higher volumes should reduce their costs.Shares in Boston Beer Company, the owners of the original craft beer brand Sam Adams, have declined 24 per cent over the past three years, despite the trend away from mega breweries. Shares in AB InBev or Molson Coors have not suffered as much as they added craft brands to their portfolios. AB InBev has been especially aggressive in acquiring a range of regional brands in the US. The problem for the likes of Sam Adams, a national brand, is that consumers prefer ever more local brews.Profit margins tend to be highest at the smaller businesses, such as micro breweries and brew pubs. They are exempt from the requirement to sell through America’s post-prohibition three-tier distribution system. Accordingly, the number of craft breweries almost doubled to 4,225 in the three years to 2015. That raises the spectre of oversupply as growth slows.Potentially, lower ingredient prices will help everyone, including the smallest local brands. And the trend towards high-end beers, the market share of which has increased from a quarter to a third in six years, is unlikely to stop. But if after years of growth the market starts to saturate, then pricing power over ingredients as well as products will be key.Success requires a balance between brand authenticity, marketing scale and profit margin. Small specialists and beer behemoths tap these in differing proportions. As the market matures it is likely that consolidation will continue. Do not be surprised if multinationals with acquired hipster credibility are best placed to benefit from fire sales.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
7;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2016-10-26T18:34:04Z;Brewing: Craft beer comes of age;It is a bright spot in an otherwise stagnant sector. But is the market at ‘peak craft’?;"James Watt, co-founder of BrewDog, says he would rather “shoot himself in the head” than sell out to “big beer”. The imagery is extreme but there is no doubting the passion of the craft brewer from Aberdeen, who this year inserted a clause into the company’s rules to prevent a sale to “a monolithic purveyor of bland industrial beer”.It was a defensive move to ward off the attentions of the big brewers. But holdouts like Mr Watt have become rarer after multinational beer companies — including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Molson Coors and Constellation Brands — have spent billions buying up smaller craft brewers in the US and Europe in recent years.The attraction is clear: the craft sector’s explosive 8 per cent compound growth over the past five years, according to Plato Logic, the market research group, has come largely at the expense of the big brewers’ mass production offerings like Budweiser and the Miller brands. Private equity has also sought a piece of the action with firms such as LNK Partners buying 15 per cent of Dogfish Head last year and Encore Capital acquiring Full Sail Brewing.Jean-François van Boxmeer, chief executive of Heineken, last month spelt out the potential for growth in the craft sector. “In the US, the craft market is 12 per cent of volume and more than that of profits . . .[But] you see it not only in the US and Europe,[craft is] also popping up in big cities in emerging countries like Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo or Mexico City. You see it in Shanghai, you see it everywhere.”The shift in tastes to local brews particularly in the US and Europe has led to an explosion of microbreweries over the past decade, while at the other end of the industry the large brewers have grown even bigger. The consolidation culminated this month with the completion of AB InBev’s £79bn takeover of SABMiller — the biggest beer deal ever — which highlighted the polarisation in an industry grappling with stagnant growth.In some ways, the backlash against lager-style, easy-to-drink beers represents a return to a brewing tradition dating back to the 1870s, rather than a break with the past. “Once upon a time, nearly all beer was beer with attitude — hoppy all-malt lagers, ales, wheat beers, Abbey beers, and stouts,” says Trevor Stirling, analyst at Bernstein Research. “Consumer preferences in the US and countries such as the UK, moved towards lighter styles of beer. Over time, tastes evolve and it seems inevitable that consumers would want to differentiate themselves from the mainstream.”The rapid rise of craft beer has changed the landscape of cities from Chicago to Denver, London and Dublin as microbreweries and tap rooms dominate the streets of hip neighbourhoods. Even dive bars and more conventional taverns can carry a vast range of beers.The $22bn craft sector represents 21 per cent of the value of the $106bn US beer market, according to the Brewers Association, up from just $8.8bn six years ago. As the craft sector squeezed the bigger brewers’ market share on one side, so did wine and spirits on the other. Muscling in on their smaller brewing rivals, whose beers command higher prices and greater margins, was the obvious place for big beer to shop for growth.AB InBev has been particularly acquisitive. After buying Chicago’s Goose Island in 2011 it has snapped up another 11 craft brewers in the past two years, ranging from Blue Point in New York to Elysian on the west coast in Seattle, and Camden Town Brewery in the UK. Molson Coors, which following SABMiller’s merger with AB InBev bought SAB’s stake in their MillerCoors venture, has acquired four craft breweries in the past year.Despite these deals, craft beer still accounts for just 1 per cent of AB InBev’s US volumes. But Goose Island is now the fifth-biggest contributor to the group’s overall volume growth in the US, according to Bernstein Research. Earlier this year, AB InBev chief executive Carlos Brito told investors that despite being one of the leaders in US craft beer “it is one [area] where we are under-represented”.Each time a craft brewer is bought out, there is an outpouring of grief and anger on social media from fans for whom craft is not only about taste but about the ethos of small, iconoclast microbrewery Davids against the Goliaths of the beer industry. When Jasper Cuppaidge, founder of Camden Town Brewery, announced the sale of the UK company best known for its Hells lagers, to AB InBev in December, one former fan tweeted: “What’s the going rate for a soul these days?”———–Indies go mainstream ISELECTED AB INBEV ACQUISITIONS: Goose Island Beer Co, Chicago, acquired March 2011; Blue Point Brewing Co, Long Island, New Jersey, February 2014; Elysian Brewing Company, Seattle, January 2015; Breckenridge Brewery, Colorado, December 2015; Camden Town Brewery, London, December 2015; Bosteels, Buggenhout, Belgium, September 2016———–It is an attitude BrewDog’s Mr Watt, who on Twitter calls himself a “dystopian puppet on a mission to save the world from bad beer” appreciates. He has been particularly critical of big beer’s cheque book invasion into craft brewing, accusing them of having “bastardised and commoditised beer over the past 50 years”.He refuses to stock brands brewed by companies bought out by larger corporations at the 44 bars his business owns. Under the ownership of a big multinational, the “beer might be OK for a while, maybe a year but ultimately the beer’s going to go downhill and the brewery becomes a pawn in these big mega-corporation games,” he says.Larry Bell, founder of Michigan-based Bell’s Brewery, one of the top 10 craft brewers in the US, has also resisted approaches from outside investors. He believes the takeovers — said to be worth close to $2.5bn globally — have sapped the soul of the industry as some breweries become more focused on the top line. The camaraderie among independent brewers also has been eroded, he says.Some have raised concerns over whether the quality of the beer and ingredients declines once a large company takes over.Benj Steinman, president of Beer Marketer’s Insights, a trade publication, thinks those fears are overblown. “I don’t think the big guys have screwed with the taste,” he says. “Actually, they’re trying pretty hard. They’re looking to invade the space, so looking to keep [their] craft brewers good at what they’re doing.”Some craft brewers believe they have found a halfway house where they can retain control but secure investment to boost their export operations. Having previously denounced rivals who sold their companies as “selling all of one’s best friend’s careers, their hearts, the portion of their lives they spent working for you”, Lagunitas’ founder Tony Magee last year sold half the brewer to Heineken for an unconfirmed amount, estimated by analysts at $500m.Mr Magee wanted to expand his export business and needed a partner with an extensive distribution network. He was also thinking about his brewery’s ownership when he retired, he explained in an extensive blog post. Twelve months on “nothing has changed”, says Karen Hamilton, spokesperson for Lagunitas, adding that it now exports to France, Denmark and Mexico, and will be shipping to Italy and other countries soon.“We were in overseas markets so we knew what we were up against” when it came to exporting without knowing the language or market, says Ms Hamilton. “We can do things so much faster now.”After years of strong growth, however, there are signs that the craft beer boom is maturing. Sales growth is slowing and M&A activity is cooling. Mr Bell, who intends to pass his business on to his children, says that at one point he was fielding inquiries from private equity groups twice a week but interest has died down. One analyst says that valuations are reaching a plateau.———–Indies go mainstream IIMILLERCOORS ACQUISITIONS: Hop Valley Brewing, Oregon, July 2016; Terrapin Beer Company, Athens, Georgia, August 2016.

KIRIN: Brooklyn Brewery, New York (25 per cent bought by Kirin in October 2016)———–“We’re reaching peak craft in the US,” says Spiros Malandrakis, senior alcoholic drinks analyst at Euromonitor. “High double-digit rates of growth cannot be sustained forever.”Sales of craft beer grew by 18 per cent in the US in both 2013 and 2014; this slowed to 13 per cent last year and there has been a further drop to 8 per cent this year, according to the Brewers’ Association. There has also been a slowdown in the number of breweries opening. This year, Ibisworld, the research group, expects the total figure for the US to reach 4,114, a 6 per cent increase from 2015, which saw a 26.5 per cent increase. That compares with 1,512 establishments a decade ago.There are several reasons for the slowdown in craft beer. As the base gets bigger, a slower but more sustainable level of growth is inevitable, analysts say.The Brewers Association’s definition of craft beer will also have a short-term impact on the sales data as it disqualifies any group that is more than 25 per cent owned by a larger corporation from the category. That criteria has removed a number of the recent acquisitions from the sector.Some US markets may also be reaching saturation point. While craft beer only accounts for 12.2 per cent of the US beer market in volume terms, in certain cities, such as San Francisco or in areas of the Pacific Northwest, it has won as much as half of the entire market, according to Lagunitas.Craft brewers are also competing with other alcoholic drinks, such as bourbons and whiskies, that have equally compelling stories of local production and authenticity that attract drinkers. With per capita consumption of alcohol growing at very low levels and craft beer prices often relatively high, competition to win consumers is intense.Analysts expect craft beer sales to continue growing but at a more sustainable pace. However, says Euromonitor’s Mr Malandrakis, there will be casualties: “I expect slowly to start seeing many of them falling by the wayside. And I do expect that in the next couple of years, there will be loads of bargain stills and fermentation banks available on the second-hand market.”Many analysts, though, believe that even if the US industry has reached peak craft in the US, the brewers remain attractive targets for the multinationals. Consolidation between craft brewers — something that has already begun — is also expected to pick up pace.Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers’ Association, believes tie-ups between craft producers will provide a noble exit for founders who do not want to sell out to the large brewers.“We certainly have seen craft companies banding together,” he says, “forming partnerships, either through private equity or on their own to get scale purchasing.”That consolidation, say analysts, will leave the industry facing an existential dilemma. “If it becomes too big, then it is not craft any more,” says Euromonitor’s Mr Malandrakis, “that is the paradox at the core of the craft proposition.”Defining a sector that encompasses everything from Blind Pig IPA to Human Blockhead and Kilt Lifter is a difficult challenge.The clearest definition comes from the US Brewers Association, the trade body in the world’s largest craft brew market. To meet its criteria of craft, a beer must be produced from a small brewery — producing no more than 6m barrels (or 7m hectolitres) of beer a year. The brewery must be independent — it no longer qualifies as a craft brewer if 25 per cent or more is owned by a larger corporation. Finally, the ingredients and brewing methods must be largely traditional — the BA does not regard flavoured malt drinks as beer, for example.Plato Logic, the market research company that compiles beer industry statistics, stretched that definition when it developed what it calls a “craft-style” segment, within premium beers. This includes premium ales and speciality beers, such as wheat beers, whether brewed by a microbrewery or not. According to this definition, craft accounted for 3.2 per cent of the global beer market last year — 10.6 per cent in the US and 2.1 per cent in the rest of the world.In the UK, the rise of craft has led to turmoil over what type of brewer can join which type of industry group. The Society of Independent Brewers defines craft brewers in terms of size, independence and quality. “Breweries must be truly independent of any larger brewing interest, be producing less than 200,000 hectolitres per year, and agree to abide by SIBA’s Manual of Good Brewing Practice,” says Neil Walker, SIBA spokesperson.Meanwhile, the UK’s Campaign for Real Ale, representing breweries and pubs, is having an existential crisis.

The period reflected new revenues linked to its $15bn takeover of Jarden, the household goods maker.Molson Coors jumped 4.5 per cent to $102.16 after analysts at Citi upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, citing expected cost savings after its completes the takeover of the portion of MillerCoors it does not own from SABMiller.“Given the reputation for strong cost-cutting cultures at the major brewers . . . most of our recent discussions with investors have surrounded Molson Coors’ $200m annualised cost synergy guidance and the degree of conservatism that might perhaps be embedded in that figure,” Citi analyst Wendy Nicholson said.Shares of hotel operator Wynn Resorts slid 6.4 per cent to $97.95 after the company was allocated fewer gaming tables at its new Wynn Palace in Macau than it had sought.Google owner Alphabet climbed 3.3 per cent to $791.34 as sales growth at its mobile advertising business accelerated.Excluding currency movements, the company would have reported a 25 per cent jump in revenues, up from 18 per cent a year earlier.“The report reaffirmed our view from last quarter that the first quarter underperformance was a temporary event and that the core business was healthy,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 2,173.60 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to 18,432.24. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 5,162.13.

The share was one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 index.The fall comes off the back of fourth-quarter earnings reported this morning. The company reported earnings of $1.10 per share, beating expectations of $1.09. But disappointing revenues have set the tone for full-year 2017 earnings that are yet to come. Revenues missed analysts’ forecasts of $1.82bn, coming in at $1.79bn.The restaurateur revised 2017 earnings down to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 per share, when analysts were looking for $3.99 per share.“These results reinforce our firm belief that our strategy is working as we continue to build guest loyalty by relentlessly focusing on our back-to-basics operating philosophy,” said Gene Lee, the company’s chief executive. “This focus, together with our competitive advantages, drove our strong performance for the year and increased shareholder value.”On the other end of the spectrum, Hershey’s, the American chocolatier, is the subject of a takeover bid from Mondelez International. The news resulted in trading in Hershey shares being temporarily halted after a sudden rise of over 7 per cent just after 10:30am in New York. Hershey’s was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 index, up 16.8 per cent to $113.49, helping push the consumer staples sector up 2.2 per cent.Molson Coors also saw its share price rise after the brewer, known for beers such as Amstel and Carling, issued bonds on both sides of the Atlantic in recent days.The company was the first to issue in the US after the Brexit vote last week. It secured a low coupon on its debt as yields across investment-grade bond indices and benchmark US Treasuries have been falling.The brewer’s shares rose 2.7 per cent to $101.13, responding to the bond deals, which will probably be used to fund its full takeover of MillerCoors.After strong gains on Tuesday and Wednesday, the rally in the energy and materials sectors in the S&P 500 index slowed marginally, gaining 0.9 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively, as Brent crude dipped 1.8 per cent to $49.68.Murphy Oil saw earlier gains in the week pared back, falling 0.8 per cent to $31.75. Noble Energy dropped 1.2 per cent to $35.87, while Marathon Petroleum gained 1.9 per cent to $37.96.Chesapeake, the second-largest producer of natural gas in the US, led the sector’s pullback, down 3.2 per cent to $4.28, after the company announced that its retirement plan was in partial termination following a more than 20 per cent reduction in the company’s workforce over the past two years.On the day, the S&P 500 rose 1.4 per cent to 2,098.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.3 per cent to 17,930, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 1.3 per cent to 4,842.7.

Molson’s sale of debt will help fund the company’s full takeover of brewery MillerCoors.Lower interest rates on high quality bonds in the wake of risk aversion prompted by Brexit is also attracting companies to tap the credit market.The average yield on the Barclays Aggregate US investment grade bond index has fallen in recent days from 2.11 per cent to 1.92 per cent, the first time the index has sunk below 2 per cent since January 2015. The index has an average duration of about five-and-a-half years.“There was concern around what type of impact the UK vote would create on the marketplace but today proves we continue to see strong appetite for investment grade product in spite of the volatility around Brexit,” said Dan Mead, head of the US investment grade syndicate desk at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, one of three bookrunners on the US portion of the deal.There have been four other bond deals by investment grade European companies this week, two issuing in Japanese yen, one in South Korean won and one in Norwegian krone.“I see no reason for the European corporate bond market not to be functioning again in the next few days,” said Marc Baigneres, head of debt capital markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa for JPMorgan.The European credit market has additional support from the European Central Bank’s current programme of regular corporate debt purchases.While European stock markets fell sharply in the aftermath of the referendum and have rebounded, the reaction in credit markets has been muted: the iBoxx non-financial European credit derivatives index has risen 0.3 per cent.Mr Baigneres said: “[the euro market] is likely to be fairly quiet until September, which we’d expect to be pretty busy with issuers likely to pre-empt US elections.”Mr Mead expected more deals in the days to come before the second quarter ends on Thursday and US activity ebbs ahead of the July fourth holiday weekend.“We had a decent pipeline waiting until after the Brexit vote,” he said. “Now that we have seen the success of the Molson deal, we would expect supply to pick up as early as Wednesday. Friday is an early close so any supply you will see will be in the next couple of days before the long weekend.”Investment grade issuance in the US stands at about $694bn for the year, according to data from Dealogic, compared with $745bn at this time last year and $1.3tn for the whole of 2015.

But the maker of the Amstel, Becks and Carling brands took advantage of a rebound to sell its bonds, which will pay for the company’s full takeover of brewery MillerCoors.Having lost more than $1tn over the course of Friday and Monday, the S&P 500 index rallied on Tuesday, gaining 1.8 per cent to 2,036. Oil prices also rebounded and the CBOE’s Vix index — an indicator of investor concern — fell to 18.75, below its long-term moving average of 20.Molson Coors issued four tranches of debt of different maturities: a $500m three-year tranche with a coupon of 1.45 per cent, a $1bn five-year tranche with a coupon of 2.1 per cent, a $2bn 10-year tranche with a coupon of 3 per cent and a $1.8bn 30-year tranche with a coupon of 4.2 per cent.Investors submitted orders in excess of $30bn for the four tranches, showing strong appetite, according to a person familiar with the deal.The Brexit vote has ushered in a wave of volatility but at the same time the general risk-off mood that has followed the vote has pushed rates down, which is attractive to issuers.The yield, which moves inversely to price, on the Barclays Aggregate US investment grade bond index has fallen since the UK vote, from 2.11 per cent to 1.92 per cent, the first time the index has sunk below 2 per cent since January 2015.

13;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2016-05-20T19:40:59Z;Brussels set to approve AB InBev-SABMiller deal;Regulatory clearance conditional on selling some brands within six months;Brussels is set to approve the £71bn tie up between brewer AB InBev and its London-listed rival SABMiller, according to people familiar with the matter.AB InBev had already agreed to sell off a host of household name beer brands owned by SABMiller — including Peroni and Grolsch — in order to allay concerns from the European Commission.Now, Brussels has indicated that it will give its blessing, as long as these sales are carried out within six months of the deal closing, people familiar with the process said. This will pave the way for the creation of the world’s biggest brewer, with roughly one-third of the global beer market.A final decision on whether to give the merger the go-ahead will be taken next week, ahead of the final deadline on Tuesday.Analysts had expected the merger to be passed by European regulators with relative ease after the brewers agreed to a series of disposals this year.AB InBev agreed to sell the premium European brands Grolsch and Peroni to Japanese brewer Asahi for $3bn, in a move to head off competition concerns. British craft beer maker Meantime was also included in the deal, which was reached in April.In addition, the Belgian brewer agreed to sell SABMiller assets in eastern Europe— including Pilsner Urquell — where the company has a dominant market position. Disposing of these assets is expected to bring proceeds of between $4.6bn and $7.8bn, but a buyer has yet to emerge.By creating a global beer company — which will operate on every continent bar Antarctica — the AB InBev-SABMiller deal has sparked a series of regulatory challenges that must be completed before the transaction can be finalised. Regulators in South Africa and Australia have already approved the deal.In the US, AB InBev had previously agreed to sell SABMiller’s stake in MillerCoors to its joint venture partner Molson Coors.The European Commission, AB InBev and SABMiller all declined to comment.

However Snow is pitched at the lower end of the market, where margins are slim and sales have been hit by the mainland economic slowdown and consumers’ changing tastes.“This [deal] will give CR Beer more of a presence in a part of the market that has not grown well over the last couple of years and that is not likely to do particularly well this year,” said Ben Cavender of China Market Research in Shanghai.“The acquisition of the remaining stake in Snow could help to give the company more control over brand direction but it’s unlikely that the deal is going to improve margins or profitability in the short term,” he added.Beer production in China in the first nine months of 2015, the latest period for which figures are available, fell 6 per cent year-on-year, according to local analysts.Analysts said that the market for mass production beers such as Snow is nearly saturated, making growth in the sector difficult. China’s beer consumption at 34.2 litres per capita is already ahead of the global average of 33, according to the US Department of Agriculture.Future profitability will require premiumisation, analysts say. China is more than twice the size of the world’s second largest beer market, the US, and Canaccord Genuity expects it to account for more than 30 per cent of industry volume growth in the next 10 years.A combined AB InBev and SABMiller entity would have had more than 40 per cent of the beer market in China, putting it in antitrust regulators’ sights.When InBev acquired Anheuser-Busch in 2008, in the first published ruling of the new antitrust regime, Mofcom banned InBev from taking a stake in CR Snow.

The news sent its shares down as much as 3.4 per cent in Tokyo trading.No price for the two brands has been indicated, but the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan’s largest newspaper, reported at the weekend that the assets could be valued at as much as Y400bn ($3.4bn).Other potential buyers include Dutch group Heineken, US-based Molson Coors and Ireland’s C&C Group, maker of Bulmers and Magners ciders.Analysts expect the final price tag to be expensive with many global suitors expected to bid. For Asahi, a deal — even if costly — would provide a solid platform for the company to expand in Europe, according to Makoto Morita, Daiwa Securities analyst.“The brands have an established history and a solid fan base. They would provide Asahi with a significant European foothold, which it could use to boost sales of its Super Dry [beer] brand,” Mr Morita said.Asahi and other Japanese beverage groups have been active buyers of foreign assets, under pressure to expand sales beyond a shrinking home market.Asahi’s overseas revenue increased 48 per cent between 2012 and 2014 to Y233bn through M&A. The group owns 20 per cent of China’s Tsingtao Brewery and it paid $1.3bn in 2011 for New Zealand’s Independent Liquor.It has not been all smooth sailing for Japan’s drinks groups. Asahi has accused two buyout groups of allegedly misleading it about the earnings of Independent Liquor. Its overseas business, which accounts for 13 per cent of total sales, has also recorded an operating loss for three years through 2014.Last month, Kirin warned of its first annual loss due to the deterioration of its beer business in Brazil, acquired in 2011.More broadly, Japanese players are struggling to keep up with the pace of large consolidation moves worldwide.Some M&A bankers have warned that Japanese companies could eventually become acquisition targets if they do not merge with domestic rivals or significantly expand their overseas operations.

The deal, which would be the largest transaction in the brewing industry and create a company with almost half its profits, has sparked antitrust reviews in the US, Europe, China and elsewhere.“These megamergers may have been good for shareholders but not so much for beer drinkers,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, who, like his colleagues, rattled off a list of craft brewers in his home state.“This merger would clearly break the law. Whether a remedy can be fashioned is the million, or I should say billion-dollar question.”AB InBev chief executive Carlos Brito repeatedly told lawmakers the deal would not have any impact in the US, whether it is on supply purchases, distribution or production.Instead, he said the combination with SABMiller was about markets where the companies have little or no presence, such as Africa, Latin America and Asia. “This is about the rest of the world,” Mr Brito said. “This transaction has nothing to do with the US.”The pair has already solidified deals to try to address antitrust concerns — SABMiller is to sell its 58 per cent stake in the MillerCoors joint venture to Molson Coors in a $12bn deal — while other transactions are in the works.Bob Pease, chief executive of the Brewers Association which promotes independent craft brewers, said the MillerCoors sale was not enough and his biggest concern was that the combined AB InBev-SABMiller would use its market power to influence independent distributors.He said the brewers should be made to divest their company-owned wholesalers, citing examples in which he said AB InBev has already used its market dominance to its benefit. He also said they should modify their incentives for other wholesalers that entice them to refrain from distributing other beer brands.Mr Brito noted that the beer market in the US was more competitive than ever, with 4,000-plus brewers in the 50 states.And Mark Hunter, chief executive of Molson Coors, added that his deal with SABMiller would also benefit consumers. “Our transaction does not injure competition, but unquestionably enhances it,” he said.“Molson Coors’ purchase of the remaining interest in MillerCoors from SABMiller means that ABI will get nothing in the US.”In Europe, AB InBev is planning to sell Peroni and Grolsch brands, which are owned by SABMiller. The sale is aimed at addressing concerns that an AB InBev-SABMiller tie up would have too much control over Europe’s premium beer market.The deal will also face scrutiny in China, where SAB produces Snow, the world biggest beer brand by volume, in a joint venture with China Resources Enterprise. AB InBev is working on possibly selling its stake in that joint venture to CRE, a person familiar with the situation said.

Significantly, the facilities will be put under the control of a “data trustee” in the form of T-Systems, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, the German telecoms group.Mr Nadella said Microsoft staff would have no direct access to customer information held at these facilities, so the company would not have to respond to US government demands for information.Chinese billionaire says art purchases aim for ‘spiritual’ richesRead moreThe move will put pressure on rival “cloud computing” groups, including Google, Amazon and Salesforce to come up with their own solutions to European demands for greater privacy over their data.Microsoft’s legal team has spent two years devising the legal and technical arrangements for the data centres, but also expects the system to be challenged in court.The move is part of Mr Nadella’s strategy to reorient away from selling licences to software such as the Windows operating system, instead selling subscriptions to other online services such as the Azure cloud platform.Mr Nadella told the Financial Times that the German trustee system was an effort to satisfy every possible customer. “Customers need choice,” he said. “They want to adopt cloud technology on their terms.”● Related analysis: Microsoft’s Satya Nadella rethinks the cloud

Dilma Rousseff compared the breach of dams at a mine operated by Samarco, a joint venture between BHP and Vale, to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.Earlier Andrew Mackenzie, chief executive of BHP, and Murilo Ferreira, his counterpart at Vale, had said they were “overcome” by the damage caused.“We are 100 per cent committed to do everything we can do to support Samarco and make this right,” Mr Mackenzie said.More than a week after the accident involving the two global iron ore miners, nine people have been confirmed dead while 19 people have not been accounted for. The dam failure in Mariana sent muddy waste from the mine more than 400km downstream and forced the evacuation of more than 600 people.Samarco’s operations have been stopped and its operating licence suspended. Analysts suggested the mine may not operate for years and estimated the groups could have to pay more than $1bn in remediation costs, fines and compensation.Shares in BHP, the largest miner by market capitalisation, had a torrid week and have fallen 14 per cent in London since the accident. BHP said it was talking to its insurers about the accident.Snapchat stake writedown casts pall over Silicon ValleyThe popularity of disappearing photo messages has helped propel Snapchat to a valuation of $15bn and a position as the fourth most valuable private technology start-up, writes Hannah Kuchler in San Francisco.But this week, the company saw some of that valuation potentially vanish as one of its major investors, fund manager Fidelity, wrote down the value of its stake by 25 per cent.The reasons were just as intangible as a blink-and-you-will-miss-it Snapchat message. Fidelity did not set out its thinking publicly. One reason may be that it is hard to find public companies against which the private start-up can be compared. The app is no Facebook or Twitter, and even if it was, their stock market fortunes have diverged.Snapchat’s attraction is its millions of millennials who become addicted to the platform, even reading news on its Discover service. But it has holes in areas that are also important to marketers: measuring ads’ effectiveness and targeting the right people. It has not yet landed on a killer ad format that marketers will buy in droves, instead focusing on sponsored “lenses” that enable users to add special effects to their posts on the site.The bigger message from the writedown was that Silicon Valley start-up valuations may not be all that they seem. Valuations discussed in private are nowhere near as transparent as the daily stock market ticker — but with more mutual funds investing in the slow-to-go-public companies, their estimates are about to get much more attention.● Related Inside Business column: Unicorns take investors on wild valuation rides

Anheuser-Busch InBev has secured a record $75bn loan package to fund its $108bn acquisition of SABMiller, choosing unexpectedly to arrange the deal itself in a bid to save millions of dollars in fees, according to people familiar with the matter.The offering, which is divided into five tranches — including two bridge financing pieces that are likely to be exchanged for a bond facility — surprised portfolio managers who had expected a mammoth bond offering in the coming months.The financing was supported by AB InBev’s core relationship banks, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Banco Santander, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, Barclays, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank, according to Allen & Overy, a law firm that advised the lenders.However the transaction did not include a joint global co-ordinator, according to a person familiar with the deal.That is likely to reduce the fees that the mega-brewer, backed by Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lehmann — known for his keen eye on expenses —, has to pay out to banks. More than 20 banks nonetheless came to the table for a slice of the deal, with bank demand still waiting in the wings despite the size.“The size and demand for this deal speaks to the type of credit and the profile and confidence people have in AB InBev,” according to a person familiar with the deal.“Any company is looking for flexibility and diversification and given the amount of demand — and there was excess demand for this transaction, more bank demand than you typically see — the company was able to diversify its funding sources.”The deal includes a $25bn three-year term loan with the option for a one-year extension, a $10bn five-year term loan, and a $10bn one year bridge loan that is expected to be paid off and cancelled by the sale of SABMiller’s stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors for $12bn.The remaining financing needs are covered by a two-year $15bn bridge loan and a $15bn one-year bridge loan with a one-year extension option. The company plans to pay down part of the two bridges with any excess proceeds from its sale of MillerCoors and then tap debt markets to convert the remaining portion into bonds.The weighted average cost across the five-part deal is 110 basis points above Libor, the group added.Investors and bankers said they expected the bond sales, which are not expected until next year due to necessary regulatory clearance, to be spread across several maturities and multiple currencies. Felipe Dutra, chief financial officer of AB InBev, said in October that the group would “as soon as practically possible . . . execute the bonds takeouts and get that behind us”.Belgian-listed brewer secures $108bn acquisition with $12bn spin-off deal with Molson CoorsRead moreExecutives have sought to assuage fears about the group’s debt burden if the transaction is cleared, writing in an investor presentation that its long-term goal remained net debt of two-times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. Analysts with Standard & Poor’s projected in September that leverage could exceed four times in the first year of the combination.Analysts with Wells Fargo said they expected the $24bn in annual earnings generated by a combined AB InBev-SABMiller to allow the company to reduce debts at a pace of $5bn a year.Nicholas Clark, a partner with Allen & Overy who advised lenders in the AB InBev transaction, said the offering underlined the demand for quality issuance.“This deal shows that for companies that are strong credits, banks are still willing to stand behind them to raise these eye-watering debt packages to support strategic M&A,” he added.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

He has a lot to celebrate having secured a deal to buy for $12bn the 58 per cent of the MillerCoors joint venture it does not own.The acquisition, which is contingent on Anheuser-Busch InBev completing its takeover of SABMiller, is a “game changer” for Molson Coors, as Mr Hunter says himself, giving his company scale and full control of MillerCoors’ number-two slot in the US market, commanding a 27 per cent share.Owning the whole of MillerCoors will add roughly $4.74bn to Molson Coors’ net sales of $7.85bn in 2014. The brewer estimates that the deal will be accretive to earnings per share in the first full year of operations and produce $200m in annual cost-savings by the fourth year of its full ownership — less than some analysts had expected.Ever since it emerged that AB InBev was going to make an offer for SAB, investors had been widely expecting SAB to relinquish its ownership in the MillerCoors venture to meet any demands from US competition regulators. It was also assumed that Molson would be the buyer given the JV agreement gave Molson first and final bid in any sale. In light of these expectations, Molson’s share price had gained more than a quarter since AB InBev made its first approach for SABMiller in September.“There were clearly significant rights surrounding the joint venture and they could have played out over time, but it was about seizing the opportunity and moving with pace [to secure the deal],” Mr Hunter says.The purchase, which analysts had been expecting to cost between $10bn and $13.5bn, will give Molson scale, buying power and a more efficient manufacturing and supply chain thanks to common back-end services. This is important in a market where the share of mainstream beer brands such as Miller Lite and AB InBev’s Budweiser is being eaten into by demand for craft brews. It is an area where Molson is building up its portfolio.AB InBev deserves, and will need, the benefit of the doubtRead more“I don’t think [the deal] changes the outlook on the market; it gives us chance to be a more efficient competitor,” Mr Hunter says, adding that he will be “strengthening our portfolio through crafts”, red beers, which include Rickards, and investing more in its brands.The acquisition also gives Molson full access to MillerCoors’ international portfolio, though sales are much smaller than the US. Adam Fleck of Morningstar points out that Molson will once again be able to sell Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite in Canada, after SAB took distribution in-house this year.Mr Fleck says it could also give Molson Coors greater opportunities in Latin America, where it sold nearly 2m hectolitres of Miller Genuine Draft and Lite last year at premium prices, adding that the market for premium beers in the region is expanding."

Some 1,700 of the UK-listed brewer’s senior managers will received vested shares and options worth up to $2.1bn. Chief executive Alan Clark is in line for more than $65m.Dealogic estimates the bankers will share $200m in advisory fees alone.The deal announcement came after AB InBev, which makes Budweiser, secured a $12bn spin-off sale and secured $75bn in bridge financing.Molson Coors, the US-Canadian brewer, will buy out SABMiller’s stake in their US joint venture MillerCoors , in a deal that is critical to winning US regulatory approval for the larger combination.Starting today we shift gears and are working towards closingCarlos Brito, AB InBev chief executive, told the Financial Times that it was “a great day for us but we’re only done when the closing is signed”. The deal teams have been talking for months; “starting today we shift gears and are working towards closing”, he said.Dubbed “megabrew” by the drinks industry, the SAB takeover will give AB InBev a significant foothold in Africa, where it barely has a presence, and in parts of Latin America where it previously was not competitive.The consolidation among big brewers comes as they face a rising challenge from fast-growing small, craft brewers that are swallowing up sales.Cees ‘t Hart, chief executive of rival Carlsberg, which will be in fourth place by sales behind Heineken and Molson Coors after the deals, said the AB InBev SAB combination would create: “a powerful global player”.“It’s always better to have a more fragmented market than a heavily-consolidated one but, on the other hand, it’s more important to be the number one or two player in local markets” than to be ranked high globally, he added.AB InBev said the deal was unlikely to complete until the second half of next year given the complexity of the combination, which will involve negotiating with antitrust regulators in different parts of the world.AB InBev already controls 46 per cent of the US beer market, which made disposal of SAB’s US business essential to winning antitrust approval there.Mr Brito mentioned China and South Africa as countries in which the brewer would work closely with SAB to address antitrust concerns. In China, SAB produces Snow, the world’s biggest beer brand by volume, in a joint venture with China Resources Enterprise.AB InBev expects to extract $1.4bn annually in synergies from the combination after four years — equating to 9 per cent of SAB’s sales — mostly from integrating corporate and regional headquarters, and from savings in procurement, brewery operations and distribution.This is less than in previous deals masterminded by Jorge Paulo Lemann, the Brazilian billionaire and serial dealmaker behind AB InBev’s acquisition-led growth.James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets said: “We think SABMiller is already an efficient business and ABI is unlikely to achieve synergies similar to Modelo (21 per cent of sales) or Anheuser-Busch (18 per ent). That said, at 9 per cent we think the company could be lowballing the total number.”AB InBev deserves, and will need, the benefit of the doubtFull storyHowever, the $1.4bn would come on top of the $1.05bn in annual savings that Alan Clark, SAB chief executive, promised his own investors last month while jousting with AB InBev for a higher price.Lazard, the independent investment bank, will probably receive the largest fee on the AB InBev-SABMiller deal as it was the lead adviser to the Belgian-Brazilian brewer. Robey Warshaw will probably receive the largest fee on the SABMiller side as the tiny advisory boutique was the lead adviser to the UK-listed brewer. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will also share a cut of the fees, for their roles working with SABMiller.Seven years ago, Goldman and Citigroup shared $72m in fees for their role advising Anheuser-Busch on its $61bn sale (including debt) to InBev. Fees received by Lazard which advised InBev on that deal were not disclosed.The terms of the recommended offer remained unchanged from last month, when a tentative deal was announced: most SAB investors will pocket £44 in cash for each of their existing shares.There is also a partial share alternative aimed at SAB’s two largest shareholders, Altria, the US tobacco company and BevCo, the private investment vehicle of Colombia’s Santo Domingo family. It comprises £3.7788 in cash and 0.483969 in shares, which will not be listed and are subject to a five-year lock-up.The City has christened the brainchild of AB InBev boss Carlos Brito “Megabrew”. Jonathan Guthrie offers some alternatives.Full storyAB InBev has lined up $75bn in term loans and bridge loans to be refinanced in the capital markets. Immediately following the deal, the group’s net debt will be about four times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation but that is expected to quickly fall to about two times as cash flow pays down debt.SAB will lose its listing on the London Stock Exchange, where it is one of the 100 biggest companies. It will be merged with AB InBev into a new Brussels-listed company, where AB InBev already has its headquarters.There will be secondary listings on the stock exchanges of Johannesburg, Mexico and New York.Mr Clark said: “SABMiller grew from small beginnings, brewing quality cold beer for thirsty miners in the dusty streets of 19th-century Johannesburg. Listing on the London Stock Exchange in 1999 was the launch pad for our global ambitions . . . I am sure the next chapter will bring new opportunities for exceptional success.”"

One person familiar with the negotiations said SAB would sell its 58 per cent stake for about $12bn (£7.9bn).The joint venture sale could also help smooth the way with other regulators, notably in China, where the combination is also likely to run into antitrust scrutiny.AB InBev is also expected to announce that it will extract just under $1.5bn in synergies from combining UK and South African-listed SAB with its own operations — equivalent to 7 per cent of SAB’s net sales, including associates and excluding MillerCoors, two people familiar with the talks said.This is lower than that achieved in previous deals spearheaded by the three Brazilian dealmakers, led by Jorge Paulo Lemann, who have masterminded AB InBev’s growth.SAB’s board has already agreed in principle to the offer, which includes a £44-per-share cash component as well as a share option aimed at SAB’s two largest investors.Brewer’s approach for SABMiller driven by need for global reach and fits modus operandiRead moreAnalysts have said SAB is a more efficiently run business than AB InBev’s other recent deals, making it harder to extract savings.InBev achieved synergies amounting to 18 per cent of Anheuser-Busch’s sales when it bought the Budweiser brewer in 2008 and 21 per cent from Modelo, the Mexican brewer of Corona.Molson Coors owns 42 per cent of the MillerCoors joint venture and has always been seen as the natural buyer for SABMiller’s larger stake. The sale agreement will be conditional on AB InBev’s managing to complete its acquisition of SAB.AB InBev’s formal offer to pay £44 in cash for each SAB share — and a partial share offer for 41 per cent of the London-listed brewer’s shares — is expected to come in just hours ahead of a deadline set for 5pm Wednesday by the UK’s Takeover Panel.The deadline was twice extended as AB InBev raced to complete the terms of its deal.Molson Coors declined to comment.

No agreement had been finalised as of Tuesday afternoon, some of the people cautioned.A planned disposal to Molson Coors is further indication that AB InBev and SAB are closer to cementing the terms of their combination, ahead of a Wednesday deadline for AB InBev to make a formal offer for SAB.Advisers to both companies were racing on Tuesday to meet the 5pm deadline, but a further week-long extension might be necessary, according to some people close to the talks.If a further extension is necessary, an agreement for the conditional disposal could be announced on Thursday when Molson Coors issues a trading update.The two sides last week requested more time from the UK body which oversees public takeovers. AB InBev is offering £44 a share in cash to SAB shareholders, as well as a partial stock alternative intended for the UK brewer’s two largest investors.The talks with Molson Coors indicate that AB InBev is already mapping out plans to win over competition regulators. A takeover of SAB would give it control of roughly 30 per cent of the global beer market.AB InBev recently hired bankers at Lazard and Barclays to explore the sale of certain US assets, including SAB’s stake in the MillerCoors venture to help get the deal past US antitrust regulators.AB InBev’s brands control 46 per cent of the US beer market, while the MillerCoors joint venture accounts for 27 per cent.Given that Molson Coors already owns 42 per cent of the venture and has the first and final bid on any sale of SAB’s stake, it has been seen from the outset as the frontrunner.Molson Coors’ rights over the venture could give it the upper hand in price negotiations, analysts have said, though this is unlikely to be seen as too much of a problem for AB InBev, which probably wants any disposals to be speedy.Molson Coors’ shares have jumped 28 per cent since AB InBev first made a public approach for SAB, underscoring investors’ expectations that SAB would have to relinquish its ownership of MillerCoors.Analysts have said that owning MillerCoors outright could enable Molson to save between $300m and $500m in annual costs, given that it could reduce overlap in administrative areas and gain from its scale in procurement and distribution.In spite of their dominance of the US beer market, both MillerCoors and AB InBev still face a growing threat from craft brews, which en masse have been making steady inroads with an increasing share of about 11 per cent.AB InBev and SAB could not be reached for comment and Molson Coors declined to comment.Litany of regulatory and cultural hurdles must be cleared before the world’s two largest brewers can seal the proposed mergerDeal presents a valuable opportunity for US-Canadian Molson Coors whose stock has risen on such hopesAB InBev-SABMiller merger will face scrutiny from antitrust regulators in America and needs support of big shareholder

The extension highlights the complex nature of the deal and the amount of work and people involved, including 21 banks working on AB InBev’s financing.The sale of the US assets is considered fundamental to getting the merger past antitrust regulators in the US, according to analysts.Molson Coors, the US-Canadian brewer, is the favourite among analysts and investors to buy the stake it does not already own in the brewing venture. The joint venture agreement with SAB gives it first and final bid on any sale, allowing it the opportunity to secure a good price. The likelihood that AB InBev will want to move quickly to seal its takeover of SAB makes Molson Coors the obvious choice, analysts said.They added that the opportunity for Molson Coors to buy out the 58 per cent it does not own of the joint venture is one that it will not want to miss. It would be able to pull out cost savings estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The joint venture has a 27 per cent market share in the US.Under the joint venture agreement, in the event of a takeover of SAB, Molson Coors has the right to raise its stake from 42 per cent to 50 per cent and install a chief executive of its choosing. From then it can start negotiations on acquiring the rest of the company.Some analysts are not completely ruling out other possibilities, such as Heineken potentially showing some interest, perhaps in a partnership with Molson Coors. The two already have distribution agreements in Canada and Ireland. However, all eyes are on Molson Coors.AB InBev could not be reached for comment.Molson Coors reiterated that it was watching developments “with interest” but declined further comment.

But for one far smaller rival the deal may present a valuable opportunity.Since 2008, the US-Canadian group Molson Coors has been the minority partner in MillerCoors, a joint venture with SABMiller that sells brands including Miller Lite, Coors Light and Blue Moon Belgian White.A successful offer from AB InBev for SABMiller would raise sufficient competition issues in the US to force a sale of SABMiller’s 58 per cent stake in the venture, most analysts argue.Buying that stake and taking full control of MillerCoors would be “a game changer” for Molson Coors, said Robert Ottenstein, head of Evercore ISI’s global beverages research team.Molson Coors appears best placed to pull off such a deal not only because of its existing role in the joint venture. The terms of its agreement with SABMiller give it the right of first and last refusal over its partner’s stake, which analysts say AB InBev would sell quickly to avoid delaying the larger deal.“It is hard to imagine anyone else stepping into this. It just doesn’t make sense,” Mr Ottenstein told investors. “[AB InBev] is going to want certainty and [Molson Coors] has been looking at this obviously for years. They’ll be chomping at the bit.”AB InBev has yet to make a firm offer for SABMiller, leaving valuations of MillerCoors up in the air. Mr Ottenstein estimates the 58 per cent stake could fetch about $9.65bn, equivalent to 10 times the joint venture’s 2014 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.● 1970 Philip Morris buys Miller Brewing

●2008 SAB and Molson Coors create MillerCoors joint ventureAdam Fleck, a beverages analyst at Morningstar, reckons that Molson Coors could pay as much as $13.5bn, or 13.5 times his estimated 2017 ebitda. This multiple would be below those used in other recent beer deals, reflecting the US-Canadian group’s advantageous position in any negotiation, he says.Molson Coors, whose shares have risen more than 20 per cent in the week since AB InBev’s interest in SABMiller became known, declined to comment.The giant deal under discussion highlights a backdrop of shifting consumer tastes as smaller craft beer brands steadily erode larger rivals’ market shares and younger drinkers favour wine and spirits.The added pressures of slowing consumer demand in emerging markets have contributed to an environment that requires cost cuts and increased efficiencies.Owning MillerCoors outright could allow Molson Coors to save $300m-$500m in annual costs, analysts estimate. It could reduce overlap in administrative areas such as human resources, finance and management, while also exploiting the advantages of scale over distribution and procurement.Molson Coors would need to go through a two-stage process to take full control of the venture. First a takeover of SABMiller by AB InBev would trigger Molson Coors’ right to increase its 42 per cent stake in MillerCoors to 50 per cent and appoint the venture’s chief executive. It could then enter talks to take control of the remaining half of the venture, giving it the first and final bid for the company.While there may be a strong strategic case for Molson Coors to take full control, financing considerations are likely to hang over the decision. Fitch, the rating agency, cautioned that a buyout could result in a one-notch downgrade of its BBB credit rating to “low investment grade” assuming a deal cost of about $9bn and depending on the amount of debt used.But Fitch also sees the advantages of a deal, calling it a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” for the company, citing Molson Coors’ minnow-like scale against an enlarged AB InBev.Evercore’s Mr Ottenstein says Molson Coors already had financing lined up and that there are indications that it would be willing to give up its investment grade status to get a deal done.MillerCoors accounts for about half of Molson’s global volume, but if it could consolidate the whole company on its accounts it would represent about 70 per cent, Morningstar’s Mr Fleck estimated.Mega brewers, long dominating the beer market, no longer resonate with a public that is acquiring more adventurous appetitesRead moreThe prospect of a mammoth deal between AB InBev and SABMiller has prompted speculation about further deals in the sector, but the family ownership structure of some of the biggest brewers has thwarted past attempts at consolidation.Further dealmaking “is a possibility but there doesn’t seem to be appetite at the moment”, Morningstar’s Mr Fleck says.Molson Coors is jointly chaired by Geoff Molson and Pete Coors with the two families owning 16 per cent of the company. If they can agree a deal for MillerCoors, it may be one of the few takeovers to follow AB InBev’s ambitious move."

The stock surged 14 per cent to hit a record high of $82.98 after South African brewing giant SABMiller said it had been approached by rival Anheuser-Busch InBev over a potential $245bn tie-up.AB InBev and SABMiller are the two biggest beer makers in the world. A potential tie-up between the two is expected to put pressure on their smaller competitors to consolidate in order to compete.Speculation that SABMiller could also be looking to adopt a “poison pill” defence against AB InBev by making a play for a smaller rival fuelled the run for beer stocks. American depositary receipts for Danish brewer Carlsberg gained 6.1 per cent to $15.65 while those for Heineken, which itself rejected an approach from SABMiller only last year, rose 2.9 per cent to $40.59.Eamonn Ferry at Exane BNP Paribas says SABMiller’s “best option” to make an acquisition of its own, would be to go after France’s Castel group. But he added: “The only question is: can SAB get its hands on it?”Elsewhere, FedEx suffered another leg down after the US package shipping company unexpectedly cut its full-year profit forecast. Citing among other factors, weaker-than-expected freight demand and higher operating costs, the company said it now expects adjusted earnings for fiscal 2016 to be between $10.40 and $10.90, compared with its previous forecast of $10.60 to $11.10.The profit warning will further add to investor concerns about the health of the global economy.

27;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2014-09-15T16:43:44Z;US beer brewers boosted by bid activity;Shares rise after Heineken rejects takeover offer from SABMiller;Beer brewers were buoyed on Monday by prospects of industry-wide consolidation following Heineken’s rejection of a takeover offer from SABMiller.The announcement renewed speculation that two of the sector’s largest ale makers, Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller, could seek to expand their portfolios following a spate of activity from companies in the consumer discretionary arena, including a possible deal between the two.Analysts with Stifel Nicolaus noted Molson Coors was the most likely candidate to buy out SABMiller’s stake in the pair’s US joint venture, MillerCoors, if a deal between SABMiller and AB InBev sparked regulatory scrutiny.“We continue to think Anheuser-Busch InBev would undertake exceptionally high deal complexity – scale, multicurrency financing, potentially divergent shareholder interests, strategic partnership risk/changes, antitrust reviews – if it bids for SABMiller,” Stifel analyst Mark Swartzberg said.“However, we also think ABI management is skilled in all of these areas and that SABMiller’s strategic appeal is high,” he added.Analysts with Morningstar noted SABMiller would likely improve its offer for Heineken, despite the latter’s cool reception.“An acceptable offer would likely have to include a significant premium to the current market valuation, and a strong presence on the executive board for members of the Heineken family,” Philip Gorham of Morningstar said.Shares of Molson Coors advanced 6 per cent to $76, AB InBev rose 3 per cent to $114.45 and SABMiller shares trading in New York climbed 9 per cent to $60.43.RadioShack named Holly Etlin, a director at restructuring advisory firm AlixPartners, as its interim chief financial officer on Monday following the resignation on Friday of John Feray.Mr Feray quit for personal reasons, the US electronics retailer said. His exit comes shortly after the company said it was examining options to secure fresh capital but, should its cash position weaken, it might need to file for bankruptcy protection.The announcement sent shares 16 per cent higher to $1.06.Apple shares were lifted after the company said it had received more than 4m pre-orders for its new pair of iPhones – the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus.The iPhone remains Apple’s flagship product and its most profitable even as the company pushes ahead with the Apple Watch, which it debuted last week alongside the newest iterations of the iPhone.Shares rose as much as 1 per cent before pairing back gains to $101.60 as the broader technology sector fell.Cree, the maker of LED lights, was under pressure after brokerage Goldman Sachs cut its rating to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ on the view the company would face headwinds, including increased competition, in its chip business.“While we remain positive on the prospects for continued LED lighting adoption, we see solid execution in this segment by Cree as well appreciated by the market and see stock returns in the near to midterm driven by the chip business where Cree faces multiple growth [and] market share headwinds,” analyst Brian Lee said.Shares declined 4 per cent to $41.10, taking its losses over the past 12 months to 31 per cent.Overall, US equity markets struggled for direction following weaker than expected figures on Chinese industrial production.The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 1,984.13, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 17,031.14.

Sales rose 1 per cent to $1.19bn.In a note to investors, analysts at Goldman Sachs said profitability was driven by better than expected results in Canada and for the MillerCoors segment, the company’s US joint venture with rival SABMiller, which saw profits grow 10 per cent.Peter Swinburn, Molson chief executive, said the company “continued to build a bigger and stronger brand portfolio that is delivering value-added innovation; continued investment in our core brands; and increased our share in above premium”.In June, Mr Swinburn said he would not rule out buying rival SABMiller’s 58 per cent stake in MillerCoors. Mr Swinburn announced last month that he would retire at the end of the year.Elsewhere in the consumer sector Mondelez shares fell despite adjusted earnings per share climbing by almost a fifth in the second quarter, as its revenues softened, indicating that the cost-cutting urged by activist investor Nelson Peltz is bearing fruit.The sprawling food conglomerate reported adjusted net earnings of $691m for the quarter, or 40 cents per share, up 19.4 per cent in constant currencies and narrowly ahead of the 39 cent consensus estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg.Leaving aside any adjustments for currency movements, hedging costs or valuation changes, Mondelez’ net earnings rose 3.5 per cent to $622m in the second quarter, for a diluted earnings per share of 36 cents.However, net revenues slipped 1.8 per cent to $8.4bn in the quarter, but its “organic” revenue figure was up 1.2 per cent thanks to better pricing. That led Mondelez to lift its quarterly dividend by 7 per cent.Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and chief executive, said the company remained on track to achieve its margin and earnings targets this year despite “challenges”.Mondelez has long been under pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz to cut its corporate fat and focus on higher-growth products like Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate. Mr Peltz joined Mondelez’ board earlier this year.Shares in the snack foods company fell 1 per cent to $35.65*.Ralph Lauren, one of the few US retailers that has succeeded in both the mass market and luxury goods sectors, fell slightly after flagging up “challenging conditions”.The New York-listed retailer said it expected full-year sales to climb between 6 and 8 per cent this year from a year earlier, or between $7.90bn-$8.05bn, as sales in its own stores advanced. The forecast was in line with Wall Street’s view for sales of nearly $8bn.The guidance accompanied fiscal first-quarter profits that topped expectations. The company said it earned $162m, or $1.80 per share, on sales of $1.7bn.Jacki Nemerov, chief operating officer, said Ralph Lauren continued to invest in new technologies and stores despite “challenging market conditions”.Ralph Lauren shares rose 0.2 per cent to $156.88.Shares in volatile Groupon tumbled 13 per cent to $6.17 after the online discount provider slashed its full-year profit outlook in its results release after the market closed on Tuesday, citing the need to spend abundantly on marketing. Groupon said it expected adjusted earnings before interest depreciation and amortisation of more than $270m in 2014. In May, it had raised its forecast to more than $300m.The collapse of bid proposals dragged down the shares of takeover targets Time Warner and T-Mobile US, while Walgreens shares also tumbled 14 per cent after the group abandoned plans to relocate to cut its tax bill. The falls weighed on US equity markets overall.The S&P 500 rose less than half a point to 1,920.24; the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 14 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 16,443.34; and the Nasdaq Composite was about 2 points higher, less than 0.1 per cent, at 4,355.05.* This has been amended from the original article which stated the Mondelez price as $55.10, which was in fact the price of Kraft, the predecessor company from which it was split."

Its shares were 8.8 per cent higher at $21.01.The beverages sector was boosted by positive results from Molson Coors after the brewing company reported better than expected earnings, driven by improved performance across all its businesses.Its first-quarter results suggested a strategy of focusing on premium beers had paid off for the group.Profits – helped by the early ending of a Canadian joint venture – surged more than fivefold. The company’s shares climbed 3.65 per cent to $61.95.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Mondelez International shares jumped 8.2 per cent to $38.10 after it posted first-quarter earnings and said it had reached a deal with Dutch coffee and tea company D.E Master Blenders to combine their coffee businesses.By contrast, Whole Foods shares tumbled in their steepest fall for more than five years after the largest US natural grocer warned of increasing competition from popular store chains. Shares in the retailer were down 18.81 per cent to $38.93.Allergan, the US pharmaceutical company behind an anti-wrinkle treatment designed to fend off the effects of ageing, came under further pressure to accept a takeover proposal.The US maker of Botox, which last month received a bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, repeated again on Wednesday that it would “review and consider” the approach.David Pyott, Allergan chief executive, is under pressure from the company’s largest shareholder, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, to accept Valeant’s bid.Allergan has been reported to be examining whether there are other potential buyers for the company.Its latest injunction to investors came alongside its first-quarter earnings, which showed a jump in revenues from $1.45bn to $1.65bn.Profits, excluding certain items, for the quarter came in at $1.18 a share, better than the $1.13 analysts forecast.Nonetheless, shares in the group fell 0.27 per cent to $165.87.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.32 per cent to 4,067.67; the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.72 per cent to 16,518.54; and the S&P 500 added 0.56 per cent to 1,878.21."
30;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2014-03-27T16:34:54Z;Cornwall seeks an answer to its residential property conundrum;In the past 30 years, the village of Rock has developed a thriving community because of, rather than in spite of, its popularity with visitors;"Jamie Mercer runs the Fourways Inn, as his father did before him. His family has lived in the same village for more than 100 years, but now he is worried about the future and whether the pub will last long enough for his son to take it on. “When I was a kid I would walk to school and all the houses were occupied. Now they are all empty. There are so few locals left.”This is St Minver, the parish that hit the headlines for having the highest proportion of second homes in Cornwall, a county in the most southwestern tip of the UK. Nationally 6 per cent of properties are second homes; here the number stands at 42.9 per cent.It is this kind of figure that will resonate in many picturesque rural communities that have seen house prices rocket out of reach of the people whose ancestors once filled the pews in the village churches.In the past 20 years the village of Rock, within the parish, has become synonymous with the image of wealthy holidaymakers from the southeast squeezing out locals and, in the winter months, leaving villages empty.But while it might be easy to portray the situation as locals ready to take up the pitchforks against the wealthy carpetbaggers in a bid to preserve the culture and heritage of the place, the incomers are largely welcomed. In the past 30 years, Rock has developed a thriving community because of, rather than in spite of, its popularity with visitors. This extends from the leisure activities based around the golf and sailing clubs to supporting a thriving set of shops and two art galleries.In 1994, local businessmen Bill Sharp set up a brewery in the village that became a national success story; it now has 115 employees and increases production year on year. In 2011, the company was bought for £20m by Molson Coors, the Canadian brewer. The restaurant of two-Michelin-star chef Nathan Outlaw brings further prestige to the village.Rather than Cornish cultural heritage dying out, in some respects it is being revived. Rock Rowing Club is preparing for the World Pilot Gig Championships in May. Once the means by which men would row out to guide tall ships into the estuary, the practice had all but disappeared, but now the club is thriving.“This place needs the tourists and second-home owners,” says Alex Roades, a cheerful estate agent whose Rock office has half a dozen homes for sale at more than £1m each.“Before tourism, Rock was nothing: a load of sand dunes, no industry. The village has more of a community now than ever because of the nature of the market. There are more residential homes here and a growing population as a result of the large number of second homes and holiday lets.“Holiday homes may look like regular homes and you could live in them, but essentially they are commercial buildings.” Visit Cornwall, the tourist board, calculates overall spending, including rates and maintenance, on second homes in North Cornwall is more than £8.5m a year – double that of any other Cornish district.An entire industry has sprung up around second homes. “We have gardeners coming out of our ears,” jokes Carol Mould, parish council chairman, who has lived in Rock all her life. “Letting agents, cleaners and contractors are all in demand.”But it is this legion of workers, just over 10,000 strong in North Cornwall, who are being priced out of the area. Local builder Brian Hawkey says more than 80 per cent of his trade comes from second-home owners, which in turn allows him to employ 13 skilled craftsmen – yet he says they can’t afford to buy a home for their families.Earnings here fall far short of the £300,000 needed to buy a family home, yet the county council scheme to provide homes prioritises those in acute need from across the county as a whole, with a waiting list of up to six years.“Those in need of housing most in the parish don’t qualify for social housing,” Mould says. “So where social housing has been built, it is people from outside the immediate area who are moving in.”This is the conundrum facing planners: how to allow for continued investment and meet the needs of a workforce caught between being outpriced by the market yet earning too much to qualify for social housing.Cornwall county councillor Andrew Wallis has been lobbying government to change planning regulations to force people to apply for permission to change houses from a primary to a secondary residence, to limit the number of second homes, but critics warn it would further skew the housing market and raise prices even higher.Mould wants to see more power over neighbourhood planning devolved to a local level and points to the Localism Act, which cedes more control for planning decisions to local people.“It is about balance. Our whole economy is dependent on tourism; we need to provide for that,” she says, “Rock has always been a unique place and it needs a unique solution.”"

Markets in China and Hong Kong were closed for holidays.Sentiment was subdued after the minutes of the Fed’s meeting on March 13 suggested that further quantitative easing, so-called QE3, was unlikely as Fed policy makers agreed that the world’s largest economy was moderately improving.“The Fed statement is consistent with our view that the economic environment would have to deteriorate to justify further asset purchases,” said analysts at Barclays Capital. “We expect market focus to stay on global growth as this holds the key to dissipating solvency concerns in developed markets.”One of Tokyo’s biggest fallers was Fast Retailing, Asia’s largest apparel retailer, after disappointing March same-store sales. The company, which operates the casual clothing chain Uniqlo, fell 5.7 per cent to Y17,800 after missing market forecasts with a 5.1 per cent year-on-year increase in sales last month.Honda Motor led the country’s carmakers lower after reporting its US sales fell 5 per cent in March. Analysts were expecting a 5 per cent gain. Shares in Honda were down 3.1 per cent to Y3,100.As hopes for further monetary stimulus in the US faded, exporters were hit. The rest of the auto sector fell, leaving Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru cars, down 2.5 per cent at Y653, while Isuzu Motors lost 2.5 per cent to Y474. Toyota Motor, Asia’s biggest carmaker by sales, fell 2 per cent to Y3,485.Tokyo’s biggest climber was Asahi Group Holdings, which gained 2 per cent to Y1,832 after Molson Coors of the US outbid the Japanese brewer for eastern European beverage group StarBev in a $3.5bn deal.South Korean automakers had initially supported Seoul’s Kospi index after reporting robust US sales in March. As the index began to sink, however, so too did Hyundai Motor, which fell 0.6 per cent to Won253,500. Hyundai’s affiliate Kia Motors fared better, ending flat at Won78,300.Hyundai Engineering & Construction, the civil engineering company, shed 2.8 per cent to Won79,600 on concerns that Iraq may impose a fine or blacklist the company because of delays in implementing a contract.The Kospi Composite ended 1.5 per cent lower at 2,018.61In Sydney, gains for health and leisure groups helped offset losses in the mining sector. Senex Energy climbed 4.5 per cent to A$1.05, after the company increased the proved and probable reserves at the Growler oilfield.The S&P/ASX 200 index ended 0.1 per cent lower at 4,333.86.

33;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2012-04-03T20:44:11Z;Molson Coors to buy StarBev for €2.65bn;;"Molson Coors, the US-Canadian brewer whose brands include Coors Light and Carling, is to buy StarBev, the eastern European beer maker, for €2.65bn.The acquisition, from private equity group CVC, will help the beermaker expand as it seeks to extend sales beyond its core territories of the US, Canada and the UK. Starbev’s core markets are in central and Eastern Europe.“This is very much about growth,” Peter Swinburn, chief executive of Molson Coors, said. “Our [markets] are flat and declining; these ones are growing.”He added that the deal was about buying growth and profitability: Starbev makes profit margins of 30 per cent at the level of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, double the level that Molson Coors achieves.The brewer is planning to use StarBev, whose flagship beer is the Czech brand Staropramen, as a platform for growth and to sell its existing brands such as Carling. It is attracted to the potential recovery in Eastern Europe to growth rates achieved before the economic crisis.The deal puts Starbev’s enterprise value at 11 times its 2011 ebitda of €241m. When SABMiller bought Australian brewer Foster’s last year it paid a multiple of 13 times.While the deal is expected to be earnings accretive in the first full year of operations, Mr Swinburn conceded that synergies, at 5 per cent of sales, were modest. “There’s no overlap, so no natural synergies,” he said.He shrugged off concerns that Starbev operates in competitive markets. “Yes, they are split three ways but we have the number one brands in at least 50 per cent of these markets,” he said.Trevor Stirling, analyst at Bernstein Research, said it was unclear how quickly these markets could resume a growth trajectory and highlighted that the pricing environment remained difficult. “Having been owned first by ABInBev and then private equity, there is unlikely to be much low hanging fruit,” he added.For CVC, the sale represents a quick exit, having only owned the business since late 2009.However, it will have a stake in the business going forward. Molson Coors’ is financing the deal with $3bn in cash and debt, and also issuing a €500m of convertible bond to CVC, that will allow it to benefit from any appreciation in Molson’s stock in the future.One person familiar with the sale said on Tuesday that the deal would yield several times what CVC invested in the company, and came in response to unsolicited approaches.Anheuser-Busch InBev had the right of first offer to reacquire the business if CVC chose to sell StarBev, and was among those having considered a bid, along with Japanese brewers and western European drinks companies such as SABMiller, people with matter previously said.ABI sold the business to CVC for an enterprise value of $2.2bn, with a further potential $800m payment dependent on CVC’s return on its initial investment.CVC was advised by Nomura and Molson Coors was advised by Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Barclays."

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
35;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2012-04-03T19:04:52Z;Molson Coors/Starbev;The price looks high but volume matters and Molson had little choice but to seek growth;Starbev is a constellation of second-tier brewers scattered across eastern Europe that the big brewers don’t want. Canadian-American Molson Coors is a tenth the size of its largest rivals. On Tuesday, Molson said it would buy Starbev for $3.5bn from CVC Capital Partners. The price looks high. But in a business where volume matters, Molson had little choice but to seek growth in new markets. The deal would lift its beer volumes by almost one-third.Molson needs some stardust. Its revenues of $3.5bn in 2011 were a 10th of AB InBev’s (the world’s biggest brewer by most measures), but Molson’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were just 6 per cent as big. And these earnings grew only 6 per cent last year, almost half the pace at AB InBev. But chasing growth in emerging markets (if you can call eastern Europe one of those – beer consumption is expected to grow by only an average 2 per cent annually over the next five years) is not certain to unlock big savings unless synergies can be achieved.AB InBev showed that overlapping distribution can do just that – it has made savings of more than $2bn through synergies since it bought Anheuser-Busch in 2008. But for Molson and Starbev there is little duplication. Molson’s brands, such as Carling and Coors, are barely present in eastern Europe. And it plans to run the two businesses separately.Sure, Molson gets the worldwide rights to Starbev’s flagship brand Staropramen. But its other brands are much less well known. Starbev is the number one brewer in only four of its nine main markets and it lost share in one of those (Serbia) last year, according to Euromonitor. Carlsberg, with a quarter of the market, is the number one brewer in the region. And its shares trade at five times 2011 earnings. Molson is paying 11 times Starbev’s 2011 ebitda. Nothing heavenly about that.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
36;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2012-04-03T18:21:21Z;CEE beer: Molson Coors enters the fray;;"Canadian brewer Molson Coors says its $3.54bn acquisition of StarBev will put the group in the top rank of beer companies in the fast-moving emerging markets of central and eastern Europe.But with the outstanding exception of Staropramen, StarBev’s brands are not premier league. Molson may struggle to boost their performance in the region in the face of some of its biggest global rivals, including Carlsberg, SABMiller, and Heineken.Molson Coors executives say in their statement that with the acquisition they plan “to increase our portfolio of premium brands and deepen our reach into growth markets around the world”.With its limited experience of emerging markets, the Canadian company has, quite reasonably, decided to focus not at the sharp end – for example, in Africa – but in the more developed CEE countries, where drinkers are already familiar with a wide choice of brands.The revenue growth may not be so dramatic. But the assets and profits will be more secure. Moreover, in a fast-consolidating industry, the options for buying an established multi-country EM-focused operation were limited – StarBev was one of the few chunky businesses for sale.But it is not a CEE market leader. Euromonitor figures show that Denmark’s Carlsberg was number one in CEE last year with a 25 per cent market share, followed by Heineken, the Dutch brewer, and Anheuser-Busch InBev of Belgium/Brazil. Starbev had just 5.1 per cent.The chart paints the picture:Molson would argue that that is not the whole story. The regional figures above cover most of the former Communist bloc, including Russia, Ukraine, the Baltics, central Europe, and the Balkans. This isn’t a homogenous market. Beer sales are dominated by national brands selling to national customers – with a slice at the premium end where richer drinkers buy international brands – such as Staropramen.At a country level, StarBev looks much stronger. As the Molson Coors chart (based on Euromonitor data) shows below, its leading brands are number one in five countries – Serbia, Croatia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Montenegro.But even that’s not quite the end of the matter. When each big brewer’s brands are added together, StarBev slips down Euromonitor’s rankings. According to numbers produced for beyondbrics by Euromonitor, StarBev is indeed the number one company in Serbia and Croatia. But it is only number three in the much bigger Hungarian market, with a 22.5 per cent share, behind Heineken on 23.6 per cent and SABMiller on 27.2 per cent. In Bulgaria it is third and for Montenegro, beyondbrics has no data.In the high-profile Czech market, StarBev ranks second behind SABMiller, which not only is market leader but also has in its portfolio the priciest brand, Pilsner Urquell. In Romania, the second most populous country among the EU’s new member states after Poland, StarBev is a creditable third. But in Poland it is nowhere.So, Molson Coors is buying a reasonable selection of good brands in middle-sized markets. This reflects StarBev’s creation from CEE operations that Anheuser-Busch Inbev decided to sell after the two merged in 2008.As the FT has reported, this is the business which CVC Capital Partners bought in late 2009 for up to $3bn. The two parties agreed an enterprise value of $2.2bn for the assets, with a further potential $800m payment dependent on CVC’s return on its initial investment.Molson is now paying $3.54bn, with $500m of the sum being paid in convertible debt to CVC to give the seller a share in future equity gains.CVC declined to comment on the details on the terms of its original purchase or of the sale. On the face of it it might have made $540m on a $3bn investment, assuming the $800m was paid out. That’s a return of 18 per cent. Not bad, in today’s markets. But over the period since the deal was announced – October 15 2009 – until now, CVC would have done better – and had less hassle – investing in Anheuser-Busch Inbev shares, which have risen 68 per cent.Molson Coors may prove a better manager of the assets than CVC, given its marketing experience, the potential for cross-selling its own brands in CEE and StarBev brands in other Molson markets, and a plan for $50m in annual synergies.But the Canadian will face the same well-entrenched competition.Related reading:

37;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2012-04-03T10:18:40Z;[Snap] Molson Coors wins StarBev;;"Canada’s Molson Coors is acquiring StarBev, the central and east Europe brewer, for $3.54bn from CVC, the private equity company, and StarBev managers.The deal, announced on Tuesday, will make the Canadian group one of the largest brewers in the fast-growing CEE market, where it will challenge global rivals, headed by Anheuser-Busch InBev, SAB Miller, and Carlsberg.The announcement carried on Business Wire said:Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP; TSX) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement with StarBev L.P., owned by funds (“CVC Funds”) advised by CVC Capital Partners Limited (“CVC”) and StarBev management, to acquire StarBev for E2.65 billion ( 3.54 billion). Headquartered in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Prague, Czech Republic, StarBev operates nine breweries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and generated 2011 sales of approximately E0.7 billion ( 1.0 billion) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of E241 million ( 322 million).1 The purchase price represents a multiple of approximately 11x EBITDA.“The acquisition of StarBev fits squarely into Molson Coors’ strategy to increase our portfolio of premium brands and deepen our reach into growth markets around the world,” said Peter Swinburn, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors. “The Central and Eastern European beer market is attractive, with strong historical trends and upside potential as the region returns to its pre-economic-crisis growth rates.“StarBev, as a market leader in the CEE region, provides Molson Coors with a great platform for growth and an excellent foundation from which to extend our key brands, such as Carling, into Central and Eastern Europe. Staropramen, StarBev’s international flagship brand, will also enhance our portfolio in some of our current and planned markets.”StarBev, which employs approximately 4,100 people, has brewing operations in the Czech Republic, Serbia, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Montenegro and also sells its brands in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovakia. StarBev brews 13.3 million hectoliters annually and holds a top three market share position in each of its markets. Starbev’s portfolio of more than 20 brands includes local champions such as Borsodi, Kamenitza, Bergenbier, Ozusko, Jelen and Niksicko and also distributes brands such as Stella Artois, Beck’s, Hoegaarden, Lowenbrau and Leffe under license….…Alain Beyens, CEO of StarBev said: “We are delighted to become part of one of the world’s largest brewers. It has been great to work with CVC as we have developed and grown this business over the last few years. Their support has enabled StarBev to become a leading innovator of world-class brands. I am convinced Molson Coors will take StarBev to the next level of development and growth.”"
38;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2012-03-21T17:55:13Z;Smokers hit by 37p cigarette pack rise;;The price of a packet of cigarettes will rise by 37p as George Osborne targeted smokers in Wednesday’s Budget, while drinkers got off relatively lightly.The chancellor said there was “clear evidence” that tobacco price rises helped cut national smoking rates. He announced an increase to the tobacco duty escalator – the formula used to tax tobacco – that will see the duty on a packet of cigarettes rise by 5 per cent above inflation each year – up from 2 per cent. The government projects the move will raise an additional £260m in taxes over the next five years.A typical packet of Benson & Hedges or Marlboro costs £7.09 – that will rise to £7.47, according to the Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association. By contrast, in Spain, the same packet of Marlboro sells for about £3.50.In the UK, a 25g packet of rolling tobacco is £7.54 – that will go up to £7.91, according to the TMA.Paul Stockall, a TMA spokesman, said the increase will spur tobacco smuggling.However, despite making reference to the growing problem of abuse, Mr Osborne said he would not make any similar increases to the duty escalator on alcohol – introduced by the Labour government in 2008 – where costs rise 2 per cent above inflation.Consumers can expect an 11p price rise on a bottle of wine, 41p on a bottle of spirits and 3p on a pint of beer from Monday, according to The Wine and Spirit Trade Association.Mark Hunter, chief executive of beer company Molson Coors and chairman of the British Beer and Pub Association, said the continuation of the tax escalator was forcing British brewers into decline.
39;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2012-03-08T18:24:26Z;Minimum alcohol pricing poses problems;;Cheap alcohol is giving David Cameron a headache. By forging ahead on alcohol price controls the UK prime minister is on a collision course with competition authorities, industry and his own health secretary.Ramping up the price of a pint inevitably raises hackles, as seen by the Scottish government’s attempts to introduce minimum alcohol pricing.By reducing binge drinking and alcoholism, Mr Cameron is hoping he can save the national coffers £15bn over 10 years and purge Saturday night town centre “war zones” of fuelled-up youths.The trouble, argues the £37bn drinks industry, is that it would also hurt the vast majority of responsible drinkers.“Aside from its doubtful legality, minimum unit pricing is a regressive measure, which will fall on lower income households whilst failing to address the UK’s cultural drivers of alcohol abuse,” says Kristin Wolfe, SABMiller’s head of alcohol policy.Setting a minimum price for a unit of alcohol, expected to be in the 40p to 50p range, may breach European free trade legislation, as Anne Milton, the UK public health minister, has acknowledged.Proponents believe that this challenge can be headed off, given the scale of the problem.Government numbers show one in four Brits drink at harmful or hazardous levels, and the charity Alcohol Concern expects the consequent hospital admissions to hit 1.5m a year by 2015, costing the National Health Service an annual £3.7bn.Deterred by the price of alcohol at the bar and on supermarket shelves, more drinkers are choosing to brew their own beer at home, writes Hannah Kuchler.Somewhat out of favour since its 1970s’ heyday, home brewing has made a comeback, with sales of beer-making kits at Tesco rising 70 per cent last year.Home-made beer can cost as little as 30p a pint. In contrast, a bottle of real ale could cost at least £1.50 in a supermarket and £3.50 in a pub.Greg Hughes, owner and director of Brew UK, an online home brewery shop, expects more cash-strapped consumers to start brewing their own if minimum pricing is introduced.“The quality of products is much better than in the 1970s as manufacturers spent a lot of time with modern breweries to make sure that the beer you produce at home is good quality,” says Mr Hughes.Another internet store, the Online Homebrew Company, brands itself as a way to avoid paying duty on alcohol, with the tag line “why pay Dave and Nick when you can brew it yourself!” referring to David Cameron, the prime minister, and Nick Clegg, his deputy.But while brewing your own beer and wine is lawful, there are restrictions on who can distil spirits. Making your own can also be dangerous, as shown when five men were killed in an explosion at an illegal alcohol factory in Lincolnshire last year.Other drinkers may turn to low alcohol beers for a cheaper tipple because the drinks may be excluded from minimum pricing. Brewers, including Molson Coors, are looking to launch new drinks to cater for this demand.Nor do health lobbyists buy the argument that raising prices hurts the 70-odd per cent of Brits who drink moderately, arguing that the biggest increases would be borne by the cheapest – and most misused – drinks.“My patients are not drinking Château Lafite, they’re drinking strong cider or lager or cheap white wine,” says Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, special adviser to the Royal College of Physicians and chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance.“The problem of alcohol is a problem for the whole of society, not just misusers,” adds Katherine Brown, head of research at the independent Institute of Alcohol Studies. So far as she is concerned, “the root cause is the product not the individual”.Manufacturers and retailers have sought to counter such perceptions with drink awareness campaigns, but their participation in the government’s Responsibility Deal on alcohol last year was so great that health lobbyists walked out, claiming it had been hijacked by industry.The Wine and Spirit Trade Association estimates that, assuming a 50p minimum unit price, a bottle of vodka costing £10 today would go up to £13. However, a £9 bottle would also rise to the same price. That, says the WSTA, undermines the marketing investment made by the branded companies, and could spell the end for supermarket own brands as they effectively lose their price advantage.The British Retail Consortium estimates alcohol accounts for around 10 per cent of supermarket sales. Brewers and distillers, like cigarette makers before them, may be forging into emerging markets but still rely on the UK for a chunk of net sales – 8 per cent in the case of Diageo, the world’s biggest drinks group.That has a knock-on effect on the broader economy, as lobbyists are keen to point out. The industry contributes £16bn to government coffers through excise duty and VAT and supports, directly and indirectly, 2m UK jobs. Pubs, closing at a rate of 16 a week, would come under more pressure.However, the health lobby argues that the savings more than compensate: each year 3,393 fewer deaths, nearly 100,000 fewer hospital admissions and 45,800 fewer crimes ten years after the implementation of minimum pricing, according to the chief medical officer’s report.The statistics vary depending on who you listen to, but as Mr Cameron is discovering, debates over alcohol are usually emotive rather than strictly scientific.
40;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2012-03-07T22:53:57Z;Breweries target women with new tastes;;Big beer companies are increasingly targeting women with new flavours and fewer calories as they look to claw back sales that have been lost to spirits and wine.Peter Swinburn, chief executive of Molson Coors, said that brewers have been doing a bad job at targeting the “girls’ night out” and that the industry needs to provide women with beers that do not leave them feeling bloated or with a bitter aftertaste.“Beer hasn’t been addressing that very well,” Mr Swinburn told the Financial Times.Molson Coors, which brews Coors Light, Carling and Blue Moon, has been chasing women customers with new offerings such as Molson Canadian 67, which contains only 67 calories, and the recently launched Animée, a beer with a pink hue that claims to be bloat-free.Molson said the new Animée brand, which is being sold in the UK, aims to dispel the idea among women that all beers look and taste the same and that there is nothing to tell them apart. Women account for just 17 per cent of beer sales in the UK, offering much room for growth.According to Mr Swinburn, Molson’s marketing has been overly male-oriented and the industry needs to lure women by reminding them that beer tends to have fewer calories than wine or liquor.Beer sales in western markets have been declining as consumers have turned to more innovative spirits products and have been treating themselves to premium brands. According to the Distilled Spirits Council, the spirits industry has been stealing about $3bn a year from beer in the US since 2000.“Beer has been seen as pedestrian,” Mr Swinburn said, explaining the difficulty keeping up with spirits innovation.Spirits producers have been catering to women with “lighter” beverages. Beam said last month it was expanding its Skinnygirl brand with fruity vodkas, wine and piñas coladas. Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniels, is launching Little Black Dress vodka.Heineken, the world’s fifth-largest brewer by revenues, is also looking to tap women drinkers as it tries to revive sales in developed markets.René Hooft Graafland, chief financial officer of Heineken, said that the company will begin selling Strongbow cider outside of the UK to markets such as the US. Sales in the cider category have been outpacing beer, he said, because of the perception that it is more healthy.“There is the perception of beer that it has more calories, that it fattens,” Mr Hooft Graafland told the Financial Times.However, Mr Hooft Graafland said the company would resist overtly creating a beer that was specially for women. Instead it would use smaller, more fashionable packages and continue to market Heineken as premium and trendy.
41;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2012-02-22T20:10:22Z;CVC receives approaches over Starbev;;CVC, the private equity fund, has been working with bankers at Nomura to assess approaches from several brewers for Starbev, which it bought for $3bn in December 2009, according to people familiar with the talks.It has not put Starbev up for sale or begun a formal sales process, the people said, but the move follows approaches to CVC about a possible bid for the company, which it acquired from Anheuser-Busch InBev.It is not clear whether CVC will choose to sell the business, one of the people said. “It is a very strong asset that from day one has seen a large amount of interest,” said one person familiar with the situation.ABI has the right of first offer to re-acquire the business if CVC chooses to sell, and it is among the brewers potentially interested in making a bid, one of the people said. However, some analysts were sceptical that buying Starbev, which operates in a series of small markets, would fit ABI’s usual approach of targeting large positions in big markets.ABI declined to comment.SABMiller is another brewer that has taken an interest Starbev, the people said. Bankers have speculated that the eastern European beer maker could attract potential buyers including Japanese brewers, or US brewers such as Molson Coors, which declined to comment.“There are very few assets around with critical mass,” said one of the people. However, some industry specialists believe that some European brewers could face competition issues if they bought 100 per cent of Starbev.The company is headquartered in Prague and has a portfolio of more than 20 brands, including Czech brand Staropramen, as well as having the right to brew or distribute ABI brands, including Beck’s, Hoegaarden and Stella Artois. Analysts at Nomura estimated that in 2008 Starbev had earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of around $180m, but added it may since have increased.Starbev was formed by CVC when the fund bought the central European operations of ABI for $3bn, following the $52bn merger of the the US and Belgian companies that formed the world’s largest brewer.The sale followed a decision by ABI to focus on core brands, such as Stella Artois, Beck’s, Bass and Hoegaarden, and make $7bn worth of divestments to pay down the debt it incurred by its purchase.ABI also sold its minority stake in China’s Tsingtao brewery for $900m to Asahi and a private bidder, and sold the Tennent’s lager brand in the UK for £180m to C&C, the Irish drinks group, for £180m.CVC and Nomura declined to comment.Additional reporting by Alan Rappeport, Louise Lucas and Daniel Schäfer.
42;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2011-09-22T18:56:55Z;Door slams shut for corporate have-nots;A better outlook earlier in the year has given way to fears over refinancing;Three years on from the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers and a banking crisis that prompted a worldwide recession, the outlook still remains bleak for companies.Global GDP is estimated by some analysts to remain stagnant at about 3 per cent this year and next, down from more than 4 per cent in 2010. Recession is still expected in peripheral eurozone economies such as Spain and Italy, according to analysts at Citi. “Recession appears to be a more likely outcome now in Europe and/or the US than three to six months ago,” says Jonathan Stubbs, equity strategist at Citi.While last year in Europe, earnings upgrades outpaced downgrades, today the situation is reversed, with downgrades outstripping upgrades, according to the Citi analysts. As economists lower growth forecasts, earnings expectations are being reset as economic activity slows.This year, the story in the corporate world has been one of haves and have-nots. Companies that built up strong balance sheets during the crisis have almost unparalleled levels of cash. In one stunning example, computer maker Apple emerged this summer as having more cash than the US government itself.But for many smaller companies, particularly those that are consumer facing, the economic crisis is still real.“As the impact of the staggering post-Lehman concerted fiscal stimulus began to take its effect on the global economy in 2009 and 2010, many were lulled into thinking the worst was over,” says Jonathan Coltman, restructuring partner at KPMG.“This stimulus also clearly helped some companies to stagger on and put off hard restructuring decisions. Unfortunately, the stimulus is now waning and nations themselves are being dragged into financial crisis. The resultant impact on demand patterns, confidence and prospects of growth is only just emerging.”Corporate restructuring specialists say deleveraging on the scale required over the coming years will be a long, hard and socially draining process, and will have to take place against a backdrop of heightened, political, social, financial and environmental instability.“Increased volatility and instability are also here to stay,” says Mr Coltman. “The coming decade will be one of the hardest in living memory for CEOs, CFOs and boards to build and protect corporate value.”In the UK, corporate insolvencies slowly fell over the course of 2010 from their peak at the height of the recession in 2009, according to R3, a trade body for the insolvency industry. However, since the start of 2011 they have begun to rise once again.In early 2011 the steepest rise in insolvencies has been among the real estate, wholesale and retail and manufacturing sectors.UK company insolvencies rose to 5,974 by the second quarter of this year, having fallen to 5,383 in the fourth quarter of 2010.Constraints in bank lending and a sluggish economic recovery are both factors in the increase in corporate failures. “Recovery is one of the most difficult times for businesses, as it takes time for a return to growth to translate into tangible relief for businesses, yet creditors tend to be more aggressive in their pursuit of debtors,” says Frances Coulson, president of R3.The first half of 2011 gave many corporates hope, as credit markets rallied, with high yield bond issuance reaching its highest levels.This return in lending appetite among banks and institutional investors also helped support a revival of mergers and acquisitions activity, as the outlook became more certain.But in recent months, capital markets have been choked off once again by renewed sovereign debt crises in the US and Europe. Equity and debt markets once again shut to those companies seeking funding for growth or debt reduction. Bankers have already started warning that there may be no new corporate listings in Europe this year if the uncertainty continues.“If this negative sentiment, flight to safety and associated volatility continue, then we can expect another round of financial and operational restructurings to deal with pending maturities that are faced with limited refinancing possibilities,” says Andrew MacCallum, managing director at Alvarez & Marsal, the restructuring specialist.During the first half of 2011, the high-yield market was active and allowed companies to chip away at refinancing an impending “wall” of maturities that come due between 2012 and 2014.“The high yield market was providing much needed refinancing capacity in the face of the refinancing wall,” says Mark Sterling, restructuring partner at Allen & Overy, the law firm. “That’s now shut and may not open for a while, given the volatility in the capital markets. This leaves billions of dollars of debt due for refinancing with no obvious source.”And while global interest rates remain suppressed, some restructuring professionals fear the impact of their eventual increase on companies.“If interest rates rise and debt service costs crank up – with more groups becoming unhedged, a material interest rate rise could trigger a lot of restructurings,” says Richard Tett, restructuring partner at Freshfields, the law firm. “There’s a pent up supply of restructurings around Europe that are currently limping along – performing fairly well operationally, but just waiting to be restructured when the markets improve or liquidity or lenders’ patience runs out.’Financing is still available for the strongest companies. Many have taken advantage of cheap debt and bought back shares. In August, more US companies were set to buy back shares than in any month since the peak in 2007, according to Birinyi Associates. Companies in Europe and the UK have also stepped up buy-back programmes, according to Thomson Reuters data.In recent weeks, companies including AOL, brewer Molson Coors and retailer Lowes have announced plans to buy back their own shares.Analysts at Citi urge chief executives to consider capital or corporate restructuring as a way of creating value for shareholders. “Given the macro nature of the market, de-equitisation, through spin-offs or buy-backs, offers CEOs the opportunity to focus on self-help value-creation strategies,” says Mr Stubbs at Citi. “Get smaller, get smarter, get a higher share price.”Companies have taken note. Divestments rose to a record share of global mergers and acquisitions activity this year, according to Dealogic data. Spin-offs and asset sales accounted for about half of global dealmaking, up on last year. In the US, such activity is up more than 40 per cent on the first half of 2010.Steve Frobisher, business turnround expert at PA Consulting Group, says companies need to take advantage of the disruption.“Companies need to secure enough capital to prosper, either by raising capital or by a ruthless focus on cash in the business, including selling off surplus assets,” says Mr Frobisher.“They need to create portfolios of winning businesses, remembering the adage: ‘The best way to create value is to stop destroying it.’ This means exiting or re-engineering value-destroying lines of business.”This year, US companies were most aggressive in taking advantage of the weakness of others. In the first quarter of 2011, US companies accounted for almost half of global M&A activity, up from about a third in 2010.“Companies need to be aggressive in pursuing market share, as there will never be a better time,” says Mr Frobisher.
43;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2011-09-21T21:08:54Z;Foster’s backs sweetened SABMiller offer;;SABMiller is set to win one of the last remaining prizes in international brewing after lifting its cash takeover offer for Foster’s, the Australian drinks group.Foster’s, having rejected SABMiller’s initial A$4.90 a share offer in June, immediately backed the revised proposal which it said was an “outstanding” deal for its shareholders.The two companies differed on the actual value to shareholders of the revised offer largely due to the treatment of a tax refund that will be paid out to shareholders and a dividend, which SABMiller initially said it would deduct from the original offer price.Foster’s said the offer for its equity was sweetened from A$9.5bn to A$10.8bn ($11bn). SABMiller estimated its offer at A$9.9bn for the equity. Including net debt, SABMiller said its revised offer represented an enterprise value for A$11.5bn for Foster’s, a 2.8 per cent increase.“That we think a worthwhile bump to get board recommendation and support for a scheme of arrangement,” said Graham Mackay, chief executive of the London-listed brewer.Foster’s said the bid was worth A$5.5325 a share to its shareholders, a 13 per cent rise on SABMiller’s initial bid. It comprises A$5.10 a share cash, a 30 cents a share one-off distribution and a 13.25 cents a share final dividend for the 2010-2011 financial year. It calculates that this represents an enterprise value of A$12.3bn, including A$1.5bn of net debt.Analysts and investors were less impressed by the extra cash put on the table to secure an asset in a mature market, albeit one offering some of the biggest margins in the world thanks to the duopoly nature of the Australian market.An adviser to Foster’s said the Australian group had played its hand well after refusing to negotiate with SABMiller while it stuck to initial A$4.90 a share proposal. “It’s a massive result for Foster’s,” the adviser said.It is understood hostilities between the two brewers thawed over the last week or two. “The negotiation was over a beer,” quipped John Pollaers, Foster’s chief executive. Mr Pollaers declined to comment on whether Foster’s had held talks with rival suitors since SABMiller’s initial offer.Foster’s shares closed 2 cents lower at A$4.89 on Wednesday before news of the revised offer was made public. SABMiller shares fell slightly more than the broader market.Grupo Modelo of Mexico and Molson Coors, the North American brewer, are known to have discussed a joint bid for Foster’s, while UBS named Anheuser-Busch InBev this year as a potential bidder. UBS also noted that Foster’s represented “a rare, sizeable opportunity …[in] global brewing”.But Foster’s had been out of reach for would-be bidders until earlier this year when it demerged its unprofitable wine operations, a business regarded as a poison pill after billions of dollars was spent on building up the business in a series of ill-fated acquisitions at inflated prices.SABMiller pounced on Foster’s barely a month after the Australian group spun off its unprofitable wine operations into a listed group named Treasury Wine Estates.The Australian group has recommended the deal in the absence of a higher offer. SABMiller’s acquisition will need to win clearance from regulators.Foster’s is advised by Goldman Sachs and Gresham. SABMiller is advised by JPMorgan, Moelis, Royal Bank of Scotland and Morgan Stanley.
44;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2011-02-07T23:36:35Z;Frayed nerves from Kent to the Mersey;The disparities loosely known as the north-south divide threaten to become a big issue again. But the present situation is more complex;We notice the disparities loosely known as the north-south divide more in bad times than in good. The output gap widened over the past decade, but then prosperity was benefiting all. Now public spending cuts threaten to make this a big issue again.The present situation – possibly the calm before the storm – is more complex. Pfizer’s closure of its Sandwich research centre in east Kent, with 2,400 jobs, is a reminder that parts of the south are vulnerable too: the Thanet area has 5.2 per cent claimant count unemployment, twice the south-east average. Meanwhile Scotland’s life sciences received a modest boost from Toshiba’s £15.5m investment in healthcare imaging in Edinburgh, creating 26 jobs now and 100 within three years.This recession has subverted many expectations. At first people assumed London and the south-east would be punished for their part in the financial bubble. But it was manual workers in the West Midlands, Wales and parts of northern England who bore the early brunt. Since then, as manufacturing has partially recovered, things have evened out a bit. Economic indicators are all over the place. Yorkshire and the Humber, Scotland and the West Midlands have had the biggest rises in unemployment since the start of the recession. But the biggest output falls in 2009, the most recent period for which data are available, were in eastern and south-east England.According to surveys by the British Chambers of Commerce, Scotland and London suffered the deepest drop in sales of services in the UK market during the recession, while the West Midlands, Yorkshire and north-east England had the biggest fall in manufactured exports. All are at varying stages of recovery.Business confidence has recently been strongest in London, followed by Yorkshire and the north-east, and lowest in Wales, according to Lloyds TSB Commercial. Corporate insolvencies are rising in Scotland and Northern Ireland but falling in England and Wales, says the Insolvency Service.So what will happen now? Over the past decade, output per head soared in London but declined in many other regions. History suggests it will not be easy for the laggards to catch up, but look on the bright side. For example, the Mersey Partnership, a public-private body, thinks 128,000 jobs will be created in Liverpool city region by 2021 – double the past decade’s growth. Ambition is a good first step.Doomsday, or notSharp’s Brewery in fashionable Rock, Cornwall – maker of Doom Bar, David Cameron’s favourite tipple – was sold last week to Molson Coors for £20m. Such a takeover could indeed have spelt doom to the little brewer a couple of decades ago. Today, although it has sparked some concern among beer lovers, it is a sign that big companies are taking the revival of cask ales seriously.Molson Coors recently opened its own new microbrewery in Burton upon Trent to produce historic brands such as Worthington’s White Shield. As the Campaign for Real Ale prepares to celebrate its 40th birthday next month, the stereotype of ale drinkers as flat-cap wearing, middle-aged northerners (like your Notebook writer) is receding. There are now 700 brewers in Britain, four times more than when Camra launched. Real ale is growing in popularity among women and young people and in the south.Cask ale sales are rising but up to 30 pubs a week are still closing, down from 52 at the height of the recession in 2009. Competition from cheap supermarket booze appears the main culprit. There are some hopeful signs, though. Enterprise Inns, a big pub company, has started doing deals in which independent brewers such as Derbyshire’s Thornbridge and West Sussex’s Dark Star will run some of its pubs. That follows an example set by Everards brewery in Leicestershire, which has revived 21 closed or rundown pubs in partnership with 12 different breweries.Britain still has 55,000 pubs, so all is not yet lost. Those that concentrate on their beer, instead of just relying on income from food, look to have the best chance.All togetherThe coalition wants to move the May Day bank holiday to the October half-term and rename it UK Day or Trafalgar Day. If it opts for UK Day, will nationalists in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland go to work in protest?brian.groom@ft.com
45;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Companies quizzed on water risks awareness;The launch of the Water Disclosure Project highlights a greater urgency for data and action;A decade after launching a global initiative to encourage companies to report on their carbon emissions, the Carbon Disclosure Project has turned its attention to another vital resource – water.On Friday it launched the Water Disclosure Project, which asked 302 of the world’s largest companies for information on their water use and other water-related business issues on behalf of 137 institutional investors representing $16,000bn in assets.By contrast, the first carbon request was on behalf of just 35 investors with $4,500bn of assets under management.As with the CDP, the number of companies questioned and the number of investors asking for the information are expected to rise over time.The CDP launched the water project partly in response to pressure from investors for more information on the issue but also because of a long-held belief within the organisation that water is a crucial factor for businesses.“If climate change is the shark, then water is the teeth,” says Marcus Norton, head of CDP Water Disclosure. “It is through water that climate change will bite.”A number of investors CDP advises on carbon issues wanted to know the effect on their portfolios of water-related risks but lacked the data to enable them to make effective assessments, he adds.At the same time, as supplies become more uneven because of climate change, water demand will rise because of population growth and urbanisation.Another factor is the emerging middle class in developing markets, who will increase demand for a whole range of products that require huge amounts of water, from beef to semiconductors to vehicles. It takes more than 15,000 litres of water to produce a kilogramme of beef, for example, and 2,700 litres on average to make one cotton shirt.The report suggests some sectors are more aware of water risks than others, with 100 per cent of companies in the chemicals sector responding to the request, compared with just 29 per cent in the oil and gas, construction, infrastructure and real estate sectors.“I don’t think this means water is less important to these sectors,” Mr Norton says.Sectors reporting the greatest exposure to water risks include food, beverage and tobacco and metals and mining, with chemicals and technology and communications the least exposed. Physical risks to direct operations from drought and flooding are most frequently cited, but companies also recognise risks from changing regulations and reputational damage.The leak of toxic sludge from an alumina plant in Hungary last month is the most recent example of the problems companies can face if they do not take adequate precautions, with the plant seized by the government, executives arrested and MAL, the plant’s owner, facing claims of millions of euros in compensation.Unlike carbon, which has global impacts regardless of where it is emitted, “water is a global issue, but a local resource”, says Gregory Wade, global chief supply chain officer for brewer Molson Coors.There appears to be a greater awareness of water risks than there was about carbon when the CDP started, with 96 per cent of respondents aware of water risks in their own supply chains.However, just 53 per cent of those questioned could identify whether they were exposed to water risks in their supply chains.Nearly two-thirds of businesses (62 per cent) are also identifying a wide range of water related business opportunities in areas such as water management, water efficiency and reduction, and wastewater treatment.The report highlights companies exhibiting best practice in water management, including Anglo American, Colgate-Palmolive, Ford, GE, PG&E and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
46;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2010-11-05T22:33:56Z;Molson Coors to serve up beer for females;;Molson Coors is launching a beer aimed at women in the UK next year as it makes a fresh attempt to invigorate the lacklustre market.Beer’s share of the UK drinks market has shrunk by a fifth in the past five years, and the North American brewer of Carling wants to reverse the industry’s declining fortunes much as Nintendo’s Wii revolutionised gaming. “Before the Wii, gaming was done by 15-year-old boys in their bedrooms, said Mark Hunter, chief executive for UK and Ireland.“Nintendo brought it to the whole family and changed the landscape of gaming.”His answer is a yet-to-be named beer that will be rolled out in the UK in the middle of next year and, if successful, further afield including the US. It will be accompanied by designer black and gold goblets, publicans who will be discouraged from serving sloppily overfilled glasses, and supported by advertising.It is the brewer’s second attempt to target women, 60 per cent of whom never drink beer according to its research. The last effort was withdrawn at a late stage after it was deemed insufficient to engage a new swathe of drinkers.This time, Molson Coors has carried out 18 months of research and spoken to more than 30,000 women at their homes, in bars and supermarkets.Although barriers were largely thought to revolve around beer’s reputation as a bloating, fattening drink with a bitter taste, Molson Coor’s research showed that the key barrier for women was the advertising.Other brewers chasing women drinkers include Carlsberg, which sells a fruity drink called Eve and SABMiller.The latter’s Redd’s, “a premium alcohol fruit beverage made for the modern, confident woman” conversely proved popular with the (presumably modern, confident) man in Colombia.Analysts remain sceptical. “Most of these products are what men think women should be drinking and fail miserably,” said Trevor Stirling, of Bernstein research.However he added that younger men often had similar preferences for sweeter, fruitier drinks, pointing to the popularity of cider. “Actually even Strongbow is a way of men drinking something cold fruity and fizzy without losing credibility among their friends,” he said.The UK beer market has been evaporating over the years: social and economic change have erased 40 per cent of its share of the alcoholic drinks market over the past four decades. Prices meantime have stagnated – there have been no retail price increases in the past 13 years.
47;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2010-11-03T20:59:10Z;US stocks rise in choppy trading;;"The financial sector helped US stocks edge higher in choppy trading after the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it would embark on a second round of quantitative easing.Stocks see-sawed after the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee said it planned to buy $600bn of bonds, more than the $500bn forecast, by the middle of next year. The purchases will be spread out and the pace will be adjusted if needed.“I think the market is struggling with what to make of it,” said Dan Cook, chief executive of IG Markets. “It had it priced in pretty well at $500bn- $1,000bn and between the FOMC and the Federal Reserve of New York, the total is $850bn-$900bn.“I think we could see a good week or two of softness. A healthy retracement would not be a bad thing.”However, Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management, said in the longer term financials, housing and the automotive sectors stood to do well out of the increased liquidity from quantitative easing, and the consumer discretionary sector could rise on hopes for economic growth.The S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,197.96, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to close at 11,1215.13 and the Nasdaq Composite ended 0.3 per cent higher at 2,540.27.The S&P 500 financials index gained 1 per cent, with Bank of America adding 1.1 per cent to $11.52, AIG gaining 3.4 per cent to $43.57 and Morgan Stanley surging 3.2 per cent to $25.40.Before the Federal Reserve’s announcement, investors shrugged off a Republican victory in the midterm elections, widely predicted to buoy markets in the longer term.Analysts at JPMorgan said healthcare, financials and technology stood to benefit most from the Republican victory in the House because reforms of healthcare and finance could be implemented in a more lenient way, and technology could benefit from the extension of the tax cuts of former president George W. Bush. They said alternative energy stocks could suffer.Elsewhere, the earnings season pressed on in a bumper week of results for the healthcare sector.WellPoint, the US health insurer with the most customers, raised its earnings forecast as it became the latest insurer to report reduced costs as people shy away from non-essential procedures.Sales fell but Angela Braly, chief executive, said that enrolment would increase “slightly” next year. The shares edged 0.5 per cent higher to $56.05.Profit at Aetna, another health insurer, jumped 52 per cent and the company also raised its full-year guidance. Its shares rose
2.9 per cent to $30.84.CVS Caremark rose 1.1 per cent to $30.87 after reporting its quarterly results. The largest provider of prescription drugs in the US said profit fell 20 per cent, missing analyst estimates, after lower sales in its pharmacy benefits management division.Time Warner beat analyst expectations and raised its forecast for the full year. An advertising recovery helped buoy profits at the owner of cable networks, including CNN and TNT, and magazines such as Time and People.Revenue from Warner Brothers was flat as strong sales for the film Inception were outweighed by a more tepid reception for last year’s The Hangover and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. In spite of this, shares in Time Warner slid 1.1 per cent to $32.07.Molson Coors reported a stronger quarterly profit, helped by higher beer prices and cost savings. The brewer, which makes Coors Light and Blue Moon beers, rose 3.9 per cent to $49.08. MillerCoors, the company’s joint venture with SABMiller, said net income rose 37 per cent in the third quarter, also helped by prices offsetting soft volumes in the US market.In financials, insurer Hartford Financial Services Group raised its profit
estimate for this year after it focused on its core markets. The insurer also benefited from impairments and losses in its investment portfolio returning to pre-crisis levels. Its shares soared 9.2 per cent to $25.57.Homebuilder Pulte Group sunk 7.7 per cent to $7.45 after it reported a wider-than-expected loss."
48;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2010-09-09T12:06:36Z;Private equity groups target Foster’s wine;;Some of the world’s biggest private equity groups, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG, are working on potential bids for Foster’s wine assets after the Australian company rejected a A$2.7bn (US$2.5bn) offer from Cerberus Capital, the US investment group.Sydney-listed Foster’s declined to identify who had made the rebuffed A$2.3bn-A$2.7bn approach for its Treasury Wine Estates arm, which owns the Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Rosemount and Lindemans brands.But a person familiar with the situation said the mystery bidder had been Cerberus, confirming an earlier report in The Australian newspaper. The person said several other big buy-out groups were also working on similar bids, including KKR and TPG.All parties declined to comment. But the person said several private equity groups were looking closely at the Foster’s wine business, as they scoured the world in search of bargain assets to take advantage of a recent slump in the winemaking industry.One US buy-out boss said the economic downturn had caused falling sales and shrinking profit margins at many winemakers. This meant they were now valued at mid-single digit multiples of earnings, compared with a historic average of about 12 times.One analyst estimated the Foster’s wine unit was worth at least A$3.3bn on a debt-free basis and the buy-out group wanted to acquire a cash-generative business as it entered into a recovery phase.Cerberus, best-known for its ill-fated investment in carmaker Chrysler, has no investments in Australia, although it tried to sell its Talecris blood plasma unit to CSL, a deal blocked by competition authorities.KKR and TPG have both invested before in alcoholic drinks makers, a sector that some private equity groups have shied away from because of opposition from some Middle East investors.TPG sold Beringer, a Californian winemaker, to Foster’s for about A$2bn in 2000. It also owns Mey Icki, Turkey’s biggest producer of spirits including its national drink raki. KKR last year bought South Korea’s Oriental Brewery for $1.8bn.Foster’s plans to become a beer-focused business next year when its wine unit will be spun off as a listed entity. The group spent more than A$7bn building its Australian, US and European wine portfolio at the top of the market.Analysts said the buy-out offer had in effect provided potential bidders for the Foster’s group, which has a market value of A$12.2bn, with an “indicative exit price” for the wine business. SABMiller and Japan’s Asahi Breweries are regarded as potential suitors. New York-listed Molson Coors also owns a small stake in Foster’s.Foster’s shares rose slightly on Thursday, gaining 1 cent to A$6.35.
49;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2010-09-08T16:00:08Z;Foster’s rejects A$2.7bn bid for wine unit;;Foster’s has rejected a A$2.7bn (US$2.5bn) offer for its wine assets from a buy-out group, in a move analysts said would spur fresh takeover interest in the Australian company’s highly prized beer business.The indicative proposal valued Treasury Wine Estates at A$2.3bn-A$2.7bn but Foster’s said it “significantly” undervalued the business and its prospects.One analyst estimated the wine unit was worth at least A$3.3bn on a debt-free basis and the buy-out group, thought to be from the US, wanted to acquire a cash-generative business as it entered into a recovery phase.Foster’s plans to become a focused beer business next year when its wine unit will be spun off as a newly listed entity.The group spent more than A$7bn building its Australian, US and European wine portfolio at the top of the market.However, the unit, which has generated poor returns and required large asset write-offs, has also acted as a “poison pill” for international beverage groups interested in Foster’s beer assets.“The [buy-out] offer might embolden beer companies to bid for the group because previously they were reluctant to buy it because they thought they would be stuck with wine,” one analyst said.The analyst added that the buy-out offer had effectively provided potential bidders for the Foster’s group, which has a market value of A$12.2bn, with an “indicative exit price” for the wine business. “Now the beer groups have greater certainty that one or more parties will be interested in wine,” another analyst said.SABMiller and Japan’s Asahi Breweries are regarded as potential suitors. New York-listed Molson Coorsalso owns a small stake in Foster’s.The buy-out group that made an offer for the wine unit is likely to be interested in its cash flows and opportunity to further improve the business.“Conditions in wine have been poor and some people think they can only get better from here,” the second analyst said. “But the price looks a bit tight assuming we are expecting a rebound.”Beringer, a Californian winemaker, was acquired by Foster’s in 2000 for A$2bn.Foster’s said the “high level of conditionality, the requirement for exclusivity and other terms of the proposal” added uncertainty to the buy-out group’s approach.“Foster’s believes that Treasury Wine Estates is well positioned to grow over the coming years and thereby create additional value for Foster’s shareholders,” the group said in a statement. The company’s ill-fated expansion into wine led to the departure of Trevor O’Hoy as chief executive in 2008.Its shares closed more than 4 per cent higher on Wednesday, up 27 cents at A$6.34.
50;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2010-09-08T00:18:36Z;Luxury lodging makes a comeback;;Luxury lodging is back – but maybe not with all the frills hotel guests enjoyed pre-recession, says Frits van Paasschen, chief executive of Starwood Hotels.“It’s a nice try, but austerity is only cool for a while,” he says.The group behind Sheraton, Westin and St Regis and the boutique hotels W, Le Meridien and Aloft, was hit by the downturn harder than most rivals because of its concentration on top-end brands. But the 1,000-plus hotel operator now believes it has cause for optimism.In July, it beat expectations and recorded growth of 11.9 per cent in the industry benchmark of revenue per available room. Other lodging groups are also feeling more bullish.True, room rates were cut by on average 20-25 per cent during the downturn, and rates at Starwood started moving up only in the spring. Even then, the growth is more about a change in the mix of guests.But amid cautionary words on the recovery, Starwood declared in July “the Great Lodging Depression of 2008-2009 is behind us” and “The World Is Changing in Our Favour – We are Unequivocally Bullish on Long-term Prospects”.Mr van Paasschen doesn’t speak in initial capitals, but knows a thing or two about brands and how to sell them. Dutch-born but raised in Seattle, Mr van Paasschen, aged 49, worked at Disney before holding senior positions with Nike and becoming chief executive at Coors Brewing.“There is a parallel in some respects between what Nike did to the sneaker business and what W has done to the lodging business,” he says.“It brought lifestyle, it brought design, it brought personality, it brought attitude to a space that, once it was there it seems odd that it wouldn’t have always been there.” Mr van Paasschen has just returned from a European tour, opening a Brussels hotel for Aloft, the sister brand to W.Aloft, he says, is “the lodging industry’s answer to the Mini Cooper or Ikea or Top Shop, which is to say, style at a steal”.It is an interesting turn of phrase.In April 2009, Starwood launched a corporate espionage lawsuit against Hilton Hotels and two former executives responsible for Starwood’s luxury brands’ designs who had defected to Hilton.The case is ongoing – Hilton contests it – and Mr van Paasschen declines to discuss details, but he says Starwood is focused on ensuring that “the expertise that we’ve built up in a cumulative fashion is ours to bring to bear for our owners”.Starwood, he points out, is in some respects in the intellectual property business. It gives owners and developers a flag to put on their hotels and that creates value for them and for Starwood. “So we would guard our intellectual property in a significant way to ensure that we’re able to do that,” he says.Starwood was a pathfinder of branded boutique hotels (Mr van Paasschen prefers to call W, Aloft and Le Meridien “design-led contemporary brands”). Others treading down this path are InterContinental Hotels Group with its Indigo brand, Hyatt with Andaz and Marriott with Edition, in partnership with Ian Schrager, the godfather of boutique hotels.They must all chase W, which will have 50 hotels by 2011, and Starwood’s other luxury brands which, Mr van Paasschen says, have brushed aside the portents of the doom-mongers.“I was asked many times during the crisis whether I felt that luxury was dead and we maintained that once people felt more confident about their futures, once businesses felt better about their situation, that people would come back to luxury, and in fact at the beginning of this year we saw the greatest growth in luxury.“More has stayed the same than has changed,” he says.
51;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2010-05-26T03:29:16Z;Foster’s to spin off lossmaking wine unit;;Foster’s is to spin off its prized brewing unit from its struggling wine operations in a structural overhaul that is expected to flush out takeover interest from international brewers.The Australian beverages group, which has a market capitalisation of just over A$10.6bn (US$8.7bn), said on Wednesday it would list its wine unit separately, although a demerger was unlikely to take place until the first half of next year “at the earliest”.Foster’s shares jumped 7 per cent to A$5.51 on news of the split, which was accompanied by a warning that the group’s wine assets would be written down by a further A$1.1bn-A$1.3bn in the year ended June.International brewers have long coveted Foster’s beer operations that dominate the Australian market but they were never likely to act if a sale included the wine portfolio, built up at the top of the market at a cost of close to A$7bn. Investors and industry analysts had for years urged Foster’s to rid itself of the wine business, which has been producing poor returns and weighing on the group’s performance.SABMiller, the London-based brewer, and Japan’s Asahi Breweries are regarded as potential suitors, while Canada’s Molson Coors, which has merged its US operations with SABMiller, owns a small stake in Foster’s.Molson Coors, however, is considered by industry watchers to be more of a minority strategic investor in the event of a bid for Foster’s.Analysts have given the beer business an enterprise value of some A$12bn and said that it is a strong, cash-generating operation.Ian Johnston, the Foster’s chief executive brought in two years ago after Trevor O’Hoy quit due to the group’s ill-fated wine acquisition spree, said the group’s decision early last year to separate the two businesses’ operations was already yielding benefits.“While the beer and wine businesses are market leaders, they operate in separate market segments with different strategic and operating characteristics,” Mr Johnston said.The group said that the demerger was subject to “detailed evaluation of the issues, costs and benefits to Foster’s shareholders and ongoing assessment of prevailing economic and capital market condition”.SABMiller, which has an Australian joint venture with bottler Coca-Cola Amatil called Pacific Ventures that sells premium beers, wants a stronger foothold in the Australian market.Asahi, which held a stake in Foster’s in the 1990s, last year agreed to buy the Australian soft drinks business owned by the UK’s Cadbury for £550m (US$909m).Foster’s on Wednesday forecast that full-year earnings before interest tax and depreciation would be A$1.05bn-A$1.08bn, in line with market estimates.Mr Johnston said wine continued to suffer from oversupply in Australia, weak consumer demand in international markets and the Australian dollar’s strength.He said the beer business had maintained growth and further investment was being made made in the group’s major brands, which include the global Foster’s Lager and Australian labels such as Victoria Bitter and Crown Lager.
52;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2010-05-03T18:27:09Z;US beer;With lager lines suffering, the industry’s problems run deep;An experienced barman can jazz up stale beer, but you may not want to drink it. The US brewers reporting this week face a similar problem – trying to make the best of a highly consolidated, stagnant market.Admittedly, numbers released by Molson Coors today and Anheuser-Busch Inbev tomorrow will reflect one of the worst periods for US beer sales since Federal excise taxes were increased in 1991. Customers have lacked cash for a few cold ones – 15 per cent of men aged 16 to 34 are unemployed, compared with 10 per cent nationally. But a recovery in traffic at convenience stores in the months ahead, through which a third of industry sales are made, should start to help. A further quarter of beers are bought on-premise, where traffic continues to pick up at casual restaurant chains.Yet industry problems run deep. Premium lager – the full-fat versions of Budweiser and Miller – has been in decline for more than a decade. Light beer, a less bitter brew with typically 4 per cent alcohol, has made the running, but sales of Miller Lite and ABI’s Bud Lite have started to fall. Craft beers from local breweries and imports are instead taking the growth. Longer-term, there may be a threat from relaxing attitudes to alternative intoxicants.Cost savings from merging operations provide excitement for now. ABI intends to keep tapping that well into 2011 and Molson-Coors is improving profits via its joint venture with SABMiller. Yet the risk remains that with small competitors chipping away at the edges and consumer interest drifting, an effective duopoly is tempted into cutting prices to keep factories running at full speed, particularly because costs are on the rise. Investors should ponder how much fizz is left.
53;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2010-04-12T10:03:34Z;Femsa to offer finance via Oxxo retail chain;;Femsa, the Mexican drinks group, is to push sales of financial services through its Oxxo convenience store chain to boost profits after selling its beer business to Heineken for €3.8bn ($5.5bn) earlier this year.José Antonio Fernández, Femsa’s chairman and chief executive, told the Financial Times in an interview that by broadening the range of financial services it offers – customers can already pay utility bills and buy airline tickets – it could build smaller stores but remain highly profitable. “We want people to be able to make deposits and acquire more financial products,” he said.About 40 per cent of Oxxo’s sales come from beverages – including soft drinks, mineral waters and beers – which require a lot of storage space.In December, Oxxo became the first convenience chain in Mexico to strike an alliance with Spanish bank BBVA. The deal will allow the bank’s customers to make cash deposits and pay credit card bills at its stores.Although retailers in several countries have begun competing with banks – the UK’s Tesco has claimed it will become the “people’s bank” by opening bank branches in its stores – it is unusual for a convenience store chain to offer a broad range of financial services.Trevor Stirling, analyst at Bernstein Research, said Oxxo’s move was likely to be successful because chain’s breadth – it is Mexico’s biggest convenience store chain controlling about half the market with some 7,500 stores – makes it a “destination stop” that people can trust.Oxxo, which contributes about 14 per cent of group earnings compared with 60 per cent for Coca-Cola Femsa (a bottling company in which Coca-Cola owns a 32 per cent stake) and 24 per cent for Femsa Cerveza, has been the fastest-growing part of Femsa’s business in recent years, with a compound annual earnings growth rate of 30 per cent between 2005 and 2008, according to Bernstein Research.It is opening 900 stores a year, a pace Mr Fernández claims Femsa can keep up for the next 4-5 years as it targets 12,000 stores by 2014.Femsa Cerveza, whose brands include Dos Equis and Sol, has been the weakest part of the business, with earnings declining 3 per cent between 2005 and 2008, although growth returned in 2009.Femsa decided to sell its beer business in 2008 following a spate of brewing industry consolidation that saw InBev acquire Anheuser-Busch, SABMiller merge its US beer operations with Molson Coors, and Scottish & Newcastle sold to Carlsberg and Heineken.The creation of AB InBev, now the world’s biggest brewer, “transformed the industry completely”, Mr Fernandez said, adding that Femsa realised it could not move fast enough to remain competitive due to its lack of international scale.The family-controlled company then made “the toughest decision in 120 years” and hired the investment bank Rothschild to advise it on strategic alternatives. After serious talks with several brewers – including SABMiller – it decided to sell Femsa Cerveza to Heineken in exchange for a 20 per cent equity stake in the Dutch group.Although Heineken will be in charge of running Femsa Cerveza, Femsa will have two seats on the Dutch group’s board. “We will be very interested members,” Mr Fernandez said, adding the Dutch group has already decided to push Dos Equis in Australia and the UK, and Sol in Russia.
54;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2010-02-16T10:28:03Z;Foster’s results lose their fizz;;Ian Johnston, chief executive of Foster’s, revealed on Tuesday that there had been no talks between the group’s senior ranks and Molson Coors since the US-Canadian brewer took indirect control of a 5 per cent stake in the Australian beer and wine group in 2008.“I think they are sitting there as a shareholder,” Mr Johnston said as Foster’s reported a larger-than-expected 14 per cent drop in first-half net profits to A$356m (US$318m).Last year, Peter Swinburn, chief executive of Molson Coors, predicted further consolidation in the global beer market, although he said the pace might slow as the industry digested a number of large deals.The Australian group is in the midst of a transformation programme under a new management team after structurally separating its poorly performing wine operations from its core beer business.However, Mr Johnston declined to put forward a timetable for a possible demerger of the wine business, as the group was still considering a range of options.Wine continued to drag on the group’s performance in the six months to December, with earnings before interest and tax down 62 per cent in North America and 76 per cent in Europe. The decline in Australian wine was pegged to 1.1 per cent, while Asia fell 25.6 per cent.Foster’s faces a wine glut in Australasia, tough market and economic conditions in the northern hemisphere and unfavourable exchange rate movements after a strong appreciation of the Australian dollar.“We are cautiously optimistic that the [US] wine industry is pretty close to hitting the bottom,” Mr Johnston said. Foster’s failed to make further impairment charges on the carrying value of its wine assets, contrary to some analysts’ forecast.Analysts added that Foster’s beer business had met expectations, with the Australian and Pacific beer operations increasing EBIT by 6.6 per cent to A$486m. However, Foster’s suffered from a small loss in market share.Mr Johnston said he was pleased with the progress of the group’s transformation programme but admitted a lot of work remained.“We recognise we have to pick up performance across our entire business,” he said.“Not all the benefits are coming through because of poor market conditions and exchange rates,” he said, adding that wine was well positioned once trading conditions improved.Net debt fell by A$394m to A$2.2bn at the end of 2009 compared with June 30, for a gearing ratio of 59 per cent.Foster’s shares closed 12 cents lower at A$5.44.
55;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2009-11-09T17:52:01Z;Brewing: Refreshing news for beer drinkers;;Last month, Femsa, Mexico’s second-largest brewer, announced it was “in discussions with several parties to explore opportunities involving its beer business”.The message was clear: Femsa Cerveza, as the company’s brewing arm is known, was for sale.The news ripped through a sector that has been outside the frenzy of consolidation that has swallowed up independent brewing companies around the world during the past few years.Two companies – Femsa Cerveza and the larger Grupo Modelo, which has a market share of roughly 57 per cent, control almost the entire Mexican market.While competition between them is strong, the duopoly has ensured that it is almost impossible to walk into a bar or restaurant and find a beer not produced by one of them.Moreover, both companies are still, essentially, family-owned – even though Anheuser-Busch Inbev (ABI), the brewing giant, owns 50.2 per cent of Grupo Modelo.So where are Femsa’s discussions likely to lead? And what does it mean for the country’s beer market, one of the world’s top 10?According to UBS, the investment bank, SABMiller is the only realistic contender to buy Femsa. One reason, it argues, is that it is the only international brewing company with the financial muscle to afford Femsa’s estimated price tag of about $7.5bn.This year, SABMiller said it could probably raise $4bn-$5bn from its ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) base alone. In addition, the company said in August that its shareholders would probably accept some equity issuance if prompted.Besides, it is an open secret that SABMiller has long been eyeing the Mexican market.Its rivals, by contrast, would probably face an array of obstacles in trying to acquire Femsa.For one thing, ABI’s stake in Grupo Modelo, which produces Corona Extra, the best-selling imported beer in the US, all but disqualifies it as a buyer because any such attempt would run up against Mexico’s anti-trust authorities.At the same time, Molson Coors, another global brewer, could prove too small to absorb Femsa.As for Heineken, which is already a partner of Femsa in the US and Brazil, most analysts believe that the company is more concerned with integrating previous acquisitions and paying down debt than with looking to buy new companies.Regardless of who ends up with Femsa, the deal is expected to lead to profound changes in the domestic beer market. For one thing, a purchase by an international company would almost certainly lead to an introduction of the purchasing company’s line of beers into the market.Until now, that has been hard to imagine: walk down any main street of any city, and you will see restaurants and bars with chairs, tables, parasols and awnings sporting either the colours of Corona Extra, Modelo’s leading brand, or of Sol, a beer made by Femsa.Customers are presented almost invariably with only one of the two families, and hardly ever an imported beer.Second, and perhaps more important, the purchase could spell much greater competition for Grupo Modelo.From his office in the hyper-modern Mexico City neighbourhood of Santa Fe, José Parés, is taking the news of Femsa’s possible sale in his stride.As vice-president for international markets at Grupo Modelo, he suggests that his company is not too concerned with the possible sale of Femsa: “We can see the competition, but our focus is on the consumer.”Yet many analysts believe that any deal involving Femsa could push ABI into a response.The international brewer has already expressed an interest in increasing its stake in Modelo, and some experts think that it is only a question of time before they try to do so. “It is the next logical move,” says Tomás Lajous, strategist at UBS in Mexico City.If he is right, the chances are that before long Mexicans will have a longer list of beers to choose from.
56;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2009-10-26T02:09:37Z;Family brewers sit alongside big brands;;Few brands are more immediately traceable to their birthplace than Newcastle Brown Ale, one of the UK’s more successful and recognisable global exports.The bottles of hoppy ale, emblazoned with a blue star logo and prominently displaying the name of their home city, are sold in 40 countries worldwide, with US sales outstripping those in the UK.But heritage is little defence against the trends that have rocked the UK brewing and pub sector over the past two decades since the 1989 Beer Orders restricted the number of tied pubs that could be owned by brewers.The consequent shift from brewer-owned chains to big independent pub companies, combined with brewery takeovers by global players, has reshaped the industry in one of its heartlands – north-east England and Yorkshire.Scottish & Newcastle, which makes Newcastle Brown and is now owned by Dutch group Heineken, is moving production from Gateshead to Tadcaster in North Yorkshire, to cut over-capacity and costs.Yorkshire has in some ways benefited from consolidation. Big multinationals have invested in modern facilities after takeovers, while a plethora of mid-sized family groups remain, as well as a new breed of small start-ups. The county, the UK’s biggest beer producer, has 70 breweries now, compared with 13 in the 1970s.The small town of Tadcaster has become an industry powerhouse. S&N took over Tadcaster-based John Smith’s, which remains Britain’s most popular bitter, with 1m pints a day downed. Molson Coors, the North American brewer that sells one in every five pints drunk in the UK, acquired a site from Bass and continues to use it to make a range of beers. Yorkshire’s oldest brewery, Samuel Smith, still turns out exceptional – and exceptionally cheap – ales delivered round the town by dray horses.Then there are award-winning producers such as Black Sheep and T&R Theakston in Masham, in the Yorkshire Dales, and Timothy Taylor in Keighley. The latter is investing £2.5m ($4.1m) to increase capacity from 60,000 to more than 75,000 barrels. Landlord, its biggest seller, is one of singer Madonna’s favourites. In its 150th anniversary year in 2008 turnover was £20.7m, up 7 per cent from £19.3m in 2007, but pre-tax profit fell from £3.6m to £3.1m as the price of crops, fuel and power increased.Twenty years ago, the north-east had S&N, Vaux, the Federation Brewery, Whitbread and Camerons, all big regional players serving hundreds of licensed premises.Today, only one of the one-time north-east brewing big five, Hartlepool-based Camerons, survives. S&N’s Newcastle site has been cleared for a Science City redevelopment, Vaux’s Sunderland site has been the subject of a decade-long planning wrangle and the Whitbread site in County Durham has been redeveloped for housing.Mergers in brewing are nothing new: the five points of the Brown Ale blue star represent the five long-defunct breweries that merged to create Newcastle Breweries, itself combined with Scottish Brewers in 1960 to create S&N. But Alistair Arkley, a former managing director of Camerons and a pubco entrepreneur who is one of the north’s best-known brewing-sector figures, says the Beer Orders forced the pace of change.In Yorkshire, Leeds is to lose its 187-year-old Tetley brand and 170 jobs in 2011, as owner Carlsberg, the Danish group, consolidates its operations.Yet dedicated cask-ale drinkers believe moving a beer affects its taste and distinctiveness. As public enthusiasm for local sourcing and authenticity grows, their argument is winning. While beer sales are down to their lowest levels since the 1930s and up to 40 pubs are closing a week, real ale is becoming more popular.There are successful newcomers with evocatively named, distinctively local brews, such as Black Grouse, Northern Kite and Venerable Bede, sometimes supplying their own pubs in an echo of the eclipsed big regional players.When Tetley shuts, the city’s brewing legacy will fall to Leeds Brewery, created in 2007 by two recent graduates with no experience of brewing – only drinking – and now producing 20,000 pints a week.“Consumers continue to turn away from the huge brands which are seeing their sales fall, while craft brewers are meeting the renewed appetite for local food and drink,” says Sam Moss, co-owner of the brewery, which uses the Leeds skyline on its marketing in an echo of Newcastle Brown. Charles Dent, of Timothy Taylor, says people want beers “brewed by brewers, not by computers”.…………………………………………………………………………….The self-funding picture grows clearer for KromekFor Kromek, a pioneer in digital colour and 3D X-ray imaging, this is a great stage in its corporate development, writes Chris Tighe in Newcastle.Having raised more than £3.5m in the current year in private equity investment, with more about to be announced, the materials technology and imaging specialist has begun trialling its anti-terrorist liquid scanning equipment at airports internationally. Manchester Airport is about to be added to the list.Turning a university spin-out in six years into a business with leading edge technology, a clear market strategy, a commercial product and a valuation by investors of £50m is no mean feat. Consequently, Arnab Basu, founder and chief executive, was this month named as Ernst & Young’s Young Entrepreneur of the Year for his “rare combination of intuitive commercial sense, pioneering technical expertise and a flair for motivating others”.Kromek, the trading name of Sedgefield-based Durham Scientific Crystals, has developed a reliable method of producing, from vapour, single crystals of cadmium telluride. These can be used as detectors of X and gamma rays. “We are taking the world of X-ray from black and white to colour, and analogue technology to digital,” Mr Basu says.The company’s technology, heavily patent-protected, has wide applications in security, medical, industrial inspection and defence markets. But, as a small company, it has to focus.It has just won a contract worth up to $4m (£2.4m) with the US Defence Threat Reduction Agency for detectors, allowing it fully funded entry to the defence market.But Kromek is having to self-fund its work in the airline security market, where better means of scanning liquids could help lift the restrictions on carrying liquids on board.It is, Mr Basu says, a classic case of a small company having to take the financial risk to win commercial acceptance for its products. Kromek expects to turn over several million pounds in the year to April 2010. Analysts have forecast £12m next year.
57;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2009-10-01T18:04:18Z;Molson points to further mergers;;Peter Swinburn, chief executive of Molson Coors, the US-Canadian brewer, says he expects further consolidation of the global beer market, “albeit at a slower pace” as the industry digests the impact of InBev’s acquisition of Anheuser-Busch and other big deals.In a video interview with FT.com, Mr Swinburn said he expected “an inevitable continuance of the consolidation”.“I think we’re probably going to see a slowdown for the immediate future, because obviously there’s been some big acquisitions and some big moves in the last two years, and people, I think, are trying to digest those moves,” he said.Molson Coors, the world’s fifth-largest brewer, was formed in 2005 from the merger of Canada’s Molson with the US Coors beer company.It subsequently linked up with SABMiller, the world’s second-largest brewer, in a US joint venture that combines the Coors and Miller beer brands.Outside North America, it has a strong presence in the UK, where it produces Carling.The company has also been seen as having a potential future interest in Foster’s, the Australian brewer, after taking indirect control of a 5 per cent share last year.Mr Swinburn said Molson Coors was also in a position financially to make acquisitions “if the right opportunities come up”, including the addition of smaller, niche brands to its existing portfolios in the US, Canada and the UK, such as the recent purchase of the Indian restaurant-focused Cobra beer brand in the UK.In the US, Mr Swinburn described demand as continuing to be “sluggish”, with consumers in some cases “trading down” to lower-cost beers such as Coors’ Keystone brand, and looking for promotional deals.But he argued that it was too early to tell whether consumer behaviour would be altered in the longer term by the economic recession of the past year.“I think the short answer is, nobody knows. If you look at history …the consumer usually comes back to their normal habits after about two years, but again I think it would be very foolish just to take that for granted.”
58;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2009-08-16T19:18:44Z;Foster’s wine demerger possible;;Foster’s could demerge its beer and wine operations within 12 months, paving the way for a possible takeover of the Australian group’s beer business.The company said six months ago it was not an “appropriate time” to sell or demerge its wine business, but it has structurally separated the poorly performing unit from its prized beer operations, which dominate the lucrative Australian market.Analysts believe Foster’s will reconsider its position as improved capital markets revive takeover activity.The wine business acts as a poison pill for would-be bidders for Foster’s beer business. SABMiller, the London-based brewer, and Japan’s Asahi are are seen as the most likely suitors.Canadian brewer Molson Coors, which has merged its US operations with SABMiller, speaks for about 5 per cent of Foster’s equity. However, the Canadian group is not thought to be a likely bidder and its holding is considered strategic in the event of an offer.Foster’s, which reports full-year results on August 25, has a market value of A$10.3bn (US$8.6bn). Merrill Lynch recently suggested the beer business had an enterprise value of some A$12bn due to its strong profits growth. Foster’s declined to comment.In the first half of its fiscal year, Foster’s Australian beer sales volumes rose 3.1 per cent, driven by growth in premium beers like Carlton Dry Fusion and Crown Lager, while Australian beer earnings rose 5.6 per cent.Martin Yule, analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes a full demerger of Foster’s beer and wine businesses could be achieved in 12 months. But he warned one hurdle to such a move would be the company’s almost $2bn in US dollar-denominated debt, which cannot be supported solely by its US wine assets.SABMiller, which has an Australian joint venture with bottler Coca-Cola Amatil called Pacific Ventures that sells premium beers, wants a stronger foothold in the Australian market. However, neither SABMiller nor CCA are interested in wine.Asahi Breweries, which held a stake in Foster’s in the 1990s, last year agreed to buy the Australian soft drinks business owned by the UK’s Cadbury for £550m ($909m).Additional reporting by Peter Smith in Sydney
59;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2009-07-14T16:40:20Z;Kirin-Suntory merger to spur consolidation;;Kirin confirmed on Tuesday it was in early merger talks with Suntory, its local rival, in a move that is likely to trigger further consolidation in Japan’s food and drinks sector.If the deal to combine Japan’s largest and second-largest food and drinks groups goes through, it will create an entity with revenues of Y3,820bn ($41bn) that could become a significant operator, particularly in Asia.The new group would be significantly smaller than global giants such as Nestlé or Unilever.However, it could become the first Japanese group in the food and drinks sector with sufficient scale to compete on the global stage with overseas peers such as PepsiCo and Anheuser-Busch InBev.The combined company would have annual beer sales by volume of about 56m hectolitres, according to Bloomberg data, making it the world’s sixth-largest brewer, behind Molson Coors and ahead of China’s Tsingtao.The discussions highlight a recognition on the part of Japanese companies that their long-term survival depends on them strengthening their position at home while at the same time expanding abroad.“The main objective is to create a stable cash cow in the domestic market and [use that as a basis to] invest in overseas markets,” said Hiroshi Saji, analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.Both Kirin and Suntory are considered winners in their sector.But the Japanese market for the beers and beverages that the two groups make “is not a market that will grow 10 per cent, 20 per cent, in future”, according to Suntory.Kirin said: “We have been saying for a while that we cannot expect top-line growth in the domestic market.”The problem that food and drinks makers face in Japan is not simply limited to the country’s ageing society, which is sapping demand for everything from cars to beer.Large retailers, themselves under pressure due to slow consumer demand, are using their purchasing power to drive down prices.This is particularly true in the soft drinks market, where fierce competition among more than 10 manufacturers gives the retailers an advantage over their suppliers.Against this backdrop, the potential synergies from a merger of Kirin and Suntory are compelling, analysts say.Suntory has a strong position in soft drinks, an area in which Kirin has struggled.Kirin’s operating profit margin on domestic soft drinks was a meagre 2 per cent, compared with more than 10 per cent for its beer and related products.“If Kirin were to focus on liquor businesses and Suntory on soft drinks, there would be potential for improved profitability at Kirin,” Taizo Demura, analyst at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, said in a report.Meanwhile, Kirin has an extensive distribution network in the Asia-Pacific region which it acquired through its investments in San Miguel Beer, the largest brewer in the Philippines, and in Lion Nathan, Australia’s second-largest brewing group.This network could be used to distribute Suntory’s products as well, such as its popular Brand’s health food products, said Mr Saji.A merger still faces considerable hurdles and both Kirin and Suntory emphasise that it is by no means certain where the talks will lead.Combining their operations would also raise anti-competitive issues, since together Kirin and Suntory would have almost 50 per cent of Japan’s market for beer and related products.Analysts say, however, that the very fact that Kirin and Suntory are talking will put pressure on rivals Asahi and Sapporo, Japan’s two other large beer and soft drinks companies, to review their strategies.Asahi has little option but to try and co-operate with Sapporo in beer, and with Coca-Cola, which could be unseated from its top position in soft drinks, said Mr Saji.Whatever they do, “they are now under pressure to take the next step” in their own growth strategies, Mr Saji added.

The restructuring comes after Cobra, which was put up for sale a year ago, struggled to find a buyer. Bankers said the privately-held group, which is not profitable, needed to find a way of generating cash.Mark Hunter, chief executive of Molson Coors UK, said the brand would have a much healthier financial position after transferring distribution to Molson Coors, which controls 20 per cent of the UK beer market.The venture does not include Cobra’s Indian operations, which will remain owned by Cobra’s existing shareholders.
61;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2009-04-24T22:34:52Z;Cask ale gives pubs reason to cheer;;Cask ales, for years a minority taste, are proving a surprise tipple of choice as the national appetite for locally sourced produce helps to compensate for a dramatic decline in lager sales.After swallowing a 2 per cent rise in alcohol duty in Alistair Darling’s Budget, brewers and pub operators will next week reveal the extent of their recession-fuelled suffering. New industry figures will show that beer consumption is declining at the fastest rate since Labour came to power in 1997.With lager accounting for nearly three-quarters of all beer consumed in the UK, the decline is hitting the industry’s staple product hardest.It will be of small comfort to pub operators that their bête noire, the supermarket, which undercut them with deep discounting on popular lagers, is feeling the brunt of this spending fall. Next week’s figures from the British Beer and Pub Association will show a double-digit decline in beer sales in supermarkets and off-licences for the first time. That is almost double the rate of decline in pubs.But amid industry gloom, a ray of light has emerged in the shape of Britons’ rediscovery of cask ales, a product drinkers cannot get in a supermarket. Industry experts attribute the rise in demand to the fact that the product, in contrast to mass-produced lager, has the clear provenance modern consumers crave.Marston’s, which owns five breweries and specialist beer brands such as Marston’s, Banks’s, and Brakspear as well as operating more than 2,000 pubs, said earlier this month that sales volumes had been improving, in part due to the “increasing popularity” of regional cask ales.“Our portfolio of ale brands can benefit from the longer-term growth in eating out in pubs and the strong demand from the local free trade for premium ale beers,” said Ralph Findlay, chief executive.Compare his view with that of Dutch brewer Heineken – now Britain’s biggest brewer following its acquisition of Scottish & Newcastle’s UK business last year – which this week blamed “the global economic downturn, unfavourable weather, the continued effect of smoking bans, distributor destocking, excise duty increases and selling price increases” for falling beer sales volumes.Camra, the Campaign for Real Ale, claims cask ale is outperforming the beer market. Sales may have declined last year but they have done so at about half the rate of other beers. Its share of the on-trade beer market is now 13 per cent.Cask ale producers have been borrowing some of the marketing tools used by the lager producers, with women the new target audience. But, according to Julian Grocock of the Society of Independent Brewers, the real impact came with the introduction of progressive beer duty in 2002, which made cask ale production more economically attractive.“Back then, there were around 200 to 300 independent brewers. Now our membership alone is 460 strong,” he said.Cask ale growth gives beleaguered pub operators some limited respite. “It is good to see a revival in cask ale sales,” said Giles Thorley, chief executive of Punch Taverns. “The real losers are the national brewers’ ale brands – it is the good-quality regional brewers who have filled the gap.”The pubs could also benefit from a resurgence in lager producers’ marketing activity.Coors Brewers, Britain’s second-biggest brewer and the owner of the Carling brand, is in the process of sending invitations to some 7m households, offering some of them free pints or half pints of Carling at their local pub.“People are less pessimistic . . . they are recognising that one of life’s simple pleasures is just to go out and share a beer with friends,” said Mark Hunter, chief executive of Coors Brewers.Brewers say lager sales are “polarising”, as people choose either expensive or cheap brands.Miller Brands, the UK group owned by SABMiller, said sales volumes have risen 20 per cent over the past six months even as overall beer sales volumes have declined.“We are seeing a trend by the consumer to either trade up to premium products or trade down to value ones,” the brewer said, adding volumes of its Peroni Nastro Azzurro brand had risen 40 per cent in the past six months, while volumes of Pilsner Urquell had grown by nearly 20 per cent.
62;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2009-04-19T19:56:02Z;Wilbur Ross and Molson Coors eye Cobra;;Wilbur Ross, the US investor, and Molson Coors, the brewer, have emerged as possible buyers for Cobra Beer as the sale process of the Indian-themed lager draws near to a close.Cobra, which was founded by Lord Bilimoria in the late 1980s to introduce UK drinkers to an “authentic” Indian beer, has been looking for a buyer since last summer.It has been hoping to receive as much as £185m for the group, which is not profitable.The privately-held company initially attracted interest from Diageo but the distiller decided the brand was not suitable for its beer portfolio. It also struggled to attract interest from big brewers such as SABMiller.However, Mr Ross and Molson Coors, which owns the Carling and Coors Light brand, could split the company. If Coors takes Cobra’s UK assets, Mr Ross could pick up the group’s Indian business.Mr Ross, whose firm WL Ross & Co. specialises in buying distressed assets, has an office in Mumbai.Molson Coors and Mr Ross declined to comment.The UK is Cobra’s main market, accounting for 71 per cent of total sales volumes. Just over one-third of UK sales are made through restaurants.In 2008, the company had net sales of £28m in the UK, and £5m in India.The brand is not a top 10 lager brand in the UK, although it has improved its ranking in recent years, moving to 14th in 2008 from 21st in 2006, according to market research group Nielsen.Lord Bilimoria owns 64 per cent of Cobra. The remainder is held by the Och-Ziff investment group, employees and other investors.
63;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2009-04-05T21:30:47Z;MBAs face employment lesson;;"It is just over a year ago that Martin Bustarret left Insead, MBA in hand, to work for International SOS, the global healthcare company. At the time, the world economic meltdown barely cast a shadow over the recruitment process.At International SOS’s headquarters in Singapore, Mr Bustarret (pictured), a Frenchman, is in charge of developing large medical projects, often supporting oil or mining corporations when they move into a new region, supplying doctors, nurses and medicine. In the past year, he has spent about 25 per cent of his time travelling, as far afield as Indonesia, Ghana and Liberia.One of the elements of the job he enjoys most relates to the additional social requirements as part of the mining or drilling concession – healthcare education or malaria prevention.For Mr Bustarret, two factors attracted him to the Singapore-headquartered company: it was a truly international company, with 60 offices worldwide; and he wanted to “work in a company that makes sense, that makes a contribution”.While Mr Bustarret, who claims he was never cut out to be a management consultant or a banker, chose International SOS as his favoured recruiter, many MBAs graduating this summer who did believe they were destined for those two professions will look at Mr Bustarret with envy.For as the bulk recruiters from finance and consultancy rein in their plans, many MBA students will have to make compromises in three areas in order to get a job. First, many will have to rethink the geography of where they work, looking at areas such as Asia and the Middle East rather than the US or Europe.Second, they may have to take a job in a small or medium-sized company rather than the huge partnership or conglomerate they had expected. And third, they may have to look at lower-paying industries.The business schools are laying on a special welcome this year for smaller companies, says Marianne Wisheart, head of human resources at Power Advocate, the energy consultancy. “It’s really exciting. The schools have been rolling out the red carpet.”As a company with 75 employees, such a welcome at the US’s top business schools is a novel experience. “We’ve been able to penetrate some of the top-tier schools that we haven’t been able to recruit from before,” says Ms Wisheart.Though a small company, 30 per cent of employees have an MBA and others have technical masters degrees. Successful applicants will probably take up jobs in management or supply chain management in the privately owned company, which gives share options as part of the pay packet.Pay will certainly be an issue for many graduates this year. At Molson Coors Brewing in the UK, which is one of the companies looking at recruiting MBAs at London Business School for the first time, salaries will not compare to those offered last year in the City. But Richard Bradley, head of client services at Alexander Mann, to which the brewer outsources its UK recruitment, says successful candidates should be able to see a 25 per cent increase on the salaries they earned before their degree. In the longer term, the MBA should give them the ability to rise rapidly through the company, he says.Though many companies are able to recruit MBAs for the first time, they will still have specific requirements. Power Advocacy, for example, will be looking for those with an engineering or technical background; International SOS will require a global mindset.Mario Ferraro, general manager for international human resources at International SOS, says a growing number of schools are providing global managers. “We see from one year to the next that business schools are more able to provide these (global managers).”Mr Bustarret’s advice to MBAs graduating this year is to be realistic. “You can’t change industry, location and type of job all at once. What I would advise is, be sure of your strengths and build on that.”"
64;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2009-02-17T08:11:26Z;Foster’s to keep struggling wine business;;Foster’s, the Australian drinks group, has ruled out selling its wine business after a lengthy review and will instead separate the underperforming business from core beer operations.The move, outlined as Foster’s reported a 3 per cent rise in first-half profits to A$411m ($262m), reverses the previous strategy under Trevor O’Hoy, former chief executive, who stood down last year.Mr O’Hoy helped turn Foster’s into a diversified drinks group, which included spending A$6.8bn to create the world’s second-largest wine business. However, he was criticised for paying inflated prices for assets such as Southcorp, the wine group.On top of previous goodwill impairment charges for its wine business, Foster’s on Tuesday warned of further non-cash writedowns of up to A$250m in its full year, taking total writedowns to close to A$1bn.It also warned of other charges amounting to up to A$165m, and 300 job losses.The shares closed 5 cents lower at A$5.20.Ian Johnston, chief executive, said retaining wine was not a second-best option, although a lot of hard work was needed to get the business to improve.The efforts of Foster’s to find a buyer for wine had been hampered by difficult conditions in the financial markets.He said: “We have confessed it has underperformed our expectations. But this is a good business, with global brands in Australia and North America and it is profitable and throwing off cash.”He said the wine business had suffered from poor execution in the Americas and from the abandoned “multi-beverage” model where sales of different beverages were combined under one sales and marketing team.Foster’s is looking to sell up to 36 low-quality vineyards, covering 5,000 hectares, and shut three wineries. The company lost one vineyard and part of another in February’s bush fires in Victoria.Molson Coors Brewing, the North American beer company, said in November 2008 it had built a more than 5 per cent stake in Foster’s. Mr Johnston said on Tuesday he had had no talks with Molson and was unclear about its intentions towards the Australian group.Foster’s said its beer, cider and spirits operations in Australia, Asia and the Pacific had performed strongly in the opening six months. Net beer sales revenue in Australia rose 6.2 per cent.However, spirits and ready-to-drink mixed drinks suffered from a rise in excise tax.Mr Johnston said: “We’ve seen a strong comeback in Australian beer with underlying volume up more than 3 per cent for the half and we finished the year with about a 52 per cent value share of the Australian beer market”.The small rise in first-half profits, which did not include the forecast writedowns, benefited from favourable currency movements. The company also said its balance sheet was strong and interest cover on its debt was covered about eight times by profits.Foster’s did not provide guidance on expected full-year earnings.
65;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2009-02-10T22:19:47Z;US brewers;;"First you cry into your beer, then you stop drinking it. In good times, beer consumption tracks real economic output. In bad, beer volumes take a while to react, but stagnate for longer than the economy. Citigroup points out that after global economic growth troughed in 1991, beer volume growth was nonexistent in 1992 and 1993.In the mature US market, where growth is low in any case, that may not matter: reporting fourth quarter 2008 numbers on Tuesday for its joint venture with Molson Coors, SABMiller forecast growth in American beer volumes of 0.5 per cent this year.Instead, the key factor for profits is pricing and the extent to which consumers trade down.However, the evidence that they have done so is mixed. The large brewers successfully raised prices in the fourth quarter as they continued to feel the effects of last year’s packaging and raw material cost inflation. But soft Miller Lite volumes were attributed to Americans cutting back on eating out. Growth has also stalled in some areas of the import market, particularly for Heineken.The big unknown is how Anheuser-Busch’s new owners will behave. Smaller competitors will start to discount if volumes soften over the summer. Corona has already started to cut prices and, as it is opening the world’s largest brewery this year, will probably continue to do so. Budweiser of old would not tolerate any loss of market share. But with about $16bn of debt to refinance over the next two years, and $1bn of cost savings to extract, A-B InBev may be reluctant to start a price war. The managers of the MillerCoors joint venture, also looking for $500m of cost savings, probably feel the same.Still, both aim to be more efficient in three years time and will then be looking for ways to increase market share. Relying on both sides to pull their punches is not a strong argument for resilient profits.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

sector bail-out fund.The sell-off worsened as Mr Geithner spoke and continued throughout the day. Senate approval of the economic stimulus bill failed to halt the widespread decline, which wiped out much of the previous week’s strong gains.“There was a very long drum roll leading up to this,” said Stephen Wood, senior portfolio strategist at Russell Investments. “It didn’t happen.”Financials led the retreat, hurt by persistent fears of outright nationalisation of key institutions in which equity holders would be wiped out. The sector lost 10.9 per cent overall.JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, now the two largest US banks by market capitalisation, fell 9.8 per cent to $24.62, and 14.2 per cent to $16.35, respectively.Bank of America dropped 19.3 per cent to $5.56, while Citigroupdropped 15.2 per cent to $3.35.Regional banks – key winners in the previous session – suffered some of the heaviest losses. Insurers also did particularly badly, off 9.1 per cent overall on concerns of the need for fresh capital raising.Standard & Poor’s and Fitch cut their credit ratings on Hartford Financial Services, which fell 13.2 per cent to $13.05.Lincoln National fell 18.9 per cent to $14.42 after the group reported its first loss in six years and Moody’s warned it may cut its credit ratings.The S&P 500 closed down 4.9 per cent at 827.16, paring the gains since President Obama’s inauguration day to just 2.7 per cent.The benchmark index stands 4.8 per cent below its 50-day moving average and less than 10 cent away from an 11-year low hit last November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 4.6 per cent weaker at 7,888.88 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 4.2 per cent lower at 1,524.73. The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, leapt 6.9 per cent to 46.7.Traders had remained reluctant to place bearish bets on banks before the administration unveiled its plans. But all 10 sectors were sharply in the red on Tuesday. Commodity stocks gave the market some support early in the session but finished sharply lower. The material and energy sectors finished off 4.5 per cent and 4.7 per cent, respectively.Alcoa was one of the highest profile victims outside the financial sector, pushed 10 per cent lower to $7.65 after S&P cut the aluminium producer’s credit rating to the lowest investment grade.Meanwhile, a glut of other downbeat developments once again underscored the extent of the recession and the toll it was taking on US corporations.Food retailers were sold off after Citigroup highlighted the risk of a “modern day price war” and cut its target price on a host of stocks in the sector. Safeway shed 6.4 per cent to $20.50 after Deborah Weinswig, analyst, downgraded her recommendation on the stock to “sell”.Commerce Department data showed US wholesale inventories fell by a record 1.4 per cent in December, twice as much as forecast.Meanwhile, General Motors unveiled proposals to cut 10,000 salaried jobs and impose pay cuts on other workers as part of its restructuring plan. GM shares fell 4.6 per cent to $2.70.Molson Coors lost 7.9 per cent to $37.30 after the brewer disclosed worse-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.Only nine S&P 500 stocks found positive territory. Among them, Qwest jumped 2.4 per cent to $3.45 on well-received results, but the telecoms sector took scant comfort from its figures, off 4.8 per cent overall.Intercontinental-Exchange edged 1.3 per cent lower to $61.44. Investors had looked beyond a 24 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profit to focus on a jump in commissions but the shares succumbed late in the session. The sell-off also took in erstwhile defensive consumer stocks such as Procter & Gamble, off 2.8 per cent to $51.45."
67;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2009-01-14T18:16:47Z;Sense of loss at pioneer’s downfall;;The talk over coffee on Wednesday morning at Red Barn Capital, a Toronto portfolio manager, was all about Nortel Networks’ bankruptcy filing.Lyle Stein, Red Barn’s chief executive said: “There’s a real sense of loss. Our first sense is, isn’t it sad?”Many other Canadians feel similar emotions over the downfall of one of their country’s most celebrated companies.Brahm Eiley, president of Convergence Consulting, a Toronto-based technology adviser, said: “They developed technology that really transformed telecoms around the world”.What’s more, he said: “Everybody I know owned Nortel stock at some point.”The company traces its origins to the Bell Telephone Company of Canada which, together with its US counterpart, received the patent rights for the telephone from Alexander Graham Bell in the late 19th century.As Northern Electric and later Northern Telecom, Nortel pioneered the switches, routers and fibre-optic cable that dramatically enhanced the capabilities of telephone networks, setting the stage for the internet era.Its customers have included many of the world’s leading telecoms companies.Nortel also became a staple of Canadian investment portfolios, especially after Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE) spun off a 39 per cent stake in 2000.At the height of the technology boom, Nortel shares made up a third of the value of the Toronto stock exchange. Its dominance forced the exchange to cap the contribution of any one company to its main index.The shares reached a peak of C$1,230 in March 2000, taking into account a subsequent 10-for-one consolidation. They were trading at 38.5 cents prior to the bankruptcy filing.In other ways too, Nortel is a shadow of its former self. Its workforce has shrunk from a peak of 96,000 to about 26,000.The coming restructuring is widely expected to result in Nortel’s being broken up and sold to its rivals, depriving Canada of yet another corporate champion.Tony Clement, Canada’s industry minister, said on Wednesday that the government “appreciates the importance of the telecommunications industry to our economy and will continue to work with Nortel during its restructuring”.Over the past decade, foreigners have swallowed many of the country’s best-known companies, such as miners Inco, Alcan and Falconbridge, the Hudson’s Bay department store chain, and the two brewers, Molson and Labatt.Among the few that remain are Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, and Bombardier, the train and aircraft manufacturer.Politicians have come under pressure to take a more active role in slowing the “hollowing-out” of corporate Canada. The current Conservative government blocked the sale last year of Vancouver-based MacDonald Dettwiler, an aerospace technology group, to a US weapons maker.Noting that the Toronto exchange was now dominated by banks and other financial services groups, Red Barn’s Mr Stein said: “We’ve gone the way of many smaller-tier markets”.
68;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2008-12-11T01:03:42Z;Cobra ready to split UK and Indian businesses;;Cobra Beer, the Indian-themed lager brand, is prepared to split its UK and Indian businesses and sell them to separate buyers as its founder, Lord Bilimoria, seeks £185m ($274m) for the group.Lord Bilimoria, who owns almost two-thirds of Cobra, is selling the brand after Diageo showed interest in it during the summer.Talks with Diageo over the distiller taking a minority share fell apart, prompting Cobra to consider other buyers.Lord Bilimoria said: “We are proactively now approaching all the major drinks companies in the world”.Cobra will this week distribute information memorandums to trade and financial buyers stressing they can either bid for the full business, or for its UK and Indian arms separately. It will consider both cash and equity offers.Analysts say SABMiller could be a buyer for the whole business, given its strength in India (where it owns the Foster’s brand and is the country’s second biggest brewer) and strategy of developing international premium brands. Diageo declined to comment on whether it would look again at Cobra.Cobra has brewed beer in India, which contributes about one third of total sales volumes, since 2005 from nine breweries. It has a 1 per cent share of the Indian beer market.A potential Indian buyer could be the UB Group, which owns Kingfisher, India’s biggest beer brand. The group, run by billionaire businessman Vijay Mallya, is also in talks with Diageo over the sale of a stake in its United Spirits business.Cobra built its British business in Indian restaurants but has diversified into sales through supermarkets and pubs. Restaurants today account for about 40 per cent of sales, with one-third derived from supermarkets.Molson Coors might be interested in the UK business but analysts say other brewers, such as Heineken, Carlsberg and Anheuser-Busch InBev, are tied up integrating acquisitions.Lord Bilimoria said he would like to keep a small stake in Cobra if possible. “Ideally I’d love to be able to carry on with a role in the business and keep a small share.” He owns 64 per cent of Cobra. The remainder is held by the Och-Ziff investment group, employees and other investors.Group net sales for the year ending in July were £33.6m, with some £28m from the UK (where it contracts out brewing and does not own any breweries) and the remainder from India. Cobra is not profitable.

Citigroup shed 6.6 per cent to $8.89 after unveiling plans to cut 52,000 jobs, which, according to consultants Challenger Gray & Christmas, was the biggest job cut announcement since the 60,000 by IBM in 1993.The bleak news, coupled with mounting signs of global recession, overshadowed any developments at the G20 meeting.Still, the market pared early losses as investors hunted for bargains in the energy, material and industrial sectors and briefly entered positive territory.Jeffrey Kleintop, strategist at LPL Financial, said there was a “tug of war” between poor economic developments and some signs of improvement in credit markets.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished down 2.6 per cent at 850.75 points after a sharp sell-off into the close, near the session’s lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.6 per cent at 8,273.58 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index 2.3 per cent at 1,482.05.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, edged 4.2 per cent higher to 69.10, which continued to indicate elevated signs of distress.Elsewhere in financials, Bank of America slid 8.5 per cent to $15.03 after the group said it would increase its stake in China Construction Bank from 10.75 per cent to 19.1 per cent.Investors brushed aside a better-than-expected reading on industrial production – output rose 1.3 per cent last month, according to the Federal Reserve – as downward revisions to prior figures offset the rare positive news.RDQ Economics said the data were in any case primarily a result of “post-hurricane rebounds” and Bank of New York Mellon called the increase a “dead-cat bounce”.Official confirmation that the Japanese economy had entered recession increased concerns that the global downturn was spreading.Construction groups came under pressure after separate data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed manufacturing in New York contracted in November at the fastest pace since records began in 2001. Caterpillar lost 3.4 per cent to $35.70.General Motors jumped 5.7 per cent to $3.18 on mounting hopes Washington would grant aid to the car industry, although Ford eased 4.4 per cent to $1.72.In earnings news, Lowe’s and Target became the latest retailers to disclose sharp falls in third-quarter profit.Yet the figures were not quite as dire as analysts feared and shares in the former rose 4.2 per cent to $18.99.Target lost 4.1 per cent to $31.68 after management warned that the discounter’s gross margin performance might not be repeated in the fourth quarter.Also in the consumer sector, McDonald’s edged 0.9 per cent lower to $55.61 even after UBS upgraded its recommendation on the fast food group from “neutral” to “buy”. The bank said it was encouraged by the group’s “ongoing strong global trends amid a deteriorating global consumer environment”.In technology, Dell fell 3.4 per cent to $10.52 after Merrill Lynch downgraded its recommendation on the computer maker from “buy” to “neutral” ahead of results due this week, owing to lower than expected demand.Walt Disney lost 6.4 per cent to $19.74 after Soleil Securities cut its recommendation on the theme-park operator and media group from “buy” to “hold”.United Parcel Service was up 0.3 per cent at $53.28 even after the delivery group declined to forecast its peak day for holiday shipping, breaking with a long-standing practice in the industry. An uncertain economy made prediction too difficult, it said.Alcohol, tobacco and casino stocks received a boost after Merrill Lynch issued a bullish outlook on the so-called vice sectors.“Consumers do not kick their habits in tough economic times,” said Merrill.Still, brewer Molson Coors shed 2 per cent to $41.71.Energy was one of several sectors to find positive territory earlier in the session, but finished down 1.6 per cent overall as crude oil settled just above $55 a barrel.
70;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US beer industry;;Cold, refreshing, helps you forget – the charms of beer are pretty recession-proof. However, what was a lifestyle choice when consumers were flush with cash rapidly becomes an overpriced foreign beer as wallets close. So it seems that one of the trends in beer drinking that has predominated for almost a decade – growth in premium imported brands – has begun to turn.Local brewers are doing fine. On Thursday Anheuser-Busch, for instance, reported decent volumes and its management indicated that price per barrel is expected to be up 4 per cent for the year. That followed solid numbers from Molson Coors in its North American businesses on Wednesday. But the supermarket trade data from AC Nielsen released in October indicate that Heineken’s premium import brands have shown volume declines since the summer.That shift mirrors the experience of brewers elsewhere. Markets that have been expanding at a heady pace are reacting more sharply to economic slowdown. Formerly thirsty South African, Brazilian and Russian beer drinkers are balking at price rises. Beer makers in the US, used to plodding along, have less to lose. Chastened by the price war of three years ago, aggressive attempts to take share are unlikely. Meanwhile, the system of separate distributors means brewers are relatively indifferent to whether consumers are drinking in bars or at home – unlike European peers hit by harsh retail competition.Empire building still predominates, of course. Molson Coors’ decision to buy a 5 per cent interest in Foster’s, may presage an eventual bid for the beer business. The Molson and Coors families may also be attempting to bulk up before bowing to the inevitable – absorption into their joint venture partner SABMiller. Meanwhile, InBev is on course to take over Anheuser. The Belgian brewer has undoubtedly overpaid, but with the US market showing rare resilience, its decision to buy may be prescient after all.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
71;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2008-11-05T23:49:20Z;Molson reveals 5% stake in Foster’s;;Molson Coors Brewing, the North American beer company, has declared its interest in a potential takeover or break-up of Foster’s after admitting it had quietly built a stake of nearly 5 per cent in the Australian beer and wine group.“Foster’s has not been informed of the precise extent of Molson Coors’ interest in the company nor their intentions with respect to that interest,” the Australian group said in a statement in Australia early Thursday.Deutsche Bank in September disclosed it had built up a 5.26 per cent stake in Foster’s but declined to name on whose behalf it had acquired the holding. Molson has taken ownership of most of that stake after entering a swap arrangement with the German investment bank.Foster’s has been preparing its takeover defences for months amid expectations that the sale or demerger of its poorly performing wine operations would lead to a scramble for its coveted beer operations. It is working with Goldman Sachs JB Were, the Australian affiliate of the US investment bank, on its defence plan.Foster’s shares closed at A$5.85 on Tuesday in Australia, giving the group a market value of A$11bn (US$7.5bn). Analysts estimate that Foster’s beer assets could be worth close to A$12bn.Wine has always been regarded as a so-called “poison pill” and its sale would liberate the business, a person close to the situation told the FT.Ian Johnston, the former Cadbury Schweppes executive, took the helm at Foster’s this year after Trevor O’Hoy, his predecessor, took the fall for the group’s ill-fated foray into wine.Foster’s said last month it was running late with its strategic review into the wine business but hoped to complete the process in the coming months before announcing the details to the market early next year.Molson would be expected to face competition if its decided to bid for Foster’s from North American, Asian and European brewing companies.Analysts believe that SABMiller, the London-based brewer, would be a strong contender to bid for the beer brands if they were put on the auction block.SABMiller already owns the Foster’s brand in India and has a joint venture with Foster’s to brew and sell the brand in the US.SABMiller already has a presence in Australia via its joint venture with Coca-Cola Pacific Ventures, which is building a brewery on the country’s east coast.The venture sells SABMiller’s international brands, including Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Pilsner Urquell and Miller Genuine Draft, and last year bought Bluetongue, a boutique brewery.Foster’s beer brands inlcude upmarket brands such as Cascade and Crown Lager as well as mainstream brands Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 5.1 per cent lower at 9,139.27 points, while the Nasdaq Composite index ended its six-session winning streak, down 5.5 per cent at 1,681.64 points.The technology sector came under heavy pressure, down 5.5 per cent ahead of results due after the bell from Cisco, which fell 5.1 per cent to $17.39.Yahoo climbed 4.3 per cent to $13.92 on hopes it could reach a deal with Microsoft, which fell 6.2 per cent to $22.08. Google lost 6.7 per cent to $342.24 after walking away from a potential search advertising partnership with Yahoo in the face of antitrust concerns.Worse than expected results from bond insurers MBIA and Ambac Financial, which sank 22 per cent to $8.16 and 40.9 per cent to $2.01, respectively, weighed on the financial sector.Financials led the declines in the stock market, with the sector down 8.8 per cent. Banks were sold off particularly sharply.Falling production at ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, put pressure on the materials sector, which stood 6.4 per cent lower. Nucor and US Steel shed 10.5 per cent to $35.50 and 8.3 per cent to $37.75, respectively.As preparations began for the new administration, which will take office in January, traders speculated over which sectors stood to win and lose from the so-called Obama effect.General Motors fell 2.8 per cent at $5.56 amid serious doubts over the survival of GMAC’s mortgage unit. It had been up as much as 7 per cent on speculation GMAC’s poor financial performance could strengthen the carmaker’s case for further government assistance, coupled with a more sympathetic stance from the new administration.US energy independence was one of the most talked about issues of the presidential campaign and the sector was in sharp focus. Coal and consumable fuel was one of the worst performing areas, down 9.9 per cent.ExxonMobil and Chevron fell 4.9 per cent to $73.69 and 4.2 per cent to $74.88 amid fears of a so-called windfall tax, although analysts said low energy prices made that a distant threat. Oil prices fell again.The solar power sector was down sharply in spite of the prospect of renewed government focus on renewable energy. A profit warning from SunPower, which dropped 34.7 per cent to $32.99, dragged the sector lower.Chesapeake Energy bucked the downward trend, it was up 8.2 per cent to $24.83 even after Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, cut its ratings further into junk territory.Traders “pounced” on speculation of a possible bid from BP, said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers.Some healthcare companies also gained. MedcoHealth Solutions, the prescription drug administrator, and Hospira, the medication delivery group, jumped
9.1 per cent to $41.47 and 6.8 per cent to $30.60, respectively, on the back of well received quarterly earnings.Market futures had been little changed as US television networks declared victory for the Democratic candidate on Tuesday evening, but stocks fell once trading started on Wednesday.In spite of the market declines, analysts broadly welcomed the clear victory that avoided the much-feared disputes of recent elections.Tom Elliott, strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, issued a bullish outlook for the market as the president-elect had “the opportunity to take the
US forward to a brighter future”.Bill Flaig, chief investment officer at Arrow Funds, had said: “It’s a ‘buy the rumour, sell the fact’ type of market.“The economic data will largely dictate what happens next.”In earnings news, Molson Coors Brewing climbed 8.3 per cent to $41.78 on the back of well-received results."
73;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2008-10-14T19:39:48Z;US sales fall at SABMiller;;SABMiller, the brewer, warned that a deteriorating global economy and weakening consumer demand has made its prospects for the next six months “increasingly uncertain”.Although total lager volumes were 3 per cent higher in the six months to September, SABMiller experienced slowdowns in North America and South Africa, two of the company’s largest markets, which together account for roughly half of total group revenues.Volumes at Miller Brewing Company – SABMiller’s US division, which combined with Coors in July to form MillerCoors – were down 2 per cent in the three months to July.In South Africa, lager volumes were down 1 per cent in the six-month period, although there was some respite from sales of soft drinks, volumes of which increased 2 per cent.Russia and the Czech Republic were two other weak spots, where volumes shrank by 4 and 5 per cent respectively.However, there was some comfort for the brewer. First, it could point to high comparables from the previous year, when global lager volumes surged 9 per cent.Second, due to the company’s global reach, there are still pockets of growth in Asia, Africa, Latin America and even parts of Europe. In Poland, Lech beer helped propel volumes up 4 per cent, while thirsty Romanians drank 24 per cent more of the company’s products.“We’re quite fortunate because we have such a wide geographical spread,” said SABMiller, which brews Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Pilsener Urquell. “In some of our markets like Africa [excluding South Africa], the effect of the current economic crisis will not be felt until a lot further into the future, if ever.”Shares in SABMiller closed down 20p at 950p.
74;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2008-09-30T09:34:31Z;Me and my adviser: Expansive brewer in a toast to its lawyers;;"John Davidson, the Scotsman who oversees SABMiller’s global M&A deals, became the brewer’s company secretary and general counsel two years ago after “the longest job interview in history”.“I knew for a while that my predecessor was looking to retire,” Mr Davidson says from the London office of Lovells, the law firm he worked at for 25 years. “I got a call from him to say that Graham Mackay [SABMiller’s chief executive] would call on Monday and offer me a job.”Mr Davidson knew SABMiller well because he had advised the company while at Lovells on many of its big deals, including the acquisitions of US brewer Miller in 2002 and Colombian brewer Bavaria in 2005.During that time, he also got to know Andrew Pearson, a Lovells partner who joined the firm in 1998 and who started working on SABMiller projects almost straight away. Today, he is SABMiller’s so-called “relationship partner”, which means he is responsible for keeping the brewer happy. “You are the port of call if there are any issues,” Mr Pearson says.Today, the two men work closely together on SABMiller’s deals, this year completing a joint venture between the brewer and Molson Coors in the US and Puerto Rico which merged their businesses.Lovells was involved only peripherally in the US anti-trust process, but handled the European merger clearance process.The lawyers say that getting US anti-trust approval for the deal was “a long hard slog” (it received a so-called “second request” for additional information from the Department of Justice). The deal was closely scrutinised by regulators because it involved paring the US’s three biggest brewers – Anheuser-Busch (recently acquired by InBev), SABMiller and Molson Coors – down to two.After the deal was finally approved in June (with SABMiller having submitted initial documents in November 2007) the company was told its “document discovery” process was the biggest ever undertaken for a big anti-trust investigation.At one point during the process (which took 80 days), SABMiller had 250 attorneys a day reviewing more than 250,000 documents, or some 21.6m pages. It sent the government more than 7.5m pages of material and more than one terabyte (1,000 gigabytes) of electronic material.Information given to the Department of Justice included details of all the factories owned by SABMiller globally that make products sold in the US; copies of distributor agreements; data on production costs, advertising, price discounts and sports sponsorships.Nevertheless, Mr Davidson says the deal was stimulating intellectually because the partners needed to work out how the joint venture would operate commercially in the future without favouring one partner over the other, particularly since SABMiller would be competing with Molson Coors outside the US and Puerto Rico.Thinking more commercially is one of the challenges of his new job. He says the biggest difference between being a partner at a law firm and being a general counsel – a new position at SABMiller – and the company secretary is having to think about “commercial objectives”.“Being the company secretary and the conscience of the board is a whole new challenge for me …when the CEO says: ‘What do you think about this?’ you’ve got to have an answer.”It is a “lonelier” job than working in a legal partnership, he adds. “It’s easy to talk glibly about the collegiality of a partnership but it is actually quite tangible and quite real …there is a huge sense of common purpose and comradeship …the ability just to wander next door and say, ‘I’ve got this problem, what do you think?’ and chew it over with someone …As general counsel, you’re actually on your own at the top.”Still, Mr Davidson and Mr Pearson retain a close relationship. They see each other socially – they live in the same town – and say they resolve any differences of opinion amicably.These have included Lovells spending more time than expected on certain jobs – and consequently billing the brewer more than expected. SABMiller also sometimes asks that a particular lawyer or team of lawyers be assigned to particular tasks.Mr Pearson claims SABMiller treats their external advisers as “part of a team” rather than “external add-ons”.“That engenders a real sense of commitment,” he says, adding he almost feels like “an external general counsel”.He explains that this is unusual, because most companies tend to keep their legal advisers more at arm’s length, and do not include them as early on in deals as SABMiller does.“Other clients, if they were doing a deal in Colombia, might ask their UK firm to identify the best Colombian law firm to do the job and then go off and instruct them, and you might not hear any more about it.”Although Mr Davidson does not get involved in day-to-day legal matters in Colombia or other countries, he does bring in Lovells for cross-border deals to work alongside Colombian lawyers (whom he describes as “very well trained …they all have US masters degrees and have worked for major Wall Street firms”.)Mr Pearson says SABMiller reflects a new breed of international companies that need experienced global advisers. “We often find ourselves playing the ‘international counsel’ role in which we liaise with and co-ordinate with local law firms.”"
75;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2008-08-04T18:41:20Z;Beer industry savings;;Bar room stories are designed to entertain and impress but should be taken with a pinch of salt. So what to make of the claims by InBev and MillerCoors that both can take a big chunk of costs out of their respective US beer businesses?The challenge for each is different. The newly minted joint venture between SABMiller and Molson Coors brings together the number two and three brewers in the US. By combining breweries and operations they hope to save $500m annually and harvest all the usual woolly benefits of sharing best practices, widening the talent pool and harnessing greater marketing muscle.InBev’s takeover of Anheuser-Busch, meanwhile, should close by the end of the year. The pair’s US operations (the bulk of Anheuser-Busch’s business) are already well meshed, so instead the aim is to slim down a fat organisation and find $1bn worth of savings once the Belgians and Brazilians are in control.Both approaches come with difficulties. While MillerCoors faces a tricky integration, InBev has promised that nothing much will change: the breweries will be kept intact, unions unruffled and friendly relations with distributors maintained. Such assurances were necessary to win the Anheuser-Busch board’s approval for a politically sensitive deal.US beer distributors, in particular, are not without weight in Washington. Presidential candidate John McCain’s wife Cindy, for example, chairs the board of an Anheuser-Busch distributor. But these pledges may well limit InBev’s ability to extract the promised savings.Even if $1.5bn of costs can be extracted from the US industry, it is worth considering what will happen to those savings. Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors respectively control 50 and 30 per cent in a market where volumes are growing by just 1 per cent a year. The temptation to reinvest those savings in a push for market share will be hard to resist.Post and read comments on this Lex
76;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2008-07-23T18:40:56Z;Thirst to be first: race for a global lead in beer;;"Chris Burggraeve, chief marketing officer of InBev, leans on a bar in front of a Stella Artois tap as he delivers the Belgo-Brazilian brewer’s somewhat tautological corporate spiel. Brands, he says, are “the lifeblood of any branded goods business – and that’s what we are”.The appearance by the fresh-faced Belgian comes on a video clip at globalbeerleader.com, a website set up by InBev – producer of Stella and brands including Beck’s – as part of its successful campaign to take over Anheuser-Busch of the US.The $52bn (£26bn, €33bn) deal agreed last week gives InBev prime position in the world’s most profitable beer market: Anheuser-Busch has a near 50 per cent share in the US, which by volume is also the second biggest beer market in the world after China. At least as important, the acquisition helps position the brewer for the future by giving it Budweiser, the world’s best-known beer brand.Brewing still has few truly international brands. Of the world’s top 10 best-selling brands (a list topped by Bud Light, China’s Snow beer and Budweiser), only for Heineken of the Netherlands do international markets account for the vast proportion of sales. But the ownership of strong international brands is becoming increasingly important to brewers, for two main reasons.First, they are prized by consumers in fast-growing markets such as Russia (see below) and China, who did not have access to foreign brands until recently. Second, even in mature western markets, the premium on prominent brands is high and growing. Heineken, for example, says profits on the Heineken brand are twice those on the regional brands such as Amstel that still form about 80 per cent of sales.Those better profit margins become all the more important to brewers in the current environment of high commodity and energy prices and slowing world economic growth. Big rises in raw material costs, including hops and malted barley as well as oil for transport and aluminium for cans, have been forcing them to put up beer prices. Jørgen Buhl Rasmussen, chief executive of Carlsberg, the Danish brewer whose brand is in the top 20 global best sellers, says: “When you don’t have strong brands, it’s very hard to offset price increases.”Some drinks analysts predict that half of the beer industry’s profits will eventually be derived from premium brands, up from about 10 per cent now. This would strengthen the position of groups such as InBev, Heineken and Carlsberg, they add. The Dutch group sees itself as having a head start – it began moving into US and Asian markets more than 70 years ago. “It takes you decades to build an internationally recognised premium brand,” says Jean-François van Boxmeer, Heineken chief executive.But although Budweiser is one of the world’s most most widely recognised consumer brands of any kind – ranking in league tables close to Nike and Dell – it is drunk mostly in the US. By volume, barely 5 per cent of Anheuser-Busch’s beer (which also includes brands such as Michelob and Rolling Rock) is sold internationally. That offers InBev a vast opportunity. “Budweiser has always been much better known than drunk around the world,” says an investment banker who advised InBev’s executives on the Anheuser takeover. “Bud could easily become their big global brand.”That is also how Carlos Brito, InBev’s Brazilian chief executive, sees it. The success of companies such as PepsiCo and McDonald’s shows people still want American brands, Mr Brito says. “Consumers like the US lifestyle.” Budweiser, he adds, can sell “America in a bottle”.Gerard Rijk, analyst at ING, sees the trend towards a few big brands as weakening the position of others such as SABMiller, the brewer that emerged from South Africa and began adding northern hemisphere brands in the late 1990s, when it bought the Czech Republic’s Pilsner Urquell. It subsequently absorbed Miller Brewing of the US in 2002, which gave it the Miller Genuine Draft brand, as well as Italy’s Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Grolsch of the Netherlands. But these four (excluding Miller Lite, sold mainly in the US) account for less than 2 per cent of the group’s total sales volumes.Mr Rijk argues that SABMiller’s lack of a “dominant overwhelming brand” makes it vulnerable despite being a well-run company. “When there is not yet a global brand, you can break it up.” Some of SABMiller’s rivals also see the brewer’s lack of global brands as an Achilles heel. “It is one of their challenges,” says the chief executive at another big brewer.Graham Mackay, SABMiller’s chief executive, acknowledges that global brands are increasingly important, noting that beers such as Peroni are growing faster than other brands at the group. But he adds: “The idea that we’re going to be broken up any time soon is quite fanciful …We’ll continue to be a consolidator.”Other beer analysts back him up, saying there is no reason for SABMiller to be a loser in any further acquisition round. Andrew Holland, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, expects two main blocs to be created – one led by InBev and the other by a combined SABMiller/Molson Coors, which recently merged their US brewing businesses. “The next logical thing is for SAB to do a full merger with Molson Coors,” says Mr Holland.All the while, each of the big brewers will have to spend big sums burnishing the image of its best brand and further extending its international reach. As Heine­ken’s Mr van Boxmeer puts it: “A large part of the world which was closed 20 years ago has opened up …You can see a large trend of demand for ‘something else’, which we can provide.”For InBev’s Mr Burggraeve, who joined the group only last November after a dozen years at Coca-Cola (see below), that marketing task began right then, and in all urgency, rather than by making videos for the Anheuser bid. InBev has been regarded as one of the industry’s poorer brand managers, having failed to protect the premium image of Stella Artois in the UK.British demand for Stella, once marketed as “reassuringly expensive”, dived after InBev cut prices and the brand became associated with the country’s binge drinking culture. The poor UK performance dragged down global Stella Artois volumes in 2007, before improving this year amid a new advertising campaign that emphasises its quality and purity.Many in the industry consider InBev’s management to have been tough and efficient rather than brilliant marketeers. As chief executive, Mr Brito reflects the culture of the company when he describes his lifestyle: “I have no hobbies. I work all the time.”Now, he is to become custodian of what has long been promoted as the “king of beers”. With so valuable a brand as Bud to protect, Mr Brito might need to consider getting out more.Emerging tipples rise up the value rankingsWhen brewers talk of their “global” brands, they no longer just mean those from western Europe or the US. Some of the emerging global names began life far from there.Baltika, the Russian brand owned by Carlsberg, and Brazil’s Brahma,owned by InBev, beat brands including Miller Genuine Draft, Foster’s and Molson in the 2008 market value ranking of beer brands by Millward Brown, a research group.Millward Brown says Baltika, at number 15 on the list, is valued at just over $1bn (£501m, €636m) while Brahma, which pulls in at number 17, is worth $944m. (Skol, where rights are shared – InBev brews it in Brazil and Carlsberg has most of the rights beyond Latin America – ranks eighth, worth $1.9bn.)Carlsberg says Baltika, of which it recently gained full ownership after buying Scottish & Newcastle, its former joint venture partner in Russia, is now one of its top four international brands along with the Carlsberg brand itself, Tuborg and 1664 Kronenbourg.Baltika was the reason that Carlsberg, with the help of Heineken, launched a surprise bid for S&N last year in a deal that split up the British brewer. Carlsberg wanted a bigger stake in the Russian beer market, where annual sales volumes have been rising some 10 per cent on average in the past four years, but it also saw the global potential of the Baltika brand.“It’s becoming international,” Jørgen Buhl Rasmussen, Carlsberg’s chief executive, told the Financial Times as he opened the brand’s 11th Russian brewery in May.Baltika, which was developed only in the early 1990s but is now Russia’s biggest beer brand, was first exported in 2000. Since then it has been shipped to some 47 countries including Australia, Japan and Greece and is also brewed under licence in the UK and Ukraine. About 10 per cent of its total sales come from outside Russia.InBev’s Brahma brand is much older, having been created in 1888 in Brazil, where it was long considered an ordinary beer brand. But InBev began creating a global image for Brahma when it started exporting it to 15 countries in 2005. It is now available in more than 30 national markets, including 20 outside Latin America.The brewer redesigned Brahma’s packaging, creating a curved bottle with embossed lettering in what it says was an attempt to form a link between the Brazilian culture (“optimistic and creative”) and the beer.The redesign was also the brewer’s first attempt at creating a global brand after InBev was created by the merger of Brazil’s AmBev and Belgium’s Interbrew in 2004.But although InBev describes Brahma as one of its “global flagship” brands, along with Stella Artois and Beck’s, it does not appear to have won over the palates of American and European drinkers. Asked which will be the brands of the combined Anheuser-Busch InBev with most potential, Carlos Brito, chief executive, says: “Bud Light, Bud and Skol.”Bottling gives brewers a taste for the soft stuffBranding has become so important to brewers that some industry specialists believe they may one day consider merging with some of the biggest brand names in the drinks business: Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Carlos Laboy, a beverages analyst at Credit Suisse, says that as brewers become bigger, they are starting to think of expanding beyond beer. “InBev is not thinking in terms of being a brewer …they want to become the most dominant consumer packaged company in the world,” he says.Pepsi and Coke already have substantial bottling and distribution agreements with brewers around the world. When it completes its acquisition of Anheuser-Busch, InBev will be the biggest company outside the US in the business of turning PepsiCo’s proprietary concentrate into the finished product on supermarket shelves. SABMiller, meanwhile, is one of Coca-Cola’s biggest bottlers outside Latin America; in Australia the two have a joint venture, Pacific Beverages, which is building a brewery on the country’s east coast.It has long been the soft drinks companies’ strategy to franchise bottling operations. Carlsberg bottles Coca-Cola drinks in Denmark and Finland, and Pepsi in Sweden, Norway and Laos. Heineken owns a stake in Compañía Cervecerías Unidas, the Chilean brewer and soft drinks bottler.For the brewers, bottling is a convenient sideline that makes use of their existing capacity. But the low margins in a business until recently dominated by small, family-run companies mean they have not pursued it as a serious long-term strategy. Profits are limited because the brewers do not have any control over marketing and branding, and have to split revenues with the brand owner. Brewers also say that soft drinks companies have been sharply increasing the price of soft drink concentrate over the past decade.Graham Mackay, SABMiller chief executive, acknowledges that owning a big soft drink brand – assuming SABMiller could ever afford to buy one – would be far more profitable than bottling one. “We can’t do with soft drinks brands what we might like to do with them.”Some suggest that SABMiller could strike some sort of deal with Coca-Cola. That might sound implausible, points out Mr Laboy, but so did the idea of InBev buying Anheuser-Busch five years ago when its market capitalisation was one-third that of the American brewer.For their part, soft drinks companies have been reluctant to sell beer, wine and spirits because they are wary of being linked with the problems of underage or binge drinking. “They’ve considered [getting into alcohol] many times,” says the chief executive of one brewer. “But they want to stay squeaky clean.”Coca-Cola had a brief flirtation with alcohol, owning the US’s Taylor Wine Company for seven years before selling it to Canada’s Seagram in 1983. But it has since pursued a pure soft drinks strategy.Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola’s chief executive, insists that soft drinks have a strong future. “I believe that there is no better consumer business in the world today or in the future than the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink business,” he said in February at a conference in New York.However, with soft drinks companies now battling declining markets for fizzy drinks, some analysts say they should reconsider the logic of owning alcoholic brands. Mr Laboy argues that one way Coca-Cola could cut costs and improve profits, as sales of its core Coke brand slow, would be to buy either SABMiller or Fomento Económico Mexicano (Femsa), the family-controlled Mexican brewer.He also says brewers should consider making a move on the soft drinks groups – in particular, that InBev should take a close look at PepsiCo. Anheuser-Busch InBev will have close to 40 per cent of the volumes in the Chinese beer industry …What would their business look like if they had the entire PepsiCo portfolio on their trucks?”"
77;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2008-07-14T20:57:34Z;Wall Street falls on fears over financials;;Stocks fell on Monday as US government measures to shore up confidence in mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac failed to impress equity investors, and regional banks came under pressure.The government sponsored enterprises, which buy or finance almost half of the $12,000bn US mortgage market and have long been seen to have an implicit guarantee from the US government, have been a drag on equity markets.Speculation that they needed more capital but would be unable to raise it had sent their share prices tumbling and again raised the spectre of systemic financial collapse.Barclays Capital said: “While we believe that this removal of short-term systemic risk is likely to improve sentiment and support GSE credit and equity in the short term, in the longer term we believe that GSE capital requirements will likely increase as credit losses are likely to be sizeable.” Fannie Mae fell 5.1 per cent to $9.73 while Freddie Mac lost 8.3 per cent to $7.11.By the close, eight of the 10 leading industry groups were in the red, knocking the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.9 per cent to 1,228.29 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.4 per cent to 11,055.19 points and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.2 per cent to 2,212.87 points.US stock markets ended last week in bear market territory. The S&P 500 posted its sixth successive weekly decline as investors rushed to sell Fannie and Freddie on speculation that a government bail-out could wipe out shareholders while oil prices spiked above $147, pummelling consumer-facing stocks.With the former threat off the table, financial stocks were expected to rally strongly. But the reverse happened as regional banks came under heavy selling pressure after the collapse of IndyMac Bancorp last week.Analysts noted that while the GSEs were more or less explicitly backed by the government, smaller banks were not “too big to fail”.Goldman Sachs added Zions Bancorp to its “conviction sell” list and predicted that a number of other regional banks might cut their dividends.M&T Bank said its second-quarter profit fell 25 per cent due to credit losses related to residential real estate.Zions fell 23.2 per cent to $19.73, M&T Bank dropped 15.6 per cent to $58.82 while trading in National City shares was temporarily halted. The shares closed down 14.7 per cent to $3.43.Washington Mutual was the biggest faller, down 34.7 per cent to $3.23. The larger banks and brokerages came under fire. Citigroup fell 6 per cent to $15.22, JPMorgan lost 4.4 per cent to $31.69 and Bank of America dropped 7 per cent to $20.15.Lehman Brothers, the whipping boy in the current round of the credit crisis, came under renewed attack in spite of a cautiously positive report from Bernstein Research that argued that thanks to Fed support and deleveraging “the firm should be able to survive any confidence crisis ahead”.Investors were less sure and shares in Lehman Brothers fell 14.1 per cent to $12.40.The sector as a whole slumped 6.1 per cent while the KBW banking index fell to its lowest level since October 1996.There were some bright spots and outside the financials only the utilities sector was down more than 1 per cent. InBev said it would buy Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Budweiser beer, for $52bn. Anheuser-Busch shares rose 0.6 per cent to $66.87.Waste Management, the largest US waste disposal company, said it would bid $34 a share to buy Republic Services in a deal valued at $6.19bn. Waste Management lost 5.8 per cent to $34.49 while Republic jumped 13.8 per cent to $31.76. Positive earnings forecasts helped boost a handful of stocks. Allegheny Technologies surged 9.7 per cent to $55.21 after the specialty metals producer said second-quarter profit would be higher than previously forecast.Energy and consumer staples stocks were the only gainers, boosted by elevated oil prices and some analysts upgrades respectively.Schlumberger rose 2.7 per cent to $101.79 and National Oilwell Varco rose 5.4 per cent to $87.59. Dean Foods climbed 2.6 per cent to $18.45 while Molson Coors added 2.2 per cent to $55.42.
78;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2008-06-13T18:49:58Z;Heady times as Anheuser ponders InBev offer;;Anheuser-Busch’s advisers, who are now considering rival brewer InBev’s $46bn takeover proposal, will spend the weekend evaluating the offer’s merits before presenting their opinions to Anheuser’s board of directors, according to people close to the situation.The US brewer, which has maintained a relatively modest pace – at least, publicly – in addressing InBev’s unsolicited attentions, says it will make a decision on the bid “in due course”.InBev, which had been considering an offer for Anheuser for months, sent a proposal to Anheuser on Wednesday to buy the company and its flagship Budweiser brand.Anheuser’s board must now consider not only whether InBev’s $65 per share bid values the company appropriately, but also whether it is willing to sell – and, if not, whether it can try to block a deal.Anheuser may therefore craft its public response to InBev’s bid in a way that will buy it more time to continue talks with Grupo Modelo, the Mexican brewer in which Anheuser owns more than a 50 per cent stake, people close to the companies said.If Anheuser wants to scuttle InBev’s attempted takeover badly enough, it may try to buy the remaining share of Mexico’s largest brewer and use the acquisition to build up the broader company’s anti-takeover provisions.People close to the situation had mixed opinions as to whether such a move, which could require one or more votes of shareholder approval, could serve as a viable “poison pill” tactic.Anheuser executives waited to travel to Mexico to formally speak with Modelo about the situation until Thursday, once the company had received a specific proposal from InBev, people close to the process said. That gave Anheuser the advantage of having clear information on InBev’s intents.But it has left Anheuser’s advisers to work double-time as they assess the variety of decisions facing the St Louis, Missouri-based company.Meanwhile, eager investment bankers have descended upon SABMiller, another leading global brewer which this year amalgamated its US business with Molson Coors, the third largest US brewer, with proposals for ways it might be able to jump into the fray.A “white knight” bidder to counter InBev may be tough to come by – especially with top private equity firms still locked down by the credit crunch. There were no indications as of Friday that SABMiller was pursuing a bid for Anheuser.However, if InBev and Anheuser merge, SABMiller may be able to snap up certain assets that fall off the back of the combined company’s “beer truck”. A purchase of Anheuser would be incredibly expensive for InBev, and would almost surely necessitate asset sales to help pay down some of the roughly $40bn in debt financing InBev has arranged to help pay for the takeover.InBev, aside from an option it might have to sell some or all of Anheuser’s half-stake in Modelo if it completed the acquisition, could also choose to sell Anheuser’s large aluminium or packaging businesses. InBev’s Belgian and Brazilian owners are also likely to have fewer compunctions than the Busch family about trading away Anheuser’s “Busch Gardens” theme parks. Tensions between Anheuser and Chinese brewer Tsingtao, in which Anheuser owns a 27 per cent stake, have also risen as Anheuser has increasingly sold its own Harbin brand head-to-head in China against Tsingtao’s beers.If the tie-up between Anheuser and Tsingtao does not withstand a merger with InBev – through which Anheuser could become an even stronger competitor in China – SABMiller may target Tsingtao.While people close to the situation would not rule out the possibility of an outright combination between InBev and SABMiller, they noted that InBev’s sights appear to remain solidly locked on Anheuser.
79;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2008-06-12T18:46:38Z;Silence greets unfolding power play;;While InBev’s top executives were laying out the rationale for their unsolicited $46bn takeover bid for Anheuser-Busch on Thursday, the largest brewer in the US remained silent – continuing the stance it has maintained since rumours of the bid first emerged last month.August Busch IV, chief executive and great-great-grandson of the founder, had previously stated that he would oppose a foreign takeover of the brewer, which owns the Budweiser and Michelob brands.But although he met two InBev directors on June 2, after reports of the impending bid, he has yet to make any comments.The brewer, which is being advised by Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, has also yet to publicly make a case for why it should remain independent. Bankers say this apparently passive stance bodes ill for Anheuser-Busch should it attempt to fight off the bid.However, Mr Busch’s earlier expression of opposition to a takeover has fuelled speculation about a possible defence strategy.This has focused largely on Grupo Modelo, the largest brewer in Mexico, which is more than 50 per cent owned by Anheuser-Busch, although it holds only 44 per cent of the voting shares.Modelo’s shares rose sharply on Thursday on speculation that the US brewer could seek to defend itself by acquiring the remainder of the company.That would make a combination of the two companies more expensive for InBev to acquire, although InBev has not ruled out increasing its bid.Modelo’s board ended a two-day meeting on Thursday. It also met on Wednesday with InBev and on Thursday with Anheuser-Busch, a source close to the situation said.After facing criticism over the valuation of its original sale of a half stake to Anheuser-Busch in the mid-1990s, Modelo may now have a chance to play the two parties off against each other.If Anheuser-Busch successfully convinced Modelo to sell the rest of the company, it could try to infuse the transaction with anti-takeover provisions, people close to the situation said.However, it would also have to persuade its own shareholders that such a deal delivered more value than InBev’s $65 per share offer.Bankers say Anheuser-Busch could also seek to show that it is serious about slashing costs by cutting the heavy marketing spending that has been a key element of building its iconic brands and by reducing employees, something it could easily do without InBev’s help.It seems unlikely that Anheuser-Busch will attract a “white knight” in the form of a bid from another drinks company or brewer to counter the InBev offer.SABMiller has already merged its US operations with Molson Coors, while Heineken and Carlsberg are tied up with the financing and integration of Scottish & Newcastle, the UK brewer.Diageo of the UK is a long shot because, although it likes strong brands, it is not likely to want to take on the job of rejuvenating beer sales in the US.Political opposition could also become a factor, although nationalist sentiment failed to stop SAB’s takeover of Miller in 2002 or Coors’ 2005 merger with Canada’s Molson.Trevor Stirling, beverages analyst at Bernstein Research, said: “I think that they will be tempted to play the patriot card, perhaps using the unions and wholesalers as proxies. However, the management and directors have to be careful to be seen to entertain the bid seriously, otherwise they leave themselves open to lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duty.”While the weak dollar has facilitated the InBev take­over approach, it also underlines the divergent strategic paths taken by InBev and Anheuser-Busch during the 1990s. While InBev and SAB focused on acquiring small international brands, Anheuser-Busch’s then chief executive, August Busch III, concentrated instead on building its US brands and returning cash to shareholders. Its international presence currently consists of its share of Grupo Modelo and a 27 per cent share in China’s Tsingtao.Anheuser-Busch has also been taking small steps towards diversifying into non-alcoholic drinks, including acquiring the maker of an energy drink and investing in an Icelandic mineral water company.In addition to its brewing interests it also operates theme parks, as well as rail-road and bottling operations linked to its beer business.
80;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2008-05-23T22:44:00Z;InBev weighs options for beer merger;;The large Belgian brewer InBev could attempt to force Anheuser-Busch to the bargaining table or strike a deal with SABMiller as it tries to consolidate share of the global beer market, according to people familiar with the company’s plans.InBev has long studied the possibility of a merger with Anheuser, the US brewer of Budweiser beer, but has consistently run into opposition from Anheuser’s board of directors.As it weighs whether to take a more aggressive stance, InBev is working on a $46bn takeover bid for Anheuser and arranging potential financing for a deal, according to people close to the process. Those people cautioned that InBev’s plans were still not crystallised, however, and could change.Shares of Anheuser finished the session more than 7 per cent higher at $56.61 in New York on Friday, their biggest gain in three years. InBev fell €1.56, or 3.1 per cent, to €48.76 in Brussels.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the second-largest shareholder in Anheuser.If the Belgian brewer does proceed with an approach, it could take its offer straight to August Busch IV, the Anheuser chief executive who resisted an informal bid from InBev last October, the people said.If its foray does not convince Anheuser to sit down for friendly talks, InBev may consider a direct appeal to Anheuser’s shareholders.To cast its net sufficiently wide, however, InBev is also evaluating a plan B: a tie-up with SABMiller. InBev and SABMiller have been informally discussing a combination, according to a person familiar with the situation.The progression of those talks, however, has been limited by the US Department of Justice’s review of SABMiller’s deal to merge its US operations with those of Molson Coors.None of the companies could immediately be reached for comment.Molson Coors said this week it expected the venture, which will be named Miller-Coors, to win regulatory approval in the next few weeks. After that point, SABMiller’s talks with InBev could progress further.To move its potential offer for Anheuser forward, InBev has worked to arrange a financing package through JPMorgan and Santander, the Financial Times’ Alphaville website reported.InBev, which owns the Stella Artois and Beck’s beer brands, would gain control of roughly a quarter of the world’s beer market if a deal with Anheuser were successful.
81;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2008-05-21T22:34:20Z;Molson Coors awaits SABMiller go-ahead;;Molson Coors, the North American brewer, expects to receive regulatory approval to merge its US operations with those of SABMiller within the next few weeks, paving the way for a stronger competitor to US market leader Anheuser-Busch.Leo Kiely, chief executive of Molson Coors, has been in London this week to discuss merger plans with SABMiller. The two brewers agreed last year to combine their US brewing operations in a new company, Miller-Coors.Mr Kiely said the US Department of Justice, which is reviewing the merger, had not so far made any special requests for information that could delay the deal.The two brewers are combining their American businesses to improve profitability. Anheuser-Busch has profit margins of nearly 17 per cent, nearly double those of Coors or Miller, and controls nearly half of the US beer market.Recent speculation that Anheuser-Busch may be bought by another larger brewer, such as Belgium’s InBev, remain “just rumours”, said Mr Kiely, adding that the St Louis-based brewer would continue to be a formidable competitor. “Anheuser-Busch is a big, strong company.”Once its merger is approved, MillerCoors expects to build sales of upmarket niche brands such as Peroni Nastro Azzuro and Pilsner Urquell (both owned by SABMiller) in bars and restaurants by training a specialist sales force. “It’s a targeted approach,” said Mr Kiely.It has taken Molson Coors more than a decade to make its home-grown craft beer, Blue Moon, a success. It sells about 1m barrels every year in the US. But the brewer is now capitalising on rising demand for specialist beers.“The craft beer business has never been more vital,” said Mr Kiely, adding that he planned to develop more craft beers. Molson Coors last year created a subsidiary, AC Golden, to develop new kinds of beer.MillerCoors also hopes to bring more of SABMiller’s 150-odd beer brands to the US. “The portfolio of our future provider has some real promise in terms of imports,” said Mr Kiely.Low-alcohol beers will also be another priority for MillerCoors. “Light beers continue to be the preference,” said Mr Kiely, adding that MillerCoors would encourage people to buy Coors Light for its “refreshment” and Miller Lite for its “taste”.US sales of the leading brewers’ low-alcohol beers have been rising over the past 12 months, with supermarket sales up 1.4 per cent to the end of April, according to Beer Marketer’s Insights, the industry newsletter.Both Anheuser-Busch and SABMiller have been losing share to Molson Coors, which increased sales of its low-alcohol brands by more than 7 per cent.Molson Coors plans to take the Blue Moon brand, currently only sold in North America, to the UK this year.Mr Kiely forecast that the British beer market, which is in decline, would revive as brewers became more innovative. “In the long run, I do believe the UK beer business can return to growth.”
82;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2008-01-17T22:37:09Z;SABMiller on track despite slowdown;;SABMiller, the world’s third-largest brewer, said that, although sales growth had slowed in the three months to December, it was still on track to meet earnings forecasts.The London-based company said like-for-like beer sales by volume rose 4 per cent in the last quarter, against 10 per cent in the same period last year and 11 per cent in the previous six months.“There was a slowdown in our sales in China, which will impact our overall volume figures much more than it will our profits,” the company said.“Across the board, we’ve passed on higher input costs on such things as barley, hops and energy to our customers, which has also hit sales,” it added.The brewer of Peroni beer also blamed stagnant demand on severe weather and rising interest rates in Colombia, as well as declining overall consumption in the Czech Republic.Growth in sales of Miller beer in the US was flat at 1.5 per cent.Graham Mackay, chief executive, previously said that restoring margins to levels seen prior to the rise in input costs would probably take two or three years.SABMiller said earnings would meet analysts’ forecasts, partly aided by exchange rate movements in the South African rand, Colombian peso and some European currencies.However, it warned that trading in 2008 would be difficult as a result of higher ingredient costs and reduced consumer spending.It also said it would book a $19m (£9.6m) one-off charge this quarter for “staff retention arrangements” in connection with the merger of its Miller operation with Molson Coors Brewing Company, and that it expected to incur more such costs until the completion of the transaction, expected in mid-2008.The company’s shares fell 57p to £11.87, a loss of 4.6 per cent.The share price has now lost more than 20 per cent since October.
83;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2007-10-17T20:51:13Z;Carlsberg, Heineken poised for S&N bid;;Carlsberg and Heineken are next week set to launch a formal bid to buy and break-up Scottish & Newcastle in a move that has enraged Britain’s biggest brewer.The pair were on Wednesday understood to be planning a friendly offer pricing S&N – whose assets include Foster’s lager and Strongbow cider – at between 720p and 750p per share, valuing the company at between £6.8bn and £7.10bn, excluding debt. If the brewers unsuccessful in friendly negotiations, they may consider a hostile approach.S&N on Wednesday night reacted furiously to the move, not least because it has spent the past five years working closely with Carlsberg on a Russian joint venture. Sources close to the situation said S&N would not consider any bid below £8.S&N’s shares soared 19 per cent to close at 756p. They have risen 32 per cent since the start of the year as it has become the object of takeover speculation.The British brewer, which runs the highly profitable Baltic Beverages Holdings joint venture in Russia with Carlsberg, described the potential offer as “unwelcome”.It said it had not received a formal approach from Carlsberg and that it did not know of Carlsberg and Heineken’s plans until the companies telephoned S&N’s chairman Wednesday morning.S&N said it was “confident” in its future as an independent group and urged shareholders “to take no action”.S&N has worked closely with Carlsberg since 2002, when it acquired a stake in BBH after acquiring Hartwall, the Finnish brewer, and the two brewers have held talks about a possible merger in the past.If an offer were made, Carlsberg would take BBH, its French and Greek operations. Heineken would take the UK and other European businesses of S&N, including Finland and Portugal.The proposed deal has been structured to avoid antitrust issues for Carlsberg in the UK and western Europe.S&N has long been considered a takeover target as it is one of the few remaining brewers with an open share register left in a consolidating industry.If a deal is successful, it could prompt rival offers for S&N. SABMiller and Diageo have held talks over a possible joint bid for S&N.It could also prompt further consolidation in the industry. InBev is believed to have held talks with Anheuser-Busch, and last week Molson Coors said its new joint venture with SABMiller in North America could lead to further links between the two companies.Heineken could fund the purchase with cash resources, but Carlsberg, which is expected to pay more than Heineken, would need to issue equity or debt.Carlsberg is understood to have DKr70bn (€9.4bn) available for acquisitions, DKr50bn of which could come through an equity increase and DKr20bn from taking on new debt.The Danish brewer had net interest-bearing debt of DKr20.5bn at the end of June, and has suggested it could raise another DKr10bn without changing its capital structure.Additional reporting Robert Anderson
84;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2007-10-15T07:40:55Z;SABMiller hurt by slowdown in sales of beer;;SABMiller’s shares lost ground on Monday after the brewer, which is forming a joint venture with Canada’s Molson Coors to boost its North American profits, said beer sales slowed in the second quarter.SABMiller said organic sales volumes rose 11 per cent in the first half of the year, indicating sales had slowed since the first quarter, when it reported sales growth of 13 per cent.The brewer’s shares dropped 70p to £14.13.Analysts said sales volumes appeared to be slowing in the group’s three most profitable regions: South Africa, Latin America and Europe. Although SABMiller reported sales growth of 22 per cent in China, profit margins in China are low.Rob Mann, analyst at Collins Stewart, said the slowdown reflected a reversion to “normal” sale trends following “spectacular” growth in the first quarter.SABMiller said its financial performance for the first half of the year was “in line with management’s expectations” but noted that growth in sales revenues had been hurt by high commodity costs and higher investment.The group expects higher prices for agricultural products such as barley and also aluminium and glass, to add about $150m to $200m (£74m to £98m) to its costs in the current financial year.The weakest region in growth terms was North America, where Miller’s volumes rose 1.4 per cent on an organic basis, with Miller Lite up 2.1 per cent. However, the group said a change in mix towards higher-margin brands had lifted revenue per barrel by 3.9 per cent.The new Miller Chill, a “chelada style” light beer with a hint of lime and salt, had traded “above expectations”, SABMiller said, while some of its international brands. such as Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Leinenkugel’s, had shown double-digit percentage volume gains.Elsewhere the group recorded higher growth rates, particularly in newer markets.Strong volumes in China, where the group’s Snow brand is on track to become the world’s second largest lager brand by the end of 2007, helped increase growth in Africa and Asia by 20 per cent.In South Africa, SABMiller’s early heartland, volumes were up just 2 per cent. The group blamed the weak growth on supply shortages as it changes its packaging processes.Volumes sold in Latin America rose 8 per cent, with sales in Colombia up 7 per cent and up 10 per cent in Peru.
85;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
86;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2007-10-11T07:13:27Z;Antitrust rush;;Are US companies getting together while they still can? SABMiller and Molson Coors this week announced a joint venture that would result in 80 per cent of the US beer market being in just two hands. The second and third largest US beer companies say antitrust issues did not influence their decision but the timing is fortuitous.The November 2008 election is looming and Democratic presidential candidates are promising voters that they will come down harder on big business combinations. The responsibility for approving US mergers is divided, roughly along sector lines, between the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC is required to be bipartisan but the beer deal will likely go to the justice department, whose leadership changes with the presidency. Under President George W. Bush, the department has been much more permissive than it was under Democrat Bill Clinton, the former president.A looming crackdown on big intra-industry mergers is not certain. But the window of opportunity may have begun to shut: civil servants tend to dominate enforcement in an administration’s last year. The regulatory threat is sharpest in oil, gas and telecommunications, where consolidation has already drawn Democratic fire. But even supermarkets, drug stores and banks may want to move now to avoid concerns about regional dominance.The two agencies saw an estimated 23 per cent increase in merger filings in the 2007 fiscal year. That reflected cheap financing that has now dried up. Fear of tougher US scrutiny will not be strong enough to create a new boom.The European Union, in any case, remains fierce on deals with an international component. But the US election clock might jump-start long-discussed deals with significant regulatory elements. Some antitrust lawyers are advising clients that they need to get moving, and fast.
87;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2007-10-09T23:39:08Z;Miller and Coors unite;;The only surprise is that it did not happen sooner. SABMiller and Molson Coors have long struggled in the US against brewing giant Anheuser-Busch. Thanks to the scale benefits of controlling nearly half the US beer market, Anheuser’s operating margins are more than double Miller’s and triple those of Coors. A combined MillerCoors would have a more competitive 29 per cent market share.With limited growth opportunities in the mature US market, where beer is declining in terms of per capita consumption and facing serious competition from wine, the deal makes eminent sense. The companies expect annual cost savings to hit $500m, after initial costs of $450m, based on substantial cuts in overhead and freight expenses. Those savings are worth more than $2.6bn – once taxed and discounted at 10 per cent.Coors supplies most of its beer from one brewery in Golden, Colorado. The new venture will have eight large breweries scattered across the US. That should alleviate cost pressures for the companies’ distributors, three-fifths of whom already sell both brands. It also allows SABMiller to consolidate its foothold in the US market without making an outright acquisition. SABMiller remains focused on expanding in emerging markets. Its recent turnround programme at Miller failed to boost profits.There will be challenges, such as deciding how to position the two flagship light beers, Miller Lite and Coors Light. And the deal will face antitrust scrutiny. While creating a more powerful rival to Anheuser, the transaction would mean a near duopoly in the US.If it goes through, however, it will increase pressure on Anheuser in its home market, and could encourage it to be more aggressive overseas. The trouble is, synergies are more difficult to come by in global combinations than in local tie-ups. A deal between Anheuser-Busch and top global brewer InBev would be no exception.
88;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2007-10-09T20:45:55Z;Overview: M&A pushes equities higher;;Record highs were a theme for US and Asian equities on Tuesday, as renewed merger and acquisition activity gave investors further reason to believe the worst of the recent credit squeeze was firmly behind them.Among Tuesday’s deals, French family-owned Sonepar said it was eyeing a €2.5bn bid for Dutch electronics distributor Hagemeyer, while British brewer SABMiller announced a joint venture with US rival Molson Coors. In New York, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both set record closes and new intra-day peaks. A late rally in stocks was ignited after the release of the minutes from the last Federal Reserve policy meeting, at which US interest rates were cut by 50 basis points.“Although financial markets were expected to stabilise over time, participants judged that credit markets were likely to restrain economic growth in the period ahead,” said the minutes.Policymakers did not indicate whether further rate cuts were likely.Traders said equities rallied in relief as the Fed did not see broad- based weakness in the economy. US bond yields rose, led by the policy sensitive two-year Treasury note as investors reduced expectations of a near term rate ease.“A general improvement in market conditions since the Fed’s rate cut, a weaker dollar and higher commodity prices, and surprisingly resilient economic data outside housing question the need for another 25 basis points rate cut at the end of this month,” said Lena Komileva, economist at Tullett Prebon.David Ader, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital said: “We’re left where we were, looking at new data to determine the course of further Fed action.”A bullish day for global equity markets was crowned by the S&P 500 rising 0.8 per cent to a record close of 1,565.15, while the Dow rallied 0.9 per cent to a new peak of 14,164.53. Investors also expected strong results from Alcoa, as the aluminium producer was set to kick off the US third-quarter reporting season after the closing bell.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was up 0.5 per cent to 1,587.66.Deal activity helped push London’s FTSE 100 index 1.14 per cent higher to 6615.4. A note of caution, however was expressed by some equity strategists.Gareth Evans at UBS said: “I’d be reluctant to suggest we’re through the worst of it. Volatility is still higher than we were used to before the start of the credit crunch.”The Vix index, Chicago Board Options Exchange’s measure of volatility in the US equity market stood at 16.16 yesterday, down 7.5 per cent on the day and well below this year’s high of 37.5 hit in August, but still above the 12 level seen in early June.Evidence that the appetite for risk has still not fully recovered from the late-summer turmoil was also provided by global fund flows data.Fund tracker EPFR Global said US, European and Japanese equity funds remained under pressure, suggesting investors were less bullish than market moves implied.In Asia, Tokyo investors returned after Monday’s holiday and drove the Nikkei 225 Average 0.6 per cent higher to 17,159.9.Many Asian equity indices struck fresh record highs – Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, China’s Shanghai Composite and South Korea’s Kospi were among them.India’s benchmark index overturned Monday’s 2 per cent loss, and rallied 4.5 per cent after coalition government allies toned down their verbal conflict over a nuclear energy deal with the US.Bombay’s Sensex index passed the 18,000 level for the first time, and closed at a record high of 18,280.24.The Fed minutes sparked selling in US Government bond prices. The yield on the two-year note rose 5.5 bp to 4.13 per cent. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note was at 4.655 per cent, up from 4.61 per cent in early trade.Earlier on Tuesday, bonds had rallied in part after a leaked report by the International Monetary Fund, which is to cut its 2008 global growth forecast from 5.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent following the market turmoil of the summer. US growth in 2008 was cut from 2.8 per cent to 1.9 per cent.The IMF cut its forecast for eurozone growth in 2008 from 2.5 per cent to 2.1 per cent. The yield on the German 10-year Bund was down 2.2 basis points to 4.31 per cent.Meanwhile, the IMF’s UK growth forecast was cut from 2.7 per cent to 2.3 per cent. This was roughly in line with downgraded forecasts from Alistair Darling, the UK’s finance minister, who delivered Britain’s pre- Budget report. The yield on the UK 10-year Gilt fell 2.9 basis points to 4.9 per cent.In the currency markets the dollar lost steam against the euro and closed 0.5 per cent lower at $1.4112. The Fed minutes noted: ”Inflation risks could be heightened if the dollar were to continue to depreciate significantly.”“The mere fact that the Federal Open Market Committee would contemplate a hypothetical significant depreciation will do the market’s confidence in the dollar no good,” said Alan Ruskin chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.Sterling fell by 0.2 per cent to $2.0339 against the dollar and by 0.4 per cent to £0.6927 against the euro.Commodity markets re-overed some poise after Monday’s losses.US Nymex West Texas Intermediate returned to the $80-a-barrel level, having hit a daily low of $78.39.The recovery extended to metals. Gold, recovered to $738.40, up almost $8 on the day. Copper rallied 0.6 per cent to $8,010 a tonne, while lead hit a fresh record high of $3,810 a tonne, up 3.6 per cent higher at $3,780.
89;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2007-10-09T20:35:14Z;Wall St rallies after Fed minutes;;Wall Street stocks surged to fresh record highs on Tuesday after the minutes of last month’s Federal Reserve meeting revealed the decision to slash interest rates was unanimous and helped to allay fears about the health of the economy.Investors were also anticipating the start of third-quarter earnings season.The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to a new record intraday and closing high , up 0.9 per cent on the day at 14164.53, after the release of the Federal Open Market Committee minutes. Stocks had earlier experienced a choppy session.The S&P500 also set a new record close, 0.8 per cent higher at 1565.15, while Nasdaq Composite was 0.6 per cent higher at 2803.91.The minutes revealed that all members of the committee agreed the Fed should cut rates by 50 basis points.Policymakers, “saw a risk that tightening credit conditions and an intensifying housing correction would lead to significant broader weakness.” But committee members, “were a little more confident that the decline in inflation earlier this year would be sustained.”“I think the Fed is coming round to the position that inflation is really under control and the focus should be on growth,” Georges Yared, chief investment strategist at Yared Investment Research, said. “I think we’re still going to see two more rate cuts before the year is done.”Equities surged even as the chances of a further cut at the end of this month have weakened to 36 per cent from 74 per cent a week ago, according to futures market calculations.Gains on the S&P were led by the energy sector, with materials and utilities stocks also attracting buyers. Financials were weak in early trade but surged after the release of the Fed minutes. Goldman Sachs gained 5.4 per cent to $239.20.Microsoft was among the best performers on the Dow, 0.9 per cent higher at $30.10 after Goldman Sachs raised its earnings estimates. Exxon Mobil, up 2.2 per cent at $92.67 also saw strong gains. But Citigroup, closed lower, 0.4 per cent weaker at $47.62.Alcoa, the first of the Dow’s 30 companies to report, was due to announce its results after the closing bell. Its shares closed 3.7 per cent higher at $39.72.S&P 500 company earnings are forecast to grow at an average annual rate of 0.8 per cent during the third quarter, down from a forecast rise of 6.2 per cent at the start of July, according to Thomson Financial.“The market is short-term extended, up 12.5 per cent in the last seven weeks and is probably going to be hit with some rather poor earnings in the third quarter,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards. “The question is: how much is this already built into the market?”Average earnings for consumer stocks are now seen sliding 7 per cent whereas analysts were forecasting a rise of 3 per cent. For financials, average earnings are forecast to fall 6 per cent, down from an expected rise of 9 per cent in July.In contrast, analysts expect double-digit profit growth for the healthcare and technology sectors.“Profits are key. The key indicator to watch going forward is the US profits cycle,” David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management noted. “Every full-blown US recession in the past 30 years has been preceded, or accompanied, by a profits recession, as corporate financial balances shifted into deficit.”Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Vix index retreated further on Tuesday, down 7.5 per cent to 16.16.“Volatility levels have eased back, both in equity and currency markets, which has effectively freed up risk budgets,” said Mr Shairp.In deal news, Molson Coors Brewing and SABMiller announced they would launch a joint venture to combine their operations in the US and Puerto Rico.The new entity, known as MillerCoors, is expected to generate annual revenue of some $6.6bn. Molson was the best performer on the S&P 500, 10.5 per cent higher at $56.15.In company news Sprint Nextel shed 1.2 per cent to $18.28 after Gary Forsee stepped down as chief executive. The mobile phone operator also said it expects a net loss of 337,000 subscribers in the third quarter and revised its fully-year profit and revenue guidance downwards.Shares in Google gained 0.9 per cent to $615.19, a new high, helping the company to join the ranks of the 10 most valuable US companies by market capitalisation. Lehman Brothers raised its price target from $610 to $714.Crude oil futures prices rose back above the $80 mark – $1.24 firmer at $80.26 a barrel in New York – giving energy stocks a lift. The S&P energy index rose 1.8 per cent to 583.94.
90;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2007-10-09T19:38:50Z;SABMiller and Coors merge US business;;SABMiller and Molson Coors on Tuesday agreed to merge their US brewing operations to create a rival to market leader Anheuser-Busch.SAB and Coors, the second and third-largest US brewers respectively, said the operation would be named MillerCoors and each would have an equal voting interest. SAB, the larger brewer by both sales and profits, would hold a 58 per cent economic stake and Coors, 42 per cent.The joint venture will have about 30 per cent of the US beer market, leaving it behind Anheuser, which has nearly 50 per cent. Shares in Molson Coors rose by more than 8 per cent in early afternoon trading in the US while Anheuser’s shares were down by 1.3 per cent. Shares in SAB closed up 1.4 per cent in London trading at £14.87The joint venture will have eight breweries in the US. It is not expected to result in any brewery closures although it may lead to job losses. US brewers face growing competition from wines and spirits companies. ”The US alcoholic beverage market is more competitive than it’s ever been,” said Leo Kiely, chief executive of Coors.Graham Mackay, SAB chief executive, said the tie-up created ”a much stronger competitor”.SAB said yesterday it did not expect immediately to match Anheuser’s profit margins, which are more than 17 per cent - nearly double those of Coors or Miller. Mr Mackay said: ”I don’t think it’s realistic to expect …to get to Anheuser’s domestic margins any time soon …but we expect to make progress.”Mr Kiely will be chief executive of MillerCoors, and Tom Long, who has been running the SAB business in the US, will be president and chief commercial officer. Pete Coors, vice-chairman of Coors will be chairman and Mr Mackay will be vice-chairman.The deal, which is conditional on regulatory approval and requires each company to stay in the venture for at least five years, is set to close in mid-2008.The deal, which is conditional on regulatory approval and requires each company to stay in the venture for at least five years, is set to close in mid-2008.Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank advised Molson Coors, while Lehman Brothers advised SAB.

Yesterday, turnover reached nearly 17m shares – 2.5 times the daily average.Elsewhere in the sector, Hammerson rose 4.5 per cent to £11.96, Liberty International added 2.9 per cent to £11.78, and Land Securities gained 2.6 per cent to £16.93.In the wider market, leading shares closed sharply higher, helped by a flurry of mergers and acquisition activity across Europe.The FTSE 100 rose 74.5 points, or 1.1 per cent, to a 10-week high of 6,615.4.
The chancellor’s Pre-Budget report had little affect on the market. The FTSE 250 gained 99.1 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 11,427.8.Northern Rock led the market higher, rising 19.9 per cent to 206¾p on news that the government had offered to guarantee all retail deposits made since September 19.Water stocks were in demand after a consortium led by Australia’s Challenger Infrastructure fund made a knock-out £4.2bn bid for Southern Water.Analysts said the deal valued Southern Water at a 31 per cent premium to its regulated asset base. “This is likely to be supportive to a sector currently trading on a 17.8 per cent premium,” Cazenove said. And it proved to be, with Severn Trent rising 2.3 per cent to £14.66 and Kelda climbing 4.1 per cent to 929½p.United Utilities, which is trying to sell its electricity distribution business, was also lifted by the news, rising 1.6 per cent to 725½p.SABMiller, the brewer, rose 1.4 per cent to £14.87 after announcing plans to fold its US operations into a joint venture with Molson Coors. Traders said the news left Scottish & Newcastle, up 2.5 per cent to 637½p, looking increasingly vulnerable to a bid. S&N was also propped up by speculation that John Dunsmore, its incoming chief executive, had met his opposite number at Carlsberg at the weekend.On the downside, Wolseley fell 2.1 per cent to 855p after Citigroup placed 9m shares at 837p.It was not a good day for construction-related stocks after UBS downgraded its rating on the sector for the first time in seven years.The broker said it was facing strong headwinds that would negatively impact performance. The bearish call unsettled Persimmon, off 2.4 per cent at £10.15, and SIG, 3.2 per cent lower at £10.53.Oil exploration stocks dominated the FTSE 250 leaderboard as Burren Energy, up 28 per cent to £11.80, revealed it had rejected several takeover approaches at up to £11 a share. Premier Oil rose 8.2 per cent to £11.20, while Dana Petroleum put on 5.9 per cent to £11.87 on that news.Debenhams added 4.4 per cent to 105¾p after a push from Cazenove. The broker said annual results, due on October 23, could surprise, with management of the department stores group providing an upbeat outlook.“Management has repeatedly voiced confidence about its product offering for 2008, which, predictably, has been ignored by the market,” Cazenove said, adding that there was a large short position in Debenhams.About 16 per cent of Debenhams’ share capital is currently on loan. However, that figure is more significant than it looks because Debenhams only has a free float of 50 per cent.Takeover rumours continued to swirl around Alfred McAlpine. Its shares rose 5.1 per cent to 523½p amid talk Carillion, up 0.6 per cent to 418p, is working a 575p a share break-up bid.Sports Direct International added 1.8 per cent to 139p on rumours that Baugur had built a stake, and talk of a bid approach saw property company Shaftesbury rise 4 per cent to 557p."
92;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2007-09-04T10:15:16Z;Carlsberg’s new chief;;Imagine that you have just been promoted to the top job. Your feet are under a slightly larger desk and you have unpacked your executive toys. So now what?Luckily for Jørgen Buhl Rasmussen, there should be no need to resort to the incoming chief executive’s trick of kitchen-sinking. Carlsberg has been delivering decent growth in sales and profits, in large part thanks to the Russian operations Mr Rasmussen has been running. Investors seem to be happy, with the shares up a third so far this year.The temptation, then, may be to make a mark as an acquirer. Beverage consolidation is in the air and changes to the Carlsberg Foundation’s charter earlier this year made it possible to issue new shares to fund a deal. Top of the target list will be BBH, the 50-50 joint venture with Scottish & Newcastle in Russia.Unfortunately, to get it would probably mean buying the whole of larger group S&N. This would be something of a stretch, assuming Carlsberg paid a premium to the current enterprise value of £8bn. Competition issues would also mean disposing of the low-growth UK business, which contributes more than a quarter of operating profits. As a forced seller – and with InBev and Molson-Coors ruled out as buyers on market-share grounds, and Diageo on record as uninterested – getting a decent price would be challenging.Far more sensible, but less exciting, would be to persist with efficiency improvements. Although half the group’s sales come from Nordic countries, where Carlsberg enjoys what is in effect a duopoly, profitability in western Europe is still well below that of its competitors. Operating margins there were 9.5 per cent in 2007, compared with 13.5 per cent for its peers, according to Lehman Brothers. Current targets are only to get these to 10-12 per cent by 2009. Beating that would be a good start.

The S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent higher at 1456.81, its highest level in more than six years. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent at 2,497.10.“This morning’s economic data was sort of a mixed bag,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. “But the market put together another decent but unspectacular up day.”The economic data showed a rise in the number of jobless and a fall in January’s industrial output because of reduced car production.Baker Hughes was one of the biggest fallers after it failed to meet analysts’ quarterly profit forecasts.The group’s earnings rose by 27 per cent to $326.2m but its shares plunged 9.4 per cent to $65.19 on investor concerns over weakness in its North American market.In mergers and acquisitions news, shares in Anheuser-Busch were up 3 per cent to $51.75 after Brazil’s Valor Economico reported that the brewer was holding merger talks with InBev of Belgium.The report cited a source close to Marcel Hermann Telles, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Jorge Paulo Lemann – the big investors in InBev who were behind the 2004 merger between Brazilian brewer AmBev and Interbrew that created InBev.Shares in rival brewer Molson Coors also climbed 5.5 per cent to $87.03 on the back of a better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Boeing’s stock rose 2 per cent to $91.71 after the aircraft-maker confirmed that it had received an order from United Parcel Service, the delivery group.Caterpillar, the maker of farm and construction equipment, said it plans to buy back $7.5bn worth of shares over the next five years and made an upbeat statement about its future performance. Its shares rose 2.2 percent to $67.62.Goldman Sachs analysts changed their rating on AMR and JetBlue, sending shares in the two airline groups in opposite directions.Citing its valuation, the analysts reduced their recommendation on AMR, the owner of American Airlines, which sent its shares down 1.2 per cent to $38.05.Meanwhile, shares in Jet-Blue were trading 4.7 per cent higher at $13.85 after the analysts upgraded their rating to “buy” because of its strong margins.

The final voting results are expected to be certified next Friday.The presence of Mr Peltz and Mr Weinstein on the board will step up pressure on William Johnson, chief executive, to execute his plan to cut costs, raise the dividend and increase share buybacks. But given the animosity, it may also increase friction on the board, which could lead to resignations.Trian Group, Mr Peltz’s investment vehicle, is the second-largest Heinz shareholder with a 5.5 per cent stake in the company. On Friday it said the results were “a big victory for all Heinz shareholders”. Trian’s success may spur other investors to take on underperforming companies.Earlier this year Trian nominated five candidates to the Heinz board in an effort to pressure the company into improving its performance and producing higher shareholder returns.Its aggressive plan called on Heinz to cut $575m in spending, reduce the amount it pays to retailers to promote products, sell non-core assets and boost marketing.Heinz said the Trian plan would cripple the company and in June put forward its own strategy, which included cutting costs by $355m over the next two years, reducing promotional spending with retailers by $145m, introducing more than 100 new products in 2007 and buying back $1bn of shares.Heinz is also seeking two additional directors as part of a plan to expand its board to 14 from 12.“We are confident that the board of directors will support the company’s plan to enhance shareholder value and drive our business momentum,” said Michael Mullen, a Heinz spokesman."

97;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2006-06-09T20:55:12Z;Wall Street falls back after heavy sell-off;;Wall Street fell back this week as three days of heavy selling dragged down the main stock indices.During the week, the S&P 500 briefly dipped into negative territory for the year.At one stage the Nasdaq Composite had fallen more than 10 per cent from its high in May, the scale of decline that many market watchers define as a correction. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell back below 11,000.Chipmakers trailed the market, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropping 6.4 per cent. On Wednesday, Citigroup re-vised down its sales forecasts for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices citing the possibility of a price war be-tween the chipmakers.Intel subsequently raised the possibility of just such a price war when it announced late on Thursday that it would cut prices by 60 per cent to gain market share.

The stock gained 6.7 per cent to $31.96. Also bucking the trend in the S&P 500 was BMC Software, which rose after reporting increased profits for the fourth quarter, aided by higher sales and cost-cutting. The shares received a further fillip from upgrades from Piper Jaffray and Goldman Sachs. BMC was up 6.3 per cent for the week at $22.02.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent, or 5.63 points, for the day at 1,252.30, a loss of 2.8 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5 per cent, or 10.26 points, for the day at 2,135.06, a weekly decline of 3.8 per cent. The Dow was down 0.4 per cent, or 46.90 points, for the day to 10,891.92, a loss for the week of 3.2 per cent, its worst week in a year. “We had a choir of Fed members singing to the same tune, that basically interest rates needed to go higher because of oil prices beginning to impact on inflation,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach.“That weighed on stocks and the correction continued. I suspect that the market was discounting higher rates of inflation and higher interest rates.”As the sell-off gathered pace, fears about inflation and interest rate rises – for a long time the dominant concern on Wall Street – were joined by broader fears about the health of the economy. This pushed up traditionally defensive consumer staple stocks such as Procter & Gamble and Molson Coors, while cyclical stocks suffered. Consumer staples groups Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson were rare gainers in the Dow.P&G added 0.9 per cent to $54.45, posting its biggest one day gain in over a year on Thursday. J&J was up 1.1 per cent to $61.38.Also attractive to skittish investors was brewer Molson Coors, which jumped 2.6 per cent to $67.96. Molson has gained 7 per cent in the past two weeks. “Defensive issues have become more fashion-able,” said Mr Cardillo.Slowdown fears meant investors shied away from cyclical and durable goods stocks.

99;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2006-03-28T20:16:02Z;Some mergers are more equal than others;;Alcatel and Lucent were remarkably specific last week in making the only public statement so far about their deal talks.The two telecommunications equipment makers were negotiating a “merger of equals” intended to be priced “at market”, the companies said.Behind the disclosure lay a desire to see that regulators, investors and politicians would not be mistaken: although Alcatel, based in France, is much larger than its US rival, the deal would not be a French takeover. Insiders were even more precise: the board would be evenly split, and Patricia Russo, head of Lucent, would run the combined group, although the headquarters would stay in Paris.There are obvious reasons why both Alcatel and Lucent have been pushing for such a structure as they close in on their all-stock deal, which could be announced this week. For one, it could help smooth the path to regulatory approval in the US, where severe scrutiny is expected to be focused on who is controlling Lucent’s sensitive communications networks and research.A merger of equals may also make a deal possible in terms of price. According to many industry observers, Alcatel would not be willing to pay the extra money associated with a takeover – otherwise known as the control premium.But there may be as many risks as benefits in choosing such a structure, where past transatlantic deals – such as the combinations of drugmakers Pharmacia and Upjohn, drinks companies Guinness and GrandMet, and carmakers Chrysler and Daimler-Benz – have mixed track records.A number of corporate consultants and securities lawyers believe that a merger of equals often causes confusion among employees during the integration, simply defers – rather than eliminates – any political uproar once one side emerges as dominant, and potentially opens up the target to criticism that it did not fetch the highest price for its shareholders.“The phrase ‘merger of equals’ is a misnomer because you always have a buyer and a seller,” says Jeffery Perry, of Ernst & Young’s transaction services unit in Chicago. “It can send the wrong message.”A first danger might come when the senior jobs of the combined group are divided up. Instead of seeking to extract the best of management from both companies, there might be a tendency to allocate jobs simply to maintain equality among the company’s executive ranks. “There is a temptation to have ‘two-in-the-box’ of everything rather than looking very closely at what the strengths of both organisations are going forward,” Mr Perry says.Critics’ of Pharmacia’s merger with Upjohn, where the Swedish-American group’s headquarters were moved to neutral London, have pointed to a similar risk. They say the combination suffered because of management’s reluctance to streamline its operations, which would have required closing certain under-performing facilities around the world. But such moves might have revealed that one side was becoming dominant over the other.Potentially even more worrying for Lucent and Alcatel is the threat posed by shareholders unhappy with a “merger of equals” structure, which will offer Lucent investors little or no premium to the company’s $13.6bn market value. For years, shareholders have accepted no premium deals because of the promise that the combination would, in effect, yield a premium in the future through cost savings.But the advent of hedge funds, which have skewed the composition of many companies’ shareholder bases – particularly those involved in bid situations – in favour of more short-term players, may be reversing that acquiescence. If there is any hint that Lucent could have held out for a better price from another buyer, or even from Alcatel in a full-blown takeover, investors might not approve the transaction. “Shareholders are more active and less bashful,” says one New York-based corporate lawyer. “It doesn’t matter what you call it, if the valuation isn’t right, the deal won’t get done.”This issue has come to fore on a number of recent occasions. Adolph Coors, a US beer group, was last year forced to improve the terms of its merger of equals with Molson after pressure from the Canadian group’s investors. More dramatically, investors scepticism about such deals surfaced in the wake of Daimler-Benz’s merger with Chrysler, when the US automaker’s top shareholder sued the German group’s management for $1.2bn.The claim by Nevada billionaire Kirk Kerkorian – dismissed by a federal judge after a lengthy trial in Delaware that began in December 2003 – was that Daimler had defrauded investors and deprived him of a takeover premium by maintaining the façade of a merger of equals while the German group was surreptitiously plotting a full-blown takeover of the Detroit-based carmaker.Although the trial ended in a legal victory for Daimler, it offered a unique spotlight into how rapidly one side in a merger of equals can become the dominating force. Within a few years, nearly all of DaimlerChrysler’s senior management was German, as was the board. The combined group already had its primary listing – and headquarters – in Germany.With Alcatel and Lucent, another case study is on its way.
100;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2006-01-22T18:10:50Z;January 22 2006: Who’s afraid of Ollanta Humala?;;After a rocky period, Peruvian markets bounced back last week following a poll last Sunday which gave Ollanta Humala a 25-28 per cent lead against his nearest challenger in April’s presidential elections.The reason? Investors had feared that Mr Humala – whose first name means vigilant warrior in Quechua – was about to open up an even bigger lead over Lourdes Flores, the moderate rightwing candidate who had until recently been leading the field.The poll, by Apoyo, Lima’s most credible survey firm, showed Ms Flores would comfortably win a second round run-off. Another poll, published last Thursday, suggested Ms Flores had regained the advantage in the first round. But it would be unwise to take too much comfort.Mr Humala’s support is particularly heavy in rural indigenous areas, a sector of the population that is ignored in Apoyo’s survey. There are signs that the mood among these socially excluded mainly indigenous groups is becoming increasingly radical. That must be one of the conclusions of December’s election in neighbouring Bolivia where Evo Morales won last December’s contest with 50 per cent more votes than opinion polls had predicted. Mr Humala, a nationalist former army officer, is seen as close to both Mr Morales and Venezuela’s populist president Hugo Chávez.It is not likely to be long before opinion polls will again show Mr Humala edging ahead. Peruvian equities and bonds have risen in recent months but they have underperformed their Latin American counterparts. Expect more of the same in coming months.Latin beer warsA clash of Latin America beer titans appears to be in order after last week’s announcement that Femsa, the Mexican brewer, bottler and retailer, is to buy a 68 per cent stake in Brazilian brewer Kaiser for $68m and about $60m in debt.Brazil, of course, is the home turf of AmBev, the region’s biggest brewer and, since its merger with Interbrew of Belgium to form InBev in 2004, part of the biggest brewer in the world. AmBev has been expanding aggressively in South and Central America in recent years. Many view a move into Mexico as only a matter of time.Femsa and Kaiser should not be much of a threat to AmBev at home. AmBev has nearly 70 per cent of Brazil’s market, Kaiser just 8.7 per cent. But while Femsa’s first battle will be to recover market share lost in recent years by Kaiser to other small brewers, industry insiders say it will have to attack AmBev, too. In so doing it will learn a lot about AmBev, famous for having one of the most aggressive corporate cultures in Latin America - knowledge that will be useful if and when AmBev makes a move on Mexico.Femsa must be delighted with the deal. As recently as March 2002 Molson of Canada (before its merger with Coors of the US) paid $765m for 80 per cent of Kaiser, which at the time had 17.2 per cent of the Brazilian market. Molson, to put it mildly, underestimated the challenges. It made ill-advised changes to Kaiser’s distribution, which were subsequently reversed, at a time when Kaiser was under attack from smaller breweries. It was overtaken for second place behind AmBev by Schincariol (many of whose executives were arrested last year for corporate tax evasion).Since 2003 Femsa has owned some of the Brazilian Coca-Cola bottlers that lost (and subsequently regained) Kaiser distribution deals under Molson. This should hand Femsa some easy cost savings with its new acquisition. Kaiser is a powerful brand that, under Femsa, has every chance of growth. But watch for the reaction from AmBev.Cemex’s new opportunityMexican cement makers are about to strike it rich. As early as this week a deal ending a long and bitter dispute about exports to the US will come into effect and present Mexican producers – including the international giant, Cemex – with lucrative opportunities to expand sales.According to details of the agreement between Mexican and US authorities leaked last week, Mexican producers will be allowed to export up to 3m tons of cement to the US this year with a tariff of just $3 a ton. That compares with a $26 a ton “anti-dumping” penalty imposed by Washington since 1990. By 2009 these penalty tariffs will be scrapped as will the cap on the amount Mexico can export.Cemex, Mexico’s largest producer and the world’s third largest, will receive an immediate cash payment of $100m in compensation for duties already paid. It will also be able to use the $65m in provisions set aside to make future payments for other purposes. Cementos de Chihuahua, a smaller producer part-owned by Cemex, will receive $40m.Mexican exports reached 2m tons last year and with demand in the US rising on the back of post-hurricane building work, they should increase significantly.A challenge for the Social ForumThe collapse of the bridge on the Caracas airport road has afforded international fans of Hugo Chávez, flocking to Venezuela for the “alternative Davos”, an opportunity to experience at first hand the consequences of the government’s mismanagement. After arriving at Maiquetia airport, an expected 30,000 visitors can expect an arduous road journey of between three and five hours to reach to Caracas, where the western hemisphere bit of the anti-globalist jamboree is being held.Attendees will probably be more interested in discussing the finer details of anti-imperialist strategy and participative democracy. But they could usefully ask themselves why Mr Chávez for all his talk about changing the world cannot build a simple road. The bridge’s failure was entirely predictable. The fault running underneath it has been unstable since it was built in the 1950s. Mr Chávez is now in his eighth year in office and has had plenty of time to organise construction of an alternative route.Edited by Richard Lapper.

101;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2005-06-09T13:20:03Z;SEC seeks Molson merger documents;;Molson Coors Brewing on Thursday said federal regulators have asked for more information related to first-quarter earnings and the February merger of the two brewers.The US Securities and Exchange Commission has requested voluntary provision of documents and information. Molson Coors is co-operating with the inquiry, it said in a filing.Molson Coors in April announced lower sales volumes in all its main markets, a sizeable first-quarter loss and the departure of Molson’s former chief executive.The results were a disappointing start to the merger of two family-controlled North American brewers and sent the company’s share price tumbling nearly 20 per cent in a day.Several class action lawsuits were filed last month in the US and Canada alleging that the companies misled shareholders by failing to disclose certain business trends before shareholder votes on the merger between the companies.Besides an operating loss, first-quarter performance was dented by a one-time charge of $29.6m for payments to a dozen senior executives who have left since the merger took effect.The acquisition of Coors, based in Denver, Colorado, was designed to broaden the horizons of Montreal-based beyond the mature North American market. But it has been bedevilled by problems, including intense competition from other brands and an unsatisfactory distribution system.

Given that the newsletters are driven by scoops and the parties involved may be a tad reticent to jinx their deal, this could prove costly.""I think there's not enough effort being made to get a hold of people,"" Tom Lamont, the division's colourful editor, tells Observer. In the 1990s Lamont was known for his cheap cigars - smoked in the New York office, after lunch - bowls of candy and scrawl across stories he didn't like.The policy will be discussed at next week's editors' meeting. ""Personally I'd prefer to donate the money to charity, although I'm sure some people would rather have a party with it,"" he says.Lamont admits that the surcharge could be unfair for certain beats. ""If you're doing a syndicated loan story, you could call 10 banks and get 10 did not return calls, so you could be out five bucks,"" he says. ""Then again, if you're on the mutual fund beat and a flack's only too happy to get on the phone, then that's different.""Rajun DemocratsPlenty of Democrats are interested in the unusually heated contest to become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee. James Carville isn't one of them.""It doesn't matter in the sweep of history who is or isn't the chairman of the DNC,"" Carville said on Thursday at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor.But the fiery Democratic strategist said the all-out race for the job, set to be decided at a DNC meeting on February 12, was ""indicative of the state of the Democratic party"".""Can you imagine the Republicans having six guys running around the country?"" Carville asked, shaking his head. The field includes Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and presidential candidate, and former congressman Martin Frost.Carville wouldn't say who he wants in the job but said he tried to get Wesley Clark, the retired general, to run. ""I wish someone had taken charge"" with a few telephone calls or a meeting in a smoke-filled room, Carville said, adding that the party job ""is supposed to be a rigged deal"".Drink upMolson shareholders could have one big cause for regret if they decide on Friday to approve the venerable Canadian brewer's contentious merger with Adolph Coors of Colorado.For as long as most Montrealers can remember, North America's oldest beer producer has held shareholder meetings at its flagship brewery on the shores of the St Lawrence River.No sooner was the serious business over in the John Molson Room than everyone repaired to the adjacent pub to savour a Molson Canadian or one of the company's lesser-known brands.""It was absolutely lovely,"" recalls Pat Baker, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, comparing Molson's offerings with the coffee and sandwiches on offer at most annual meetings.Sadly, today's meeting will be held at a more conventional venue - the Fairmont Hotel in downtown Montreal. Beer is unlikely to be on tap. With luck, shareholders will be as vocal in asking for future meetings to revert to the brewery as they have been in persuading Molson and Coors to sweeten the terms of their deal.Speaking of the UNIn a sign of its deep fear of the US these days, the United Nations wasted no time shooting down a statement from one of its most respected officials on Iraq's elections.After a journalist said he had met US troops involved in a get-out-the-vote campaign, Carina Perelli, the UN's chief elections expert, reacted with alarm - saying she had spent some time ""asking, begging military commanders precisely not to do that"" and called the US military ""extremely, I would say over-enthusiastic"" in its pre-election activities.The UN quickly realised it had another public relations mess on its hands. It sent out a statement, saying Perelli had ""mis-spoke"" and stressing the US military played a crucial role in maintaining security.As the UN promises a public information revolution over coming months, Observer wonders why they chose the celebrated Nixonian phrase, so favoured by his press secretary Ron Ziegler.Already missedHeinrich von Pierer is no doubt wondering what impression he really left on Siemens. On Thursday he bade an unemotional farewell to shareholders of the German industrial powerhouse he steered for 12 years.A day earlier, he sent a farewell e-mail to the conglomerate's 430,000 employees, with best wishes for the coming year. Von Pierer, who is among Germany's best-known business leaders, admits to being somewhat surprised at one reply, from an employee in China.The note, he says, read something like: ""Thank you for the kind e-mail, but who are you?""

103;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2005-01-18T08:39:58Z;South African beer sales boost SABMiller;;SABMiller said global beer volumes rose by 5 per cent during the third quarter as good weather in South Africa helped increase consumer thirst for lager in its domestic market.The world’s third-largest brewer enjoyed growth of 4 per cent in its home market, South Africa, thanks to the summer season and robust consumer spending.SAB, which brews Miller Lite and Pilsner Urquell, also benefited from strong growth across parts of eastern Europe, including Poland, Russia and Romania, which helped offset weaker Italian and Hungarian markets.Africa and Asia saw 10 per cent growth in organic lager volumes.But the group said Miller’s beer sales to retailers slipped 0.3 per cent behind last year as conditions remained difficult. SAB, which is midway through a turnround of Miller, the US brewer it acquired in 2002, flagged a slowdown in this market in the second quarter as the broader US beer market stagnated.The group also cautioned in November that the second half of the year would be tougher as it faced strong comparables from last year, as well as increased spending on marketing and raw materials.Tough market conditions in El Salvador led to an 8 per cent fall in carbonated soft drinks in the third quarter but lager volumes in Central America increased 3 per cent ahead of anticipated increased excise charges.Last week SAB said it might attempt to further strengthen its US presence by opening takeover talks with Molson if the Canadian brewer’s $3.5bn merger with Adolph Coors of the US was turned down by shareholders.The group’s shares, which are listed in London and Johannesburg, rose 0.6 per cent to 858p in early morning trade on Tuesday.
104;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2005-01-14T13:46:34Z;Lex: Coors/Molson;;The problem with lousy deals is that there are few riches with which to bribe dissatisfied shareholders. An example is Molson's proposed merger with Adolph Coors, which requires two-thirds approval by both classes of Molson's shares. Mounting opposition has forced Coors to sweeten the offer further. The increase in Molson's debt-financed special dividend benefits unaffiliated Molson shareholders. This is at the expense of Coors and Eric Molson, the brewer's domineering shareholder and chairman, whose investment vehicle will waive participation in the pay-out. In total, the special dividend now amounts to a net value transfer equivalent to about 7 per cent of Molson's share price.Judged by recent brewing deals, that is hardly generous. Admittedly, Molson's share price has already anticipated some of the meagre synergies the deal will generate. Performance at Molson's main Canadian business has deteriorated sharply in recent months and is heavily dependent on distributing Coors. Still, there is little doubt that Molson could secure a better price by selling out to a buyer who actually knows how to turn round brewers. SABMiller, which has already indicated interest, comes to mind. Molson shareholders have good reasons to fear that Eric Molson who controls the majority of voting shares will block any alternative bid, no matter how sensible. But that is all the more reason to demand at least one further concession: equal voting rights for all shareholders in the new capital structure.
105;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2005-01-13T22:50:38Z;Molson, Coors to increase merger dividend;;Molson and Adolph Coors, the two North American brewers pursuing a $3.5bn merger, on Thursday night agreed to nearly double the special dividend for Molson shareholders in connection with the proposed deal.The move came amid uncertainty over the fate of the transaction, which is scheduled to be voted on January 28 by Molson investors, a significant number of whom have said they oppose the transaction.Coors, based in the US, and Molson, based in Canada, had already offered Molson shareholders a special dividend worth C$381m in November. On Thursday, they nearly doubled its size to C$640m.The increase in the dividend became necessary as the outcome of the shareholder vote began to lean in favour of the opponents of the transaction.On Thursday night, one person close to the companies said that investors who were previously opposed to the deal would support it in light of the increased dividend, and predicted that the merger would be approved. Aim Trimark, one of Molson's largest shareholders, said it was in favour of the deal because the terms had been revised.Pressure on Molson to offer an additional incentive for investors to support the Coors merger reached boiling point this week following SABMiller's move to portray itself as an alternative bidder for Molson. The South African brewer said it hoped to enter merger discussions with Molson if the Coors deal falls through, despite the fact that Eric Molson, the chairman who effectively has a veto over large decisions at the company, said he was not interested in considering other options other than the Coors deal.Mr Molson on Thursday night said: “As shareholders with a controlling interest and a long-term view, we believe the merger with Coors provides the best business opportunity for Molson to be a proactive player in the global beer market.“Throughout the day, people familiar with the thinking at Molson and Coors said they were considering sweetening the offer. One person familiar with the matter said there was a “good chance“ of an improved offer in the coming days. Another said Molson was deciding “what could be done“ in terms of sweetening the deal.If the companies had decided to sweeten the deal by modifying the exchange ratio, the date of the shareholder vote would also have had to be postponed.A merger between Coors and Molson would unite two of North America's most well-known family-owned companies to create the world's fifth-largest brewer, behind industry giants such as Anheuser-Busch and InBev.When the two companies announced the deal in July last year they identified annual synergies of $175m - half of which could be achieved within 18 months. The two companies already have an agreement to sell each other's brands under licence.
106;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2004-10-13T23:17:18Z;Tight race in battle for Republican-held Colorado;;"The race for Colorado's open Senate seat offers two different versions of the American success story. One candidate is the scion of a brewing empire founded by German immigrants, the other a farmer and rancher from a poor family who became Colorado's first Hispanic official elected statewide.Pete Coors, the brewing magnate, and Ken Salazar, the state attorney-general, are the colourful personalities at the heart of a race that could determine the balance of power in the Senate.Colorado has recently been a Republican-leaning state but the party may have an uphill battle hanging on to the seat occupied since 1993 by Ben Nighthorse Campbell. While the latest poll shows the presidential candidates running neck-and-neck there, in a Gallup poll last week Mr Salazar enjoyed an 11-point advantage over Mr Coors.Mr Salazar represents a rare breed among Democrats because rural voters - the traditional Republican power base in the west - appreciate his western Colorado heritage and his experience as a rancher.""A Democrat running in Colorado is very difficult but Ken Salazar can do it,"" says Rick Ridder, a Democratic consultant. ""He gets 15,000 to 20,000 votes here that no other Democrat gets.""Political and demographic change may also favour Mr Salazar. Colorado's population has risen by 35 per cent since 1990 and its Hispanic community today accounts for 18 per cent of all residents. Mr Salazar is supported by 75 per cent of Hispanic voters, while Mr Kerry has the backing of only 55 per cent, says Floyd Ciruli, a Denver-based analyst.He is also independent, says Eric Sondermann, a political consultant. Mr Salazar is ""usually nowhere to be seen"" during frequent visits from John Kerry, the Democrats' presidential nominee, Mr Sondermann says. Mr Coors, on the other hand, makes it his business to stay at the side of President George W. Bush through virtually every visit.The Coors Brewing Company, of which Mr Coors is chairman, has loomed large in the election. The company has made Mr Coors an icon, starring in its national television commercials as a rugged outdoorsman. His family brewery gives its name to the popular baseball park that has anchored Denver's downtown renewal.""He announced his candidacy and he already had higher name recognition than the governor,"" says Ted Halaby, chairman of the Colorado Republican party. But Democrats have wielded the company against Mr Coors, much as they have made Halliburton a political liability for Vice-President Dick Cheney. Salazar campaign commercials have flaunted Coors Brewing's environmental problems and record of job outsourcing. They have also flagged up its efforts to lower the state drinking age and its racy television commercials, which tend to feature top-heavy cheerleaders - both of which bother conservative Christian voters.There are also signs that Mr Coors is still shaky on policy. During a recent debate on NBC's Meet the Press television programme, he made a Bush-like gaffe when he referred to a nuc- lear North Dakota. Mr Coors also demonstrated scant knowledge of the Patriot Act - even while accusing Mr Salazar of opposing it - and offered no credible explanation of how he would uphold his pledge to balance record federal budget deficits while also supporting tax cuts and greater defence spending.Mr Sondermann calls Mr Salazar's distance from mainstream Democrats a key distinction in Republican-leaning Colorado, where 32 per cent of registered voters are politically unaffiliated, compared with 37 per cent who are Republicans and 31 per cent Democrats.For Mr Salazar, a victory would end the Democrats' long dry spell in Colorado. Its last big victory was 10 years ago, when Roy Romer was elected governor. In the 2000 campaign neither presidential candidate even visited the state: Mr Bush's victory seemed a foregone conclusion.A Coors loss would be a blow to Republicans defending a three-seat majority in the Senate - and to the White House and state strategists who selected him as a safer bet than Bob Schaffer, an ex-congressman and traditional conservative.Mr Salazar's attempts to broach crucial regional issues such as chronic water shortages and the effects of rapid growth on the environment and economy have failed to lure Mr Coors away from the president's shadow.Mr Coors has not lived up to analysts' expectations that his management experience would attract conservative Republicans. But Mr Sondermann is surprised that Mr Salazar has not emphasised local issues.""You have to go way down the list"" of voter influences to find topics such as the environment, the economy and business, Mr Ciruli says. So far, he says, the dominant factors have been personality and partisanship: ""It's 'I like him' or 'I don't'."""
107;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2004-09-21T01:34:36Z;Lex: Molson;;Lyndon Johnson once said: “A man without a vote is man without protection.” But in business, protection has a price. Typically, only outright owners of equity get to vote. In Canada, however, things are different. Molson, the brewer, has enfranchised option-holders to vote in its proposed merger with Adolph Coors. Some may believe that since a merger will have an impact on the underlying stock, option-holders should be given an opportunity to voice their views.But rampant democracy has its problems in this instance. For until owners of share options exercise their options, they have arguably not paid for the same rights that shareholders enjoy. This has a knock-on effect on equity investors. They may not have realised that their voting power could be diluted in this way.Economic dilution from stock options is a well-documented issue. At least that dilution is partially offset by the payment the option-holder makes to exercise the options. But option-holders in Molson will not have to pay extra, it seems, for the right to vote.Molson has said that giving option-holders a vote is not unusual in Canada. What makes it particularly significant in this case, however, is that the proposed merger with Coors has met with some criticism. Admittedly, the number of share options is still small relative to the outstanding share count. But if the vote is very tight, they could become significant. This is presumably not what regular shareholders signed up for when they bought Molson's equity.
108;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2004-08-11T23:03:23Z;Observer - US;;"Drinks on the houseSo Peter Coors, of beer fame, will be the Republican candidate for Ben Nighthorse Campbell's vacant Senate seat in November. The chairman-on-leave of Adolph Coors breweries triumphed over rival candidate Bob Schaffer in the state's Republican primary on Tuesday.As victory approached, Coors joked that the first person he wanted to thank was Senator Campbell, for deciding not to run. The Republican National Committee may not share his sentiments; Coors faces a potentially tough challenge from Ken Salazar, state attorney-general and the first Hispanic to hold state-wide office in Colorado.But should we also be prepared for a clash of brewing titans? Observer notes that August Busch IV, president of rival Anheuser-Busch, was among the 200 business leaders who endorsed the Kerry-Edwards ticket earlier this month. There is one point on which both might agree, however: in June, Coors said he supported returning the legal drinking age in the US to 18, rather than 21.Fly boyRalph Nader is continuing his lonely assault on the presidency. But is he perhaps sounding a little desperate in his efforts to persuade voters to get him on state ballots? The Nader-Camejo would-be ticket has now announced that it has appointed Southwest Airlines as “its Unofficial Campaign Airline”.“George W. Bush has his Air Force One to under-reimburse for campaign trips. John Kerry has his leased Boeing 757 to tour the country,” Nader declares. “But we have Southwest Airlines and its entire fleet of aircraft at our disposal.” He goes on to praise its “frugal tickets, pleasant, responsive people, with humour and a desire to say yes, and very interesting passengers”.Nader also puts in a good word for Herb Kelleher, the airline's founder, who he says succeeds “because he cares about his employees and passengers far more than the kind of compensation packages, contingent stock options, and golden parachutes demanded by his counterparts”.More controversially, the campaign is advocating the return of roasted peanuts widely removed from US flights because of the risks to the nut allergic.Which just shows you can't please all the people all the time.Baggage bonanzaBritish Airways is doing its bit to deal with some of the ups and downs of the transatlantic airline business. The airline has dispatched a special flight to the US, packed exclusively with luggage stranded at London's Heathrow last week by storms and those oh-so-familiar “technical failures”.“There are no passengers on the flight. They are putting bags in the cabin where they would normally sit. They are just cramming it full,” a spokeswoman said. In all, 7,000 bags were left behind in London. All were due to be in the US by yesterday.Postal purgationThe US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is widely seen as a bastion of liberal jurisprudence. So it was perhaps a little surprising that the San Francisco-based court this week upheld the sentencing of a man to stand outside a post office for a day, wearing a sign reading: “I stole mail. This is my punishment.”In a 2-1 ruling, judges rejected the argument that the punishment was aimed purely at humiliating Shawn Gementera, a 24-year old petty thief, saying it sought instead to make him aware of the gravity of the crime.Various state courts have had several attempts at similar public purgation of guilt in the past, such as proposing the wearing of incriminating T-shirts, or vehicle registration plates highlighting drink-driving convictions but most have been overturned on appeal.The Ninth Circuit panel has taken things to a new level, while suggesting that it is being characteristically innovative, by contrasting the punishment with the alternative of a longer prison sentence.Aside from two months in jail, Gementera was ordered to apologise to his victims and to watch postal customers trying to recover missing mail at a lost-and-found window.Lee languageAmong his other achievements, Lee Kuan Yew, modern Singapore's founding father, is known for having penned one of the best-written political memoirs in recent years. However, his son, who become the city-state's new leader today, appears not to match him as a wordsmith.The elder Lee was appointed this week to a newly created cabinet advisory post, with the odd-sounding title of “minister mentor” as he vacated his previous position as senior minister.Lee said his son “chose [the title] from a list of alternatives found in a thesaurus to describe an old political warrior who gives of his sincere advice based on his experience”.Perhaps Lee the elder's first task in his new post should be to educate his son in the political benefits of finding a more zappy title.Chill outThe downfall of Saddam Hussein has left the world a little less well-endowed with despotic leaders with a penchant for bold architectural statements.But Saparmurat Niyazov, president of Turkmenistan, is doing his best to keep the flame alive or, in his case, frozen. The Central Asian strongman is already building one of the world's largest mosques in the largely desert republic.Now he's announced that he wants to build an ice palace in the mountains outside Ashgabat, the capital, which already has a a cable car and an aquarium. “Our children can learn to ski,” Niyazov enthused on national television. Given Turkmenistan's soaring summer temperatures, this is one grandiose scheme that might not last for the mandatory 1,000 years.observer@ft.com"
109;TAP;Molson Coors Brewing Company;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
