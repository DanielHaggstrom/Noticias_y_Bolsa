Steel plates for repairing broken bones: no. Bill Brebrick, sales manager for Zapp Precision Wire, has been learning fast about what the US government will exempt from its tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium.Specialised wire made in Germany, sold by Zapp to be made into windscreen wipers in Mexico, is available only on import, the US department of commerce has ruled, and has therefore won an exemption. Shaped plates used to repair badly broken bones, however, could in the government’s view be made in the US, so Zapp faces tariffs on those unless it finds a domestic supplier.The Trump administration in March introduced tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium, and also set up a process for US importers to request exclusions. As application for requests on tens of thousands of products have flooded in, many companies said they were finding the bureaucracy frustrating and the decisions bewildering.Winners and losers are being chosen seemingly arbitrarily by the government, they complain, distorting markets and disrupting supply chains. Meanwhile, a backlog of decisions continues to grow.“Manufacturing was doing so well,” said Mr Brebrick. “People would like to get back to business as usual. Let us compete on a level playing field and leave us alone. No more regulation, please!”Zapp, which is German-owned and has its US manufacturing centre in South Carolina, filed more than 30 requests for exclusions and has received just 12 decisions so far. One has been granted, 11 were declined. Mr Brebrick is finding it hard to get explanations for the decisions. He has called the commerce department half a dozen times, using the numbers published for inquiries, and left messages but has heard nothing back.A Financial Times analysis of the exemption requests filed and published by the government suggests Zapp has been less fortunate than other companies in its hit rate with tariff exclusions. As of the end of Friday, 55 per cent of the 933 decisions announced by the commerce department on requests for exclusions from the steel tariff had been to approve an exemption.But Zapp’s experience is typical of the daunting bureaucratic complexity of the process and the unpredictability of its results. Officials in the commerce department are being called on to make snap judgments about highly complex questions of industrial capacity.Companies that want to import products that are not, or cannot be, made in the US, according to the government’s judgment, can be granted selective exemptions. Products deemed to have home-produced alternatives cannot escape. US businesses are often cautious about discussing the process on the record, not wanting to jeopardise their chances of securing one of the valuable exclusions. But complaints about the process are widespread. As one industry representative put it, there is “a lack of transparency and a lack of consistency”.The sour joke among opponents of Mr Trump’s strategy is that while his tariffs may do little to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, he has at least been highly successful in creating work for the federal government. As of close of business on Friday, more than 16,000 requests for exemptions from the steel tariff had been posted on the regulations.gov website. The commerce department’s Bureau of Industry and Security had granted 516 and denied 417. The total number of requests that have been sent in is thought to be several thousand higher: it can take a few weeks for the department to post the request online.Companies have taken widely different approaches to requesting tariffs. Voestalpine, the Austrian steel group, has filed more than 3,000 exclusion requests, each covering a particular highly detailed product specification. Other companies have filed much broader requests for general categories.The decisions made by officials are similarly variable. The notices announcing decisions are brief, giving only a cursory explanation of the department’s reasoning, and have often left companies struggling to understand their thinking.

Exemption: DeniedRoyal Dutch Shell, for example, applied for tariff exemptions for high-specification steel pipes able to resist the pressures, temperatures and corrosive threats found in deep water oil and gas production, arguing that only Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation of Japan supplied a product that could meet these demands. The commerce department ruled that it accepted the argument for tubing 3.5 inches in diameter — but not for tubing 4.5 inches in diameter.Sometimes the differences mean varying treatment for competing companies in the same industry. Schick, the razor company, has been granted 16 exemptions for different grades of the steel used to make blades. Gillette, the razor division of Procter & Gamble, which employs about 1,350 people in Massachusetts, has applied for similar exemptions but as of Friday had not received any decisions.So far, the department seems to be close to meeting its objective of delivering a decision on applications for exclusions within 90 days, but the size of the backlog is raising fears among steel-using industries that delays could start to mount, creating additional problems. Wilbur Ross, commerce secretary, made a request to Congress for more funds to pay for the increased workload, but he was turned down, and the department has been redeploying staff from other activities to help process applications.The Department of Commerce said that it was making “considerable progress” on the requests for tariff exemptions, adding new decisions daily. The total reached 1,150 on Monday, it said. “We will be posting substantially more in the coming weeks,” a spokesperson said. “We are optimising our efforts with the resources we have.”Sometimes, officials appear to be denying exemptions for more advanced imported products on the grounds that less sophisticated US alternatives are available.Plains All American, the US pipeline group, is importing steel pipe from Greece, made using an advanced manufacturing process that it says is not available from US suppliers. The commerce department turned down its request for an exemption from the tariff on the grounds that similar pipe using an older technology was produced in the US.Lewis Leibowitz, a trade lawyer who represents many companies seeking tariff exclusions, said there was a risk that US steel producers would use the tariffs to protect outdated technologies. “They are saying ‘we are going to stop anybody that tries to bring in a better mousetrap’, and the commerce department has just bought into that. And that is disturbing,” he said.Plains said the project, a pipeline in Texas to carry oil from the booming Permian Basin shale region, will still go ahead using the imported pipe, which has already been paid for. But it argued that the tariff “risks US energy security and American jobs” and said it was “reviewing our options to challenge this decision”.Its chief executive will be raising his concerns at a hearing on the exclusion process held by the House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday.Under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, the legal basis of the tariffs, there is no formal process for appealing against a decision. Many of the denials have been issued on the basis that the application was incomplete, offering companies the chance to resubmit requests providing more detail. That restarts the process from the beginning, adding delays and increased paperwork for both the companies and the commerce department, but does at least leave open the possibility of relief. For other companies, the only option seems to be legal action, but that looks like a long and expensive process.US steelmakers, including US Steel and Nucor, have been active participants in the process, filing hundreds of objections to proposed exclusions. Sometimes they argue they can already supply the product or an equivalent, other times they say they could be in a position to produce it within weeks or months.The burden is being placed on the Bureau of Industry and Security to decide speedily which side is representing the position most accurately.Wiley Rein, Nucor’s law firm, has submitted objections to about 10 per cent of the published applications for exemptions from the steel tariffs. Alan Price, a lawyer at the firm, said he thought the bureau had done a good job in setting up a new process for deciding on exclusions so quickly: “In the long run, there is probably some room for improvement. But decisions have not been unduly delayed.”He added: “If people want to turn this into a legal process to make lawyers rich, they can do that. But Commerce [department] set the process for section 232….and that process is moving forward.”Some US companies worry, however, that as Mr Trump pushes ahead with additional tariffs, including new measures aimed at China and the threatened charges on imported cars and components, the administrative process will become only more complex.“You are going to see these same types of issues occur again,” said Alexander Russ of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers. “The problems are going to be compounded.”"
1;NUE;Nucor Corp;2018-03-14T10:00:38Z;Nucor chief on Trump and the case for protection;John Ferriola wants end to piecemeal ‘whack-a-mole’ response to steel dumping;For Nucor, the largest US steel group by market capitalisation, 2017 was a paradoxical year. The domestic market was difficult, with the share taken by imports rising sharply, but the group had its most profitable year since before the financial crisis of 2008-09.“For us and our customers it was a better year than the market,” says John Ferriola, Nucor’s chief executive since 2013 — speaking shortly before the March 1 White House meeting of steel executives, at which he sat alongside the president as Mr Trump announced plans to introduce tariffs.Nucor’s pre-tax profits in 2017 were $1.75bn, up 35 per cent from 2016. The company has outpaced much of the US steel industry over the past few decades. Its mini-mills, using mostly scrap metal as an input, have proved highly competitive against rivals using the older basic oxygen furnace technology to make steel from pig iron.Mr Ferriola adds that the company has also benefited from sustained investment, which it kept up during the downturn. Among those investments were increases in capacity for mills in Nebraska, Tennessee and South Carolina that make engineered bar, which is used in industries including energy, transport and in manufacturing earthmoving equipment and vehicles.The investment paid off with a 7 per cent rise in sales of engineered bar and sheet products to the carmaking industry last year, even though vehicle production fell by 3 per cent.Mr Trump had helped the steel industry before his decision on tariffs, Mr Ferriola says. The deregulation strategy has been important, not so much for rules directly affecting steelmaking, but in a regulatory approach that aims to remove barriers to investment for the industry and clients. He says: “Time can be spent meeting the needs of our company and serving our customers, rather than filling out paperwork.”He is a strong supporter of the shake-up of the US tax system that was passed into law at the end of last year, including a reduction in the main rate of corporate tax from 35 per cent to 21 per cent, and temporarily enhanced allowances for some types of capital investment. The company booked a $175m gain from the tax changes in the fourth quarter of 2017, but Mr Ferriola expects a much broader impact.“Tax reform was an important issue for Nucor, for the whole industry, and for our customers,” he says. “The additional returns that we will see from this . . . I am sure will spur us to make even greater investments quicker.”The company has six growth projects (such as installing a new micro mill) under way this year, five in the US and one in Mexico. Overshadowing all of these developments, however, is the question of competition from imports.“We’ve been fighting illegally traded imports for as long as I’ve been in the business, which is a long time,” Mr Ferriola says. He began his career in 1974 with Bethlehem Steel, a one-time pillar of industrial America that went bankrupt in 2001. Mr Ferriola had moved over to Nucor, the rising power in the industry, 10 years before.He talks about illegally traded imports because he says that steel has often been dumped in the US at below-cost prices and supported by subsidies from foreign governments. The frequent successes of the US industry in making cases for countervailing and anti-dumping duties are evidence enough of that, he says.But he argues that those cases have been a game of “whack-a-mole”: as soon as a particular abuse has been identified and blocked, another problem emerges with a different product or a different country. Hence the need for a “comprehensive solution” to protect the industry. He was speaking before the tariff plan was announced, but said he would applaud whatever action the president took.“It’s going to be extremely beneficial to the steel industry . . . and it will be President Trump fulfilling a promise he made on the campaign trail,” he says.Steel-consuming industries such as appliance makers were concerned about possible import restrictions and higher prices, but Mr Ferriola says they ought to be supportive. “If we don’t enforce our trade laws today, it becomes obvious to other countries that they can violate our trade laws with impunity. It might be steel today, but tomorrow it will be appliances.”
2;NUE;Nucor Corp;2018-03-14T10:00:36Z;US steel industry changes up a gear for carmakers;Producers are developing new, lighter grades, but R&D investment is needed;President Donald Trump’s pledge to revive the US steel industry now has foundations. The decision by Washington to impose heavy tariffs on overseas steel has cheered the domestic sector, which has long complained of being undercut by imports.Yet for the industry to return to anywhere near its past glories, innovation driven by research and development spending will also be essential.Even if less foreign steel arrives on US shores, the metal faces increasing competition from other materials — particularly in carmaking. Steelmakers will also be under pressure to keep down prices, given warnings from other industries that higher steel costs could make their own plants in the US uncompetitive and result in job losses.“The cost of steelmaking in the US is higher than anywhere else in the world. They need to look at how they can reduce it,” says Alex Griffiths, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy.The American Iron and Steel Institute, a lobby group, says labour productivity in the sector has increased fivefold since the early 1980s, but argues investment opportunities could be lost without tariffs. But economists and policymakers opposed to protectionism say the measures may stifle innovation by insulating companies from foreign competition.“Domestic mills have never spent a lot of money on research,” says Chuck Bradford, a veteran industry analyst. Even so, he adds that US steelmakers have been developing new grades to help car manufacturers produce lighter vehicles to improve fuel efficiency, as required by tighter emissions regulations.A wake-up call came in 2014 when Ford began to use aluminium, which is lighter and more expensive than steel, for the body of its F150 pick-up truck, the country’s best-selling car. This raised questions about whether steel’s dominant position in one of its key markets would be eroded. The car industry accounts for about a quarter of US steel demand, according to the AISI.The largest US-listed steelmaker by output, Nucor, is working on the development of “third generation” advanced high-strength steels (AHSS) for automotive use. These grades are stronger, so can be rolled out very thinly, meaning that less is used, saving weight. They are also more ductile, meaning they are easier to work on without damage.“In the past you’ve seen some of the Asian companies develop some of these third-generation steels a little bit earlier than the rest of the industry, but the US has responded pretty quickly,” says Dean Kanelos, automotive technical lead at Nucor.As the world’s largest steelmaker with industrial operations in 18 countries, ArcelorMittal’s research and development activities are by nature international and spread widely. But it, too, is developing new grades in the US.At its Calvert plant in Alabama, one of the world’s most advanced steel finishing facilities that it co-owns with Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal, ArcelorMittal is developing a new third-generation AHSS.A wake-up call came when Ford said it would use aluminium for the best-selling car in the US“This particular product doesn’t exist any place in the world,” says Greg Ludkovsky, ArcelorMittal’s head of global R&D. “We aren’t declaring commercial victory on this, but we produced this material with the desired characteristics in Calvert.” The company says it could be used in structural car parts, such as bumper beams, door beams and rails.Despite the financial pain felt by some companies in recent years, a number of investments into new facilities demonstrate a confidence among US steelmakers. In some cases, this is being driven by a desire to supply “differentiated” steel products, as opposed to commodities.Nucor is spending $230m on an expansion at its Arkansas plant, with an additional cold rolling mill to make advanced high-strength grades for the automotive industry. In Ohio, a $400m zinc galvanising line is being built by US Steel and its partner Kobe Steel of Japan, on the back of demand from carmakers.Another development that some observers believe could reshape the industry are so-called micro mills. Traditionally, steel was made on massive sites with large blast furnaces that turn raw materials into molten iron.The US industry was transformed in the 1980s by “mini mills”, which are smaller, more flexible, cheaper to build and today represent the majority of US production. They use electric arc furnaces to re-melt and refine scrap steel.Micro mills are smaller still. Advocates say they allow for the efficient production of commodity steels, used in construction, for local markets. Texas-based Commercial Metals Company has run one for almost a decade and has commissioned a second one, while Nucor has committed $250m to build a micro mill and is eyeing sites for another.Mr Bradford says, however, there is limited scope for US companies to innovate the steelmaking process itself, because equipment is largely bought from Germany, Italy or Japan. “Domestic steelmakers do not have the capability to develop new [production] technology and more money won’t matter,” he adds.
3;NUE;Nucor Corp;2018-03-08T19:12:18Z;US steel stocks trim gains ahead of White House meeting;;US steel stocks are sharply lower on Thursday just a couple of hours out from Donald Trump’s expected signing of a bill to impose heavy tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium.It has been one trading week since the US president caught the market off guard last Thursday with the tariff announcement. Notwithstanding today’s performance, the direction for US and global metals producers has been clear.Although US names like Nucor, US Steel, Steel Dynamics and AK Steel are all more than 3 per cent lower today, they have largely clung to the gains posted since March 1 when the tariffs were announced. International steel and aluminium producers, which would suffer from the proposed duties, are down, in most cases by 2 per cent or more.Analysts at Moody’s noted that the tariffs announcement was favourable for the domestic steel and aluminium sector in the near term, but “the long-term implications of this decision may not be as favourable”.For US manufacturers, the tariffs “will likely lead to significant increases in steel and aluminium prices in the US, which will hurt domestic industrial manufacturers that rely on these commodities as key raw materials in production,” said David Berge, senior vice-president at Moody’s.Meanwhile, the impact of the tariffs “would be manageable for the Asian steel sector . . . because exports to the US account for relatively small portions of their total steel production,” according to Sean Hwang, an analyst at Moody’s.

US Steel dropped 2.5 per cent to $26.67, Steel Dynamics fell 2 per cent to $36.17 and AK Steel fell 1.9 per cent to $5.69.The price of hot rolled coil steel index futures dipped 6.8 per cent to $590 per contract this year with a drop of 7 per cent since the start of September putting pressure on steel companies in the near term, said analysts.“HRC prices remain under pressure,” said Chris Olin, an analyst at Longbow Research. “Trading and distribution contacts now see downside risk toward $560-$580.”Estimates from the World Steel Association show the growth in global demand for steel set to slow in 2018 as China’s consumption is expected to flatline.Overall steel demand will increase 1.6 per cent to 1.65bn tonnes in 2018, said the trade body, down from a 2.8 per cent underlying growth rate in 2017.US steel companies have had a turbulent year so far, mired in the debate over possible trade tariffs and the impact it could have on steel prices.But despite vocal urgency from the current administration, plans have failed to advance.Mr Trump is said to have rejected a Chinese proposal to cut steel overcapacity that was endorsed by some of his top advisers, according to several people familiar with the internal debate.Nucor and Steel Dynamics are both set to report earnings this week. US Steel and AK Steel both report at the end of the month.The companies underperformed the broader market as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite all reached new closing highs. The S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent to 2,557.64, lead by telecommunications and financials. The Dow Jones Industrial moved 0.4 per cent higher to 22,956.96 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 6,624.00.Elsewhere, computer software company Adobe also struggled, falling 2.3 per cent to $150.46 after Deutsche Bank analysts downgraded the company.Adobe has enjoyed a strong rally this year, rising 46 per cent so far, but the Deutsche analysts expect the company’s rapid growth to slow, adding that they have concerns over its cloud marketing business.“More cautious feedback from partners on lengthening sales cycles in Digital Marketing — the main growth driver — and a relatively full valuation likely means the stock trades sideways for the near term,” said the analysts.

7;NUE;Nucor Corp;2017-07-20T17:24:14Z;The corner of the US stock market that cannot tune out Trump;Steel investors and analysts must pay close attention to the US president;No investor could ignore Donald Trump when he captured the White House. Promises to cut corporation tax galvanised the stock market while a pledge to repeal Obamacare put the healthcare sector on edge.Six months since his inauguration, it is becoming easier for money managers to tune out the 45th US president as confidence in the ability of Mr Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress to deliver on promises dwindles. Ambitions to kill Obamacare foundered in Congress this week.The president, for example, has been mentioned by just two of the first 25 companies to have reported second-quarter earnings, according to Factset. That compares with 16 mentions from the first 25 companies in the fourth quarter.However, there is one corner of the US stock market where the requirement to follow Mr Trump’s every word is as urgent as it was at his election: those invested in steel companies.With gridlock resurfacing in Congress, attention has turned to sectors where the president can change policy through executive orders — and the steel industry is on the frontline.“The fact that the legislative agenda has gone a lot slower makes the likelihood that something will happen on the executive side more likely,” says Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at fund manager TIAA Investments. “Steel companies and steel users are definitely the most susceptible to that at this point.”Overproduction by China’s heavily subsidised steel sector has left life harder for US producers, making the industry — and its workers — a prime target for Mr Trump’s America First agenda.The Department of Commerce has been instructed to investigate the implications of steel imports on US’s national security under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act. The US has in recent years imposed anti-dumping tariffs on a bevy of steel products, cutting direct imports from China. However, there is concern within the industry that Chinese mills are circumventing the rules by rerouting imports to America via countries exempt from restrictions. Any moves by the Trump administration on steel “would provide a good amount of red meat to a core constituency”, says Matthew Korn, a metals and mining analyst at Barclays.The sensitivity of investors to the prospect of Mr Trump introducing measures on steel was underlined last week when comments the president made on Air Force One en route to Paris were reported. “I'm stopping it. It'll stop,” Mr Trump said of China dumping steel in the US. “There are two ways — quotas and tariffs. Maybe I'll do both.”Shares of AK Steel, a Pittsburgh-based producer, rival US Steel, Nucor and Steel Dynamics shot higher in response. The shares were buoyed further on Thursday as talks with China intensified.The recent buoyancy in the shares of US steel producers echoes their performance in the weeks after the election but is a contrast to the weakness some of them had earlier this year. AK Steel, for example, is down 35 per cent this year while others such as Nucor and Steel Dynamics have eked out modest gains.During the first-quarter earnings calls with investors, US steel companies offered broad support for the administration’s appetite for tackling the steel glut. That is not expected to change as the companies wrap up their second-quarter earnings over the next few days. Some analysts and investors, though, are concerned about how little is known about potential plans. Will new tariffs be introduced or will quotas be preferred? Will any countries be exempted? If it is tariffs, how high will they be and on which products? “He (Mr Trump) could do essentially whatever he wants to do,” says Mr Korn of Barclays. “There are plenty of people who worry he could get up in the morning and tweet 25 per cent tariffs on everything. And I am only being somewhat facetious.”A broad tariff on all imports would likely push steel prices higher, initially helping domestic producers. However, that move would also have a knock-on effect on companies, such as carmakers, that are dependent on steel and potentially increase costs to consumers or even prompt factories to move abroad where they can purchase cheaper steel, Mr Korn cautions. Michael Gambardella, a metals and mining analyst at JPMorgan, is less concerned, anticipating quotas as the most likely path the administration will take.That will help curb importers circumventing existing restrictions. Quotas can cap imports from particular countries with tariffs able to be set on anything above those levels.“You could really address the problem of circumvention because it would close off markets for countries receiving high tariffs to redirect their products through,” he says. “Trump needs a win and this is an easy win for him.”
8;NUE;Nucor Corp;2017-07-14T20:33:36Z;Trump claims of Chinese dumping lift US steel shares;US president considers both tariffs and quotas to protect domestic industry;"Shares of US steel companies outperformed this week in anticipation that Donald Trump will impose tariffs after accusing China of dumping the metal in the US market.This week’s rally in US steel companies, including AK Steel, a Pittsburgh-based producer, and US Steel, the largest domestically based steel producer, was given added impetus on Thursday after Mr Trump said his administration will take action.Other countries are “dumping steel [in the US] and destroying our steel industry”, Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One en route to Paris. “They’ve been doing it for decades and I’m stopping it. It’ll stop.”The comments by Mr Trump were initially off the record and not reported by journalists travelling with the president, who was on his way to Paris to attend Bastille Day festivities.However, the White House later changed the ground rules and released a transcript of his remarks, sparking the steel rally.The White House is awaiting a US Department of Commerce report that will help determine whether Mr Trump can impose tariffs.An end of June deadline for the report has slipped. Mr Trump said on Thursday that “there are two ways: quotas and tariffs. Maybe I’ll do both. We’re like a dumping ground, OK?”Over the week, AK Steel rose 9.2 per cent to $6.50; US Steel jumped 8.3 per cent to $23.21; Nucor rose 2.6 per cent to $59.72 while Steel Dynamics climbed 1.8 per cent to $36.56.Nonetheless, share prices in the sector remain off their peaks from earlier in the year as investors’ optimism over the Trump administration’s policy agenda has faded.On Thursday, Wilbur Ross, commerce secretary, told members of the Senate Finance Committee that he would present Mr Trump with the options for potential action as early as next week.Several agricultural lobby groups have signed a joint letter to Mr Ross claiming any restrictions on steel or aluminium imports could lead to other countries retaliating by restricting imports of agricultural products from the US.“If the . . . investigations on steel and aluminium result in new trade barriers, the aftermath could be disastrous for the global trading system and for US agriculture in particular,” the letter read.Mr Trump was asked on the flight whether he would use trade as a bargaining chip with China over its relationship with North Korea.“The biggest strength we have are these horrendous trade deals, like with China,” he said. “That’s our strength. But we’re going to fix them. But in terms of North Korea, our strength is trade.”"
9;NUE;Nucor Corp;2017-04-20T17:17:42Z;US steel stocks jump as Trump orders import probe;;Shares in US steel companies advanced after President Donald Trump signed an order directing a probe into whether steel imports from China and other foreign countries were a threat to US national security in his latest attempt to reinvigorate the American steel industry.Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross will lead the investigation, which could provide the basis for wider import restrictions, for which US steel providers have long advocated, arguing that cheap Chinese steel, in particular, hurts domestic production and workers.Shares in AK Steel Holding were up 5.6 per cent to $6.63 on Thursday, while shares in United States Steel Corporation and Steel Dynamics were both up more than 4 per cent at $29.70 and $34.03, respectively. Nucor also gained 2.3 per cent to $58.93.The price differential between US and China has been steadily raising in recent months, increasing the demand for Chinese imports, according to Citibank analysts. The price, rather than protectionist sentiment, is likely to remain the key driver of Chinese steel imports, unless US prices are lowered.“It’s a very serious impact on the domestic industry,” Mr Ross said in a White House press briefing, saying repeated claims by China that it would reduce its steel capacity were false.However, the Citi report showed the US makes up a tiny portion of Chinese steel exports, at only 2 per cent of the total. China’s neighbors, meanwhile, absorb 60 per cent of its steel exports.The investigation is the latest move by the Trump administration to protect American steel and part of his broader ‘America first’ strategy. On Monday, Mr Trump also signed an executive order requiring all federal construction project use American steel, while late last month he also ordered tougher enforcement of anti-dumping laws.Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, said foreign imports has cost the US 14,000 steel jobs and that the new probe was an “impactful way to help address the serious threat”.
10;NUE;Nucor Corp;2016-06-08T21:08:54Z;Steel stocks rise on ‘very bullish’ hopes;US equities gain as industrials and materials post biggest rises;Shares in US steel producers climbed on Wednesday after Credit Suisse said it was “very bullish” on the sector.The price of flat-rolled products — steel sheets that are used in car bodies and many other applications — should be supported by tighter supplies and stronger demand in coming months, analyst Curt Woodworth said.“The equity market does not appreciate the amount of structural reduction in US supply that has been achieved over the past 18 months,” he added.In addition, while the pain in the US energy industry has had “significant negative consequences for US flat rolled demand”, a nascent recovery in the energy markets should further tighten conditions, Mr Woodworth said.The more optimistic outlook prompted Mr Woodworth to raise his rating on AK Steel Holding to “outperform” from “underperform”, and increase his price targets on other big producers such as Nucor Corp and United States Steel.AK shares jumped 16.8 per cent to $5.35 on Wednesday while Nucor rose 2.8 per cent to $51.76, and US Steel advanced 11.1 per cent to $17.70.Elsewhere, AbbVie shares fell after Morgan Stanley downgraded its view on the pharmaceuticals group.Analyst David Risinger reduced his rating on the company to “equal-weight” from “overweight”, saying the market now appreciates its drug pipeline better following recent disclosures, and also flagging the risk of rising competition to Humira, a drug that accounted for about 60 per cent of AbbVie’s revenues last year.In particular, Mr Risinger pointed to the threat that biosimilars, or drugs that are approved by regulators as having the same clinical effect, along with new competitors may pose to Humira.AbbVie’s shares fell 2.2 per cent to $61.73 but are still up by 4.2 per cent for 2016.Lululemon shares advanced on Wednesday after the yoga wear maker lifted its full-year revenue outlook and said its inventory levels were “rebalanced”.Shares in the Vancouver-based company rose 4.9 per cent to $71.48 after the company said it expected full-year sales in the range of $2.31bn to $2.35bn, up from its previous forecast for a range of $2.29bn to $2.34bn.In the fiscal first quarter, the company said like-for-like sales rose 8 per cent on a constant currency basis ahead of analysts’ expectations for a 6.7 per cent gain. Net revenue increased 17 per cent to $495.5m, ahead of estimates for $487.6m.The news came alongside profits that slid to $45.3m, or 33 cents a share, compared with $47.8m, or 34 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 30 cents a share missed expectations by a cent.Lululemon, like Nike and Under Armour, has been a key beneficiary of the athleisure trend that sees people wear workout gear outside of the gym. The retailer’s shares have advanced 30 per cent so far this year.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had risen 0.3 per cent to 2,119.1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 18,005.1, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced by 0.3 per cent to 4,974.6.The industrials and materials sectors posted the biggest rises while telecommunications and energy lagged behind.
11;NUE;Nucor Corp;2016-05-18T14:34:13Z;NYSE faces ‘critical issue’ in single trading unit;;The New York Stock Exchange experienced a “critical issue” relating to almost 200 tickers on Wednesday, causing other exchanges to route trading away from the Big Board.NYSE first alerted traders to a “technical issue” at one of its trading units about 17 minutes after the opening bell in New York. It resolved the problem, but then it flared up again by 10:26 am ET. An hour later, the exchange operator upgraded the severity of the problem to “critical” and suspended trading in 199 tickers on the NYSE, report Adam Samson and Nicole Bullock in New York.The list includes groups like Nucor, a $14.9bn steel products maker, and MGM Growth Properties, a real estate investment trust that made its public debut on the NYSE last month.Still, those symbols represent less than 4 per cent of securities listed on NYSE group, a NYSE spokesperson said. And trading continued on other exchanges, such as NYSE Arca, the operator’s all-electronic exchange.“We are investigating the root cause and then we will implement a fix as soon as we can,” the spokesperson said, adding, “the goal is to reinstate these securities by the close.”The symbols involved securities with KCG, a designated market market maker, but NYSE stressed that the problem was an exchange issue.A KCG spokeswoman said: “We are aware that the NYSE is experiencing an issue and we are awaiting updates from them on how to resolve it as soon as possible.”The issues prompted the Nasdaq Stock Market and Bats to make so-called “self-help” declarations against NYSE, suggesting that they routed trading away from the Big Board. Nasdaq initially lifted the self-help, but then issued it again after the problem re-surfaced.Self-help declarations are safety mechanisms that allow exchanges to isolate an operator that is having issues, so the problems do not cascade into the broader market. They are fairly common across US financial markets, but are seen less frequently between the major equity exchanges.Exchanges’ ability to redirect trades away from an operator that is facing trouble came into focus in 2013 when a glitch froze trading on the Nasdaq for more than three hours in a single session. Other exchanges were able to continue trading throughout the day as Nasdaq resolved its problem — something industry executives said at the time underscored the resiliency of the system.
12;NUE;Nucor Corp;2016-05-09T23:25:43Z;Indian group emerges as late bidder for Tata Steel;Seven interested parties go through to next round of sale process;"JSW Steel, one of India’s largest steel groups, has emerged as a last-minute bidder for Tata Steel’s ailing UK steel operations.JSW is one of seven bidders which Tata Steel has taken forward to the next stage of the sales process, reviving hopes that its UK operations, which employ 11,000 people, might be saved.Should JSW be successful, it would mean the collection of factories passing from the hands of one Indian owner to another.JSW’s capacity is nearly double that of Tata Steel’s Indian operations, trailing only state-owned Steel Authority of India. In recent weeks it has been linked with a possible bid for struggling Indian peer Essar Steel in Indian media reports; however its expansion drive was recently met with a credit downgrade from Fitch amid concerns over its debt pile. It did not comment on whether it was bidding.Other bidders for Tata Steel include the commodities trading groupLiberty House and Greybull, the investment firm which has provisionally agreed to acquire Tata’s Scunthorpe steelworks.Also on the list was a Chinese group and the US steel producer Nucor, according to one person with knowledge of the sales process. A Nucor spokeswoman declined to comment but said: “Like most companies, we are always looking for good opportunities.”She added: “We never limit ourselves when looking at the future, and are constantly evaluating unique market opportunities or product niches. If the right opportunity comes along, it has to fit our long-term growth strategy and provide the right return on the investment of our shareholders’ valuable capital.”A management buyout team called Excalibur, led by senior managers from Tata Steel UK, is also thought to be among the seven. A spokesperson declined to comment.Bidders who only wanted to buy parts of Tata’s operations piecemeal were excluded from the next round.One was Albion Steel, a start-up including a former Corus chief executive, which was interested in Tata’s specialist steels unit in South Yorkshire.A spokesperson for Tata Steel said: “The board of Tata Steel Europe has announced that seven expressions of interest submitted for Tata Steel’s UK business have been immediately taken forward to the next stage of the sale process. In addition, Tata Steel Europe is clarifying outstanding points with a number of other parties who have submitted an expression of interest.”The future of Britain’s steel industry was plunged into doubt when Tata said it would seek to withdraw from the country at the end of March, following years of losses.Despite pouring more than £1.5bn of investment into the former Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, which it acquired for £6.2bn in 2007, the Indian group has described its UK business as almost worthless. Tata Steel’s group executive director, Koushik Chatterjee, last month said that its UK business was losing as much as £1m a day.This news is yet further evidence of the significant interest that exists in the future of the UK steel industryUK steel producers have been hit by falling steel prices, high energy prices and persistently weak European demand, triggering a crisis that has claimed thousands of jobs and led to plant closures in the past year.The resulting political pressure led the government to offer to part-nationalise up to a quarter of Tata Steel UK alongside hundreds of millions of pounds in loans.A £15bn pension scheme, which has 130,000 members and a £485m deficit, is an obstacle to any sales, with at least two prospective buyers saying they would not want to take it on.Following due diligence, the next step is for bidders to table a firm offer, said one person involved in the process. Tata has pushed back its final deadline to offload the collection of factories beyond Britain’s EU membership referendum on June 23.A spokesperson for Community, the steelworkers’ union said: “This news is yet further evidence of the significant interest that exists in the future of the UK steel industry. Community will continue to act as a responsible stakeholder in the sales process.“We will ensure that all potential investors recognise the importance of Tata’s highly skilled workforce to any future success of the business.”The broader JSW Group was named by Credit Suisse in October as one of ten Indian groups facing severe difficulty in managing their liabilities.Additional reporting by Peter Campbell and Robert Wright"
13;NUE;Nucor Corp;2016-04-26T22:26:20Z;US Steel eyes recovery despite $340m quarterly loss;Full-year results expected to exceed earlier forecasts, while complaint against China initiated;US Steel on Tuesday became the third domestic producer in recent days to hint at a recovery in the crisis-hit market when it predicted full-year results far better than it forecast just three months ago.The company, the US’s biggest steelmaker by revenues, also announced it had complained to the US’s International Trade Commission about unfair competition from China. Cheap Chinese imports took a growing share of the US domestic steel market last year, driving down prices and forcing companies to mothball plants. Imports continue to take a historically high 25 per cent of the market, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.The company recorded a $340m net loss for the first quarter — deeper than the $75m recorded in last year’s first quarter but far better than results for the final three months of 2015. Those were initially reported as a $999m net loss but have since been adjusted to a $1.13bn loss.Mario Longhi, chief executive, said the results reflected the “challenging conditions” at the start of 2016 but had been in line with company expectations.But he went on: “We are well-positioned to benefit from currently improving market conditions for our flat-rolled and European segments.”The company predicted “adjusted ebitda” — earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation excluding restructuring costs — of $400m for the full year. When it announced full-year results in January, it was expecting to report adjusted ebitda for the full-year at only break-even levels.Mr Longhi said recent increases in prices for flat-rolled products — the steel sheets used for items such as car bodies— would start to be reflected in the company’s second-quarter results. “While we will benefit from the improving market conditions, the global steel industry continues to face many challenges,” he added.US Steel’s announcement, after the close of trading in New York, follows results on Tuesday morning from AK Steel showing its first-quarter net losses narrowed to $13.56m, against $306m in 2015.On Friday, Nucor announced first-quarter net earnings up 4.4 per cent to $70.8m, on net sales down 16 per cent to $3.72bn.American steelmakers have recovered thanks to significant capacity cutbacks and the Federal Trade Commission’s imposition of heavy tariffs on certain steel imports from Asia that it believes are being dumped on world markets.US Steel is seeking further protection via the complaint to the ITC, part of the US federal government. The company’s complaint alleged an illegal conspiracy to fix prices, the theft of trade secrets and the “circumvention of trade duties by false labelling”.“The . . . complaint alleges illegal unfair methods of competition and seeks the exclusion of all unfairly traded Chinese steel products from the US market,” the company said.While we will benefit from the improving market conditions, the global steel industry continues to face many challengesMr Longhi said the group would use every tool available to “fight for fair trade”.“With today’s filing, we continue the work we have pursued through countervailing and antidumping cases and pushing for increased enforcement of existing laws,” he said.US Steel’s shares were slightly higher in after-market trading, up 0.2 per cent in early evening, at $18.53. That compares with a low of just $6.15 the stock hit at its nadir in January.
14;NUE;Nucor Corp;2016-04-11T17:14:51Z;Cheap imports put US Steel under pressure;One-time leader of US steelmaking is mothballing plants amid global industry crisis;The sign at the exit of US Steel’s Fairfield steelworks seeks to give those leaving a last, feel-good boost. “Our employees are our most valued asset,” it reads.Turn around and look at the mill’s buildings, however, and the sign seems like a dark joke. Smoke stopped rising from the plant’s blast furnace and strip mill in August last year when US Steel — the one-time leader of US heavy industry — closed most of the facility, making 1,100 workers redundant. If it ever reopens, there will be far fewer employees.The job losses at the Fairfield works on the outskirts of Birmingham, Alabama, are among 13,500 in US steel-making since January last year, and amount to almost 10 per cent of total employment in the sector, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade body.The redundancies show how the US industry has been grappling with the same surge of cheap Chinese exports that has devastated the sector’s economics worldwide. Imports took a record 29 per cent share of the US steel market last year, as domestic production fell 12 per cent compared to 2014.The global crisis in steel making, partly rooted in excess capacity and China’s economic slowdown, is most apparent right now at Tata Steel’s lossmaking UK operations. These were put up for sale by the Indian group last month, placing 15,000 jobs at risk, including 4,000 at Port Talbot, Britain’s biggest steelworks.Fairfield is far from US Steel’s only move to retrench. The company has made two other significant closures on a temporary basis over the past six months involving plants at Granite City, Illinois, and Lone Star, Texas.“The market was saturated with imported product and it just took a toll on us,” says David Clark, president of the main branch of the United Steelworkers’ Union at Fairfield.Chuck Bradford, a steel industry analyst, says that, on top of weak market conditions, Fairfield — like Port Talbot — suffered from being a relatively outdated and inefficient facility. Fairfield had been heavily dependent in recent years on the oversupplied market for steel pipes for the US oil industry.“That’s dead at this hour, not only because the oil price is down but because too much new capacity was built,” adds Mr Bradford.US Steel, whose market capitalisation has shrunk from $14.3bn in 2007 to $2.4bn now, declines to elaborate on the reasons for the plant closures. But Mario Longhi, chief executive, said in August the moves were necessary to improve the “overall efficiency and cost structure” of US Steel’s manufacturing of flat-rolled steel, which is used to make car exteriors, among other things.US Steel fell to a $1.5bn net loss for 2015, compared to a profit of $102m in 2014.Conditions were also dire for AK Steel, the US’s other big listed operator of “integrated mills” — traditional steelworks with huge blast furnaces that make iron using ore and coke. The company’s net loss for 2015 deepened to $511m, from $96.9m for 2014. Some of the highest grades of steel can be produced only in integrated mills.Yet some hope lingers among workers at Mr Clark’s union hall, near the Fairfield works.US Steel said last year it would invest in an electric arc furnace at Fairfield, turning it into a so-called “mini-mill”, which should make the facility far more efficient. This is because electric arc furnaces, which melt down scrap steel, can be turned off and on far more easily than blast furnaces.Sanjeev Gupta, the Indian entrepreneur interested in buying Tata Steel’s UK assets, has proposed a similar overhaul of Port Talbot’s operations.Evidence of the benefits of electric arc furnaces can be found at Nucor, the biggest US operator of mini-mills, which weathered the worst of the industry downturn last year far better than US Steel. Nucor remained profitable in 2015, although net income nearly halved, to $358m.Mini-mills, which tend to specialise in “long products” such as rebar steel for construction, are far less labour intensive than those involving blast furnaces.Workers at Fairfield accept there will be far fewer jobs if the electric arc furnace project goes ahead. The investment, due to be worth $230m, was halted in December because of poor market conditions.“We never really established what the manning numbers were going to be,” says Mr Clark.However, tough new tariffs imposed by the US Federal Trade Commission on steel imports, cutbacks such as the closure of the Fairfield blast furnace, and the weakening of the dollar have combined to produce a sudden price spike. Prices for hot-rolled coil, the most common steel product, have rebounded to about $460 per tonne, says Mr Bradford. They were $350 in February.US Steel’s share price has more than doubled this year, reaching $17.53 on Monday after plumbing a low of $6.15 in January.“We remain optimistic,” says Mr Clark, who points particularly to the hope that further action against countries that violate international trade rules on steel might boost the US industry.“If we can get trade protection and take care of some of the violators, we can look forward to a long and prosperous future,” he adds.The empty storefronts in the centre of Fairfield illustrate the devastating effect on the town of last year’s closure of most of US Steel’s Fairfield steelworks.Thrift shops that once sold cheap second-hand goods have been forced to pull down the shutters. Only a sprinkling of businesses, mostly hair salons and discount stores, survive.The fate of the town — founded in 1910 specifically to house US Steel employees — illustrates why steel provokes such political sensitivity.The industry is labour intensive yet prone to sharp cyclical swings. Market downturns can consequently devastate entire communities, prompting politicians to intervene in companies’ commercial decisions.“There are so many support jobs that go along with all these people that used to work here,” says Patrick Herring, an activist at the United Steelworkers’ branch representing most workers at the Fairfield works.“They went to these stores. They bought lunch. You can see it everywhere.”The biggest single blow, however, has been a knock-on effect of the closure of Fairfield’s blast furnace.The town used to support a Walmart supermarket generating critical sales tax revenue, and the store’s closure in January forced Fairfield last month to announce the abolition of its police department. The town will instead buy policing services from nearby Jefferson County.

This follows a 20 per cent decline on Monday, amid a sell-off in copper and after ratings agency Fitch axed the company’s credit rating.Meanwhile, Aluminium maker Alcoa was the third biggest decliner, with shares sliding 10 per cent to $7.19. The company said late Monday that it swung to a loss in the fourth-quarter on the back of income tax charges and sales that fell nearly 18 per cent. Adjusting for one-time items however Alcoa reported earnings per share that topped forecasts. Shares were up after the results however and did not appear to be the trigger for bearish sentiment today.But mining stocks have been roiled amid renewed concerns on China, the world’s largest commodity consumer, and weakness in the renminbi.The S&P 500 metals and mining industry index, which includes just Alcoa, Freeport Mc-Moran, Nucor and Newmont Mining fell for the ninth consecutive day and has declined more than 20 per cent in 2016.Matthew Korn, an analyst at Barlcays, explains just how China has thrown a spanner in the works for mining stocks:We’ve seen a more volatile, weaker [Chinese yuan] and continued PMI contraction combined with unclear, arguably contradictory policy measures that all suggest, as our economists put it, “China’s economic situation has become inherently unstable.”This does not suggest a good set-up for mining stocks – instead the prospect for calling a bottom appears to be pushed out yet again.With concerns mounting about global economic growth it is unclear when miners could see their fortunes change.
16;NUE;Nucor Corp;2016-01-11T11:17:08Z;Pacesetting companies and the masochists who run them;No one company can dictate fashion but bellwethers like M&S are still needed;Being a bellwether is no fun. Shepherds used to castrate a ram — or wether — put a bell round its neck and set it to lead their sheep. For chief executives who head a company whose performance is supposed to be a guide to the state of the market, it is more like wearing a millstone than a bell.Take Marc Bolland, chief executive of Marks and Spencer, Britain’s best-known retailer.In 2009, he was fleetingly hailed as the “billion-dollar man”, based on the combined rise in M&S’s value and the fall in that of his previous employer on his appointment. He was paid a controversial fortune to join, but was doomed never to dazzle investors again. He did a decent job, often in areas out of the spotlight, but it was a wearying task. “If you are going to be chief executive of one of these entities you have to be bloody resilient,” says one person who knows the M&S chief. “You wouldn’t believe the amount of attention you get.”If it is so hard for a single company, let alone a single executive, to make the pace, why not drop the bellwether tag altogether? After all, you could argue we are all bellwethers now: the ease with which the crowd can voice its collective opinions, tastes and desires — via social media, for instance — means no single company can or should dictate fashion.But strangely, individual benchmarks are still valuable, however hard it is for some to stay standing.Bellwethers increasingly face the threat that they will one day be led off to the slaughter. Ecommerce rivals and “fast fashion” proponents have torn into M&S’s clothing business.Meanwhile, many investors seeking signals about the state of the UK retail economy have instead chosen to follow Next, headed by the sharp-eyed seer of the sector, Lord Wolfson. Yet even he has recently admitted that Next’s lead over faster-moving rivals in areas such as catalogue and online retailing is breaking down.In the US, DuPont and Dow Chemical, either of which might in the past have led the flock, are merging in order to split, ultimately, into three separate manufacturers. None will provide the same barometer for the whole chemical industry.The ability of technology’s corporate champions to stay at the top is even more tenuous. BlackBerry — then Research In Motion — was once a bellwether stock until Apple snatched its bell away. Even then, people have questioned the sustainability of the iPhone producer’s stream of innovations virtually since the day Tim Cook took over from Steve Jobs.For much of the 20th century, the bellwether company of the bellwether sector of the US economy was US Steel. The Financial Times first described the integrated producer that way in 1909 and it was another 70 years before mini-mills such as Nucor challenged the incumbent’s supremacy (as described in Clayton Christensen’s recently contested account of how disruptive innovation happens).The groups that now lead the US market — the “Fangs” quartet of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet) — have a combined lifespan of 70 years. Challengers for the title of trendsetter such as Uber and Airbnb are younger still.In short, the bellwether label has a far earlier sell-by date than it used to.Yet investors will continue to seek out stocks that are useful gauges of the economic forces affecting, say, outsourcing (such as Walmart, the retailer) or international trade (like AP Møller-Maersk, the container shipping group). A few large groups such as ExxonMobil will always have the power to lead their sector based on sheer scale and long history, despite the threats to their existence. Some companies still have a role to play as emblems of a national psyche, however diminished. A nation of shopkeepers without a flag-carrying shopkeeper would be unthinkable: hence the need for a line of resilient successors to run M&S.But there is also another important reason bellwethers are still needed — now more than ever. “We need to know that it’s not an impossible task to be a success,” says David Bowers of Absolute Strategy Research.In other words, in uncertain times, the symbolic value of high-profile survivors increases, if only as a target others can aspire to hit or beat.Bellwether companies may be less long-lasting than they once were. Their sense of direction may occasionally be unreliable. Running one is hell. But if we could no longer hear them, we really would be lost.andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill
17;NUE;Nucor Corp;2014-04-16T15:39:07Z;US and Mexico producers spar over sugar and steel duties;;Moves by US sugar and steel producers to seek anti-dumping duties against Mexican imports have led to a flare-up in trade tensions between the North American neighbours in recent weeks ahead of key rulings on the cases in Washington.In late March, US sugar companies filed a petition asking the US government to impose new duties on Mexican sugar, alleging that they were being sold below cost with the help of subsidies, leading to a $1bn loss in revenue for American producers this year.The case – which will receive a first verdict from the commerce department this week – comes on top of growing frustration among Mexican steel producers about another pending petition by US steel companies, including Nucor, to impose duties on Mexico steel “reinforcing bar”, on similar grounds of below-cost production.Both petitions have highlighted that even 20 years after the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, there continue to be serious friction in both countries related to trade and commerce.“At the end of the day, the continuing concern for Mexico, and Mexican businesses and industries, is that we ensure a rules-based, level playing field in North America in what has been a truly global trading success story,” said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the US, now at Podesta Group, a lobbying firm.“Ultimately, these decisions on sugar and steel could have a ripple effect on the TPP and TTIP [big trade deals the US is negotiating with Pacific Rim countries and the European Union], as it sends the signal the US cannot be trusted on trade commitments,” added Mr Sarukhan.Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico’s economy minister, told the FT that concerns about the anti-dumping cases had been raised with Obama administration officials recently, even though US officials do not have the power to prevent the private sector from bringing petitions.“We understand the legal framework for trade controversies in the US, and we understand their limitations to get involved. But I do believe that [the framework] sometimes jeopardises US interests around the world,” Mr Guajardo said adding that it was incumbent on US officials to allow the “opening of a dialogue that will satisfy all parties involved”.Last week, Raul Gutierrez, chief executive of Deacero, a top Mexican steel company, travelled to Washington to lament the flurry of actions taken by US steel companies which he says are designed to cut Mexican competition out of the American market.“These anti-dumping actions – not just in steel but in such sectors as sugar – deviate from the spirit of Nafta and prevent our three countries from realising the prosperity our citizens need,” Mr Gutierrez told the North American Steel Trade Committee, an industry body.But people close to the US steel companies say their case – which is due for its own key verdict from the government in the coming weeks – is fully justified. “A lot of this is theatrics by the Mexicans. The trade cases are clearly following WTO and Nafta rules. They are frustrated about the laws being applied in the way they agreed they should be applied,” one executive said, charging that Mexican companies “do not like to talk about” how closed their own market is to foreign goods.Sugar producers are equally adamant that they had no other choice but to file a case against Mexican imports. “I can tell you that we viewed it as an act of last resort – it was something that we put tremendous amount of thought into – and it is our hope that the US government enforces the laws that we have on the books,” says Phillip Hayes, a spokesman for the American Sugar Alliance.However, Tom Vilsack, US agriculture secretary, told Congress that the filing of the sugar case was “ill-timed” amid sensitive negotiations on access to the Mexican markets for US potatoes, and talks over country-of-origin labelling requirements for meat contained in the farm bill.“We are at a very delicate circumstance with Mexico on a variety of issues. I am sure they don’t see this as a particularly friendly gesture. In a perfect world, I would liked to have seen [the sugar petition] perhaps not occur or not occur at this time,” Mr Vilsack said.In addition, Mr Guajardo said the cases on sugar and steel will “make it harder” for him to build consensus in Mexico in favour of a TPP trade deal, should one be reached in the coming months. On the other hand, if duties are imposed on Mexican sugar and steel, they could help the Obama administration prove that they are being tough on trade enforcement, which many Democratic trade sceptics are demanding in connection with TPP.The US commerce department said: “The Department conducts all of its proceedings in an open and transparent manner, in accordance with US statutes, regulations, and international obligations – including relevant obligations arising under Nafta.”
18;NUE;Nucor Corp;2014-01-15T17:50:46Z;Steelmakers must step on gas to keep car work;;US steelmakers face pressure to accelerate production of the latest types of steel to protect their position in the automotive industry, after Ford’s adoption of aluminium for its best-selling vehicle provided what one company called a “wake-up call” to the industry.Ford, the US’s second-biggest carmaker by sales, unveiled a significantly lighter version of its F150 pick-up truck on Monday at the Detroit international auto show. Much of the 700lb weight reduction resulted from the replacement of traditional steel body panels with lighter but more expensive aluminium.The move could be “the beginning of the end” of automotive steel production – 40 per cent of the US steel industry – Dennis Johnson, vice-president for quality and advanced engineering for Severstal North America, an arm of Russian steelmaker Severstal, told the Financial Times.However, Mr Johnson said it was more likely to provide the “wake-up call” to the industry to start making available steel products that could match aluminium in strength and weight but be produced far more cheaply.“It’s not about developing the products,” Mr Johnson said. “They’re here. It’s about getting them out there.”Carmakers have to meet US government targets that require them to improve their fleets’ average fuel efficiency from 27.5 miles per gallon in 2012 to 54.5 mpg in the 2025 model year, introduced in 2024.Many, like Ford, are seeking to achieve the improvement partly through using less dense materials, such as aluminium. However, new steel types can be used to make components as light as aluminium because they stay strong when rolled out very thinly.Hunter McDonald, marketing manager for automotive steel for Nucor steelmaking, based in North Carolina, agreed with Mr Johnson that there had been a “timing issue” about supplying advanced steel fast enough to stop carmakers switching to aluminium.“If we can develop the grades of steel that are less expensive [than aluminium] and easier to form, you’re taking a product that they’re already using,” Mr McDonald said. “Rather than the automaker making a change from steel, it allows them to continue what they’re doing.”It’s not about developing the products. They’re here. It’s about getting them out thereJody Shaw, director of technical marketing for US Steel, said that, thanks to investment in treating higher-strength steel, his company was developing 150 new lightweight steel products with automotive customers.However, those products had not been available when vehicles currently being launched were being designed.“We’re working with customers on 2016 and 2017 launch years,” Mr Shaw said. “We would expect to see these out there then.”The F150 has been the US’s best-selling vehicle for 32 years.Alan Mulally, Ford’s chief executive, said at the launch event on Monday for the new model that he expected aluminium to become the “standard” material for body panels on future vehicles.

As we drive along the four-lane highway beside the 22 sq km site – with its eight blast furnaces, hot and cold rolling mills, port on the Yangtze River and Red Steel City workers’ town where 300,000 people live – the scale of Mao Zedong’s favourite steelworks is staggering.It has its own Guggenheim-like museum, displaying photographs of every Chinese leader, from Mao through Deng Xiaoping to Xi Jinping, the president, and Li Keqiang, the premier, visiting the plant. It dominates the Qingshan district of Wuhan, a rapidly expanding city of 10m in Hubei province that is building a 12-line subway system – and eight satellite cities – to cope.But Wuhan Iron & Steel Company is a big problem. Measured by output, Wisco is in the best of health. It is the fastest growing of China’s top-five steel producers, having gobbled up three provincial competitors and thrust into Guangxi province. It almost doubled its output in five years, becoming the world’s sixth-largest steel group by tonnage, as China’s behemoths have dwarfed the US and European competition.As a profitmaking enterprise, however, it is a big part of an ailing, inefficient industry that China appears unable to discipline. Despite injunctions from Beijing to rationalise and cut capacity, Big Steel grows ever larger and, as China’s growth slows, is making at least 20 per cent too much steel. Prices are falling and “the industry faces a severe winter”, says one executive.China’s dominance – it produced about 720m tonnes last year, compared with US output of about 120m tonnes – would have pleased Mao. He prized steelmaking as a symbol of China’s industrialisation, even forcing peasants to make it in their villages during the disastrous “Great Leap Forward” economic and social programme of 1958 to 1962.But it has become a symbol of China’s struggles with industrial overcapacity since its $586bn economic stimulus in 2008. It worked as intended in preventing the country from crashing but pushed it back toward the state investment-led economic model off which it was trying to wean itself. “It has lost five years of reform,” an economist says.China would like the problem to be taken off its hands by turning Wisco and the other top five Big Steel companies – including Baosteel of Shanghai and Hebei Iron and Steel – into global companies. It would like other countries to let them go global through mergers and acquisitions. Wisco’s “global market expansion” strategy is prudently vague.But there is no obvious reason why the US has to allow a Chinese state-owned enterprise to take over US Steel or Nucor, both of which have fallen out of the top-10 global producers. Nor would that solve China’s problem – it would offload it to someone else. China has to tackle the causes of its state-industrial bloating or the economy will suffer.One can hardly blame Anthony Bolton, the veteran fund manager, for retiring hurt from the Fidelity China Special Situations investment trust this week. Mr Bolton shunned state giants such as Wisco – whose shares trade in Shanghai at a fifth of the value four years ago during the post-stimulus euphoria – but was caught in China’s stock market funk.“China should delist a lot of state-owned companies because they are lousy,” says Andy Rothman, an economic analyst at CLSA Securities. The problem goes far deeper than poor stock market performance – it speaks to the investment-led model away from which the new leadership under Mr Xi and Mr Li is once again trying to steer.In a sense, it is already happening. All net new job creation is now taking place in the private sector, while state-owned enterprises trundle along, unloved. But SOEs are vital to provincial economies – the reason Beijing’s strictures often fall on deaf ears – and there is zero appetite for a shake-out on the scale of the late 1990s, when 46m workers lost their jobs.Insofar as excess capacity is being addressed at all, it is through consolidation. Wisco has swallowed up Ezhou Steel, Liuzhou Steel and Kunming Steel, a process it calls “sustainable growth”. It has struck iron ore deals around the world, from Australia and Liberia to Brazil and Canada.It doesn’t take a genius to work out what China’s Big Steel groups will try next. “Our intention is to carry out candid and friendly co-operation with companies overseas,” says Chen Yongzhi, director of Wisco’s communications department, who among other things is in charge of a local television station and daily newspaper.It isn’t the only one. Shuanghui International, a private Chinese pork producer, has struck a $4.7bn deal to buy Smithfield Foods, despite the controversy that breaks out each time a Chinese company tries to acquire in the US. Three years ago, Anshan Iron and Steel bought a 14 per cent stake in Steel Development of Mississippi, with plans to build five mills.The Anshan deal wasn’t referred to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which examines acquisitions with security implications. Mao believed steel was a strategic resource, but he had some strange ideas, and the US has permitted acquisitions by Russian companies such as Severstal.Fair trade is the issue, not national security. Wisco is too big to fail – that is why SOEs get low-interest loans from state-owned banks – and Big Steel gets tax breaks and other forms of official support. If a Big Steel company went for the jackpot with US Steel or Nucor, there would be grounds for concern.Before Big Steel goes global, China has to solve its own problem.john.gapper@ft.com
20;NUE;Nucor Corp;2013-06-18T21:32:13Z;Steel production costs cut by shale gas;;Shale gas has raised excitement in the steel industry not only because it creates additional demand but also because of its potential for cutting costs.A technique in operation in several countries, including Iran, Saudi Arabia and Mexico, but not presently in the US, uses natural gas and iron ore to make a product called direct reduced iron (DRI), which is then added to scrap to make steel.Using DRI, which avoids the need for cooking coal, can be significantly cheaper than conventional steelmaking, depending on the price of gas. But the process is principally useful for companies that use newer electric arc furnaces rather than traditional blast furnaces.The prospect that abundant supplies from shale will keep North American gas prices relatively low – well below their 2008 peak above $13 per million British thermal units – has encouraged steelmakers to look at building DRI capacity in the US.Voestalpine of Austria plans to invest about $740m in a new DRI plant on the coast of Texas. It will produce 2m tonnes of product per year, half of which is to be shipped to Austria to be made into steel there.Nucor of the US, in a remarkable turnround, is close to completing a new DRI plant on the site of an earlier one in Louisiana. The previous facility was dismantled in 2003 and shipped to Trinidad, because rising US gas prices made it uneconomic. John Ferriola, the company’s chief executive, says the replacement will be “a game-changer to Nucor’s cost structure for high-quality iron”.While DRI may be very important for Nucor, however, it may be less so for other steelmakers. It works well in Nucor’s “mini-mill” electric arc furnaces, but its usefulness is less clear for companies that use blast furnaces.US Steel has been using increased volumes of gas to substitute for coal in its blast furnaces, but there are limits to how much can be used.It is also investigating the possibility of investing in a DRI plant, in a possible joint venture with Ohio-based Republic Steel.However, John Surma, US Steel’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts in April that while DRI could “provide a very attractive cost structure for our tubular operations” in Ohio, “we’re not really anywhere near a project there”.Michelle Applebaum of Steel Market Intelligence said: “It’s a game-changer for a company like Nucor. It’s not a game-changer for the industry as a whole.”Charles Bradford, another analyst, said using DRI in a furnace also required more electricity for smelting than using scrap.“If the country has ample scrap supply, it may not work,” he said.That view was echoed recently by ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, which is already one of the world’s largest producers of DRI.Louis Schorsch, the company’s co-chief technology officer, said in March: “All in all, even though in a way we’d like to see it because we are such large producers of DRI, we don’t agree with the view that DRI has suddenly become some revolutionary game changer in the Nafta [North American Free Trade Agreement] region.”
21;NUE;Nucor Corp;2013-01-11T14:36:59Z;Gas users call for limits on LNG exports;;Large US natural gas users, including Dow Chemical, Alcoa, the aluminium company, and Nucor, the steelmaker, have formed an alliance to campaign for limits on the country’s exports of liquefied natural gas.The group, called America’s Energy Advantage, says it plans to “educate policy makers on the potential risks to the US economy of unfettered natural gas exports”.Its members fear that US gas prices, which have plunged over the past five years as a result of the shale revolution, could be driven higher by demand from foreign buyers.LNG cargoes in Asia are selling for about four times the US benchmark gas price of about $3.20 a million British thermal units.The increasingly vocal campaign for curbs on LNG exports has made Dow and other chemical companies unlikely allies of environmental campaigners worried about pollution from shale gas production. They are pitted against companies such as BG Group, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Dominion, which are involved in projects to build plants to liquefy gas for export.The US administration has indicated it is willing to allow increased gas exports, but political opposition is mounting.Only one company, Cheniere Energy, has so far been awarded a licence to export gas to countries with which the US does not have a free-trade agreement, but applications for 15 more proposed developments have been filed at the Department of Energy.If they were all built, they would have capacity to export 24.8bn cubic feet a day, about a third of total US gas production.Last month, a study commissioned by the energy department from NERA Economic Consulting concluded that unrestricted gas exports would push up US gas prices by, at most, $1.11 per mBTU after five years, and there would be a net benefit for the US economy worth $5bn-$47bn in 2020.The department responded by saying it planned to go ahead with considering exports licence applications on a “case by case” basis.The NERA study was criticised by Dow and its allies at America’s Energy Advantage for failing to take sufficient account of the surge in investment in chemicals and manufacturing resulting from the shale boom. They say more jobs and income could be created in the US by keeping the gas at home as a cheap input for other industries.However, Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry lobby group, said efforts to restrict LNG exports were “misguided”.“Short-sighted efforts by a few industrial users to restrict exports in an apparent attempt to control prices would deprive American families of the wider benefits of lower costs and increased job creation,” he said in a statement. “Restricting exports of energy as a ‘strategic resource’ makes no more sense than unnecessarily restricting the export of chemicals, agriculture products or cars, and such a backward move could violate international trade rules.”A recent report by NERA Economic Consulting for the energy department concluded that allowing LNG exports would be a net benefit for the US economy and could boost gross domestic product by $5bn-$47bn.But the issue is politically sensitive, with some lawmakers on Capitol Hill considering energy exports a threat to the US’s national security, while others say that exporting gas would lead to price increases at home that would hurt manufacturers and homeowners.Ron Wyden, the incoming chairman of the Senate’s energy committee, on Thursday called for the NERA report findings into question.“Although the NERA study acknowledges that some sectors of the economy will be hurt by exports, the NERA study fails to fully assess the impacts of rising natural gas prices on homeowners and businesses,” Mr Wyden wrote in a letter to Steven Chu, the energy secretary.The report used data that was two years old that understated demand and did not account for the amount of natural gas used at export terminals. “The shortcomings of the NERA study are numerous and render this study insufficient for the department to use in any export determination,” he said in the letter.
22;NUE;Nucor Corp;2011-09-19T16:04:25Z;Shale gas boosts US manufacturing;;The shale gas boom that has transformed the fortunes of energy companies is also giving US manufacturing a shot in the arm.The price of natural gas in the US has been cut in half from three years ago after new drilling techniques uncorked extra output. In Asia, where markets are pegged to oil prices, gas costs three times more.The supply trend has begun to reverse the fortunes of energy-hungry US industries. Factories mothballed as prices broke records in the past decade have begun to reopen and some manufacturers are breaking ground on new plants.Dow Chemical plans to open new US ethylene and propylene plants later this decade, and restart a Louisiana ethylene cracker closed in 2009. Royal Dutch Shell announced a chemical plant in the gas-rich Appalachian mountain region to make ethylene and petrochemicals. Sasol of South Africa last week unveiled a plan to convert gas into diesel fuel in Louisiana.In the fertiliser industry, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan is investing $158m to restart a Louisiana anhydrous ammonia plant shut in 2003, when gas prices were climbing. Aluminium company Ormet is dusting off a nearby plant shuttered in 2006.“When the price of gas comes down, it certainly ripples through our economy,” says Mike Eades, president of the economic development corporation in Ascension parish, near the PotashCorp and Ormet facilities in Louisiana.The investments come as the US gas market faces regulatory challenges. Extracting gas from shale rocks involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressures thousands of feet underground, raising concerns it will pollute drinking water. Some states have imposed moratoria or restrictions on the technology, while the Environmental Protection Agency is studying potential impacts. A government advisory panel last month urged disclosure of what is in fracturing fluid.The US government has also authorised the first major exports of liquefied US gas, potentially narrowing the gap between cheap domestic and foreign markets. When the first project won preliminary approval in May, an industrial energy consumers’ association objected, saying: “Natural gas is not like other exported products such as manufactured goods.”Cheap gas is no panacea for high US unemployment. Manufacturers employ 9 per cent of the non-farm workforce, and chemicals manufacturing employs only 0.6 per cent, or 781,000 people.The new gas economics are favourable for industries that use a lot of it. Gas is the main input for nitrogen fertiliser, such as urea. North America shut down half its nitrogen production capacity early in the last decade, and imports now satisfy half its demand.Stephen Wilson, chief executive of fertiliser producer CF Industries, says: “For the first time in decades, American manufacturers of nitrogen fertiliser and other energy-intensive products are in a position to contemplate building new plants and hiring new employees if the regulatory environment accommodates it.”Gas is also a key petrochemical feedstock. “It’s probably the single greatest factor for the US petrochemical industry in terms of our competitiveness internationally,” says Cal Dooley, chief executive of the American Chemistry Council.The chemistry council, an industry group, says trends in US thermoplastics exports show a strong correlation with the ratio of oil and gas prices. Outside the US, many producers rely on naphtha, an oil derivative, to make basic chemicals. Companies able to use cheap natural gas liquids have gained an edge as oil trades at a historically high multiple to gas.“Given the forecasts for US natural gas, on the back of abundant shale gas reserves, we feel that gas-based feedstocks will be advantaged over oil-based feedstocks in North America for the foreseeable future,” a Dow spokesman says.New supplies have kept US gas in a narrow trading range between about $4 and $5 per m British thermal units. But the fuel’s history of volatility may give companies cold feet.Nucor, a steelmaker building a $750m factory to convert gas and iron ore pellets into iron in Louisiana, has a novel approach. The company has an agreement with an energy driller whose production will be sold to offset the factory’s gas price risks.“You better have a long-term supply of low-cost natural gas. We’ve been able to achieve that,” John Ferriola, Nucor president, told investors recently.
23;NUE;Nucor Corp;2011-05-02T22:04:22Z;Pharmaceuticals boost US sentiment;;"Deal activity lifted the healthcare sector to a multiyear high, but the wider markets closed slightly lower as the market euphoria following the news of Osama bin Laden’s death fizzled out and investors turned their attention back to more humdrum
economic matters.Teva Pharmaceuticals, a generic drugmaker with its headquarters in Israel, announced a $6.8bn deal on Monday to purchase Cephalon, the US pharmaceutical company, helping to lift the wider healthcare sector.The news sent shares in Cephalon up 4 per cent to $80.11, near its all-time high, while Teva’s American shares added 3.4 per cent to $47.27.The deal will see Teva pay $81.50 a share, outgunning a $73 a share hostile approach for Cephalon made in March by Valeant. Shares in Valeant fell 5.8 per cent to $49.58 on the news.Elsewhere in the sector, Forest Laboratories added 4.8 per cent to $34.74 and Watson Pharmaceutical rose 2.2 per cent to $63.36. The S&P healthcare index put on 1 per cent. That performance made it the best performing sector on Wall Street and took the index to a three-year high.In the wider market, the S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,361.21, weighed on primarily by energy stocks as oil prices softened. Halliburton was down 3.1 per cent to $48.92 while Schlumberger lost 2.2 per cent to $87.79. The S&P energy sector lost 1.3 per cent.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average flat at 12,806.83, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,864.08.Healthy ISM manufacturing data helped to limit losses on Wall Street. The data showed a slightly less robust manufacturing expansion in April than the previous month, but the 60.4 reading still indicated a healthy rate of growth in the sector.News on Sunday night that Osama bin Laden had been killed prompted a “risk on” trade across the world and left Wall Street higher in early trading. But the markets fell flat shortly after lunch and then began to tick lower as investors took a more even-handed look at the real market implications of the news.“Obviously there has been a little bit of euphoria and a sense of relief following bin Laden’s death, but fundamentally this news has little relevance for the equity markets,” said Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management.“The markets are more interested in fundamental factors like the success of the current earnings season,” he said.The earnings season so far has been solid. Of the 302 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings, 76 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations, compared with 73 per cent last quarter.The materials, consumer discretionary and financial sectors have been the best performing, on average beating analysts’ earnings expectations by about 13 per cent, according to Bloomberg data.The best performing stocks in the material sector have been Freeport-McMoRan and Nucor, which reported earnings 24 per cent and 41 per cent higher than expected, respectively.In the consumer discretionary area, Whirlpool and Ford Motor have reported some of the biggest “beats”, with their earnings coming in 32 per cent and 25 per cent higher than estimates. Among financials, SunTrust beat estimates by 103 per cent and Goldman Sachs by 92 per cent.Since the start of the earnings season on April 11 when Alcoa reported, the S&P materials index has risen 2.1 per cent. In the same period, the financial index has dipped 0.9 per cent and the consumer discretionary index has gained 4.2 per cent.Looking back to Monday’s session, deal activity in the materials sector also helped lift sentiment in the wider market. International Coal Group jumped 30.8 per cent to $14.43 after Arch Coal said it had agreed a $3.4bn deal with the coal producer.Arch said it would pay $14.60 per share for its smaller rival, a 32 per cent premium to the closing stock price on Friday. Shares in Arch were down 2.2 per cent to $33.53.Alcoa was up 1.3 per cent to $17.22 after the aluminium producer was raised to “buy” from “neutral” at Goldman Sachs.In earnings news, Dish Network, the satellite television provider, was up
19 per cent to $29.79 as the company reported that its first-quarter profit had more than doubled, helped by a patent settlement with TiVo."

economic data, positive comments from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and deal activity in the healthcare real estate investment trust sector.The markets were given an early lift by comments from William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, that the outlook for the US economy was “considerably brighter”, but not bright enough for the central bank to withdraw stimulus help.Also helping sentiment was a strong number from the Chicago purchasing managers’ index, which measures the number of purchasing managers that are reporting better business conditions.Elsewhere, Ventas, the second-biggest US health-care real estate investment trust by market value, said it would acquire its rival Nationwide Health Properties in an all-stock deal valued at $5.79bn.This sent shares in Nationwide Health up 9.7 per cent to $42.74 while Ventas lost 3.1 per cent to $55.42.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher to 1,327.22, building on the 1.1 per cent rally on Friday.This followed a 2.8 per cent loss earlier last week as the unrest in north Africa and the Middle East led to concerns over the oil supply.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent to 12,226.34 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,782.27.Many traders used the recent sell-off as an opportunity to re-enter the markets. “The markets are supported by the decent economic data and so many bulls are using the recent correction as an opportunity to add to their positions,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.The rally was broad based, with all of the S&P sectors rising. The materials sector saw some of the strongest gains as global risk appetite edged higher.US Steeladded 1.3 per cent to $57.49 while Nucor rose 2.2 per cent to $47.96. The S&P materials index was up 1 per cent.Limiting the gains, however, were figures from the Commerce Department showing that consumer spending had risen by less than expected in January. Spending rose 0.2 per cent, less than the 0.5 per cent rise in December and short of the 0.4 per cent expected.However, the figures are likely to have been dented by bad weather. “Looking ahead, assuming that energy prices do not continue to spiral upward, the key determinant of consumer spending growth will be the pace of the recovery in the labour market and hence the path of wage and salary income,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Amazon fell 2.2 per cent to $173.29 after UBS downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, citing concerns that margins will be hit by the company’s new video streaming service.Amazon launched the service last week to compete with Netflix, the film subscription company.Shares in Netflix were down 2.7 per cent to $206.67 and have now fallen 6.7 per cent since last Wednesday.Humana, a health insurance company, was up 3.9 per cent to $65.01 after it was awarded a lucrative contract by the US defence department late on Friday night. The contract had been awarded to UnitedHealth Group in 2009 but Humana successfully challenged the decision.Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company controlled by Warren Buffett, added 2.8 per cent to $87.28 after Mr Buffett said he was prepared for “more major acquisitions” in his annual letter to shareholders.Looking at the month of February, the S&P 500 hasrisen 3.2 per cent, the Dow 2.8 per cent and the Nasdaq 3 per cent. The S&P has seen its third consecutive monthly gain and has risen 26.5 per cent since the start of September. On February 16 the index reached a point where it had doubled from its 2009 lows.The energy sector has been one of the strongest sectors of the month. The S&P oil and gas drilling index saw particular gains, rising 15.5 per cent in a month that has seen oil spike as high as $120 a barrel. The overall energy index was 6.8 per cent higher, up 14.6 per cent over the year. The index has now put on 52.6 per cent since the start of September.The biggest gainer on the S&P in February was JDS Uniphase, a maker of optical communications, which was up 45.4 per cent to $24.67 while Big Lots, a discount retailer, had risen 29.1 per cent to $41.03."
25;NUE;Nucor Corp;2010-10-05T08:39:38Z;Anshan sees slowing Chinese steel demand;;The head of one of China’s biggest steel companies says the country’s output and consumption of the metal will level off toward the end of next year, marking the end of 10 years of large increases.Zhang Xiaogang, president of Anshan Iron and Steel, told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Steel Association’s annual meeting in Tokyo that he expects Chinese steel production to remain roughly stable for at least a decade.“This is likely to happen as the economy starts to mature and focus more on consumption of goods and services by individuals as opposed to large, steel-intensive infrastructure projects,” Mr Zhang said.Mr Zhang’s thinking dovetails with that of Eiji Hayashida, chief executive of Japan’s JFE Steel, the world’s fifth-biggest producer, who reckons that global steel output and consumption will plateau in about five years’ time.But his outlook contrasts with predictions by many other industry executives and analysts that China’s demand for and production of steel will continue to grow strongly for some years to come.Mr Zhang said the steel industry was starting to feel the effect of Beijing beginning to wind down the massive stimulus programme it implemented to boost economic growth during the global downturn.“We’ve had a lot of growth in steel production and demand in China in the past two years. But from the middle of this year everything has changed, as the government’s action to help the economy has tailed off,” Mr Zhang said.According to a forecast by Meps, a UK steel consultancy, China is this year likely to produce about 600m tonnes of steel – almost half the world’s total – with virtually all of it used domestically either for infrastructure projects or in manufacturing products.Mr Zhang also said he was “looking around” for other international projects for his government-owned company in the wake of a plans to invest in Steel Development, a $168m steel mill in Mississippi in a minority partnership with John Correnti, a steel industry entrepreneur.“I would like Anshan to be a partner in other steel operations around the world, perhaps in the US, Europe or Australia. We need to be present in other markets [outside China] since this is a good way to test our products and processes to make sure they are up to the best levels of other countries,” he said.Mr Zhang rebutted criticism from parts of the US steel industry that by entering into the deal he was bringing into the US a state-controlled business that benefited from subsidies and other forms of help from Beijing.Pointing out that Anshan’s planned investment in the factory was “only $7m” – though the steelmaker could also participate in other new plants being planned by Mr Correnti – Mr Zhang said: “The critics [in the US] have nothing to worry about.”Mr Zhang dismissed the idea that Anshan got special help from having Beijing as its main shareholder. “We [Anshan] can borrow from banks [in China] not because we are state-owned but because we are successful and profitable and the banks are keen to lend to us,” he said.In an unexpected move, Mr Zhang was this week elected to take over next year as the chairman of the WSA, the main trade group for the sector.He said he had not discussed the controversy over the US project with any of the other members of the WSA’s governing board, one of whom is Dan Dimicco, chief executive of Nucor, a big US steelmaker, and one of the project’s most vociferous critics.
26;NUE;Nucor Corp;2010-09-27T21:41:09Z;Steel chief hits out at US-China plant critics;;The driving force behind a plan to build a steel plant in the US partly funded by one of China’s biggest steel companies has hit out at his critics, saying that objections to the scheme are a “ploy” by established US companies to block fair competition.John Correnti, chief executive and part owner of Steel Development, which intends to construct a $168m plant in Amory, Mississippi, with the aid of investment by state-owned Anshan Iron & Steel, dismissed as “ludicrous” a claim by a group of US congressmen that the involvement of a Chinese company could potentially damage US national security.“I don’t know of any tanks and guided missiles that will be made using the kind of steel [mainly used in the building industry] we will produce at the Amory plant,” Mr Correnti told the Financial Times.The 63-year-old steel industry veteran said that rather than attracting opposition, his plan should be welcomed: “The US government should be writing to Zhang Xiaogang [president of Anshan] applauding his decision to put money into a scheme that will create 1,000 construction jobs plus 150 new posts at the plant when the factory starts up.” The Amory plant is scheduled to begin operations in early 2012, with 14 per cent of the investment coming from Anshan, which is taking a similar stake in Mr Correnti’s company.The factory is intended to make steel bars using mini-mill technology – based on melting steel scrap in electric-arc furnaces.It will operate in competition with other US-based mini-mill companies, including Nucor, the US’s Steel Dynamics, and US divisions of Gerdau, a large Brazilian steelmaker, and Lakshmi Mittal’s ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steel company.Mr Correnti’s project in Mississippi – which he says is part of a bigger $2bn scheme to build a total of four steel plants in undisclosed locations US-wide – comes at a difficult time for the country’s steel industry which was severely affected by the 2008-09 economic crisis and is recovering only slowly.It also exacerbates tensions between the US and China.Parts of the US business community are concerned at what they regard as a “mercantilist” approach to industry by Beijing, under which the country is said to use levers such as the undervalued renminbi to help Chinese companies.Tom Danjczek, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association, a trade group, which represents most of the large mini-mill companies, said his members “particularly objected” to the presence in Mr Correnti’s investment group of Anshan.That was on the grounds that the company benefited from Beijing’s assistance, in the form “of easy access to government loans and an artificially low currency”.State-owned Anshan benefited from such government help in a way that was denied to its competitors in the US, he said.In a letter sent in July to Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, a group of Congressmen representing steel producing districts claimed the planned involvement of Anshan in the Amory project could threaten US national security.
27;NUE;Nucor Corp;2010-09-14T20:57:39Z;US stocks unchanged after retail sales data;;US stocks were almost flat on Tuesday after better than expected retail sales and business inventories data failed to push the S&P 500 out of its recent trading range.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,121.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.2 per cent to close at 10,526.49 but the Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent higher to close at 2,289.77.US retail sales rose the most in five months. Consumers spent more in clothes stores and at petrol stations, pushing sales up 0.4 per cent in August. Analysts had forecast a rise of 0.3 per cent.Core retail sales, which correspond best to the consumer spending element of the gross domestic product report because they exclude cars, petrol and building materials, rose 0.5 per cent, compared with a fall of 0.1 per cent in July.A separate release said that business inventories increased by 1 per cent in July, the largest jump for two years and twice the 0.5 per cent rise projected.“The consumer is healthier and gearing up to spend again,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group.“Don’t be surprised if forecasters start to revise their GDP numbers upwards and closer to our projections. We’re looking at GDP growth of 3 per cent in the fourth quarter and 3.5 per cent on average for all of next year.”The S&P 500 retailers index rose 1.2 per cent, lifting the broader consumer discretionary sector by 0.6 per cent. JC Penney gained 7.4 per cent to $23.99 and department store Macy’s added 2.9 per cent to $21.65.There were positive earnings results from retailers Best Buy and Kroger.Best Buy jumped 6 per cent to $36.73 after it beat the earnings forecast for its second quarter and raised its full-year outlook for 2011 from between $3.45 and $3.60 to between $3.55 and $3.70. Net profit for the second quarter to the end of August was 60 cents per share compared with the 44 cents predicted. But the electronics retailer missed expectations on same-store sales, which are often seen as a better indicator of future profitability.Kroger, US supermarket chain, rose 1.1 per cent to $21.26 after it posted net profit for the second quarter of $261.6m. Sales including fuel rose 6 per cent to $18.8bn, beating the consensus forecasts of $18.7bn.The technology sector also rose, up 0.5 per cent, after Microsoft’s plans to issue debt to fund dividends and possible share buy-backs, announced on Monday, sparked speculation that other technology companies may follow suit.Cisco climbed 0.9 per cent to $21.45 after it said it plans to pay its first dividend in its fiscal year 2011. Hewlett-Packard advanced 2.6 per cent to $39.29.In contrast, the S&P 500 financials sector fell 1 per cent, the most in the index.Bank of America, which had followed other financial stocks higher on Monday in the wake of the Basel III agreement on capital reserves, fell 1.9 per cent to $13.68. The bank plans to search for assets worth tens of billions of dollars to sell or wind down, in an attempt to ease investors’ concerns about its holdings of risky securities.It may also have to buy back up to $20bn of home loans created between 2005 and 2007 because they may have been based on wrong or missing information.Campbell Soup fell 1.1 per cent to $35.68 after it was cut from “neutral” to “sell” by analysts at Goldman Sachs, who also downgraded the whole packaged food industry. High input costs and competition from private labels have squeezed margins at many food companies.Other large packaged food producers fell, with Sara Lee lower by 1.6 per cent to $13.88 after it said it would spend more on its bakery business.Several companies cut their forecasts, including Nucor Corp, which fell 3.1 per cent to $39.42 after it predicted a third-quarter profit of 5 cents to 10 cents a share compared with an average estimate of 30 cents. The steelmaker said there had been a slowdown across its product lines.Cliffs Natural Resources, the largest US iron ore producer, fell 6.5 per cent to $63.18 after it lowered its revenue forecast from between $140 to $145 per tonne, to $115 to $120.
28;NUE;Nucor Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US lawmakers hit at China steel move;;"US lawmakers are challenging a joint venture between China’s third-largest steel producer and a US steel company because it would “allow a Chinese company to exploit the American steel market” and threaten national security.In a letter to Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, 50 lawmakers representing steel-producing states said a venture between Anshan of China and Steel Development Company, which is on course to receive a $175m investment from the state-controlled Chinese company, should be investigated by the Obama administration on national security grounds.“The full details of this transaction are not known to the public,” the letter read. “Anshan could have access to new steel production technologies and information regarding American national security infrastructure projects.”Anshan has previously repudiated accusations by US steel producers that it is heavily subsidised by Beijing. US steel companies, including Nucor, have played a role in bringing the issues to the fore.“Through their association, [US groups] made their voice clear, that they can’t have an unlevel playing field here in the US where state-owned companies are able to set up shop in the US market, unrestrained and without proper examination of the market,” Nova Daly, a former Bush administration official who represents the Steel Manufacturers Association, said.The complaint by US lawmakers resurrects an argument in Washington over “economic security”, the fear that US companies cannot compete against foreign state-controlled entities in the US market that are viewed as having a limitless cheque book.This debate reached fever pitch in 2005, when CNOOC of China launched a bid
for Unocal, a California oil company. The offer set off a furore in Washington, stoked in part by Chevron, the US oil group that ultimately took over Unocal, because lawmakers feared CNOOC had an unfair advantage.The Bush administration did not investigate the deal on national security grounds in spite of pressure in Congress, a sign the executive branch agency tasked with reviewing such deals did not see the transaction as a potential threat.The letter from lawmakers representing steel-producing states creates similar pressure for the Obama administration. The Committee on Foreign Investment, the inter-agency panel that probes deals on security grounds, has scuppered at least two deals involving China groups because it believed they represented a security threat. One involved a Nevada mining group and the other was a fibre optics components maker."
29;NUE;Nucor Corp;2010-04-02T18:27:42Z;Gains for US steel after ore price rise;;US steel products are poised to become more attractive on the global market in the wake of the sharp rise in traded iron ore – a development that has enraged makers of the metal elsewhere in the world, analysts say.Steel inputs in the US are in large part isolated from the global market because the US is the only steel-producing country that is a net exporter of the chief ingredients of steel, iron ore, coking coal and scrap.“That gives the US a huge natural cost advantage,” said Michael Gambardella, basic materials analyst at JPMorgan. “The iron ore price movements are a benefit for domestic steelmakers.”Posco, the world’s fourth-largest steelmaker, on Friday became the latest company to agree to buy ore based on quarterly contracts after miners convinced their largest customers in China and Japan to drop a 40-year-old annual pricing mechanism in favour of shorter-term deals based on the spot market.With the contract price about half the spot market just now, the new system will see iron ore prices nearly double in the short-term and force steel prices up by as much as one-third.Provisional agreement between Posco and Brazil’s Vale will see the South Korean company paying $100-$105 a tonne for iron ore from April to June – up to 86 per cent more than it paid in the past year.Europe’s steel and motor industries have complained formally to Brussels about the new system, claiming that it has been imposed on the market by an oligopoly of miners.Japanese steelmakers, who once dominated annual price negotiations, blamed competitors in China for accepting the new pricing system last week. China now makes five times as much steel as Japan.“There is a concern that the shorter the pricing period gets, the more opportunity there is for speculation and volatility,” said a manager at one Japanese steelmaker.In the US, the largest producers, US Steel and ArcelorMittal, are vertically integrated, owning their iron ore mines. A relatively high portion of steel in the US also is produced by mini-mills, such as those owned by Nucor and Steel Dynamics, which primarily consume scrap.“US pricing is being driven by a bidding war for a limited supply of scrap,” said John Tumazos of Very Independent Research, an industry consultancy.US prices rose to $650 per ton in March, their highest since 2008, in a survey by Purchasing magazine, an industry trade publication. Nearly all the 2010 increase was during the past month.Rising iron ore prices may indirectly put more pressure on scrap prices and US steel prices, as global producers adapt their mix of inputs.Additional reporting by Song Jung-a in Seoul
30;NUE;Nucor Corp;2010-02-16T22:16:55Z;US investor focus shifts to earnings;;A succession of mainly solid corporate earnings and the European Union’s seemingly tougher stance towards Greece helped give comfort to traders returning from a three-day weekend on Tuesday, sending Wall Street stocks higher across the board.“Investors seem to be taking the lack of an immediate bail-out for Greece and the decision to give the country time to show whether it has the ability to tackle its budget problems as a sign that risks in Europe may not be as high as had previously been feared,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.The positive mood was further bolstered by a significantly higher-than-expected Empire State general business conditions index figure for February. The index, which acts as a gauge of manufacturing activity in New York state, rose to 24.91 this month from 15.92 in January, boosted by higher inventories. A figure of 17-18 had been expected by analysts.The S&P 500 closed up 1.8 per cent at 1,094.87, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7 per cent to 10,268.81 and the Nasdaq moved 1.4 per cent higher at 2,214.19.Kraft Foods, the US food group that agreed this month to buy UK confectioner Cadbury for £11.7bn, lost 0.4 per cent to $28.97, in spite of reporting a 3.2 per cent rise in revenues in the fourth quarter. The company said it anticipated the integration of Cadbury to hurt its 2010 results.A strong rally in commodities prices, spurred by a weaker dollar against the euro, helped oil and basic metals company shares rise, giving the biggest boost to the S&P 500 index.Chevron the energy company, rose 2.8 per cent to $72.99 helped by a broker upgrade to “outperform” from “market perform” by Sanford C. Bernstein.ExxonMobil was also up 2.3 per cent to $66.28, while ConocoPhillips gained 2.6 per cent to $49.92.Steel producers AK Steel and United States Steel were two of the biggest movers in the S&P 500 index, rising 6.4 per cent to $23.07 and 6.6 per cent to $51.14 respectively. Nucor also moved ahead 3.8 per cent to $42.69 and Commercial Metals Company increased 2.8 per cent to $15.25.The stocks were helped by a report from accountancy firm Ernst & Young forecasting that mergers and acquisitions among miners could more than double this year, breaking a two-year decline, as China and India seek to secure supplies of raw materials.Oshkosh Corp rose 2.8 per cent to $39.42 on news that it had kept hold of a US army contract to build armoured trucks in a deal worth up to $3bn.

31;NUE;Nucor Corp;2010-01-26T20:23:23Z;US Steel and Nucor braced for more pain;;"Two of North America’s biggest steel companies painted a gloomy picture for the industry on Tuesday after suggesting they would struggle this year in the face of continued weak global demand.US Steel, the biggest steel producer in the US by output, reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss and said it expected to make another loss in the current quarter.Nucor, the US’s biggest steelmaker by sales and the main recycler of scrap steel, said it made a profit in the last quarter that exceeded analysts’ expectations but cautioned that the construction industry remained moribund and that rising scrap costs would damage earnings in the current quarter.US Steel made a net loss of $267m, or $1.86 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a net profit of $290m, or $2.50 a share, in the same period a year earlier, as sales fell 25 per cent to $3.35bn. Analysts had been expecting a loss of about $1.43 per share.John Surma, chairman and chief executive, said US Steel would make a similar loss in the current quarter, even though there were signs of improvement.“While we are becoming more optimistic, primarily due to improvements we are starting to see in the manufacturing sector, we remain cautious in our outlook for end-user demand,” Mr Surma said.Nucor’s fourth-quarter profit fell to $59m, or 18 cents per share, from $106m, or 34 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier, while sales fell to $2.9bn from $4.2bn.
Analysts had expected earnings of about 10 cents per share.“Going forward, we believe that the most challenging markets for our products will be those associated with residential and non-residential construction, which continue to show little, if any, strength,” said Nucor.“While we expect improvements of approximately 5 per cent in steel mill shipments in the first quarter, we also expect significant increases in both sales prices and scrap costs . . . first quarter earnings will be significantly impacted by these inventory valuation adjustments.”The results dampened optimism among investors a day after AK Steel, another large steelmaker, reported profits for the fourth quarter that were almost double analysts’ expectations and forecast that steel prices would rise in the current quarter as the economy recovered.The broader industrial economy will come under further scrutiny on Wednesday as a slew of bellwethers report results, including Caterpillar and Boeing.Shares in US Steel fell 9 per cent by late morning in New York on Tuesday to $51.10, while Nucor was trading 0.7 per cent lower at $43.79."

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
33;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-09-20T21:36:48Z;Mittal puts shine on steel outlook;;Lakshmi Mittal has built a glittering career – and made a lot of money – from being optimistic when it comes to the global steel industry.Even so, is the Indian billionaire becoming a tad over-excited about the potential for a strong recovery in steelmaking next year?Mr Mittal – chairman and main owner of Arcelor-Mittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker – has gone on record as saying that global steel demand could rise by more than 10 per cent in 2010.The increase in global production envisaged by Mr Mittal would come after a big fall in output this year, expected by most onlookers to be about 15 per cent.The size of the year-on-year decline in steel demand in 2009 will almost certainly be the biggest since the second world war.John Lichtenstein, head of the metals industry group at Accenture, the consulting company, says he thinks world steel production next year will rebound by 8-10 per cent.But it is likely the growth will be the “at the lower end” of this spectrum. “While a growth rate of greater than 10 per cent is a possibility, this would be at the higher end of industry projections,” Mr Lichtenstein says.Mr Mittal has built up his company over the past 20 years through making a series of bold bets on expansion in what many used to regard as a sunset industry.However, since demand for steel began to plummet around a year ago, ArcelorMittal has been among the hardest hit in the industry.While the company made 116m tonnes of steel in 2007, this year the total could be down to about 70m, or around 30 per cent lower than in 2008.After turning in earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of $24.5bn in 2008, the company is thought likely to produce an equivalent figure of only $6.5bn-$8bn this year.Most steelmakers – and ArcelorMittal is no exception – rely on sheer volume of output to drive up profits. So Mr Mittal is relying on a substantial boost in demand to restore earnings to what he regards as more healthy levels.He needs a period of higher profits to erase worries about the company’s high level of net debt – which the company intends to bring down to $22bn by the end of the year.While he is not postulating any sudden return to the output levels in the global industry of recent years – in fact world steel production may not climb much above the 1.3bn tonnes recorded in 2007 until 2012, according to Mr Mittal’s thinking – he reckons the pick-up next year could be stronger than many have predicted.Behind this view is an expectation that the multi-billion dollar stimulus packages unveiled over the past year by governments to tackle the financial crisis will deliver an economic boost more substantial than that foreseen by others in the industry.He is also counting on China – which this year is expected to account for nearly half of world steel production and consumption – to grow strongly both this year and next.However, this is where some in the industry have slightly different views.Wolfgang Eder, chief executive of Voestalpine, a large Austrian steelmaker which has plants around the world, including in China and the US, says the longer-term impact of these stimulus packages is still not clear.“We’ve seen a pick-up in demand [in the steel industry] but this has been driven more by companies building up inventories [after a long period of destocking] than any sign of a return to normal growth,” Mr Eder says.While he says that next year steel demand globally could strengthen by 7-8 per cent, Mr Eder is keen to play down expectations.“In the steel industry we are still in a trough, even though we are looking as hard as we can for positive signs.”As for China, Dan Dimicco, chairman of Nucor, a large US steelmaker, says that even though so far this year the Chinese steel industry has been more resilient than many expected, he foresees “a definite weakening” in output and demand in China during the next few months.While Mr Dimicco is not alone in the industry in voicing such thoughts, others share Mr Mittal’s more upbeat views.B. Muthuraman, chief executive of Tata Steel of India, believes steel demand in China could expand by 10-11 per cent in the year to March 2011, after growth of 9-10 per cent in the 12 months to March next year, with similarly strong expansion in consumption in India.“In the steel industry as a whole I can see a return to confidence and this is a good thing,” Mr Muthuraman says.In general, many in the steel industry regard Mr Mittal’s detailed figures about likely growth next year with a degree of scepticism.However, given his track record, few are prepared to say categorically that he will be wrong.
34;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-09-20T21:36:48Z;Mittal too upbeat, warn rivals;;Lakshmi Mittal’s predictions for a strong rebound in the world steel industry next year are too optimistic and recovery is likely to be substantially more muted, industry executives and analysts say.The chairman and main owner of ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, has forecast a rise in global production in 2010 of at least 10 per cent, but others expect a rebound to be substantially smaller and as low as 5 per cent.Demand for steel – which feeds into a huge range of sectors – is regarded as an important bellwether of industrial trends. But there has been little sign of a pick-up outside China, especially in key markets such as the US.Olof Faxander, chief executive of SSAB, Sweden’s biggest steel maker, said: “I am not as optimistic as Mr Mittal about 2010. There will be a recovery, but it will be from a very low base and there are a lot of risks attached.”Dan Dimicco, chairman of Nucor, US second-biggest steelmaker, said: “I’d be cautious about being overly optimistic for next year. The US faces an extended period of low growth. It’s hard to see the world going crazy [in terms of steel consumption] without a substantial contribution from the US.”According to Matthias Hellstern, an analyst at the Moody’s credit rating agency, world steel demand next year is likely to be about 5 per cent. “So far, especially outside China, there has been little sign of a real pick-up in demand in the product areas such as construction and cars that rely on steel,” he said.Mr Mittal – whose steel company is by far the biggest in the world – made public his projections to the Financial Times in late July. The company said he had not changed his forecasts and that they remained current.The Indian entrepreneur is counting on a strong rebound in emerging markets including China, Brazil and India.While others are more sceptical about this, Mr Mittal is not alone in believing a substantial upturn is likely. B. Muthuraman, chief executive of Tata Steel of India, which owns the Anglo-Dutch Corus steelmaker, declined to say if he backed Mr Mittal’s forecast, but said he saw “strong growth” in China and India, with Europe “moving ahead” in steel demand.

37;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-08-26T20:23:16Z;Wall Street shrugs off mixed data;;"US stocks closed a whisker higher after a choppy day of trade on Wednesday as investors digested a mixed set of economic data.A disappointing reading on durable goods orders for July weighed on industrial stocks, which were the day’s weakest sector.Although the headline figure was encouraging, analysts focused on the number that excluded transportation, discounting the temporary effect of the government’s cash-for-clunkers programme.That data was worse than expected, which triggered widespread selling in the industrial sector.Caterpillar, the machinery maker, dropped 1.2 per cent to $47.25, while
Honeywell, the manufacturing conglomerate, lost 1.1 per cent to $37.12.General Electric was also caught up in the selling, in spite a new $2.7bn contract to build a power plant in Kuwait and reports of a possible $2bn sale of its security unit. The shares fell 1.3 per cent to $14.11.The early falls were mitigated by a sharp rise in monthly sales of new homes , which boosted the homebuilding sector.Lennar gained 4.1 per cent to $15.58 and DR Horton climbed 5.7 per cent to $13.79.The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all closed a fraction higher at 1,028.12, 9,543.52 and 2,024.43, respectively.That constituted the seventh successive positive session for the Dow.“Until it becomes clear that there is a sustainable economic trend you are going to see this kind of mixed data,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential.“More worrying is the fact that the markets have sold off towards the close recently.”Metals producers came off their recent highs as commodity prices dipped. Freeport-McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, lost 1.5 per cent to $63.13, while Nucor, which makes steel, fell 2.4 per cent to $45.28.“Commodity shares could find a headwind with Chinese stocks soft and crude oil finding resistance at $75,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Financial stocks were also lower in spite of the housing data as well as figures showing that mortgage applications rose last week, defying a rise in mortgage rates.Signs of stabilisation in the housing market have lifted banks to the forefront of the recent rally, but they slipped on Wednesday as investors took an opportunity to take profits off the table.Citigroup declined 2.5 per cent to $4.63 and JPMorgan lost 0.6 per cent to $43.30.Morgan Stanley drifted 2.2 per cent to $29.53, even as rumours intensified
surrounding the sale of its Van Kampen investment unit, with Bloomberg reporting that the bank has approached at least three other asset managers with offers of a possible partnership or sale.Retailers were higher during the day, building on the gains made during Tuesday on the back of an unexpectedly sharp rise in consumer confidence.Budget retailers were especially strong, carried by the momentum from the previous session, when Big Lots reported better earnings than expected.The company was one of Tuesday’s strongest performers and rose again on Wednesday morning, picking up 3 per cent to $26.37.Rival Family Dollar climbed 3.5 per cent to $30.82.Williams-Sonoma, the kitchenware retailer, jumped after it reported a surprise profit and said that tight inventory control would see it earn more over the year than previously forecast.The sharp cost cuts mitigated slumping sales at the company, which also owns the Pottery Barn furnishings chain, and the shares rose 11.3 per cent to $17.21.Health insurers suffered however, as analysts predicted that the death of Senator Edward Kennedy could provide further impetus to government plans to reform healthcare.They said the Democrats may want to honour the memory of one of the strongest advocates for such reform.With the current plan proposing cuts in government subsidies to large health insurers, Humana lost 2.7 per cent to $36.15, while UnitedHealth fell 3.3 per cent to $28.93."
38;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-08-20T21:03:36Z;US stocks stage strong rally;;"US stocks rallied strongly in Thursday’s session, taking the benchmark S&P 500 close to its highs for the year, as investors focused on the positives in a mixed bag of economic data.Financial stocks led gains, helped by news that the Obama administration would trim its budget deficit predictions next week after cutting a $250bn provision for further bank bail-outs.This helped the sector shake off an unexpected rise in the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time as well as a smaller-than-expected rise in a measure of leading economic indicators.Investors instead took confidence from a dramatic and unpredicted swing in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region as the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said business activity turned positive for the first time in 10 months.Citigroup advanced 8.5 per cent to $4.48, while Bank of America climbed 2.3 per cent to $17.14 and Wells Fargo moved 3.3 per cent higher to $27.48.The S&P finished the session up 1.1 per cent at 1,007.37. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,350.05 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1 per cent to 1,989.22.Ryan Jacob, president of Jacob Asset Management, said: “Now that we are through earnings season, all the attention is on economic numbers, especially forward-looking indicators. Investors understand the jobs numbers will probably be the last to move.”But Eugene Profit, chief executive of Profit Investment Management said: “The data is probably a little bit more negative than the market seems to suggest. High unemployment remains a headwind.”Metals stocks also moved higher, boosted by commodities prices, which held on to most of the gains made during a surge in prices
on Wednesday on the back of figures showing oil inventories were surprisingly low.Nucor was up 1.2 per cent to $46.61 while rival steel maker AK Steel gained 2.7 per cent to $20.47.Worries about unemployment were exacerbated by concerns over the US consumer after results from Sears Holdings, which operates the Sears and Kmart retail chains.The company swung to an unexpected loss after failing to cut costs sharply enough to compensate for falling sales and market share. Its shares dropped 11.9 per cent to $65.Gamestop, the video game retailer, also dropped sharply after reporting quarterly earnings below what analysts expected.The company forecast continuing falling sales and said its full-year earnings would be significantly below current consensus estimates. Its shares gave up 7 per cent to $23.41.There was better news from Limited Brands, which owns the Victoria’s Secret underwear brand, after it beat estimates and raised its full-year forecast.But investors had hoped for better, after a bullish analyst call sparked a 4 per cent rise in the shares on Wednesday, and they gave back 1.6 per cent to $14.35.Two food companies also announced their quarterly results. HJ Heinz rose 2 per cent to $38.71 after higher prices for its products and lower costs helped mitigate falling sales.Meanwhile Hormel Foods, which makes Spam, also found gains with the company’s profits surging nearly 50 per cent from last year as the cost of animal feed fell. Its shares picked up 0.5 per cent to $37.44.“Even though revenues aren’t as bad as we might expect, we are still seeing the majority of profits come from expense cuts,” said Mr Profit.In the technology sector, data storage company NetApp fell 5.9 per cent to $21.55 in spite of reporting revenues and profit that were ahead of estimates.Investors avoided the shares after the company failed to provide an outlook for the rest of the year and replaced Dan Warmenhoven, chief executive, with Tom Georgens, chief operating officer.But there was optimism elsewhere in the sector after Goldman Sachs rated Google a “conviction buy”, saying it expects buoyant revenues from Europe, where growth opportunities should put the company at an advantage over some of its rivals. The shares gained 3.7 per cent to $460.41."
39;NUE;Nucor Corp;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Wall Street starts earnings season with rally;;US stocks staged a modest rally on Thursday as a positive start to earnings season and better-than-expected economic data failed to lift the caution that has dominated Wall Street since last week’s jobs report.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, started earnings season by announcing on Wednesday evening a smaller loss than expected on better revenues than had been predicted.Alcoa’s results and rising metals prices lifted other metals producers, including Freeport McMoRan the copper miner, which advanced 3.5 per cent to $46.69 and Nucor, the steelmaker, which gained 2.6 per cent to $41.44.But with Alcoa not having made a profit for a year its shares remained under pressure, falling 2.4 per cent to $9.23.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent higher at 882.68. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent up at 8,183.17 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.3 per cent to 1,752.55.“People are looking for a reason not to sell stocks right now, rather than to buy them,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Cannacord Adams.Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets, wrote: “The overall rebound appears to be somewhat muted, suggesting this bounce may be more of a pause in selling for now rather than the start of a new upswing,”Merck exerted significant pressure on the Dow amid speculation its cholesterol medicine fared poorly in a clinical trial comparing it with a rival drug from Abbott. Its shares lost 3.7 per cent to $27.01.But there was support from financial stocks after the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time last week was shown to be much lower than expected.Banks were particularly strong gainers, supported by the economic data and by signs of progress with the government’s latest plan to clear balance sheets of toxic assets.The Treasury announced on Wednesday evening the nine fund managers with which it will work to purchase those securities under the Public-Private Investment Plan, and committed up to $30bn to it.Citigroup rose 2.7 per cent to $2.69, while Bank of Americaclimbed 1.1 per cent to $11.97.Goldman Sachs climbed after BofA recommended buying the shares, saying second-quarter earnings would be better than previous estimates as trading and investment banking delivered strong revenues. Shares in Goldman gained 3.4 per cent to $143.21.The economic optimism was tempered however by renewed talk of a second stimulus plan, as billionaire investor Warren Buffett added his voice to those calling for the government to consider such a move.But George Feiger, chairman of Contango Capital Advisers, said this should be a bullish sign for stocks. “The first stimulus hasn’t begun to work yet, so the impact will be impressive if lawmakers vote in a second,” he said.Retailers were mixed as they reported their same-store sales for June.Target, the discount retailer, reported a steeper drop than predicted but the shares jumped 3 per cent to $38.39 after the company said its second-quarter profits would meet or exceed analysts’ estimates.But there was worse news for other retailers, including Limited Brands, whose shares fell 4 per cent to $10.89 after sales at its flagship Victoria’s Secret chain fell 14 per cent.Elsewhere, investors were betting that the possible sale of American Life Insurance Company by AIGto Metlife, its rival insurer, reported in the Financial Times, could be a better deal for Metlife than its competitor. The unit is regarded as one of the jewels in AIG’s crown, and the news sent Metlife’s shares up 2.7 per cent to $27.63 while AIG tumbled 27.6 per cent to $9.48.In the technology sector, NetApprose 3.4 per cent to $19.01 after it pulled out of the bidding for Data Domain, its rival data storage company, saying it could not match an increased bid made by competitor EMCthis week.Analysts said NetApp could now become an acquisition target itself. EMC’s shares gained 1.9 per cent to $12.76 but Data Domain fell 1.4 per cent to $33.44.
40;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-06-17T20:48:21Z;Wall Street afternoon rally peters out;;"US equities fluctuated on Wednesday as bullish healthcare stocks balanced a flagging financial sector, which fell as the government released details of proposed new regulations.The Obama plan would mean tighter regulation of derivatives and stricter controls on capital reserves. This was part of the reason for the decision by S&P to downgrade 22 banks.The rating agency said: “We believe the banking industry is undergoing a structural transformation that may include radical changes with permanent repercussions.”This sent bank shares sharply lower. And although the market took some reassurance from the president’s speech, banking shares remained lower.Wells Fargo, which was cut by one notch to AA-, lost 5.4 per cent to $23.09, while Fifth Third, which S&P cut by two notches to BBB, dropped 5.2 per cent to $6.81.“The effect of the regulation is a little bit worrying,” said Stephen Auth of Federated Investors. “But even though it could reduce returns, it may be helpful in damping risk also.”The effect of those falls was outweighed by a strong performance from drug makers. Pfizer gained 3 per cent to $14.58, while Merck rose 1.4 per cent
to $24.77.The sector had been sparked into life by news that Watson Pharmaceuticals was to buy the privately owned Arrow, which makes generic drugs. The deal will cost Watson $1.75bn in cash and shares, and its stock gained 5 per cent to $30.27.Although shares rallied in the afternoon as investors took confidence from positive words about the outlook for the US AAA credit rating from S&P, they fell back again shortly before the close.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 0.1 per cent down at 910.71 and 8,497.18 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.7 per cent to 1,808.06 however.Equities had spent the early part of the morning in negative territory after results from FedEx gave rise to concerns about the health of corporate spending.The second-largest US package delivery company, whose results often indicate the health of the wider business community, beat analysts’ forecasts with its quarterly earnings.But FedEx’s shares fell 1.4 per cent to $50.70 as it said first-quarter earnings could be less than half analysts’ estimates.Consumer stocks rallied strongly during the afternoon, however, with Abercrombie & Fitch a stand-out performer after the clothing retailer said it would close its struggling Ruehl chain. The shares rose 4.5 per cent to $26.97.The strength in the sector came as figures showed inflation is not a near-term concern, with consumer prices rising less than analysts forecast.This followed Monday’s producer price numbers, which revealed a much more moderate rise than some had feared.Wall Street also took solace from results from Adobe, the software company, whose revenues and profits dropped sharply compared with a year ago but remained ahead of analysts’ estimates. The shares gained 1.8 per cent to $28.68.Lincoln National avoided the worst of the sell-off in the financial sector after it said it had completed a $600m capital raising, having sold 40m shares at $15 each. The stock closed 1.1 down at $14.90.E-Trade, the struggling online broker, dropped 11.5 per cent to $1.46 after the company said it would look to raise $1.2bn in fresh capital to boost its balance sheet by selling new equity and launching a debt exchange.Commodity stocks continued their falls of the previous few sessions as metal prices fell further from last week’s peaks. Alcoa, which produces aluminium, lost 3.8 per cent to $10.49, while Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 3.7 per cent to $50.48.Steelmakers also continued their recent falls as metal prices dropped. Nucor dipped 1 per cent to $46.38.Steel Dynamics managed to hold steady however after it received temporary waivers for two financial requirements on $1.5bn of bank loans. The shares were flat at $15.26."
41;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-06-17T14:34:48Z;Wall Street hit by business spending fears;;Wall Street stocks slipped on Wednesday morning as news from FedEx suggested business spending was not improving.The second-largest US package delivery company, whose results often indicate the health of the wider business community, managed to beat analysts’ forecasts with its quarterly earnings. But its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $50.35 as the company said first-quarter earnings could be less than half of analysts’ estimates.Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for JPMorgan Private Bank said that results from Best Buy and FedEx demonstrate that earnings are not the problem. ”Revenues are falling and companies still need to cuts costs, which push other company’s revenues lower. There is no consumer spending power in this economy and equities face a considerable period of consolidation.”This knocked futures and the markets opened in negative territory. After half an hour of trade the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index were both down 0.3 per cent at 909.21 and 1,791.94 respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a fraction to 8,501.72.Wall Street was took some solace in results from Adobe, the software company, whose revenues and profits both dropped sharply compared to a year ago, but remained ahead of analysts’ estimates. The shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.80.Concerns over business spending were exacerbated by worries over the consumer sector after consumer confidence was shown to have dipped last week. There were further negative signs on individuals’ financial health from figures showing mortgage applications fell 15.8 per cent last week compared with the previous week as mortgage rates rose.There were encouraging signs, however, that inflation is still not a near-term concern after the consumer price index was shown to have risen by 0.1 per cent in May compared with April, which was less than analysts’ predictions. This followed Monday’s producer price numbers, which showed a much more moderate rise than some had thought.All this came on a day when the government was set to unveil an overhaul of financial regulation, which would give the Federal Reserve much more power to monitor financial companies that pose systemic risk.The increased regulation was one of the factors in the decision by S&P to cut its credit rating on 22 banks, saying, “We believe the banking industry is undergoing a structural transformation that may include radical changes with permanent repercussions.” This sent banking shares tumbling. Wells Fargo, which was cut by one notch to AA-, lost 3.9 per cent to $23.45, while Fifth Third, which S&P cut by two notches to BBB, dropped 8.4 per cent to $6.58.Lincoln National was one of the few financial companies to find gains after it said it had completed a $600m capital raising, having sold 40m shares at $15 each. The stock was up 0.3 per cent at $15.10 by mid-morning.E*Trade, the struggling online broker, dropped 13.9 per cent to $1.42, however, after the company said it would look to raise $1.2bn in new capital to boost its balance sheet by selling new equity and launching a debt exchange.Commodity stocks continued their falls of the previous few sessions as the price of materials fell further from last week’s peaks. Alcoa, which produces aluminium, lost 4.2 per cent to $10.44 while Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 4.1 per cent to $50.25.Steelmakers also continued their recent falls as metal prices dropped, and Nucor lost 3 per cent to $45.45. Even Steel Dynamics fell in spite of received temporary waivers for two financial requirements on $1.5bn of bank loans in exchange for higher interest rates. The shares gave up 3.7 per cent to $14.70.There was further consolidation in the healthcare sector as Watson Pharmaceuticals said it would buy the privately owned Arrow Group, which makes generic drugs. The deal will cost Watson $1.75bn in cash and shares, and its stock gained 5.2 per cent to $30.33.European stocks were lower early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was down 2 per cent at 845.60. Asian equity markets closed mainly lower, with the FTSE Asia Pacific index 0.1 per cent lower at 193.66.Bond yields were generally lower and the yield on the two-year Treasury note fell 4 basis points to 1.143 per cent. That on the 10-year Treasury note fell 3bp to 3.63 per cent.The dollar was stronger against major currencies early in New York, gaining 0.8 per cent against the pound to $1.63.Gold was trading $0.37 lower at $931.42 per troy ounce.Oil prices were down early in New York.

The shares lost 7.3 per cent to $35.84.There was some positive news on the sector from Tyco Electronics, which makes electronic connectors. The company said sales had improved in consumer-related markets and profits may be almost three times higher than forecast. Its shares advanced 3.7 per cent to $19.98.But this could not prevent Best Buy’s weak sales from encouraging investors to sell shares in other retailers. Targetfell 3.7 per cent to $38.62 while Home Depot lost 2.7 per cent to $23.20.Stocks had been supported during the morning by rising commodity prices, but these fell again during the afternoon, extending the trend of the previous two sessions, dragging metal producers with them.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, dropped 5 per cent to $52.39 and Alcoa, which produces aluminium, declined 2.8 per cent to $10.90.Steelmakers, which have moved from stellar gains to sharp losses in the past few sessions, intially picked up ground after Nucor said orders had improved over recent weeks, helping it to project a narrower quarterly loss than expected.But Nucor was the only one to hold onto gains amid the sell-off and the shares closed 2.4 per cent up at $46.86.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 1.3 per cent down at 911.97, and 8,504.67 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 1.1 per cent to 1,796.18.“The market is rtrying to figure out right now whether this is some sort of correction that is building or if it is just a break in an extended recovery,” said Larry Coates, chief executive of Oak Value Capital Management.The rising price of commodities, and especially oil, was shown to have pushed inflation up in May as the Producer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent from April.But this was much more moderate than analysts had predicted, easing fears that inflation could hamper stocks later in the year.There was also a boost from figures showing that builders started work on many more homes in May than expected.But some analysts warned the headline figures on housing starts hid worrying trends.“Inventories remain high, and builders seem to be building to compete with cheap foreclosed houses, which will keep the pressure on prices,” said Brett Hryb, portfolio manager with MFC Global Investment Management.The positive effect of the economic data was further tempered by figures showing industrial production in May fell more than analysts had predicted.Healthcare was one of the few sectors to enjoy a positive day as investors bet President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms would have to be scaled back after the Congressional Budget Office said the current plan would leave 30m Americans uninsured.Health insurers have suffered on the White House plans, which include scaling back subsidies for those companies. But as the proposals came under attack, major insurers gained.Aetna rose 4.7 per cent to $23.58 and Coventry Health climbed 3.5 per cent to $16.71.The sector was further boosted by Amgen, the biotechnology company, whose shares climbed 3.6 per cent to $51.21 after they were upgraded by Sanford Bernstein. The broker said revenues and earnings should re-accelerate over the year.Citigroup dropped 3.6 per cent to $3.25 after Vikram Pandit, the chief executive, said companies would have to look elsewhere than American consumption for growth drivers as the US adjusts to slower growth and less credit.AT&T dropped 1.7 per cent to $24.22 meanwhile after its shares were downgraded by Barclays Capital, which said continuing high unemployment would make growth difficult.

Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gained 4.4 per cent to $58.96 while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, advanced 3.5 per cent to $11.15.Steel makers were also helped by rising metals prices, as well as analysis by Morgan Stanley, which upgraded shares in US Steel and AK Steel but downgraded those of larger rival Nucor.Shares in US Steel rose 7.9 per cent to $37.82 and AK Steel jumped 9.8 per cent to $19.10. Nucor’s gains were limited to 2.1 per cent at $47.76.But the strength in materials stocks was countered by weakness from the consumer sector, where Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer company, warned that the short-term environment remained challenging. P&G’s shares dropped 1.4 per cent to $52.41.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent up at 942.43, close to its highest finish of the year, and the Nasdaq Composite index finished 1 per cent higher at 1,860.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction lower at 8,763.06.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford, said investors were looking at the dollar and commodities prices for signs of inflation to interpret the future direction of interest rates.“The market can only focus on one thing at once, and all week that has been whether interest rates will rise,” she said.Texas Instruments provided a boost for the technology sector after the microchip manufacturer said demand for its products would drive second-quarter sales and profits higher than previously forecast. The shares gained 6.3 per cent to $21.02.Bank of America added to the optimism in the sector when it said Microchip Technology‘s orders from China had improved, causing the bank to raise its price target on the company to $23. Microchip Technology’s shares picked up
6 per cent to $23.07.Other microchip manufacturers also benefited. Texas’s larger rival Intel advanced 3.1 per cent to $16.42 while Applied Materials gained 1.6 per cent to $11.03.News that the government will allow 10 of the country’s largest banks to repay a total of $68bn from the troubled asset relief programme failed to give the sector a lift, even though banks that repay the money will free themselves of some government involvement in matters such as hiring and executive pay.Several banks confirmed that they were on the list and some said they planned to repay the money soon. Morgan Stanley said it would repay its $10bn infusion in full but its shares fell 1.3 per cent to $30.98.Capital One, the credit card company, said it expected to repay its Tarp money “within weeks” and its shares rose 2.6 per cent to $24.05. American Express said it had also received approval, and its stock gained 5 per cent to $26.93.US Bancorp lost 0.9 per cent to $18.18 after it said it would also repay Tarp money but that the process of doing so would cost the bank $153m in second-quarter earnings.Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, said: “Financial stocks have been held back by the threat of inflation. We are seeing the negative effects of too much good economic news.”Some of the positive effect on financial stocks from the Tarp news was also damped by the congressional panel overseeing the Tarp process, which said the stress tests should be repeated on tougher terms.BlackRock continued its gains of the previous session as the company closed in on the purchase of Barclays Global Investors for a sum of $12bn-$13bn to create the world’s biggest money manager.The purchase would mean BlackRock has beaten off late competition for the unit from Bank of New York Mellon, and the company’s shares lifted 7.6 per cent to $182.14.BoNYM’s shares climbed 0.9 per cent to $28.79, as it confirmed it was also on the list of those allowed to repay Tarp funds."
44;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-06-08T20:44:29Z;Wall Street recovers losses in late trade;;US stocks staged a late recovery on Monday to end roughly where they were at the end of the previous session after a day spent almost entirely in negative territory.The equities markets opened lower on worries that interest rates might rise later in the year and stall an economic recovery.“Bond yields have been on the rise and that spells weaker than average performance,” wrote analysts at Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch. “We found that stocks deliver below-average performance when interest rates rise dramatically.”Don Galante, senior vice-president of fixed income at MF Global, agreed, saying: “The risk is that such a rise could shut the economic recovery down.”But financial stocks, which were the only sector to perform well throughout the day, led a late reversal while the market waited to see which banks would be first to be allowed to repay money from the government’s troubled asset relief program.The Wall Street Journal reported JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs would be named on the initial list. But while JPMorgan gained 2.4 per cent to $35.39, Goldman gave up 0.4 per cent to $148.35. Citigroup rose ahead of an expected swap of preferred shares into common stock.The Financial Times reported over the weekend that the bank’s plan to raise $33bn in capital had been postponed after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation threatened to lower a crucial financial health rating as part of the regulator’s drive to replace Vikram Pandit, chief executive. Citigroup shares closed 1.2 per cent higher at $3.42.The paper also reported that Bank of New York Mellon and BlackRock were competing to buy Barclays Global Investors.BlackRock, which Reuters reported was the frontrunner with an offer of about $12bn, gained 3.4 per cent to $169.36, while BNY Mellon picked up 1.1 per cent to $28.54.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent down at 939.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, on which Travelers and Cisco made their first appearance, replacing Citigroup and General Motors, edged a fraction up to 8,764.49. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,842.40.Materials were the biggest drags on equities markets as the price of oil and metals dropped.Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper, lost 1.2 per cent to $56.48, while Nucor, the steelmaker, dropped 1.6 per cent to $46.76.Multinationals felt the effect of the strengthening dollar. McDonald’s was a particularly heavy faller as the company warned that exchange rates could cost the company 20 cents per share for the year.The warning negated the impact of a stronger-than-expected rise in global sales for May and the company’s shares fell 1.9 per cent to $58.72.General Mills, which makes food brands such as Cheerios, gained 4 per cent to $54.22 after the company said 2009 earnings would be several cents better than forecast.Apple shares lost 0.6 per cent to $143.85 even though the company unveiled a new iPhone and a new Mac operating system at its annual developers conference.There had been early rumours that Steve Jobs, chief executive, might make an unexpectedly early return from ill health at the conference.However, the company said his return was not expected until the end of June.Meanwhile Palm, Apple’s latest competitor in the smartphone market, retreated 6.5 per cent to $12.16 in spite of reports that the company’s Pre phone had sold out at some stores during its launch over the weekend.Investors were concerned the new iPhone would reassert Apple’s position in the market.Verisign, which operates internet domain names, fell more than any other on the S&P after a court on Friday allowed an antitrust suit against the company which claims its pricing of the .com and .net domain names is artificially high.The company’s shares slumped 14.2 per cent to $19.90.
45;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-04-29T18:02:10Z;Troubled steelmakers;;"When companies start drawing attention to a “technical recovery”, you know things are bleak. Such was the language used on Wednesday by ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, as it reported a second quarterly net loss and a $3bn issue of shares and convertible securities to strengthen its balance sheet.A technical recovery implies no surge in confidence; rather, that inventories have run down so far that customers need to place orders just to keep up with the new depressed level of demand. For the steel industry, this is as verdant as green shoots get. There is no uniform sense of a rebound in real demand. While ArcelorMittal says the first quarter was the nadir – guiding for operating profit at least a third better next quarter – neither US Steel or Nucor, the big two US steelmakers, have yet been willing to call a bottom.Equity prices have mostly ticked up all year. Gains range from Sumitomo Metal Industries’ 2 per cent to Russia’s Severstal at 44 per cent. But fundamental valuations remain in the doldrums. Nippon Steel, the world number two, trades at 1.2 times the replacement cost of its assets – only fractionally above the multi-decade low it touched last month.To pick the winners, it may be best to look to Asia. Over the first quarter, the typical Asian mill ran at 83 per cent of its 20-year average capacity – much better than Europe (58 per cent) and the US (50 per cent). Production fell 9 per cent year on year – against a 44 per cent fall in Europe and a 52 per cent slump in the US.Demand forecasts for 2009 follow a similar pattern. So, while shake-outs are inevitable, particularly in China where virtually all steelmakers lost money in the first quarter, most of the survivors, if not the biggest – such as newly-reinforced ArcelorMittal – seem more likely to be in the east, rather than among their overleveraged peers in the west.ArcelorMittal posted a wider-than-anticipated loss in the first quarter as plunging metals prices forced the company to cut the value of its inventories, reports Bloomberg.The net loss was $1.06bn, compared with net income of $2.4bn, a year earlier, the company said on Wednesday. The loss exceeded the median estimate of $594m from the five analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. Sales slumped 49 per cent to $15.1bn.“This is a bit of a shocker all round,” Nick Hatch, an analyst at ING Bank NV in London, said. “There’s been none of the bravado that we’ve seen from previous quarters and pretty much all the main numbers are at the bottom end of the range or below. It looks as though the rest of the year will be extremely difficult.”To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

46;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-04-28T20:43:41Z;Wall St slips despite bright data;;"US stocks slipped on Tuesday after a day of fluctuations as better-than-expected economic data mitigated fears over capital positions at Citigroup and Bank of America.The two banking groups fell after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Reserve had told Citi and Bank of America they might need more capital after seeing early results of the banking stress tests.The Journal was the second newspaper to report that Citigroup might need more capital, based on the test results. The Financial Times said the same on Saturday.The company lost 5.9 per cent to $2.89, while Bank of America fell 8.6 per cent to $8.15.Losses in the financial sector were balanced by gains elsewhere after data showing consumer confidence jumped during April sparked buying of consumer stocks.Analysts had been expecting only a modest rise, and the surprise news led to Nikeadvancing 2.7 per cent to $55.59 and handbag and accessory retailer Coach gaining 6.1 per cent to $23.48.Office Depot reported a surprise profit for the first quarter and jumped 11.5 per cent to $2.82.Further support for the markets came from figures showing the fall in house prices slowed in February. On an annual basis, the figures showed the first improvement in the rate of change since December 2005.There was an extra boost for equities from the fact that manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area during April contracted at a slower pace than last month, a
better performance than analysts expected.Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investments, said: “Over the course of the morning, we have nothing but phenomenal data. The market has taken all of those things and decided things are getting better.”The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.3 per cent to 855.16 points and 1,673.81 points respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.1 per cent to 8,016.95 points.There was some good news for healthcare stocks, which have been one of the few beneficiaries of the spread of swine flu because of the potential for increased demand of drugs and medical care.Gilead Sciences continued to build on its gains of the previous session. The company, which developed the flu drug Tamiflu, rose 0.2 per cent to $47.60 as investors bet on high demand for the product with the number of people affected by swine flu continuing to rise.Waters Corp, the laboratory services company, led the healthcare sector higher after reporting rising profits in spite of falling revenues. Its shares jumped 16.3 per cent to $43.83. But the global drug giants Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb both struggled for momentum in spite of reporting better results than expected.Pfizer lost 0.7 per cent to $13.39 after its first-quarter revenues disappointed Wall Street, even though successful cost cuts allowed the company to beat expectations and reaffirm its full-year profit outlook.Bristol-Myers Squibb made a similar announcement as revenues fell short of forecasts, but cost-cutting efforts meant the company reported marginally better earnings than expected. Its shares fell 4.3 per cent to $19.65.There was added strength from the health insurance sector after Coventry Health Care announced it beat analysts’ estimates with its earnings in spite of a drop in profits. The stock picked up 7.1 per cent to $15.22.But US Steel tumbled after reporting losses that were more than double what analysts had forecast and cut its dividend after steel prices plunged.The company said it would issue shares and notes to pay off debt, about $1.6bn of which was downgraded to junk by Moody’s. The company’s shares fell 5.6 per cent to $26.15.Other steel companies also suffered after the World Steel Association warned on Monday that global demand for was likely to fall 14.9 per cent this year.AK Steel lost 1.1 per cent to $11.72 while Nucor fell 3.7 per cent to $37.50.Marc Pado, chief investment strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the market could continue to rally in spite of Tuesday’s falls. “Everybody wants to see a pull back, but if everybody wants it to go down, it won’t go down. The markets tend to frustrate most people.”"
47;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-03-23T21:34:54Z;Financial sector leads charge on Wall Street;;"US stocks made their biggest surge since October on Monday, putting the benchmark S&P 500 index above 800 points for the first time in more than a month.Financial stocks led the way on the back of details of the plan from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, to clear toxic assets from banks’ balance sheets.Banks were some of the highest risers, as Mr Geithner moved to allay fears that participating in the plan might have an effect on future pay structures.Citigrouprose 19.5 per cent to $3.13, Bank of America gained 26 per cent to $7.80 and Wells Fargorose 23.9 per cent to $17.33.Other financial companies also performed well. Insurers Prudentialand Lincoln National rose 26.5 per cent to $21.11 and 32.7 per cent to $9.70 respectively, while State Street, the asset manager, gained 21.4 per cent to $29.97.“There is a lot more detail in Mr Geithner’s latest plan,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford. “Investors believe this plan, at least initially, is the most viable possible one for cleaning up the banks. The most serious problem will be the pricing of assets, but for now, the equities market is relieved just to see some detail.”But Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said: “This is something that could have ended this much, much earlier, but now it’s just a mild positive.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 7.1 per cent up at 822.92 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.8 per cent to 7,775.86 points, while the Nasdaq Composite index gained 6.8 per cent to 1,555.77 points.The last time the S&P gained as much was on the back of a cut in interest rates from the Federal Reserve last year. Financial stocks staged their biggest rally since November.President Barack Obama also helped calm nerves on Wall Street when he sounded less than positive about a bill passed by the House of Representatives on Friday to impose a 90 per cent tax on the bonuses of high earners at bailed-out banks. Mr Obama said the government needed to find ways of reacting “that are both legal, that are constitutional”, fuelling hopes he may veto it if it passes the Senate.“The movement to tax the bonus of Tarp [troubled asset relief programme] players has put a cloud over the financial industry, and risks slowing the recovery of the financial sector and economy,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Energy stocks rose, following the oil price, which reached new highs for the year. Chevrongained 6.9 per cent to $69.15 and Exxon Mobil rose 6.7 per cent to $70.53.Investors also took confidence from better figures on sales of existing homes in February. They had been expected to fall, but rose by 5 per cent on the previous month.Homebuilders were some of the best-performing stocks on the S&P. Lennar rose
20.4 per cent to $9.76, whileKB Homepicked up 15.4 per cent to $12.98.Steel companies helped the industrial sector rise more than most after Citi said macroeconomic conditions pointed to a better future. Citi wrote: “The manufacturing downturn is no longer accelerating at this point, and upside opportunity outweighs downside risk in our opinion.”Nucor, one of the country’s largest steelmakers, rose 7.3 per cent to $40.20, while AK Steel picked up 14.3 per cent to $7.90 and US Steelrose 12 per cent to $22.08.General Electric also boosted the sector after Moody’s cut its rating by two notches, but gave it a stable outlook. Investors
had expected worse and the company’s shares rose 9.3 per cent to $10.43.Intelrose 5.9 per cent to $15.52 after the company said it would overhaul its pay structure, with no rise to executives’ pay.There was also good news for consumer companies as luxury jeweller Tiffany gained 15.5 per cent to $23.37 after its earnings beat analysts’ expectations in spite of a 34 per cent fall in sales in its flagship Manhattan store for the past quarter.Walgreen, the pharmacy chain, also beat expectations, with reduced profits coming from reorganisation costs rather than falling sales. Its shares advanced
9.4 per cent to $26.58."
48;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-03-19T20:54:57Z;Wall St retreats on stimulus scepticism;;"US stocks fell on Thursday as investors continued to react to the Federal Reserve’s bold plan to buy up assets in order the stimulate the economy.Financials fell steeply, outweighing rises in materials and energy stocks, as investors bet the plan would not be as beneficial for banks as hoped, but would trigger a rise in commodity prices and a fall in the dollar.Banking stocks had surged on Wednesday as investors bet their balance sheets would be cleared of distressed assets. But on Thursday, many were more sceptical of the move and the financial sector fell below where it had been before the Fed’s announcement.They had earlier risen as figures showed that first-time unemployment claims fell to 646,000 from 658,000 last week, against consensus estimates of 655,000.But the fallout from the Fed plan soon started to dominate investors’ thinking once more, and banks were further weighed down that a new 90 per cent tax rate on bonuses for high earning bankers at companies which had taken over $5bn from the troubled asset relief program (Tarp) could trigger an exodus of talent.JPMorgan closed 8 per cent down at $24.95, Morgan Stanley fell 13 per cent to $21.04 and Goldman Sachs dropped 5.7 per cent to $99.30.Credit card companies were also big fallers after Discover announced an operating loss of $0.36 per share for the first quarter. The company said it would cut its dividend from $0.06 per share to $0.02, and its shares lost 13.3 per cent to $6.28. American Express also fell, dropping 7.2 per cent to $13.07, while Capital One gave up 13.6 per cent to $12.30.Shares in Citigroup, which have more than tripled in the past two weeks, were particularly volatile, as the company announced it had begun plans to swap $5.3bn worth of preference shares into common stock. After an initial rise of more than
11 per cent, they slumped 15.6 per cent to $2.60.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.3 per cent down at 784.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent lower at 7,400.8 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 1,483.48.“The aggressive move by the Fed is stoking inflation expectations and there is a belief that a lot of money could flow into commodities or other inflation hedges,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MFGlobal. “This is suppressing the price of equities.”Others warned that the Fed’s actions could only be judged on a more long-term view however.“We need to let the Fed’s efforts begin to work,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of Fort Pitt Capital Group. “They will help clear the balance sheets of good banks, but that will take time.”The oil price rose sharply on Thursday to its highest level this year, which boosted the price of energy stocks. Chevron gained 0.8 per cent to $67.13.Materials also gained on hopes that a weaker dollar would boost demand for US goods from overseas buyers.Alcoa the largest US aluminium producer, lifted 16.8 per cent to $6.40, bolstered also when JPMorgan raised its estimates of the company’s earnings for 2009 and 2010.The steel sector was another strong performer. Nucor gained 7.2 per cent to $38.08, US Steel picked up 9.2 per cent to $20.94 and AK Steel rose 8.8 per cent to $7.55. AK Steel was also helped by news of a $5bn Treasury bail-out for car parts makers, which lifted the big carmakers. GM one of AK’s biggest customers, rose 8.7 per cent to $2.87.There was further good news for the technology sector, as Oracle announced better profits than expected and said it would pay its first quarterly dividend. Its shares rose 9.7 per cent to $17.37.General Electric fell however after it told investors it was likely to see a smaller profit in its financial arm than previously predicted as the economy had worsened faster than expected. Rapidly rising job losses had hit the consumer-credit business, executives said, and the company’s shares lost 1.8 per cent to $10.13.Earnings for FedEx, the delivery company, missed analysts’ estimates but its shares rose 4.8 per cent to $45.10 after executives said they did not expect a further significant deterioration in the economy this year."
49;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-03-18T19:52:04Z;US stocks spike on Fed plan;;US stocks surged on Wednesday afternoon, taking the S&P briefly back over 800, as the Federal Reserve announced unprecedented measures to clear financial companies’ balance sheets and stimulate the economy.The unexpected move by the Federal Reserve to buy $300bn in long-term Treasury bonds and an additional $750bn in mortgage-backed securities delighted investors, with financial stocks feeling the most benefit.The benchmark S&P 500 index spiked after the announcement, and was 1.6 per cent up at 790.8 shortly before the close, having hit a high of 803.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 7,642.6 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.6 per cent to 1,486.16.Banks were the biggest risers, having also been boosted by reports from Bloomberg that the Treasury was ready to expand the term asset-backed relief program (Talf) also to help clear balance sheets. The troubled Citigroup lifted 22.7 per cent to $3.08.Bank of America, whose chief executive, Ken Lewis, earlier said would be able to repay $45bn in government money from the troubled asset relief program (Tarp), picked up 17.2 per cent to $7.35.Fifth Third gained after it declared a dividend of $0.01 a share, helping to push its stock up 13.9 per cent to $2.22.Insurers also felt the benefit of the Fed’s boldness, with Metlife rising 25.8 per cent to 25.17 and Prudential gaining 19 per cent to $24.02.Morgan Stanley fell, however, after JPMorgan, as part of its new coverage of the company, said that it would need more capital. It dropped 0.6 per cent to $23.68.“The Fed needed to act with buying these assets and injecting money into the banks by printing money to capitalise the banks,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.But others were more sceptical about the effectiveness of the Fed’s plan. Joe Clark, managing partner at Financial Enhancement Group, said it could actually be bad news for stocks. “I don’t think that many people would view that as a good thing, especially when China has said it is already concerned about US debt. There could be some serious consequences if we were to anger China.”The technology sector continued its recent good performance after it emerged IBM was in advanced talks to buy its smaller rival Sun Microsystems for $10 per share, more than double Tuesday’s closing price. The news sent shares in Sun soaring 77.5 per cent to $8.82 while IBM slipped 2 per cent to $91.01.“The recent buying of tech stocks shows we have hit the bottom. You wouldn’t buy growth stocks if you didn’t think the economy was going to recover,” said Mr Pado.The Fed’s move came despite data released on Wednesday morning showing consumer prices in the US rose more than expected in February, with the consumer price index gaining 0.4 per cent, easing worries over deflation.Corporate earnings from General Mills, the food producer which makes Cheerios, came in below estimates as high costs took their toll, sending its shares down 11.4 per cent to $47.55.But there was better news from Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains which beat analysts’ forecasts for its third quarter earnings. Its shares rose 18.6 per cent to $35.47.Gains in industrial stocks were limited after the World Bank cut its forecast for economic growth in China, fuelling worries over global demand for materials.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 1.7 per cent to $37.57, while Caterpillar, which produces machinery for both US and Chinese miners, gained 1.9 per cent to $27.33.Nucor, the steel manufacturer, rose 5 per cent to $35.22. The shares had suffered earlier after JPMorgan cut its 2009 earnings forecast for the company by 75 per share.Energy stocks put a moderate drag on the market’s gains, rising only slightly after oil prices came off their recent lows. Chevron picked up 1.6 per cent to $66.36 and Exxon Mobil rose 0.1 per cent to $69.16. The shares were hit in part by profit taking, with the sector having gained more than10 per cent between the beginning of last week and the end of Tuesday.
50;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-03-18T13:03:11Z;Wall St anxious before Fed decision;;Reports of a possible major acquisition were not able to tempt US investors out of their caution on Wednesday morning as equities markets waited for details from the Federal Reserve on what action would be taken on asset purchase schemes.IBM was reported in the Wall Street Journal as being in talks to buy its smaller rival Sun Microsystems for at least $6.5bn, nearly 100 per cent above its market capitalisation at the end of Tuesday’s trading. The news sent shares in Sun up 66 per cent to $8.25 while IBM slipped 3.1 per cent to $89.99 before the bell. The companies refused to comment.The increased activity in the tech sector helped futures for the Nasdaq Composite index outperform those for the benchmark S&P 500 index or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Less than an hour before the opening bell, futures for the Nasdaq were 3 points down at 1,187.2, while those for the S&P were 5.8 points lower at 769.5 while the Dow Jones lost 68 points to 7,286. On a fair value basis, however, which takes into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract, both the S&P and Nasdaq were higher.Hopes for “quantitative easing” from the Federal Reserve were fading on Wednesday, but investors were still waiting to hear if it might buy long-term Treasury bills in an effort to stimulate the economy.Joe Balestrino, fixed income strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Such a step may act to further soothe credit markets already calmed somewhat by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who mixed upbeat comments about the economy over the long-term with an understanding of what is needed to get from here to there in comments during a rare interview with CBS’ ’60 Minutes’ on Sunday.”The Fed may be less anxious to get into such asset purchase schemes after data released on Wednesday morning showed consumer prices in the US rose more than expected in February, with the consumer price index gaining 0.4 per cent, easing worries over deflation.Mortgage applications were also higher, adding to the confidence given to financial and homebuilder stocks on Monday by data showing more new houses were started in February than had been predicted.Corporate earnings from General Mills on Wednesday came in below estimates as high costs took their toll, sending its shares down 3.5 per cent to $51.81 in pre-market trade.But there was better news from Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains which beat analysts’ forecasts for its third quarter earnings. Its shares rose 10.4 per cent to $33.00 before the bell.Industrial stocks looked set for falls after the World Bank cut its forecast for economic growth in China, fuelling worries over global demand for materials. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, fell 0.8 per cent before the open to $36.64, while Caterpillar, which produces machinery for both US and Chinese miners, fell 1.8 per cent to $26.35.Nucor, the steel manufacturer, fell 1.8 per cent to $32.95 on the news from China. The company was also hit when JPMorgan cut its 2009 earnings forecast for the company by 75 per cent.Bad news from China also weighed on Coca-Cola before the bell, as the company said it was “disappointed” by the Chinese government’s rejection of a $2.3bn bid for China Huiyuan Juice Group. Its shares lost 1.1 per cent to $41.01.European stocks were down slightly ahead of the open on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was 0.4 per cent lower at 712.96. Asian equity markets rallied for a fifth day, with the Nikkei 225 closing 0.3 per cent higher at 7,972.17.Bond yields were flat ahead of the Fed’s announcement. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell 2 basis points to 1.013 per cent, while that on a 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 3.007 per cent.The dollar was higher against major currencies early in New York, gaining 0.8 per cent against the pound to $1.39.Gold was trading $1.09 lower at $905.45 per troy ounce.Oil prices were down early in New York. US crude prices were $0.49 at $48.67 a barrel.
51;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-03-17T23:13:26Z;Mittal steels himself over financing;;With the steel industry shrouded in gloom, Lakshmi Mittal is starting to consider options for what he might need to do to raise cash should “doomsday” scenarios for the sector become reality.Should the slide in market conditions continue, the chairman and controlling shareholder in ArcelorMittal might need to raise several billion pounds by the end of the year to bolster the company’s balance sheet and reduce the risks of a breach in banking covenants.ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, said on Tuesday that it had no need to raise cash now and that it had a “successful debt-reduction programme in place” that was on course to bring down net debt of $26.5bn at the end of December by $4bn by the end of 2009.But the company said it was continuing to “consider all [potential fundraising] options as is only prudent”.A month ago, Mr Mittal said he thought the first quarter would probably mark “the bottom of the market” for the steel sector, with a small pick-up in demand later in the year.But John Lichtenstein, head of the metals industry group at Accenture, the consulting company, said he thought the year-on-year drop in global steel demand in 2009 could be as much as 14 per cent, as against his projection at the end of last year that the fall would be 10 per cent.A warning on Tuesday by Nucor, one of the two biggest US steelmakers, that it would probably make a loss in the first quarter, added to the sense of gloom.Jeffrey Largey, an analyst at JPMorgan, and one of the most pessimistic industry observers, thinks demand for steel this year could fall by a fifth.In a paper sent to clients last week, Mr Largey spelled out the implications of this kind of fall in demand for ArcelorMittal, of which Mr Mittal owns 45 per cent.Not only would steel shipments fail to climb much from the depressed level of the first quarter, but prices would also stay low. Mr Mittal is relying on a pick-up in prices to boost operating profits.Mr Largey’s worst case scenario is that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation would be $6.1bn for 2009, as against his most likely projection of $8.5bn. Last year’s ebitda was $24.5bn. If earnings went this low, ArcelorMittal could be “at risk of breaching its financial covenant [over repayment of debts]” even assuming its debt reduction programme goes as planned, Mr Largey wrote.One banker close to the company said: “All the signs are that Mr Mittal and his advisers are looking at the various options they could take to raise up to several billion dollars to bring down debts more than they plan at present, should conditions in the steel industry fail to improve.”One potential option might be a rights issue that could raise between $3bn-$5bn. Another could be to sell at least one of the company’s steel plants which might raise a similar sum, although it is highly unlikely to want to sell some of its crown jewels – such as its factory in Vitoria, Brazil.Another alternative might be to sell a strategic stake in the company to an outside business, such as a Chinese state-owned steel company. ArcelorMittal on Tuesday strenuously denied it was contemplating such a step.A deal of this sort, assuming Mr Mittal sold a stake of 5-10 per cent, could raise up to $2.5bn.Beijing might find this a tantalising possibility, given China’s wish to play a bigger part in the world steel industry. But it is highly unlikely that Mr Mittal would wish to entertain such a radical step.But with the steel industry set to go through a slide that six months ago would have seemed impossible, there is an increasing sense that all bets are on.
52;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-03-17T20:01:00Z;Wall Street boosted by strong housing data;;"US stocks staged a financials-led rally on Tuesday on housing data that was much better than expected.Figures showing that building had started on many more houses than expected during February gave equities the spur to continue the rising trend of last week.Citigroup continued its gains, rising 7.7 per cent to $2.51 and JPMorgan added 8.9 per cent to $25.14.Builders KB Home and Lennar rose 9.3 per cent to $11.12 and 8.7 per cent to $8.52 respectively.Producer prices also managed to edge upwards, by 0.1 per cent, allaying fears of deflation and further bolstering consumer companies.The retail sector as a whole also benefited from an upgrade by Jefferies International for seven companies, including Home Depot and Lowe’s, which rose 6.7 per cent to $21.48 and 6.2 per cent to $16.42 respectively.Even American Express found some gains in spite of reporting on Monday that higher numbers of people had trouble paying their credit card bills in February. Its shares rose 1.9 per cent to $12.91.“Delinquency rates will rise with unemployment, but I don’t think losses from the credit card sector is the next big surprise for the market,” said Bruce Harting, at Barclays Capital.The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 3.2 per cent to 778.12 points.The Nasdaq Composite index performed better, gaining 4.1 per cent to 1,462.11 points as technology stocks rose, having been heavily sold during the previous
session.Cisco, which on Monday announced it was to make servers for data systems, was named a “conviction buy” by Goldman Sachs.Its shares rose 4.5 per cent to $16.14.Dell also gained after saying it would launch an ultra-thin notebook computer this month to compete with Apple and Hewlett-Packard. Dell’s shares picked up 4.9 per cent to $9.34.Apple rose 4.4 per cent to $99.66 after it announced the third version of its iPhone.The rise came in spite of research group NPD saying that the company had sold 16 per cent fewer Apple Mac computers in February than in January.The news on the iPhone helped AT&T, the only network available with that model, rise 4.2 per cent to $25.37. Verizon also gained, picking up 4.5 per cent to $29.83.The Dow Jones Industrial index made smaller gains, weighed down by two of the country’s biggest metal producers as falling demand continued to take its toll. The index closed 2.5 per cent up at 7,395.70 points.Alcoa’s shares dropped after the aluminium producer said it would cut its dividend from $0.17 to $0.03, issue stock and convertible notes and trim its 2010 spending in an effort to weather weak demand.The shares fell on Monday night and continued to lose ground on Tuesday, dropping 8.7 per cent to $5.59.There was similar bad news from the steel sector, as Nucor, the country’s largest steel manufacturer, forecast a first quarter loss that was worse than expected. Dan DiMicco, chief executive, said there was “no visibility as to the timing of the [economic] recovery”. The shares fell 9.2 per cent to $33.55.Nucor was joined by other big names in steel making, including AK Steel, which fell 1.8 per cent to $6.04, and US Steel, losing 3.2 per cent to $17.81. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, also fell, dropping 0.9 per cent to $36.93.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said: “The move by Alcoa to issue shares and cut its dividend is a sign that commodity demand is weak despite excitement over Chinese buying and hopes for an economic recovery in Asia.”Energy stocks rose as the price of crude oil picked up. Chevron gained 3.8 per cent to $65.31 and Exxon Mobil rose 3.2 per cent to $69.09.Pfizer launched a $13.5bn debt sale to fund its purchase of fellow drugmaker Wyeth. Its shares rose 0.8 per cent to $14.26.The Federal Reserve is due to announce on Wednesday whether it is willing to purchase assets on a large scale.Joe Balestrino, fixed income strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Such a step may act to further soothe credit markets already calmed somewhat by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke.”"
53;NUE;Nucor Corp;2009-03-05T22:28:10Z;Financials lead sharp Wall Street reversal;;"US stocks slumped to new lows for the year on Thursday in New York, wiping out the gains made during the previous bullish session.Financials once again led the selling after Moodys, the ratings agency, warned that JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, three of the largest US banks by capitalisation, may face credit-rating downgrades.JPMorgan’s stock fell 14 per cent to $16.60 on the news and Bank of America slid 11.7 per cent to $3.17.

expected profits from Big Lots, Wal-Mart on Thursday reported a 5.1 per cent rise in February sales at stores open at least a year. Its stock rose 2.6 per cent to $49.75.

They ended the day down 4.6 per cent at $6.69.That went against the general trend of the day, which saw all three major indices rising on hopes that China could shore up global demand, with a fresh stimulus package from Beijing widely expected.Metal producers were amongst the biggest gainers, with Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, picking up 13.4 per cent to $32.21. Nucor, the steel manufacturer, and Alcoa, the aluminium maker, also saw gains, rising 8.1 per cent to $34.73 and 12.8 per cent to $6.24 respectively.The news from Beijing also helped had an effect on oil prices, and US crude rose $3.51 to $45.16 per barrel.

Applepicked up 3.2 to $91.17 while Cisco rose 6 per cent to $15.25.“The sector got badly beaten up at the start of the year, but the news out of China has encouraged some buyers,” said Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman.The S&P 500 rose 2.4 per cent to 712.87, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.2 per cent to 6,875.84 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.5 per cent to 1,353.74.Financial stocks were the worst performing sector on the S&P, however, despite further details from Washington on the Obama administration’s $275bn plan to help homeowners avoid defaulting on their mortgages. Tim Geithner, Treasury Secretary, said that mortgage providers could start reducing borrowers’ payments immediately.“The mortgage plan is a great idea,” said Pran Tiku, chief investment officer at Peak Financial. “It will allow some homeowners to refinance and so should relieve pressure on financial stocks.”But others have warned that the administration is not being sufficiently friendly towards equity markets, in spite of President Obama’s reassurance on Tuesday that “buying stocks is a potentially good deal”.“The market will find selling pressure until Washington decides to address the market’s decline via policies which are friendly toward capital formation and investment,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Banks were down, with Citigroup falling 7.4 per cent to $1.13, and Bank of America dropping 1.4 per cent to $3.59. US Bancorp added significant pressure to the sector after becoming the latest large company to cut its dividend, reducing it from 42.5 cents to just 5 cents per share.

Coal and consumable fuel was one of the worst performing areas, down 9.9 per cent.ExxonMobil and Chevron fell 4.9 per cent to $73.69 and 4.2 per cent to $74.88 amid fears of a so-called windfall tax, although analysts said low energy prices made that a distant threat. Oil prices fell again.The solar power sector was down sharply in spite of the prospect of renewed government focus on renewable energy. A profit warning from SunPower, which dropped 34.7 per cent to $32.99, dragged the sector lower.Chesapeake Energy bucked the downward trend, it was up 8.2 per cent to $24.83 even after Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, cut its ratings further into junk territory.Traders “pounced” on speculation of a possible bid from BP, said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers.Some healthcare companies also gained.

Excluding Lehman, it was the biggest laggard on the S&P 500.Wachovia, among the biggest gainers in the previous session, tumbled 14.5 per cent to $16.24 on Tuesday after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “neutral” to “underperform” and its price target from $18 to $16, due in part to expected higher credit losses.Goldman Sachs slid 4.8 per cent to $161.67 after analysts at Ladenburg Thalmann cut their profit forecast.Visa which along with Chinatrust Financial will replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the Dow Jones Financial Services Titans index, lost 3.7 per cent at $67.49.The wider market reversed Monday’s gains as initial relief faded over the government bail-out of the mortgage guarantors.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index – a measure of investor anxiety of future volatility – reached its highest level since the credit facility for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was announced and oil reached its peak in mid-July.By the close, the S&P 500 had fallen 3.4 per cent to 1,224.51, within sight of the closing low for the year hit in mid-July, led by an overall financial sector decline of 6.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4 per cent to 11,230.73. The Nasdaq was 2.6 per cent lower at 2,209.81.A steeper-than-expected drop in pending home sales also weighed on sentiment, prompting growing worries of a worsening housing slump.The National Association of Realtors index of pending home resales fell 3.2 per cent in July after rising 5.8 per cent the previous month.Meanwhile, Credit Suisse downgraded four homebuilders – Toll Brothers, Pulte Homes, DR Horton and KB Home – from “outperform” to “neutral”. The shares fell 8.4 per cent to $24.26, 8.9 per cent to $14.77, 9.1 per cent to $12.83 and 9 per cent to $21.42, respectively.Another fall in oil prices hit the energy sector as US crude fell more than $3 a barrel after Opec’s meeting in Vienna.The declines were led by Massey Energy, Noble Energy, Valero Energy and National Oilwell Varco, which fell 19.4 per cent at $38.90, 12 per cent at $57.14, 11.8 per cent at $30.51 and 11.5 per cent at $52.92.Material companies also suffered, hit by wider commodity price declines. Nucor and US Steel dropped 9.7 per cent at $42.15, and 13 per cent at $93.69, respectively. AK Steel dropped 16.2 per cent to $33.72 after hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners, its largest shareholder, offloaded 3.1m shares.Amid the gloom, there was the odd bright spot. Oil’s continued retreat afforded at least some comfort to consumer stocks. Sears and Fortune Brands, for example, put on 0.9 per cent to $92.72 and 0.7 per cent to $61.65, respectively.McDonald’s rose 1.2 per cent at $63.19 after a positive August sales update from the fast-food chain.Hewlett-Packard edged up 0.6 per cent to $46.01 after Sanford C. Bernstein raised its recommendation on the world’s largest PC manufacturer from “market perform” to “outperform”.However, that failed to lift technology stocks more generally – which have been badly hit in recent sessions – into positive territory. Dell fell 4.3 per cent to $19.30 even after it emerged that founder Michael Dell bought $100m of stock in the computer manufacturer last week.Meanwhile, UAL, parent of United Airlines, continued to suffer losses after a false report surfaced on the internet on Tuesday that the carrier had returned to bankruptcy.

They gained 0.6 per cent and lost 0.1 per cent, respectively, in spite of positive retail sales data.Media companies were the leading fallers in the consumer discretionary sector after some analyst downgrades and reports that
Hollywood studios are scaling back the number of films they release.Bernstein Research downgraded Time Warner from “outperform” to “market perform”, arguing that the planned separation from Time Warner Cable and the potential sale of AOL were among several catalysts already priced into the stock. more if neededTime Warner fell 2.2 per cent to $16.33 while Viacom dropped 3.6 per cent to $29.12.

58;NUE;Nucor Corp;2008-08-01T20:56:51Z;US stocks fall as investors digest jobs data;;Wall Street stocks fell for a second session on Friday, and trimmed already modest weekly gains, as investors wrestled with downbeat jobs data, poor results from General Motors and a bump in the price of oil.The latest employment report from the Labor Department showed that the US economy shed jobs for a seventh successive month in July, although the decline was slightly smaller than expected. The unemployment rate rose from 5.5 per cent in June to 5.7 per cent – the highest level since March 2004.Poor results from GM, the largest carmaker in the US, added to the losses. The company said it had made a second-quarter loss of $15.5bn, four times larger than analysts expected, because of the cost of labour disputes and a slump in domestic sales.A bump in the price of oil added to the pressure. GM shares fell 7.6 per cent to $10.27. Ford shares dipped 3.1 per cent to $4.65.By the close nine of the 10 leading industry groups were in the red, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.6 per cent to 1,260.31 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 11,326.32 points. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,310.96 points.Over a volatile week, the Dow edged down 0.3 per cent, the Nasdaq held its ground and the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent due to mixed second-quarter earnings, a decline in the price of oil and some weak data on growth, home prices and employment.Stu Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said: “You could be asking why markets are holding up as well as they are in the face of all of this . . . the S&P 500 was down around 1,200 a few weeks ago and here we are at 1,250 or so. I think a lot of the bad news is already discounted in the market.”S&P 500 company second-quarter profits have fallen 20 per cent on average compared to a year ago, according to Bloomberg data. Profits have slumped about 82 per cent at financials and more than 100 per cent at consumer discretionary companies while energy company profits have grown by 18 per cent. Excluding financials, average earnings on the S&P 500 rose 3 per cent.On Friday, financials were the only gainers as strength in the investment banking sector offset some bad news from exchanges. NYSE Euronext slid 12.9 per cent to $41.15 after it posted second-quarter profits that undershot ambitious analyst estimates.The shares in CME, another exchange operator dropped 7.6 per cent to $332.94 after it said that July daily average trading volume had fallen compared to a year ago.The financial sector as a whole made a late run to take its gain for the week to 4 per cent after Merrill Lynch announced asset sales and capital raising and the markets concluded that the results season had averted worst-case scenarios.Analysts at Barclays Capital said: “Overall, the US banks reported weak but not disastrous second-quarter results, and the markets breathed a sigh of relief.”For much of the session the energy sector was the only one to advance, but disappointing results from Chesapeake Energy, an independent natural-gas producer, and Chevron, the oil producer, eventually took their toll. Chesapeake lost 1.9 per cent to $49.22, Chevron dipped 0.3 per cent to $84.31, and the sector fell 0.4 per cent.Material stocks also fared poorly, hit by new data showing US manufacturing activity stagnated in July. Metals stocks led the materials sector down 2.6 per cent. Titanium Metals dropped 6.8 per cent to $10.50, Nucor fell 6 per cent to $54.78 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 5.6 per cent to $91.31.In healthcare, renewed safety concerns about Biogen Idec’s multiple sclerosis drug weighed on the sector.

59;NUE;Nucor Corp;2008-07-09T20:38:07Z;Wall Street slumps into bear market territory;;US stocks slumped decisively into bear market territory on Wednesday as investor sentiment buckled on concerns about the health of the financials sector and fears that slowing economic growth would hurt earnings at technology firms.Nine of the ten leading industrial sectors fell, knocking the benchmark S&P 500 down 2.3 per cent to 1,244.63 - its lowest level since July 2006 and its first bear market since 2002.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1 per cent to 11,246.06 while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.6 per cent to 2,234.89.All three leading indices closed down more than 20 per cent from their recent highs.Wall Street stocks rallied the most in a month on Tuesday as falling commodity prices boosted consumer-facing stocks and comments from the chief executive of JPMorgan that the credit crisis would ease helped financials roar ahead.Still, a survey of financial newsletter writers by Investors Intelligence showed the most bearishness on US stocks since 1994. And the uptick proved short-lived as Tuesday’s winners gave up all of their gains on Wednesday.Financials were the leading fallers. The sector has swung wildly this week as speculation that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae might require further capital prompted denials from the government-backed mortgage companies’ regulator and investors rushed out of, and then back into, the stocks.The pair came under pressure again on Wednesday after Fannie sold $3bn of two-year notes at higher yields than in previous offerings.Fannie and Freddie fell 12.6 per cent to $15.40 and 23.8 per cent to $10.26 respectively. The financials sector declined 5.2 per cent and an index of investment banks plumetted 6.1 per cent, hitting six-year lows.Merrill Lynch was a notable faller, tumbling 9.3 per cent to $29.74 after Fitch said it may cut the brokerage’s credit ratings on expectations of a “fourth consecutive quarterly loss in the second quarter due to on-going writedowns”.Perennial whipping-boy Lehman Brothers slumped 11.4 per cent to $19.74.Meanwhile, the technology sector was hurt by some critical commentary. Intel fell 5.3 per cent to $19.81 after Merrill Lynch said the maker of computer chips could fail to beat earnings estimates in the second half due to a weak US economy and tough competition.A downbeat review of Cisco Systems also hit the sector. UBS analysts said the world’s biggest maker of computer-networking equipment faced a slowdown in the US and Europe and may post lower fourth-quarter revenues.Cisco fell 5.7 per cent to $21.58 while the sector declined 3.2 per cent as a whole.Even Alcoa ended the day down. The aluminium producer posted better-than-expected second quarter results and initially climbed before slipping 2.4 per cent at $31.54 as the mood on Wall Street darkened.Battered steel stocks were the one bright spot, receiving a boost from an upgrade to Nucor’s shares.Timna Tanners, an analyst with UBS, wrote: “The 18 per cent drop in the S&P Steel Index in the past week is excessive pessimism in our view, and we see robust North American steel sector earnings reminding investors of the group’s attractiveness.”Nucor rose 3.9 per cent to $65.59, US Steel added 5.1 per cent to $158.17 while AK Steel Holding climbed 5.2 per cent to $54. But the materials sector as a whole followed Alcoa’s trajectory and closed down 0.8 per cent.Oil prices slipped back for a third session late in the day but that did little to lighten the mood. The consumer discretionary and industrials sectors fell 2.7 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively.Dillard’s lost 10 per cent to $9.81, Wal-Mart slipped 2.4 per cent to $57.67 and Terex gave up 8.4 per cent to $43.04.The energy sector also fell back, as refiners came under pressure. Sunoco fell 8.2 per cent to $36.41 and Tesoro slumped 12 per cent to $17.35.Earnings and price target upgrades for US coal producers could not sustain a rally to the close. Peabody Energy and Consol Energy fell 1 per cent to $74.06 and 1.3 per cent to $92.45, respectively.Searching for something positive to say of the recent stock moves, Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, could only point to the rise in volatility which signalled that markets might be near a bottom - at least temporarily.
60;NUE;Nucor Corp;2008-07-08T20:37:10Z;Wall Street rallies in late trade;;Wall Street stocks rallied the most in over a month on Tuesday, bouncing back from bear market territory as falling commodity prices boosted consumer facing stocks and financials roared ahead.Oil was the prime mover on Tuesday, falling about $6 a barrel and dropping below $137 a barrel.That retreat, and some new data showing that tax rebates continue to fuel spending helped consumer-facing stocks. Gap added 5.6 per cent to $16.75 and Ford rose 9.6 per cent to $4.90 while the consumer discretionary sector advanced 2.2 per cent.Office Depot, however, was a weak spot, dropping 31.6 per cent to $7.08 after it said North American same-store sales fell nearly 10 per cent in the second quarter and it warned on operating margins.Consumer staples also fared well, climbing 1.5 per cent. SuperValu rose 5 per cent to $32.67 while Wal-Mart rose 3.9 per cent to $59.11.Results from Pepsi Bottling Group took some of the shine off the sector, however. The company posted second-quarter results that topped analysts’ expectations but investors were unimpressed, trimming the share price by 2.7 per cent to $27.88.Industrials and healthcare stocks also advanced, adding 0.7 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.An analyst upgrade boosted United Parcel Service 4.3 per cent to $60.40 while falling oil prices helped other transport-related stocks gain.GE climbed 3.5 per cent to $28.06, CSX advanced 6.9 per cent to $60.79 and Ryder System rose 4.4 per cent to $70.08.In healthcare sector, stocks rallied a day after S&P equity strategists upgraded the group to “market weight” arguing that with equity volatility likely to remain elevated and valuations low, “investors will re-focus on healthcare’s defensive qualities, allowing for better relative performance. ”Schering-Plough was among the leading gainers, climbing 4.6 per cent to $20.86 after it said its experimental treatment for infertility had met its main goals in a late-stage study.Biogen Idec and Abbott Laboratories gained 6.9 per cent to $62.94 and 5.9 per cent to $57.37 respectively.The benchmark S&P 500 closed the day up 1.7 per cent at 1,273.68. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 per cent to 11,384.21 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3 per cent at 2,294.42. Both indices moved out of bear market territory.Financials stocks climbed sharply, adding 5.7 per cent for their biggest one day gain since early April. The Federal Reserve chairman suggested the central bank would give investment banks access to emergency cash into 2009 while the chief executive of JP Morgan said credit losses would ease.The news offered the sector some consolation after a volatile start to the week in which they re-tested five year lows.The most heavily sold stocks made the strongest advances. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Washington Mutual jumped, soaring 11.9 per cent to $17.62, 13 per cent to $13.64 and 16.8 per cent to $5.99 respectively.On Monday a wave of speculation that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the government sponsored mortgage entities, might have to raise capital to retain their triple A credit ratings triggered heavy selling .In spite of Ben Bernanke’s soothing comments, there were some moments of excitement.IndyMac Bancorp provided the most spectacular of those, plummeting 38 per cent to $0.44. The California mortgage specialist said it did not have enough capital to offer new home loans and an analyst said shareholders may be wiped out.Energy stocks crumpled in response to the falling oil prices however. The sector fell 1.6 per cent and is now on the brink of a correction from its May highs, down about 9 per cent..Exxon Mobil fell 1.2 per cent to $85.94 while ConocoPhillips lost 1.3 per cent to $89.15.Still, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, warned: “It is a passing thing. I don’t think we are going to get a real break in energy prices until the fourth quarter when prices are seasonally weak and some Fed rate hikes take effect.”The materials sector fared little better, losing 0.6 per cent as commodity prices slipped back and investors worried that a global economic downturn would hurt demand. US Steel fell 4.6 per cent to $150.55 while Nucor lost 4.4 per cent to $63.16.
61;NUE;Nucor Corp;2008-07-07T20:44:48Z;Wall Street falls as financials sell off;;US stocks fell on Monday in a volatile session of trading as a rout in the financial sector left broader equity markets poised on the brink of bear territory.The S&P 500 briefly dropped more than 20 per cent from its peak – the definition of a bear market – before recovering slightly. The index has now fallen more than 14 per cent for the year to date.The benchmark S&P 500 gained as much as 0.9 per cent and lost as much as 1.8 per cent before closing down 0.8 per cent at 1,252.30 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5 per cent to 11,231.96 points while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,243.32 points, taking both indices back into bear market territory.In financials, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities, led the retreat. They fell as much as 26 per cent and 29 per cent respectively after analysts at Lehman Brothers said that an accounting change could force them to raise extra capital. By the close, Fannie and Freddie were down 16.2 per cent to $15.74 and 17.9 per cent to $11.91.The banking sector took blows across the board as investment banks and regional banks were hit by more analysts downgrades.An analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey pointed to a number of banks, including SunTrust Banks and First Horizon, as having significant exposure to problematic residential construction loans.Lehman also came under pressure after reports that Platts, the energy-pricing company, had put the firm under a review that excludes it from trading some oil contracts. Lehman dropped 8.8 per cent to $20.84.SunTrust dropped 9.1 per cent to $31.74 and First Horizon tumbled 11.3 per cent to $6.27.The banking sector as a whole dipped 3.2 per cent touching its lowest level since October 2002 along the way while an index of investment banks lost 4.1 per cent.Richard Parker, managing director of institutional sales and trading at Stanford Financial, said: “Everyone is looking for any sort of reason to sell . . . There are just no catalysts that could take this market higher while anything negative leads to a knee-jerk reaction.”The day began in positive fashion with a $4 fall in crude oil prices helping carmakers and other consumer-facing stocks to advance.Ford rose 1.1 per cent to $4.47 while Dillard’s added 3.2 per cent to $10.48 and JC Penney gained 1.7 per cent to $37.30.Deal news also provided positive momentum. General Electric added 0.7 per cent to $27.10 after NBC Universal, its media unit, agreed to buy the Weather Channel along with two buy-out groups.Technology was the only sector to make significant gains, however, adding 0.8 per cent on news that Microsoft would consider reopening talks with Yahoo if activist investor Carl Icahn succeeded in replacing the board.Yahoo shares surged 12 per cent to $23.91 while Microsoft rose 0.2 per cent to $26.03.A round of analyst upgrades and positive writeups for the likes of Broadcom, NetApp and Apple, added to the advance. Broadcom rose 7.1 per cent to $28.09, NetApp added 5.5 per cent to $23.15 and Apple climbed 3 per cent to $175.16.Heavily sold industrial and materials stocks also made something of a comeback.In industrials, heavy goods manufacturers Terex and Cummins added 3.7 per cent to $47.60 and 3.8 per cent to $64.05 respectively.In materials, steel stocks led the way after Goldman Sachs said fundamentals remained strong in the industry.US Steel rose 1.3 per cent to $157.75 while Nucor rose 5.6 per cent to $66.07. Energy stocks fared less well, falling as oil prices slipped.Exxon Mobil fell 1.5 per cent to $86.95 while Chevron lost 1.8 per cent to $96.82 and the sector slipped 2.3 per cent.This week marks the un-official start of second-quarter earnings season with Alcoa due to report its results on Tuesday.Analysts currently expect earnings to decline 12.4 per cent compared to last year, according to Thomson Reuters.Should that happen, it would be the first time the S&P 500 has recorded four consecutive quarters of negative growth since 2002.
62;NUE;Nucor Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Wall Street shrugs off US jobs data;;US equity markets made tentative gains on Thursday but only pared losses for the week after shrugging off data showing that the US shed jobs for a sixth straight month in June and the services sector contracted unexpectedly.According to the US Department of Labor, 62,000 jobs were eliminated last month, largely in line with analysts’ expectations.Analysts noted that there was little cause for optimism on the economy. The unemployment rate, which in May jumped by the most in two decades, remained at 5.5 per cent and non-farm payrolls have now fallen by 438,000 in the first half of the year.Separately, data showed initial jobless claims hit a three-month high last week, while the Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index fell sharply in June.But equity markets proved resilient as traders bet that the poor jobs data would reduce the chance of an interest rate hike from the Fed.Industrial and material stocks were among the leading gainers, adding 1.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively as investors bought back into some of the most heavily sold sectors.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim.com, an online brokerage, said: “Historically, we tend to rally before a patriotic holiday. The major players have already gone home, volumes are light and the path of least resistance is up.”Markets closed early on Thursday and are shut on Friday for the Independence Day holiday. The benchmark S&P 500 ended the day 0.1 per cent higher at 1,262.90 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 at 11,288.54 points while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,245.38 points.Over the shortened week, higher oil prices knocked markets. The Dow and Nasdaq slumped into bear market territory before the Dow recovered slightly, while the S&P 500 touched its lowest level since July 2006.The S&P 500 lost 1.2 per cent over the week and has now declined for five weeks in a row. The Dow Jones fell 0.5 per cent over the week.Technical analysts warned that, having broken through the psychological support of the March lows, the S&P 500 could retest its 2002 depths.Kevin Edgeley, a technical analyst with Goldman Sachs, said: “US markets have been oversold since early June but, in an impulsive trend like this, give no reason to buy.”But investors did just that by, in particular, picking up beaten-down industrial stocks. Ingersoll-Rand added 2.9 per cent to $36.65 while Paccar climbed 2.4 per cent to $40.80.Materials snapped a three- day losing streak as steel producers bounced back. US Steel rose 1.6 per cent to $155.80 and Nucor added 1 per cent to $62.54.Even consumer-facing stocks seemed unfazed by the macroeconomic data. Consumer discretionary stocks added 0.3 per cent while consumer staple stocks rose 0.7 per cent.Safeway and Campbell Soup rose 2.5 per cent to $28.74 and 2.5 per cent to $34.68, respectively, while Kohl’s and Whirlpool climbed 3.4 per cent to $42.52 and 3 per cent to $62.69.Energy stocks were among the biggest fallers however, dropping 0.5 per cent, with refiners taking some punishment. Sunoco fell 3 per cent to $39.69 while Tesoro lost 1.6 per cent to $18.98.In corporate news, NVIDIA tumbled 30.7 per cent to $12.49 after the visual computing technologies provider said second quarter sales would be well below analysts’ estimates.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said that there were some encouraging signs that equity markets might be nearing a bottom. The volatility index has moved higher in recent days, the percentage of stocks trading at or below their 200 day moving averages has increased, and energy and materials stocks have come under pressure.“While this may be seen as a problem for investors,” Mr Levkovich said, “we would stress that any weakness in the commodity and energy space can be helpful to other areas that have been crowded out by momentum-driven trading.”Still, Mr Kinahan warned that there were more losses to come. “This has been the most orderly down move of all time. Wednesday was the first sign of panic. We have further to go on the downside as we have never set a bottom until people have said ‘I have to get out at any price’.”
63;NUE;Nucor Corp;2008-07-02T20:38:07Z;US blue chips buckle under latest oil blow;;Surging oil prices sent US stocks into a tailspin on Wednesday, knocking the S&P 500 below its March lows for the first time and sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average scuttling into bear market territory - down 20 per cent from its recent peak.The benchmark S&P 500 wobbled between gains and losses but closed the day 1.8 per cent lower at 1,261.53 points - its lowest level since July 2006.Technical analysts have warned that a break through the ‘Bear Stearns’ bottom could lead to further sustained weakness with the index retesting its 2002 lows.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.8 per cent to 11,215.51 while the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.5 per cent to 2,292.94. Both are now down more than 20 per cent from their recent peaks.Oil prices smashed through $143 a barrel after a government inventory report showed a sharp drop in crude oil supplies, knocking all ten leading industry groups on the S&P500 into the red.Rising oil prices have been a constant scourge for equity markets in recent months, raising the spectre of spiralling input costs and tumbling corporate profits.The biggest faller on Wednesday was the material sector, which lost 5.3 per cent - its biggest one day fall since March.Energy intensive steel producers fell for a third day. US Steel lost 12.5 per cent to $153.40 and Nucor dropped 14.2 per cent to $61.94.Gold miners also fell back as gold prices dropped. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 6.9 per cent to $107.57 while Newmont Mining lost 4.5 per cent to $50.99.The energy sector also dragged. Coal stocks were the weak link, tumbling as European prices fell the most since 2005. Massey Energy and Consol Energy fell 18.9 per cent to $74.87 and 14.6 per cent to $95.57 respectively.In industrials, transport-related stocks suffered. CSX fell 6.4 per cent to $57.06 while Paccar lost 7 per cent to $39.86.The day began in a positive fashion after European banks dismissed speculation that they would have to raise more cash, bolstering their US peers.But gains were erased after another rash of analyst downgrades while comments by Hank Paulson also took their toll. The Treasury secretary proposed the president should have to approve any use of taxpayer funds to aid a financial company in trouble.Citigroup fell 1.7 per cent to $16.84 while Merrill lost 3.4 per cent to $31.15. The financial sector as a whole slipped 1.4 per cent.Macroeconomic news did little to improve the mood. New data from the Commerce Department showed US factory orders climbed a faster-than-expected 0.6 per cent in May for a third monthly increase.Any positive momentum was curtailed by the ADP Employer Services report, which showed private companies cut jobs at four times the expected rate in June.Carmakers came under renewed pressure after analysts at Merrill Lynch punctured the euphoria surrounding General Motors sales figures, which were released on Tuesday.The brokerage downgraded GM from “buy” to “underperform” and cut its 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates, citing lower forecasts for US car sales and noting that “bankruptcy is not impossible.”GM fell 15.1 per cent to $9.98 while Ford dipped 7.4 per cent to $4.36.The consumer discretionary sector also slipped back 1.7 per cent as oil prices rose. Liz Claibornlost 6.6 per cent to $13.08 while Staplesfell 4.9 per cent to $23.12.Starbucks clung to a 0.4 per cent gain at $15.68, buoyed by plans to cut 7 per cent of its workforce and close 600 stores as part of efforts to revitalise the coffee chain.Blockbuster rose 5.8 per cent to $2.65 after it dropped a $1.35bn bid for Circuit City Stores the lossmaking electronics retailer. Circuit City shares slumped 9 per cent to $2.32.The technology sector was volatile. Semiconductors were the worst performing subsector, while software and services companies followed close behind.But there were exceptions. Yahoo climbed 3.4 per cent to $20.88 after the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft had approached media companies about teaming up for a break-up deal. Microsoft fell 3.7 per cent to $25.88.Meanwhile, Dell shares rallied 2. per cent to $23.70 after chief executive Michael Dell revealed he had bought 4.5m shares in the company at between $21.89 and $22.39 since June 27.
64;NUE;Nucor Corp;2008-07-01T20:42:32Z;GM helps dispel some of Wall Street gloom;;"US equity markets fought back tenaciously on Tuesday, throwing off fuel and financial worries to post modest gains after General Motors showed a smaller than expected decline in sales for June.The morning session proved volatile and gloomy as oil prices streaked higher, keeping up the pressure on consumer-facing and energy-dependent stocks while earnings downgrades hit the banking sector.New data showing an unexpected expansion in manufacturing activity in June helped limit losses. The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing index rose from 49.6 in May to 50.2 last month. Economists had expected the index to slip back in June.Markets swung into positive territory in mid-afternoon when General Motors reported that its sales in North America, seasonally adjusted, declined only 8.3 per cent in June – far less than expected.GM shares, which hit a 54 year low on Monday, overturned early losses to surge as much as 15 per cent. The shares closed 2.2 per cent ahead at $11.75. Ford lost 2.1 per cent to $4.71 after it posted a larger decline in sales.The picture for US auto makers in general looks challenging. Record high oil prices have encouraged buyers to purchase smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles, often made by foreign competitors.Investors also bought back into financial shares, picking up some of the most heavily sold stocks.Still, gains were limited by a slump in material stocks, which lost 1 per cent, while the consumer discretionary sector, of which automakers are a part, also lost ground.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,284.93 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 per cent to 11,382.26 points while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 2,304.97 points.On Monday, most stocks fell, rounding off the S&P 500’s worst month in six years as rising oil prices and worries about the health of the leading financial institutions undermined investor confidence. The Dow showed its biggest June decline since 1930.Larry Smith, chief investment officer at Third Wave Global Investors, said: “These very poor equity numbers directly reflect the fact that, until oil comes down, we are going to continue to have growth that is weak and gets weaker.”The downward trend paused on Tuesday, but weak spots were evident.In materials, energy-intensive steel producers were among the biggest fallers. AK Steel , US Steel and Nucor lost 4.9 per cent to $65.59; 5.1 per cent to $175.35; and 3.3 per cent to $72.23, respectively.In the industrial sector, railway stocks CSX and Union Pacific lost 3 per cent to $60.93 and 2.5 per cent to $73.65, while package delivery companies FedEx and UPS slipped 3.1 per cent to $76.37 and 1.5 per cent to $60.55.A rally in GE and Deere shares helped counterbalance those losses at the close however. The pair added 1.6 per cent to $27.12 and 1.8 per cent to $73.42 respectively.Meanwhile, consumer discretionary stocks also fell slightly as fuel prices rose. Dillard’s, the department store operator, fell 6.2 per cent to $10.85 while Jones Apparelslipped 1.9 per cent to $13.49.The biggest loser was Fortune Brands. The home products maker gave up 13.3 per cent to $54.13 after second-quarter profit fell more than it forecast, in part because of the US housing slump.Energy stocks made up for those losses. Schlumberger, the oil services company, added 2.3 per cent to $109.86 while the sector as whole gained 0.6 per cent. The refiners struggled however. Tesoro lost 2.2 per cent to $19.37.Banking stocks proved surprisingly resilient, looking past a UBS note in which the firm slashed its earnings forecasts for US banks for 2008 and 2009 by up to 30 per cent.The sector overturned losses of as much as 2.8 per cent to gain 1 per cent and snap a three day losing streak. JPMorganand Citigroup recovered from early losses to gain 0.3 per cent to $34.02 and 2.2 per cent to $17.13.Lehman Brothers also made ground, rebounding 5.8 per cent to $20.96 after Morgan Stanley rated the firm “overweight” in new coverage.CIT Group the loss-making business lender, was the leading sector gainer however, rising 30 per cent to $8.83 after it agreed to sell its manufactured housing and home-loan businesses for $1.8bn to focus on commercial lending."
65;NUE;Nucor Corp;2008-06-13T20:36:59Z;Wall Street rises as oil prices fall;;US stocks advanced for a second straight session on Friday as falling oil prices, new data showing only a moderate rise in inflation in May and upbeat comments from a former Fed chairman cheered investors, helping to pare back losses for the week.Oil slipped back about $2, offering a respite to US consumers and the companies that depend on their spending habits.Consumer discretionary stocks advanced 1.8 per cent, led by the likes of 1.5 per cent, led by the likes of Limited Brands, which added 5.4 per cent to $18.67, and Abercrombie & Fitch, which rose 4.6 per cent to $69.29.Sentiment also received a boost from Lehman Brothers, which rebounded from its recent lows. BlackRock, the largest publicly traded US fund manager, said it had bought shares in the brokerage this week and had confidence in its leadership.On Thursday, Lehman shocked Wall Street by replacing its chief financial and chief operating officers in short order. That news came just days after the embattled investment bank had pre-announced a second-quarter loss and a $6bn capital raising.Lehman shares, which have been under siege this week, losing about 20 per cent of their value, on Friday rose 13.7 per cent to $25.81.The positive momentum on Friday was encouraged by a key measure of core inflation that rose only slightly in May, calming fears that the Federal Reserve would soon have to raise interest rates.Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, also gave a small fillip to equity markets at the close, telling a conference in Mexico City that the worst of the credit crisis is nearly over and the chance of a deep recession had reduced.All ten leading industry groups rose on Friday, helping the S&P 500 index to close 1.5 per cent higher at 1,360.02. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 per cent to 12,307.35 while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.1 per cent to 2,454.50.In spite of the gains, the tone on Wall Street has darkened over the past few weeks as investors have coped with bad news from financials and looked ahead to rising inflation, weak consumer spending and a prolonged period of depressed earnings. The S&P 500 has retreated 0.1 this week and 2.9 per cent over the month to date. Volatility has spiked higher too.Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said: “The recent market rally gave a false sense of hope to investors who may have thought that the worst of the credit crisis had passed . . . We feel that brief respite is over and we’re facing another bout of weakness, at least rivalling the first leg down.”According to analysts at KBW, the outlook for the commercial banking sector is also bleak. The risks of further credit losses remain substantial and reserve-building and dilutive capital raisings may weigh on share prices.The financial sector lost 0.6 per cent this week and is now down 20.7 per cent over the year to date. The KBW banking index remains near six-year lows.At the heart of the crisis, the housing slump continues to take its toll. According to RealtyTrac, the number of foreclosure filings was about 50 per cent higher last month compared with a year earlier.US homebuilders continue to feel the pinch and the S&P homebuilder index has dropped about 34 per cent since April, giving up all of its 2008 gains.But early-week laggards found some momentum on Friday. Technology stocks rose 2 per cent after the Microsoft-Yahoo-Google love-triangle looked close to resolving itself.Overnight, Yahoo and Google announced a limited tie-up, leaving Microsoft out in the cold. Microsoft rose 2.9 per cent to $29.07, Google added 3.3 per cent to $570.93 while Yahoo slipped 0.2 per cent to $23.47.Meanwhile, Steel Dynamics jumped 7.4 per cent to $39.47 after raising its second-quarter profit forecast.US Steel rose 4.8 per cent to $174.61 and Nucor added 4.3 per cent to $77.06, helping the materials sector to advance 2.7 per cent and turn early week losses into a 0.7 per cent gain.
66;NUE;Nucor Corp;2008-06-05T20:47:55Z;Wall St up after surprise fall in jobless claims;;US stocks decisively ended a three day losing run on Thursday after initial jobless claims dropped unexpectedly to a six-week low while a late surge in oil prices helped energy stocks to their biggest one-day gains since early March.According to the US Department of Labor, first time claims for unemployment benefits fell 18,000 to 357,000 last week, after seasonal adjustments. Economists had expected a rise of 3,000.The numbers, when combined with better-than-expected private employment data released on Wednesday by payroll services group ADP, will give markets a little more confidence ahead of an employment report for May.Gains accelerated after reports showed robust retail sales growth in May. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, chain store sales rose a better-than-expected 3 per cent on a year-on-year, same-store basis.The main beneficiaries were the wholesale, drugstore and discount sectors, hinting that the consumer remains under pressure.A late rally in commodity-related stocksadded to the momentum, as did news that Verizon Communications had agreed to buy rival Alltel for $28.1bn in cash and debt from TPG and Goldman Sachs.A broad rally pushed the benchmark S&P 500 index 2 per cent higher to 1,404.04 – its biggest one-day gain since mid-April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.7 per cent to 12,604.45 while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.9 per cent to 2,549.94.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve unnerved markets with hawkish comments on inflation while the threat of credit ratings downgrades to major bond insurers snuffed out an early rally in financials. On Thursday, financials revived thanks to a positive note on Lehman Brothers, the embattled brokerage firm whose slumping share price has acted as a drag on sentiment for much of this week.Mike Mayo, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said the shares could rise, as the “worst-case scenarios” were already priced in.“Net-net, we feel Lehman is not Bear,” Mr Mayo said, as “liquidity is not a major issue, in our view, while equity risk remains but does not seem outsized”.Lehman rose 7.8 per cent to $33.85 while an index of investment banking stocks advanced 2.8 per cent and the broader S&P 500 financials index added 2 per cent.The sector briefly pared gains in mid-afternoon, when S&P cut the financial strength rankings of MBIA and Ambac, before regaining its stride.Even the two bond insurers eventually closed higher, up 7.3 per cent to $6.04 and 5.2 per cent to $2.62 respectively, as traders covered short positions.Better-than-expected retail figures buoyed consumer-facing stocks. Costco Wholesale reported a 9 per cent rise in same-store sales in May, while Wal-Mart reported a 3.9 per cent rise. Wal-Mart rose 3.7 per cent to $59.80 and Costco added 3.8 per cent to $73.50.Gains in the consumer staples and consumer discretionary sectors were limited to 1.1 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively, by a dramatic rise in commodities prices. Oil surged $5 after the dollar dropped against the euro on statements by the ECB suggesting interest rates may rise next month. That was a boon for materials and energy stocks, which added 3.4 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively.Nucor climbed 8.6 per cent to $80.54 after it raised its forecasts for second-quarter profit because of rising demand for steel.Monsanto made ground, rising 5.3 per cent to $138.51 after Jefferies raised its price target from $140 to $152.Exxon Mobil and Chevron jumped 4.2 per cent to $89.31 and 4.1 per cent to $99.99 respectively. Airlines were in focus after a number of analysts upgraded stocks in the sector, pointing to decisions by the big carriers to slash jobs and capacity.Continental Airlines said it would cut 3,000 jobs and reduce capacity by 11 per cent in the fourth quarter to offset rising jet fuel prices.UAL added 10.6 per cent to $10.11. Delta and Northwest advanced 12.1 per cent to $6.84 and 15 per cent to $8.06 respectively. Continental rose 4.8 per cent to $15.20.The Verizon deal boosted the telecoms sector. Verizon added 5.4 per cent to $38.96, AT&T advanced 2.5 per cent to $39.46 while the broader sector rose 2.9 per cent.
67;NUE;Nucor Corp;2008-05-21T20:50:43Z;Wall St falls sharply as Fed minutes released;;US stock markets fell sharply for a second session on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve indicated it was finished with rate-cuts for the moment even as it slashed its economic growth forecasts and raised its projections for inflation and unemployment.The day began in downbeat fashion as oil prices continued their relentless climb, cruising past $133 a barrel and casting a pall on equity indices. Spot oil prices hit above $134 in after-hours trading, up more than $5 on the day.The moves hit the consumer discretionary sector, swamping some positive deal news that Time Warner is to spin off its cable division while Barnes & Noble is considering a bid for rival bookseller Borders.Oil-dependent industries such as air transport were pummelled by the threat of dramatic input cost increases. Losses accelerated in mid-afternoon, when the minutes of the FOMC meeting in April revealed that the 25 basis point rate cut had been a “close call” with rising inflation risks weighing against growth concerns.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research said: “What really scared people was the fact that the Fed cut their growth numbers and they talked a little about inflation so in essence they have opened the door to rate hikes down the road. Throw in the fact that oil is up again and we have pretty big sell-off.”All 10 leading industry groups on the S&P 500 fell back, with materials stocks leading the way.Financials followed close behind, dragged down by revelations in the Financial Times that computer modelling errors caused Moody’s to mistakenly assign top-notch ratings to debt securities that later fell in value.Ratings agencies have been criticised for their part in the mortgage backed securities market, the collapse of which triggered the credit crisis.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 1.6 per cent to 1,390.75 points, its first close below 1,400 in eight days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also suffered, falling 1.8 per cent to 12,601.76 points - it’s biggest one day fall in a month. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.8 per cent to 2,448.27.On Tuesday, equity markets pulled back from four-month highs amid rising oil prices, data showing a bump in core inflation and a number of analyst earnings downgrades to the banking sector.The chronic and well-publicised woes of financials over the past year have wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off the market capitalisation of the leading players with the result that the sector has been overtaken by technology as the biggest on the S&P 500.Still, neither sector fared well on Wednesday. Financials fell 2.6 per cent, led lower by Moody’s, which tumbled 15.9 per cent to $36.91. McGraw-Hill, owner of rival ratings agency Standard & Poor’s, fell 5.5 per cent to $41.18.Technology stocks came under pressure in mid-afternoon. Google and Apple lost 4.9 per cent to $549.99 and 4.2 per cent to $178.19 respectively.Fears about rising energy and input prices weighed on the consumer discretionary sector. Stephen Wood, Senior Portfolio Strategist at Russell Investments, said: “Given what is happening with housing prices, the credit markets and with oil, we are looking at more muted economic and consumer activity.”Retailers Macy’s and Target fell 5.6 per cent to $23.18 and 2.6 per cent to $52.87, but some deal news helped pare losses for the sector to 1.9 per cent.Time Warner, the media company, agreed to spin off Time Warner Cable. Time Warner owns 84 per cent of Time Warner Cable and has been under pressure to relinquish the business and focus on turning round its ailing AOL internet division. Time Warner shares rose 0.6 per cent to $16.24 while Time Warner Cable shares added 3.5 per cent to $31.27.Bid speculation enveloped booksellers. Borders rose 8.8 per cent to $6.91 and Barnes & Noble was flat at $29.95.Among US carriers, Continental Airlines fell 13.2 per cent to $14.20, United Airlines parent UAL dropped 29.5 per cent to $8.15. AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell 24.2 per cent to $6.22 after it announced plans to cut domestic capacity.Materials groups fell 3 per cent – the most since early March.

68;NUE;Nucor Corp;2008-05-01T20:45:37Z;Wall St rises as tech stocks rally;;Wall Street stocks powered ahead on Thursday driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average, above 13,000 for the first time since early January after a rally in financial and technology stocks offset an earnings disappointment from ExxonMobil and a sagging energy sector.Analysts said that the vices of commodities rather than the virtues of the banking and technology sectors were behind the unlikely surge.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research said: “It seems that money is rotating from the previous leaders – commodity stocks, gold, agricultural stocks – into the laggards.”“ExxonMobil’s ‘poor’ earnings hurt oil stocks, and oil prices have also come off highs, so money moved out of the sector into financials and tech stocks.”An index of financial stocks added 3.9, its best one-day gain in a month, taking the sector to its highest level since February.The energy sector suffered however retreating 2.2 per cent as the dollar rallied and commodities prices slipped.A broad upswing carried eight out of 10 key sectors into positive territory and lifted the S&P 500 1.7 per cent to 1,409.33, its biggest gain in almost two weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5 per cent to 13,010, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.8 per cent to 2,465.76.On Wednesday the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate but an equivocal accompanying statement knocked equity markets.On Thursday began in similarly downbeat fashion after Exxon and weak employment data showing soaring first-time benefit claims initially weighed on the market. Still, an Institute for Supply Management index showing that manufacturing activity was weak but steady in April, helped calm nerves.Merrill Lynch was one of the leading beneficiaries from the volte face, jumping 5.1 per cent to $52.39 after the head of a Kuwait sovereign wealth fund said it may increase its holding in the investment bank.Comments overnight by Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, who said that the credit crisis was closer to the end than the beginning, supported the rally. Lehman Brothers rose 6.1 per cent to $46.93, Citigroup added 4.2 per cent to $25.99 and Bank of America gained 4.9 per cent to $39.39.CIT Group jumped 10.1 per cent to $11.99 on speculation that the independent finance company, which has been badly hit by credit market turmoil, would be sold.MBIA jumped 12.9 per cent to $11.74 after Jay Brown, its chief executive, told shareholders that the the embattled bond insurer, has enough capital to retain its triple A rating.Technology stocks were particularly strong last month after a number of industry heavyweights reported better-than-expected results and that trend continued on Thursday.The sector rose 3.2 per cent, thanks in part to Symantec. The maker of security software jumped 12.3 per cent to $19.34 after it said fourth-quarter profit tripled. Semiconductor companies also contributed to the rally after new data showed chip sales rose in March and a handful of decent earnings reports boosted sentiment. Intel rose 4.6 per cent to $23.29 while AMD added 4.4 per cent to $6.22.ExxonMobil took some of the shine of equity markets after it reported massive profits but undershot expectations super-charged by record high oil prices. Shares in the energy group fell 3.6 per cent to $89.70, while Chevron slipped 1.3 per cent to $94.94.Materials stocks also performed poorly. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold slumped 5.1 per cent to $107.96 while Nucor fell 2.2 per cent to $73.82.Larry Smith, chairman and chief investment officer of Third Wave Global Investors, said: “We may be seeing the end of the commodity bull run. There has been a lot of speculative money, some of it from hedge funds, chasing up prices. When prices stop going up that money will go away and we could see a big reversal.”Energy’s discomfort proved a boon for consumer discretionary stocks, which rose 3.3 per cent – their best showing in a month.Comcast, the largest cable operator in the US, was among the top performers, cheering investors with on-target first-quarter results. Comcast shares rose 8.6 per cent to $22.31.
69;NUE;Nucor Corp;2008-04-07T20:41:12Z;Wall St rally buckles as Alcoa disappoints;;Wall Street stocks ended the day roughly where they began as jitters ahead of the opening burst of first-quarter earnings reports offset fresh gains for financials.The benchmark S&P 500 pared early gains to close 0.2 per cent higher at 1,372.54 while the Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.3 per cent at 2,364.83.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at at 12,612.43.Markets opened in a positive mood after press reports that Washington Mutual is poised to receive a $5bn capital injection from a group of investors including private equity firm TPG.The largest US savings and loan company has been hit by big subprime-related losses over the last year or so and analysts had speculated that it, along with much of the financial sector, would need to raise additional funds.Washington Mutual shares surged 29.3 per cent to $13.15 in spite of fears that the investment could substantially dilute current shareholders. Over the past year the shares have lost about 67 per cent of their value.Last week US stock markets rallied strongly on the news that Lehman Brothers, another financial institution hit by losses on credit products and rumours of further problems, had raised $4bn through a share sale.Lehman shares on Monday rose 1.3 per cent to $44.60, while an index of financial stocks added 1 per cent.As the day progressed bad news and nerves weighed on investor sentiment.The battle for control of Yahoo intensified after Microsoft issued a three-week ultimatum for the internet search company to agree to a takeover. If not, Microsoft said it would take the deal directly to shareholders.Yahoo said that the deal undervalued the company and called the threat counterproductive. The value of the cash-and-stock proposal has declined from $41 per share when it was announced to $29.26 at Friday’s closing price.Yahoo shares fell 2.3 per cent to $27.70, while Microsoft was flat at $29.16.A potentially bumpy earnings season kicked off on Monday with disappointing results from Alcoa, the world’s third-largest aluminium company, after the close of trading.Claire Collingwood, a dealer at CMC Markets, said: “Many will be looking at today as the start of a roller-coaster ride for US equity markets. Expectations are that we will see another drubbing for corporate profits . . . but many are hoping it won’t be as bad as last year’s fourth-quarter earnings.”Alcoa said that first quarter profit fell by more than half compared to a year ago, undershooting analysts’ estimates, due to higher energy costs and a weak dollar which offset a recent surge in aluminium prices.Ahead of the results, Goldman Sachs analysts increased their target price on the stock from $37 to $42, but fears that the company would disappoint sent Alcoa shares down by 4 per cent to $37.44 by the close.Other materials stocks climbed however, led by Eastman Chemical after the US maker of plastic for water bottles said first-quarter profit excluding some items exceeded the highest analyst estimates.Eastman shares were the leading gainers in the sector, rising 3.1 per cent to $68.38, while Westlake Chemical bounced 11.6 per cent to $17.67 after analysts at UBS upgraded the stock to “buy”.US Steel also made ground after analysts at Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock from “equal-weight” to “overweight”, arguing that increasing steel prices would help earnings. US Steel added 2.2 per cent to $143.72. Nucor, another steelmaker added 1.1 per cent to $71.28.For the S&P 500 index as a whole, this is likely to be a painful first quarter.According to Thomson Financial, earnings are set to fall for a third successive quarter – an average of 12.2 per cent compared with a year earlier.Financials are likely to be the worst-hit sector, with total earnings estimated to fall by 60 per cent compared with the first quarter last year, from $59bn to $23.7bn.Consumer discretionary companies are expected to be the next weakest, with earnings falling by 12 per cent for a fourth consecutive quarter dragged down by the automotive and homebuilding sectors.The energy sector is expected to see earnings growth of about 28 per cent.
70;NUE;Nucor Corp;2008-01-11T01:33:33Z;Duferco predicts slowdown in steel industry;;The global steel industry faces the possibility of its first prolonged slowdown since 2001 in the second half of the year, according to the head of Duferco, the world’s biggest steel trading company.Bruno Bolfo, chairman and owner of Duferco, said a period of lower prices and weaker demand might be expected as a result of a “delayed reaction” to the credit crunch, the impact of which is beginning to seep into some consumer businesses.“You have to be concerned when you see the reports about the problems in the financial services industry. It is difficult to imagine these would not have some impact on steel,” he said.But Mr Bolfo – whose company is based in Switzerland – said there were a “lot of positive indications” for the steel industry that might reduce the impact on the sector of any general slowing in the world economy.“China and India are still very strong [in terms of their demand for steel] and so is the Middle East,” said Mr Bolfo. “It’s as though in the past few years we have had 600m-700m new people added to the world [considering their impact on global consumption trends].”Also, he added, demand for steel in sectors such as transportation and energy was still very strong – even in the US where much of the credit crunch has its roots.Adding to worries that the steel industry could be moving into a weaker period, Posco, the world’s fourth-biggest steelmaker, on Thursday reported a larger-than-expected 20 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profit, largely as a result of weaker demand for stainless steel.Net income at the Korean company dropped to Won713bn ($761m) from Won895bn for the comparable period a year earlier. However, Posco moved to ease investor concerns by saying net income for the first quarter of this year would rebound, helped by an increase in production.In recent weeks, investors have shown a few frissons of concern about the world steel industry, which, for most of the decade, has enjoyed stellar growth, with a sequence of price rises and a strong showing on equity markets.Since October, the global index of all quoted steel stocks has fallen 4 per cent compared with the world index of all publicly traded companies.Separately, Duferco on Thursday announced a joint venture in Italy with Nucor, the US’s second-biggest steelmaker, which marks the US company’s first production foray into Europe.Under the agreement, Nucor is likely to pay about $700m for a 50 per cent stake in Duferdofin, a steelmaker in Italy that Duferco owns and which is run separately to its global steel trading business.Duferdofin’s three plants make steel beams for use in the construction industry, with a large amount exported, particularly to fast-growing markets in eastern Europe and Turkey.Neither Duferco nor Nucor has given any indication of how much the US company will pay for its stake, as this is subject to negotiation.Dan Dimicco, Nucor’s chairman and chief executive, said the joint venture would enable Nucor to bring into Europe “its particular operating knowhow” in running steel mini-mills in the US.Mini-mills rely on scrap metal as a raw material rather than iron ore. Duferdofin – which is due to increase its output to some 1.6m tonnes a year by the end of 2008 – uses mini-mill technology in its Italian plants.
71;NUE;Nucor Corp;2007-10-09T02:43:43Z;China steel groups hit at claims of subsidies;;"Two of China’s top-five steelmakers have attacked a report from the US steel industry complaining about $52bn of government subsidies allegedly handed to the Chinese steel business.They say the report suffered from methodological flaws and contained figures that were “not true”.Zhang Xiaogang, president of Anshan Iron & Steel, said the US report, unveiled two months ago, was “not reasonable” and suffered from “flaws” in the way it was compiled. Anshan is China’s third-biggest steel producer.Hu Wangming, vice-president of Wuhan Iron & Steel, the country’s fifth-biggest producer, said: “The people who produced this report used the wrong statistics and have not fully understood the Chinese steel industry.”The US report was produced by the American Iron and Steel Institute, the main trade body representing US steelmakers.It was supported by several leading US steel companies, including Nucor.In comments that may exacerbate the tensions between the two sets of producers, Dan Dimicco, chief executive of Nucor, called the complaints from the Chinese steelmakers “hog-wash”.“The report has had a lot of attention around the world and was firmly based on what has been happening in China,” Mr Dimicco said.“Rather than the numbers in it being too high, they were probably too low; the $52bn estimate was conservative.”The US study said China’s steel industry – by far the biggest in the world – has benefited over the past 10 years from the “pervasive influence” of financial transfers from central and local government bodies, some of which are alleged to break World Trade Organisation rules.Much of the subsidy stems from the fact that 91 per cent of the production of the top 20 steelmakers in China was from government-owned entities, the study said.Mr Zhang’s comments came at the Berlin annual conference of the International Iron and Steel Institute. He said that, since the 1990s, most of China’s steel companies, even if they remained owned either by Beijing or regional governments, operated according to the rules of conventional businesses.“We think the report is unreasonable and the figures in it are not true,” said Mr Zhang, who is also chairman of the China Iron and Steel Association, the trade body for China’s steel producers.Mr Hu said the report had generated the figure of $52bn for the country’s alleged total subsidy to the industry by adding up sums of money that had been granted to companies for purposes unrelated to steelmaking, such as running local schools.It was incorrect to think that Chinese steel companies had been given special low-cost loans by government bodies, he said.“Steel companies in China do not get preferential treatment,” he added.Steelmakers in several countries allege that one reason China’s steel industry has grown so big is that its costs have been helped over the years by special loans and favourable tax treatment by governments.Critics allege that this special treatment has enabled Chinese steelmakers to ramp up exports at artificially low prices.Mr Zhang said he wanted to challenge the idea that Chinese steelmakers were concerned purely with exporting cheap commodity grades of steel.“We have spent a lot of effort building up relationships with foreign businesses such as General Motors, General Electric, BMW and Hyundai, supplying these companies with high grades of steel both in China and outside,” he said.Exports are on a downward trend, claim producersChinese steel exports are on a downward trend, says Zhang Xiaogang, president of Anshan Iron & Steel.This year, net exports of steel from China (exports minus imports) are thought likely to be 50m-60m tonnes compared with 35m tonnes last year. Much of this steel has been produced with the help of government subsidies, steelmakers in the US allege.However, Mr Zhang said action by Beijing to rein back exports was beginning to take effect.“In the past four months of 2007, the level of exports will fall,” he said.Beijing has come under pressure from other countries to reduce steel exports and is trying to achieve this through measures such as removal of tax incentives for steel exporters.Steelmakers in other countries say they are aware of the downward trend in Chinese steel exports but that the trade figures will need to be monitored for some time before conclusions can be drawn.Daniel Novegil, chief executive of Ternium, an Argentina-based steelmaker, said there was “no doubt” Chinese steel exports were falling.Even so, he remained worried about the fact that low-cost supplies of steel from China were available and said they carried a “suspicion” of benefiting from unfair subsidies."
72;NUE;Nucor Corp;2007-06-15T20:24:01Z;Nasdaq leads Wall Street gains;;Wall Street rebounded from an interest rate pothole this week and a strong weekly performance left the S&P 500 and blue chips testing record territory once more.After falling by about 1 per cent on Tuesday when long-term bond yields soared to their highest level since 2002, US stock benchmarks subsequently found their footing when rates stabilised. Benign core inflation readings for May reinforced the stabilisation in bonds and also boosted stocks.Tony Crescenzi, bond strategist at Miller Tabak & Co, said the inflation data would “help to restrain any increase in yields, which for the stock market is enough to put worries about the bond market a bit further into the background”.Attention has focused on whether the recent rise in bond yields will damp what has been a frenetic pace of merger and acquisition activity. On Friday, there were signs that deal activity was picking up and Home Depot, up 0.4 per cent at $37.95, received two separate bids for its wholesale supply unit. Among sectors in the vanguard of this week’s rebound was energy, as oil prices hit nine-month highs. Rate-sensitive utility stocks rallied, while higher commodity prices buoyed materials and industrial stocks.However, the rise in yields pushed mortgage rates sharply higher and the home builder and real estate investment trust sectors declined.The leading index this week was the Nasdaq Composite. The technology benchmark rose 1.05 per cent to 2,626.71 on Friday, a rise of 2.1 per cent over the week. Semiconductor stocks rallied 2.8 per cent this week, led by a 11 per cent rise to $24.24 for Intel. The chipmaker was upgraded to a “buy” on Friday by Goldman Sachs.The S&P 500 rose 0.65 per cent to 1,532.91 on Friday, a gain of 1.7 per cent this week. It was up from a low of 1,492.97 on Tuesday and was near its recent closing record of 1,539.18.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 13,639.48 on Friday, a rise of 1.6 per cent this week. The blue chip barometer was just shy of its recent record peak of 13,692. The Dow Transportation Average rose 1.1 per cent this week, taking its gain this year to 13.5 per cent as the sector rebounded from a sharp slide on Tuesday, when it hit its lowest level since mid April.Leading the blue chips this week was General Motors, up 11.8 per cent to $34.66 as investors cheered hopes for a union settlement over Delphi, the car maker’s former parts unit, that would help GM’s restructuring efforts.Ford rose 8.2 per cent to $8.92 this week, after it hired banks to advise on the sale of its Jaguar and Land Rover divisions.Deal talk this week focused on the exchange sector. Shares in Nymex rose 1.7 per cent to $142.12 on Friday, for a gain of 13.5 per cent this week, amid reports that it was seeking to merge with another exchange.The tug of war over CBOT Holdings, between the InterContinental Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange took a couple of twists.The CME and CBOT revised the terms of their merger agreement and will provide a special dividend to all CBOT shareholders. This followed a move by ICE on Tuesday to include a cash component in its bid for the CBOT. Shares in CBOT rose 4.3 per cent to $206.98, CME was up 0.6 per cent at $552.70, while ICE gained 7.8 per cent to $156.98.The S&P steel index fell 4.9 per cent, trimming its gain in 2007 to 27.9 per cent as consolidation talk cooled. Nucor slid 5.4 per cent to $63.02 after the steelmaker warned that its second quarter earnings would be well below analysts’ expectations.A number of stocks either hit record or 52-week highs.Eastman Kodak set a 52-week high of $30.20, and rose 10.3 per cent to $29.31. It said it had created image-sensor technology to allow photography in poor light.Freeport-McMoRan rose to a record high of $84.90 amid higher copper prices and news that the miner will sell some assets. Shares in the company gained 10.8 per cent to $84.42 this week.Apple hit a record high of $127.61 before investors cashed in after the company’s annual Developers Conference in San Francisco passed with no major new product news. The stock fell 3.2 per cent to $120.50.In earnings news, subprime mortgage woes clipped fixed income results at Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs. For the week, Bear was up 1.5 per cent at $150.09, and had pared its 2007 loss to 7.8 per cent. Goldman rose 0.5 per cent to $226.19, taking its gain in 2007 to 13.5 per cent.Lehman posted a 27 per cent rise in second quarter earnings to a record $1.3bn and its stock rose 6.6 per cent to $79.07. Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $88.48 on Friday.Fortress Investment Group slumped 6.5 per cent to $23.47 on Friday, as proposed legislation could raise taxes for the private-equity and hedge fund.Dean Foodsfell 3.5 per cent to $31.23 after it cut earnings estimates for the second quarter.Smith & Wesson reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and sales. The gun maker also raised its full-year profit and sales forecasts.

73;NUE;Nucor Corp;2007-06-11T20:31:16Z;Technology weighs on Wall Street;;Wall Street was mixed on Monday, weighed down by technology shares and the market lacked the flurry of deal activity that has come to define the start of a trading week in recent months.Stocks sought a footing in the absence of significant economic or earnings news and pared early gains when Treasury bond yields rose further. Last week, the yield on the 10-year bond approached its highest level for more than a year and late-afternoon on Monday was up 23.6 basis points at 5.154 per cent.The comparative lack of deal activity on Monday after the rise in bond yields was not a cause for concern at this stage, analysts said.Doug Peta, equity strategist at J&W Seligman, said: “It could be the canary in the coalmine, and it’s something to watch over the next few weeks. Higher rates do matter, but a 5.25 per cent yield on the 10-year should not stifle activity and even if rates reached 5.75 per cent, they would still be historically low.”For now, bond traders expect yields to remain stuck in a range between 5 and 5.25 per cent.Mr Peta said the economy was in sound shape at this stage and that was supportive for stocks.The S&P 500 index rose 0.1 per cent to close at 1,509.12. So far in June, the index has lost about 1.4 per cent and is on track for its worst monthly performance since February’s loss of 2.2 per cent.The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index of S&P volatility showed evidence of consolidation after last week’s hefty rise and fell 0.9 per cent on Monday.Among the 10 main industry groups in the S&P, utility stocks were up 1 per cent. The interest rate-sensitive sector fell last week when bond yields soared. Technology and Materials fared worst among the sectors in negative territory on Monday.Financials were higher, with Lehman Brothers up 2 per cent at $75.68, ahead of the release of the bank’s second quarter results on Tuesday. The stock remains 3.1 per cent lower since the start of the year and off its February high of $85.80.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that over the past year, the energy and utilities sectors have the weakest relationship with changes in the overall S&P index. By contrast, the financials and consumer discretionary sectors have the strongest correlation with the index.Technology stocks lost steam late on Monday and and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.05 per cent to close at 2,572.15.Apple was an actively traded stock and after rising to a high of $126.15 earlier in the day, ifell 3.5 per cent to close at $120.19. Traders blamed the lack of a notable new product announcement at the company’s annual Developers Conference in San Francisco.Blue chips lacked direction and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed a fraction higher at 13,424.96.Shares in Merck were a bright spot on the Dow, up 1.8 per cent to $51.05 andbroke an 11-day losing streak. Dupont led blue chips lower, extending last week’s slide by a further 0.8 per cent to $50.73.Steel stocks remained in the spotlight on Monday. US Steel slumped 7.1 per cent lower to $116.20 as the consolidation talk that sparked a jump of about 8 per cent in the stock on Friday faded.Shares in Nucor slid 5.9 per cent to close at $62.66 after the steelmaker warned that its second quarter earnings would be well below analysts’ expectations. The stock has still gained 14.6 per cent so far this year.Shares in NetFlix, the online DVD rental service, fell 6.4 per cent to $21.93 after a downgrade by JPMorgan.Credit Suisse upgraded Johnson & Johnson to “neutral” from “underperform” and noted that it had lagged its pharmaceutical rivals by 17 per cent over the last year. The shares rose 0.2 per cent to close at $62.27.Shares in H&R Block jumped 4.7 per cent to $23.68, after UBS said the tax-return preparer would be an attractive buy-out candidate once it completed the sale of its subprime mortgage business.Ford Motor rose 1.9 per cent to $8.40 after the carmaker hired banks to advise on the sale of its Jaguar and Land Rover divisions.Shares in Medivation soared 22.4 per cent to $19.80, after the biotech drug maker said its drug for treating Alzheimer’s disease revealed favourable results.In a quiet weekend for deals, Owens-Illinois agreed to sell its plastics business to Rexam for $1.83bn. Owens fell 1.9 per cent to $32.65.
74;NUE;Nucor Corp;2007-04-27T20:37:03Z;Wall St steadier following GDP jitters;;A fresh batch of strong earnings updates pushed Wall Street stocks to historic highs this week, but the advance remained more symbolic than substantial.The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 13,000 point threshold for the first time on Wednesday, in a move heralded by bulls as a sign of good times ahead.Yet the technical breakthrough came amid a listless week for the broader S&P 500 index. The benchmark index closed 0.7 per cent higher this week after falling slightly on four out of five days. The Dow rose 1.2 per cent this week.The Dow closed 0.1 per cent up on Friday at 13,120.94 while the S&P 500 was 0.2 points lower at 1,494.08.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent at 2,557.21.“It has been a week where the Dow has caught up with the S&P, they are now both up over 5 per cent for the year to date,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co.“The market has been celebrating earnings and upbeat guidance.”The indices were led upwards by companies such as Whirlpool and 3M that were boosted by a weak dollar and strong growth overseas. Railway and steel stocks, which are more exposed to the US economy, fared less well.Microsoft broke through the $30 mark for the first time since the launch of the Vista operating system to stand up 3.5 per cent to $30.12 on Friday. But overall investor sentiment was subdued by data showing economic growth slowing.This came towards the end of one of the best months on Wall Street for more than three years. The Dow rose 6.2 per cent in April, but the gains were driven by a relatively narrow base. About half of the gains were made by just eight of the 30 Dow component stocks.The steady rise in stocks has made it a testing month for short-sellers. Amazon, for instance, rose 36.9 per cent to $61.50 this week after entering April with short selling of its stock at the highest level since 2003.While the surge was sparked by a strong earnings report, the jump was partly explained by the unwinding of loss-making short positions.With more than two-thirds of the company’s shares held by a handful of investors, many short sellers looking to buy the stock may have found it hard to come by.Baker Hughes, the oil services group, was one of the biggest risers this week, up 11.7 per cent to $81.01.Like many other US groups reporting during the week, Baker was boosted by strong overseas sales. Whirlpool rose 17.6 per cent to $106.41 in spite of a US housing downturn because of strong appliance sales abroad.Meanwhile 3M, the Post-it Note maker that generates the majority of its revenues overseas, rose 4.9 per cent to $81.55 on strong profits.Railways and steel, two sectors that surged this year amid a burst of takeover speculation, began to lose some of their shine.The S&P Rail index, which is up 19.9 per cent this year, fell 3.5 per cent this week amid signs of weak traffic volume. CSX fell 2.9 per cent to $43.74.Profit updates from a number of steel groups undermined hopes that the steel cycle was on the up. US Steel slipped 3.6 per cent to $103.04 while Nucor fell 4.1 per cent to $64.94.Apple surged 9.8 per cent to $98.92 after handily beating analysts’ profit estimates as sales of Macintosh computers rose strongly.Texas Instruments gave upbeat guidance on chip demand, sending its stock up 7.2 per cent this week to $34.83. But relatively positive sentiment towards the sector began to wane on Friday.Broadcom plunged 4.2 per cent to $33.40 on Friday after the chipmaker fell short of analysts’ sales forecasts.JetBlue Airways slipped 3.6 per cent to $10 after JPMorgan described the group as “the most expensive airline money can buy” as it cut its rating on the company from “neutral” to “underweight”.JPMorgan reduced its recommendation on a total of six airlines, including US Airways and Continental, citing concerns about over-supply and weaker demand.Pressure on General Electric to pare its operations increased on Friday after Citigroup advocated selling the conglomerate’s NBC Universal media division.Jeffrey Sprague, a Citigroup analyst, said the group “needs to be more focused” and should sell NBC because it had “no meaningful synergy with the rest of the portfolio”.Shares in GE, down 1 per cent this year, rose 2.8 per cent to $36.84 on Friday.
75;NUE;Nucor Corp;2007-04-24T20:49:48Z;IBM gains boost Dow;;"Wall Street stocks held within tight margins on Tuesday after a string of solid earnings reports helped soothe concerns about weak home sales.The disappointing housing data, coupled with soft consumer confidence figures, soured the mood in morning trading by increasing concerns about the wider economy. Shares in homebuilders and retailers fell sharply.By midday, however, the main market indices had recovered, led by technology stocks. The relatively measured market reaction to the downbeat economic news encouraged some analysts.“I’m impressed that the market has held up even though the magnitude of the decline [in home sales] was pretty large,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co.“I’m not a fan of weather-related excuses but in this case people are holding out to see the pattern over a longer period.”The S&P 500 index closed flat at 1,480.44.

76;NUE;Nucor Corp;2007-03-09T22:05:06Z;Subprime fears dampen Wall Street gains;;A weaker yen helped Wall Street claw back some losses this week but fears about the possible collapse of a big subprime mortgage lender yet again checked resurgent investor confidence.Although many analysts expected a small recovery – or technical bounce – after the plunge in global equities last week, the strength of the rallies took some bears by surprise.Materials, financials and cyclical stocks that had suffered particularly steep losses during the market turmoil made a neat about-turn on Tuesday to help stage the biggest one-day rally since July. The advance was led by Ford, the carmaker, Nucor, the steelmaker, and Lehman Brothers, the bank.However bouts of alarm about subprime mortgage lenders, triggered by New Century Financial’s apparent slide towards bankruptcy, once again punctuated the week. Each sell-off in the sector reverberated around the market and soured the mood.An unexpected fall in the jobless rate helped to give the market an early lift on Friday. But stocks later sagged as investors reduced their holdings in anticipation of a testing week ahead.The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,402.85, up 1.1 per cent this week. The bounce recouped about a third of the S&P’s losses since February 23. Yet many analysts remained cautious.“It is hard to believe that the technical damage that was done last week could be overcome so quickly,” said Alexander Paris, market strategist at Barrington Research. “The market correction made a lot of sense and it doesn’t make a lot of sense that it will bounce right back.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 12,276.32 to stand 1.3 per cent stronger this week. The Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,387.55 on Friday.The unwinding of the global carry trade – the practice of borrowing in currencies with low interest rates such as the yen and reinvesting in higher yielding currencies – was regarded as one of the most important factors behind the sell-off.The weaker yen this week, which made the carry trade more attractive once more, helped to ease concerns.“It is interesting how movements in the yen have presaged movements in the stock market,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief investment strategist at PNC wealth management. “There is some relationship there that has perhaps been exaggerated by hedge funds.”Under pressure from its creditors, New Century Financial said it would no longer make new loans. Its shares fell 78 per cent to $3.21 this week.This put a brake on the mid-week advance of companies active in the mortgage sector. But shares in Lehman Brothers still rose 6.6 per cent this week to $75.83 while Morgan Stanley, which lends to New Century, was 6.1 per cent up at $76.Ford stock was in demand after Credit Suisse analysts raised their rating on the group from “underperform” to “neutral”, saying the carmaker’s first-quarter loss might be smaller than expected. The shares made additional gains on Friday on reports that it was close to selling Aston Martin, the luxury car brand. Ford stock rose 4.5 per cent to $7.93.Steelmakers returned to form after a gloomy fortnight. Upbeat remarks from Nucor on expected demand for steel products lifted the entire sector, with Nucor stock jumping 11 per cent to $64.26 and US Steel rising 6.1 per cent to $91.24.Goodyear continued to race ahead. Hardly dented by the stock market sell-off, shares in the tyremaker have climbed a further 4.5 per cent to $28.51 this week, up 25 per cent on the year. Analysts said the surge was helped by data that showed Americans were replacing their tyres more frequently.Retail sales in February were largely weak. Costco stock slid 2.5 per cent to $54.34 after its underlying sales figures and profit disappointed analysts.In deal news, the battle to buy Caremark heated up after Express Scripts and CVS raised their rival bids for the US drug benefits management group. Shares in Caremark rose 1.4 per cent to $61.90.Shares in Yahoo slipped 5.2 per cent to $29.12 on Friday after reports that it was in talks with AT&T that could lead to big changes in their partnership.Deere & Co stock made big advances on optimism about sales of farming equipment rising with demand for ethanol. Shares in Deere were up 7.4 per cent at $113.00.
77;NUE;Nucor Corp;2007-03-08T22:41:44Z;Wall St rallies on weaker yen;;The tentative recovery in US stocks gathered pace on Thursday as Wall Street cheered rising overseas markets and signs of improved corporate profits.The rally was given extra vigour by speculation that Citigroup might be attempting a further acquisition in Asia, while the weaker yen eased concerns about the global carry trade.However, the gains were checked in the afternoon as the spectre of subprime mortgage lenders returned to spook investors.Rumours that New Century Financial was close to bankruptcy weighed down the entire market and sent shares in the struggling subprime lender down 25 per cent to $3.87.Led by materials, financials and consumer discretionary stocks, the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to close at 1,401.89.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6 per cent higher at 12,260.70. The Dow was boosted by AT&T, which rose 3.1 per cent to $36.51 after analysts at AG Edwards lifted their rating on the telecoms company from “hold” to “buy”.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,387.73.Retailers gave a mixed set of trading updates for February but investors largely reacted positively, sending the S&P retailers index up 1.2 per cent. Wal-Mart shares slipped 0.1 per cent to $47.88 after its underlying sales growth last month fell short of analysts’ estimates.Shares in Costco were also on the defensive after the retailer said second quarter profits had declined because of charges related to stock options. The group’s shares fell 3.3 per cent to $54.26.However, while trading in February was also sluggish at JC Penney, its shares surged 4.1 per cent to $81.86 after the retailer said sales in March would rise sharply.Shares in Ford rose 4 per cent to $7.93 after Credit Suisse analysts raised their rating on the group from “underperform” to “neutral”, saying the carmaker’s first quarter loss might be smaller than expected.Steelmakers made big gains after Nucor said it saw “healthy demand” for its products, sending its shares up 5.3 per cent to $63.12.In deal news, an executive of Taiwan’s Bank of Overseas Chinese said Citigroup would buy the bank “very soon”. Shares in Citigroup pared early gains to stand 0.6 per cent up at $50.50.The battle for Caremark heated up after Express Scripts raised its hostile offer for its larger rival in the US drug benefits management sector by offering to pay interest on the cash component of its $26.1bn bid.The sweetened bid comes as Express tries to trump the deal already agreed between Caremark and pharmacy chain CVS. In response CVS on Thursday increased the dividend it intends to pay Caremark shareholders.CVS stock rose 3.3 per cent to $54.26. Shares in Caremark and Express rose by 1.4 and 1.7 per cent respectively to $62.16 and $76.
78;NUE;Nucor Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;North American steel;;Sometimes it takes nerves of steel to do a deal. On other occasions the logic looks a little rusty by the time a bid materialises. Take the offer by Nucor, the second largest US steelmaker, to buy Canada’s Harris Steel. Compared with last Halloween’s rumours that Nucor might bid for larger German rival ThyssenKrupp, it appears almost sensible.Unlike their counterparts at Thyssen, the board and main shareholders of Harris were keen to endorse a deal. One cannot blame them. At about $1.1bn (or C$1.25bn), the bid represents a premium of almost 50 per cent to the average share price over the three months before takeover talks were confirmed.Including net debt, that corresponds to about nine times 2007 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, before adjusting for minority interests. Nucor itself trades at about six times 2007 ebitda, still a premium to the sector.At least the two know each other well, thanks to their US joint venture in reinforced steel bars. The deal fits well with Nucor’s ambitions to grow in distribution and trading, where Harris is strong. The new group would benefit disproportionately from any boost in infrastructure spending.That seems a remote prospect in the US given stretched public finances. Meanwhile, Nucor has not yet unveiled synergy estimates. Having had a bumper year, steelmakers are bound to spend some spare cash on acquisitions. But in spite of last year’s steel takeovers, it is worth keeping in mind that the sector remains highly fragmented. For now, there are few signs of prices stabilising, partly because China continues to export its excess production. Deals at a hefty premium are unlikely to ease the pain for US steelmakers.
79;NUE;Nucor Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
80;NUE;Nucor Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Wall Street higher after CPI numbers;;US stocks rallied again this week, with a benign inflation report on Friday stoking bullish year-end sentiment and higher risk tolerance among investors.The news that headline and core consumer prices were both unchanged in November pushed the S&P 500 index to fresh six-year highs. It also generated yet another record intraday high for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at 12,486.30.Investors increasingly believe inflationary pressures and economic growth are both cooling. They see that as keeping Federal Reserve interest rate policy steady in 2007, or possibly sanctioning rate cuts should growth slow further.“This number is great news for the ‘Goldilocks’ economy and is very friendly for US equities and risk appetite in general,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich.Amid the rally, equity volatility as measured by the Vix index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 17 per cent this week. The low of 9.39 for the index on Friday approached its record nadir of 9.31, set in 1993.At the close on Friday, stocks had pared earlier strength. The S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent higher at 1,427.08, for a rise of 1.2 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.1 per cent on Friday to 2,457.20, and was up 0.8 per cent on the week. The Dow rose 0.2 per cent to a new record close of 12,445.52 on Friday and was 1.1 per cent higher for the week.Among a number of Dow companies making 52-week highs on Friday was General Electric. The conglomerate peaked at $37.51, and was up 6.1 per cent for the week at $37.36.Shares in Microsoft rose above $30 for the first time since November 2004 on Friday and were 2.7 per cent firmer at $30.19.Advanced Micro Devices rose 5.7 per cent to $22.12, with the chipmaker expecting a 10 per cent rise in microprocessor demand in 2007.Ciena jumped 13.6 per cent to $28.81 after the telecommunications equipment maker returned to profitability in the fourth quarter for the first time in five years, beating estimates.Shares in Adobe gained 10.1 per cent on the week to $42.81 after the maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software beat fourth quarter revenue estimates and raised its outlook.In deal news, United Airlines announced it was in preliminary talks with Continental Airlines about a possible merger. Continental’s share price rose 5.9 per cent to $44.45 and UAL was 3.4 per cent firmer at $44.41.Shares in Midwest jumped 26.7 per cent to $11.72 after it rejected a takeover from rival low-fare airline AirTran Holdings.Sabre Holdings surged 12.6 per cent to $31.89 after the internet information provider agreed to a $4.5bn private equity buy-out.American International Group rose 2.5 per cent to $72.13, shy of last month’s 52-week high of $72.55, after it agreed to buy the US port operations of Dubai Ports World.Citigroup announced a managerial shake up and Chuck Prince, chief executive, told investors the bank would take measures to boost its share price in 2007. Its rise of 11 per cent for the year trails the 22 per cent gain for JPMorgan and Bank of America’s rise of 15.5 per cent. “Nobody is more frustrated with the stock price than I am,” Mr Prince said. Citi’s shares rose 4.3 per cent to $54.07, setting a 52-week high of $54.08 on Friday.Record fourth quarter earnings among Wall Street brokerages sparked mixed reactions from investors. Goldman Sachs fell 2.6 per cent to $199.84, Lehman slid 1.2 per cent to $76.10, but Bear Stearns rose 3 per cent to $163.68 as its earnings of $4 a share trumped estimates of $3.36. In general, however, analysts said valuations already reflected record earnings and expressed doubt that the pace could continue in 2007.In retail, Best Buy was downgraded by Prudential Securities and the stock shed 5.2 per cent to $50.39 after its earnings faltered.Cooper Cos, the medical instrument and supplies company, reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter results and cut its outlook for 2007. Its shares tumbled 16.3 per cent to $44.84.Nuvelo plunged 79 per cent to $4.16 after two of its blood thinner trials failed.Steelmaker Nucor slid 9.6 per cent this week to $59.28 after fourth quarter forecasts were below expectations.

Shares sank to close 5 per cent at $51.30.Steelmaker Nucor, which hit a 52-week high last week, was down 7.4 per cent at $59.60 after it provided a fourth-quarter forecast below analysts’ expectations, citing low prices for its products and high inventories.Other steelmakers followed Nucor lower, with US Steel shares down 5.1 per cent at $73.26.Goldman Sachs reported a 93 per cent jump in earnings for the fourth quarter ending November 30, boosted by record takeover activity and strong trading across markets.Earnings per share were $6.59, above 2005’s $3.35, and well ahead of an expected $6 a share.In spite of this stellar performance, shares in the brokerage were 1.2 per cent lower at $200.Citigroup, meanwhile, named Robert Druskin as its new chief operating officer, elevating him from president and chief executive of the bank’s corporate and investment banking arm. Shares in Citigroup slipped 1.2 per cent to $52.25.Texas Instruments, the maker of mobile phone chips, lowered its fourth-quarter sales and earnings forecast.The shares sank in overnight trade, but an upgrade from JPMorgan, to overweight from neutral helped push the shares 1.6 per cent higher to $29.77 by midday.Sabre Holdings jumped 5 per cent to $31.96 after it agreed to be acquired by private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and Texas Pacific Group for about $4.5bn in cash, including $550m of debt, or $32.75 a share.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Stock Market formally launched its $5.3bn hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange, seeking to build upon its current holding of 28.75 per cent.The LSE has rejected Nasdaq’s overtures.Shares in the US exchange were 1.5 per cent lower at $35.57.The S&P 500 Index closed down 0.1 per cent or 1.48 points at 1,411.56 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.5 per cent, or 11.26 points, lower at 2,431.6.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.1 per cent or 12.9 points at 12.315.58.Analysts said sentiment for stocks remained positive heading into year-end, a period often marked by a rally in prices.“Economic data have generally been mixed since the last FOMC meeting, with employment conditions remaining firm in the face of flagging housing activity,” noted William O’Donnell, strategist at UBS.
82;NUE;Nucor Corp;2006-12-08T21:45:42Z;Wall Street rises amid heated trading;;Wall Street booked modest gains this week, pushing the S&P 500 to its highest level since late 2000, with many investors optimistic that a moderating economy will cool inflation and pave the way for a rebound next year.The latest US jobs data indicated that falling employment in construction and manufacturing was being absorbed by other sectors, keeping the economy poised for a soft landing in 2007. Equity investors hope modest rate cuts next year will renew the economy and push share prices higher over the long haul.“The best days for the equity market will come when a Fed ease is more of a reality than a hope,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management. “The jobs report keeps the economy on track for a safe landing, though there may still be some bumps on the way.”He noted the pace of wage gains, running at an annualised rate of 4.1 per cent, “does keep open the question whether labour cost pressures develop down the road.”Deals, drug trials, and brokerage downgrades sparked bouts of activity across the broad market this week.The S&P 500 had risen 1.2 per cent over the five days to 1,413.94 at the close on Friday, up 0.2 per cent on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed out the week with a gain of 1.1 per cent after a rise of 0.2 per cent to 12,307.49 on Friday. The Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent higher for the week at 2,437.036, 0.4 per cent higher on the day.There was no stopping this year’s best performing stock in the S&P 500.Allegheny on Friday hit a high of $98.46 for the year, and the manufacturer of stainless steel and titanium rose 11.5 per cent to $98.20 this week. Its shares have rallied 172 per cent for the year and lead the S&P’s best performers by a healthy margin.The second best stock in the index, Nucor, gained 11.8 per cent to $65.55 this week, and the steelmaker hit a new high for the year of $67.55, after boosting its regular dividend of $0.10 to $0.60 with a special payment. Speculation about further consolidation in the global industry has been a driver of bullish sentiment.After hitting a 52-week high three weeks ago, shares in Oracle slid 5.4 per cent to $17.80 as Lehman Brothers said quarterly sales could miss estimates.Ford’s share price remained under pressure and slid 10.1 per cent to $7.23, after the sale of $4.5bn of 30-year convertible bonds that could dilute existing shareholders in the future.News Corp shares rallied 5.5 per cent to $22.60, while Liberty Media rose 3.6 per cent to $91.61.

Shares in Halozyme Therapeutics surged 119.6 per cent to $6.26 after the biotech drug developer said it could gain $581m from a research venture with Roche.In contrast, Auxilium Pharmaceuticals slid 13.8 per cent to $14.35 after the speciality drugsmaker stopped a late-stage clinical trial.Pfizer slid 9.7 per cent to $25.17 following its suspension of the development of a cholesterol drug.Shares in Onyx Pharmaceuticals plunged 30 per cent to $12.25 after it said that its kidney cancer drug, Nexavar, had failed to help patients with advanced skin cancer.
83;NUE;Nucor Corp;2006-12-08T16:13:11Z;Mark Sellers: Exploration of management talent is crucial to success;;"Before investing in a company’s shares, it’s important to evaluate the management team.This is especially true for companies that deal in commodity products or services such as steel, oil or insurance.In these industries, the winners and losers are separated not by a typical competitive advantage such as unique intellectual property or high switching costs but by the talent of management.Famous managers of commodity companies include Jack Byrne from White Mountains Insurance, Ken Iverson of Nucor Steel, Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines, and Sam Walton of Wal-Mart. The common thread among these chief executives is that they purposely do things differently to everyone else, and stick to their strategy with a laser-like focus in spite of all naysayers.Once in a great while, an investor may be lucky enough to happen across a manager who may someday become a member of this hallowed group before everyone else finds out.I believe I have found such a manager: Ken Peak, chairman and chief executive of Contango Oil and Gas. [Disclaimer: Contango is a small-cap company with unpredictable cash flows, and as such, may not be an appropriate investment for some investors. Also, my firm has a position in the stock, so my analysis may be biased.]Before founding Contango in 1999, Peak spent 27 years in the industry in a variety of financial and executive positions, earned an MBA from Columbia University, and spent three years as a cryptologist in the US Navy.His company has interests in natural gas exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Fayetteville Shale, owns 10 per cent of a large Gulf Coast liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal being built by Freeport LNG, and has a small venture capital side business that funds early-stage alternative energy companies. Peak controls 19 per cent of the stock, with an additional
6 per cent owned by other officers and directors.Among other large shareholders, legendary investment firm Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb owns about 4 per cent. Though the stock price has run up in the past two months, insiders haven’t sold any shares. The company also has a healthy balance sheet, with little net debt.Contango has just six employees; there are no in-house marketing, legal, or engineering departments. Most duties are outsourced or done through partnerships. Contango focuses on one function in the value chain: The “E”– exploration – in exploration and production. Exploration is where value is created in the E&P business.Peak’s strategy is to find the best and brightest geoscientists in the US and partner with them. He gives them access to three-dimensional seismic data, capital to work with, a large personal stake in any successes, and allows them to operate as pseudo-entrepreneurs.Like Jack Byrne at White Mountains Insurance, Peak is essentially an allocator of capital, putting Contango’s cash into the highest-return projects that are brought to his attention and often selling them off after the initial gas or oil discovery is made and the reserves are proved. In the seven years since Contango was founded, approximately $30m of net capital has been invested in the business. That capital has morphed into a market valuation of $300m – a 900 per cent return on investment and evidence of substantial value creation.In October, Contango announced that it had made a discovery on its Eugene Island “Dutch” prospect (named after Peak’s father) in the Gulf of Mexico. The stock has since risen more than 50 per cent, but may have further to go.The company announced that the first well on the Dutch prospect has 75bn cubic feet reserves (25 bcf net to Contango). The value of this to Contango is between $80m and $150m ($5 to $9 per share.)However, Peak is notoriously conservative about the information he gives to investors and I think the prospect could ultimately turn out to be larger than this. Contango is drilling a second exploratory well in Dutch in December and could drill several more.The company also has interests in numerous other Gulf leases that have yet to be explored, and Contango has compiled a good track record of success in the Gulf of Mexico.In addition, Contango has leases on 31,000 net mineral acres in the Arkansas Fayetteville Shale, in the “core” area of the play. Southwest Energy has already proved out most of the core area, so we consider this to be a fairly low-risk project for Contango in spite of a slow start on the first few hundreds of wells.A conservative value for Contango’s acreage here is between $200m ($13/share) and $300m ($18/share), which could double in a couple of years once the company proves out more of the reserves.Finally, Contango owns 10 per cent of the Freeport LNG project. Freeport will come on line in 2008, and the LNG capacity there is already pre-sold to Dow Chemical and ConocoPhillips. This low-risk future cash flow stream is worth $50-$80m ($3 to $5/share) to Contango.Summing up the parts gives a fair value for Contango of somewhere between $21 and $32, compared with a current price of about $19. But this ignores the “option value” of further successful wells in the Dutch prospect, other Gulf leases held by the company and the small venture capital arm with investments in several start-up alternative energy companies.Mark Sellers is a hedge fund manager with Sellers Capital in Chicago msellers@sellerscapital.com www.ft.com/insidecurve"

85;NUE;Nucor Corp;2006-11-20T21:59:09Z;Wall St plays it safe as deals surge;;Wall Street stocks delivered a cautious performance in New York on Monday, as some $50bn in proposed merger deals across copper, steel, exchanges and real estate captured investors’ attention.Consolidation in the steel sector was a major theme, in the wake of Russia’s Evraz Group announcing on Monday that it intends buying US steelmaker Oregon Steel Mills valuing the company around $2.3bn. The $63.25 per share purchase represents a 7 per cent premium over Oregon’s close last week. Shares in Oregon jumped to a high of $64.40, and settled higher by $4.81 or 8.2 per cent at $63.77. Late last week, as talk of takeover deals in the global steel industry gathered pace, Oregon’s shares rose 3.7 per cent.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq, tendered an offer to buy the rest of the London Stock Exchange, in a deal that would value its shares at $5.1bn and build upon its current 25 per cent holding in the LSE. Shares in Nasdaq were slightly off their high of $37.83, up 3.1 per cent at $37.71. The LSE rejected the new offer, saying it “substantially undervalued” the exchange.“We believe Nasdaq’s final offer fails to recognize the outstanding growth record and prospects of our group on a stand-alone basis let alone the exchange’s unique global position,” said Clara Furse, chief executive of the LSE.Another blockbuster deal in the spotlight was Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold saying it would acquire Phelps Dodge in a $25.9bn deal including cash and stock. The new entity would be the world’s largest publicly traded copper company.Shares in Phelps, soared to a high of $123.96 and ultimately gained $25.45, or 26.8 per cent to $120.47. Free-port shares were down $1.77 cents, or 3.1 per cent at $56.63, after earlier rising to $59.70.The private equity firm Blackstone Group said it was buying Equity Office Properties Trust, the largest office-building owner and manager in the US, for $20bn. Shares in the company hit a high of $47.94, and closed up $3.42, or 7.7 per cent at $48.14. The BBG real estate investment trust index closed up 3.2 per cent after the news.The latest surge in deals, dictated in part by private equity firms hunting for opportunities “heightens the risk for short sellers,” argues Citigroup. “When markets slip initially and then reverse to the upside, as has happened several times over the last few weeks, hedge funds have to cover painful losses.”After opening in the red, stocks briefly recovered ground, led by the semi-conductor sector and Microsoft setting a new 52-week high of $29.97 after an upgrade from Credit Suisse. Shares in Microsoft closed 1.7 per cent firmer at $29.89, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index was up 1.5 per cent after booking a gain of 5.7 per cent last week.

The Russell 2000 index gained 0.3 per cent to 790.62.Despite the paring of modest gains in equity prices during the afternoon, a closely watched measure of equity volatility sank towards historic lows.The Chicago Board of Trade’s VIX index fell below 10, to 9.91, before it closed at 9.97. Historically, such a low level in VIX has reflected very high appetites for risk taking and has usually been followed by a sharp rise in the volatility measure.“Falling volatility is partly an indication of investor optimism. As long as it keeps falling it confirms (or supports) the uptrend in stocks,” noted Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader.Helping offset weakness in the Dow was Dupont, after a favourable press report over the weekend, and shares gained 1.3 per cent higher at $47.87.In the chase for high net worth banking clients, Bank of America has announced a deal to buy U.S. Trust from Charles Schwab for $3.3bn. Shares in Bank of America were barely changed at $54.90.Other steel companies that enjoyed solid gains on Friday were also higher early on Monday, before paring some of those gains.Shares in US Steel, rose 3.1 per cent to $72.75, down from a high of $76.16, after a rise of 9.3 per cent on Friday.

Its shares had rebounded from a low of $29.50 and were 0.3 per cent firmer at $30.58.After a blockbuster debut on Friday, that resulted in its shares rising 125 per cent, the New York Mercantile Exchange had reversed an earlier rise to $140, and closed down 2.1 per cent at $130.27.Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, stocks may well endure a period of consolidation, and while some analysts caution the market’s solid run has stretched valuations, others disagree.“We do not think that we have hit any peaks in the market yet,” noted analysts at Citigroup in research on Monday. “To a great degree, equity markets are not overvalued” and applying various valuation methods, “argues more forcefully for larger cap stocks since they are the ones that appear more favourably valued.”Meanwhile, the appetite of investors for risky assets may also be turning towards equities at the relative expense of other markets as the end of the year approaches.“Many traders feel that the easier risky asset trade is directly in equities, given a belief that valuations are less extended than in the credit market or emerging currencies,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. “This logic makes perfect sense,” he said noting “the Fed is more clearly on a path that is likely to soft land the economy than any time in the last 6 months,” after the tone of recent inflation and housing market reports.In equity fund flows, Emerging Portfolio Fund Research noted net outflows from dedicated US funds for the week ending November 16 were $861.6m. They noted “a second week of net outflows, due mainly to investors retreating from a popular energy sector ETF,” that was hit by redemptions. “Otherwise, US equity funds would have received inflows, with money flowing into both the Large Cap Equity Funds and Small Cap Equity Funds,” said EPFR. In contrast, “Mid Cap Equity Funds saw outflows for the week,” they added.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled up 10.97 points at 12,127.88, marking its fourth record close in five days.Some observers warn that the surge in equities since markets bottomed in July might not be sustainable. “The break-neck expansion of the past three months may give way to a needed short-term pause in the coming weeks,” noted David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.Among steel-makers Nucor was up $6.47, or 11.74 per cent, at $61.58 and US Steel up $3.61, or 5.4 per cent at $70.19.

96;NUE;Nucor Corp;2006-06-05T19:23:37Z;Wall St slumps as Bernanke warns on inflation;;US stocks moved sharply lower on Monday as Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned of the need to remain vigilant on inflation in spite of signs of slowing economic growth.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite index had their worst days since January, also weighed down by concerns over Iran that pushed oil prices higher.“I think the market is digesting the after-effects of Friday’s payroll numbers and has concerns about a weaker economy,” said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak.Blue-chips, housebuilders, and materials producers all turned lower.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent, or 18.73 points, at 11,125.33.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 0.5 per cent.

98;NUE;Nucor Corp;2006-05-05T20:59:16Z;Wall Street rally helped by easing oil prices;;Wall Street made strong advances this week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a fresh six-year high – to bring it within about 150 points of its all-time record – while the S&P 500 reached its highest level in five years. The Russell 2000 index of small companies reached an all-time high.Robust gains in materials and transport outweighed mixed economic data and disappointing earnings in software and healthcare.The week had an inauspicious start after CNBC revealed that Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, felt markets had misinterpreted his congressional testimony as being dovish on interest rates. Markets briefly panicked, pushing the leading indices down.However, continued solid earnings and an easing in the crude price to its lowest level in a month were enough to perk up Wall Street.The markets were also largely cheered by the week’s economic news. Fears of further monetary tightening eased thanks to figures showing an increase in productivity and a fall in non-farm payrolls.“Investors are cheering the top line numbers in employment and not paying attention to the fact that wages are up,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach, who was still nervous about the fact that oil, bond yields, gold and equities were all moving higher. “The market is focusing on the fact that the economy is still quite strong. We have all four markets going up, and somewhere along the line, something is going to give.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 had gained 1 per cent to 1,325.76 on the day, up 1.2 per cent for the week, its highest level since February 2001. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8 per cent at 2,342.57 on the day, up 0.9 per cent on the week. The Dow was at 11,577.74, up 1.2 per cent on the day and 1.9 per cent on the week.The materials sector was a star performer, with demand for steel and base metals fuelling upgrades. Nucor added 7.6 per cent for the week to $117.05 after an upgrade from Merrill Lynch, while US Steel gained 9.6 per cent to $75.10. Shares in both have doubled since October 2005, thanks to deal talk.Falling inventories helped copper prices to record highs. These supply constraints sent copper miner Phelps Dodge soaring 9.2 per cent to $94.15, and was upgraded by Bear Stearns. It has risen over 40 per cent since March.Transport was also strong. The Dow Jones Transportation index touched an all-time high, and at one point was up 5.9 per cent for the week. The index has gained 16.5 per cent since the start of the year.Freight shipper Expeditors International soared 24.5 per cent to $106.55, after it raised its dividend and reported earnings per share 20 per cent higher than analysts had forecast.Rail-freight carriers also gained, thanks to increased pricing power and growing imports from China. CSX rose 8.3 per cent to $74.19 on the week and Burlington Northern Santa Fe rose 4.6 per cent to $83.19.Software was one of the worst performing sectors: the S&P software index fell 2.3 per cent on the week.Microsoft continued its slide, losing 4 per cent before a slight recovery. It is down 12.7 per cent since releasing its earnings last week. Online auctioneer eBay lost 5 per cent on Friday - the second worst performance on the S&P 500 - and 5.6 per cent for the week.Adobe Systems, makers of graphic design software, slumped on Wednesday after it said second-quarter revenue and profits would come in at the lower end of its forecasts. It fell 12.8 per cent over the week to $34.18.Electronic Arts fell after its revenues and earnings forecasts fell short of market expectations. The shares fell 15.8 per cent to $47.85, their lowest since November 2004.The healthcare sector remained poorly. Cigna reported sharply lower first quarter profits and the company’s shares fell 14.1 per cent to $91.88. Aetna lost 1.3 per cent to $37.99.One of the biggest fallers was Procter & Gamble, whose forecast for the current quarter was below analysts’ forecasts. It fell 4.3 per cent for the week to $55.73.The NYSE Group rose 3.3 per cent to $68.60 on speculation that it would beat Nasdaq for control of the LSE. NYSE gained 9 per cent on Friday, in reaction to its successful secondary equity offering, which frees it to bid for other exchanges.
99;NUE;Nucor Corp;2006-05-01T20:57:18Z;US stocks hit after Bernanke testimony claim;;Wall Street trading came to a dramatic conclusion on Monday, following a report that Ben Bernanke believed his testimony last week had been misinterpreted by the markets.Stocks were knocked back from earlier gains that had been made on the back of strong consumer spending and personal income data. The CNBC television network reported that Mr Bernanke had told a reporter he had not intended to signal a “doveish” policy on interest rates, and merely wished to show that he was “flexible”.The main indices all dipped sharply on the news, to close the day in the red.At the close, the S&P 500 index was 0.4 per cent, or 5.42 points, down at 1,305.19, while the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.7 per cent, or 17.784 points, to 2,304.79. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent, or 23.85 points, lower at 11,343.29.Wal-Mart reported a 6.8 per cent preliminary gain in same-store sales for April compared with last year. The figures, a significant improvement on March, helped the world’s largest retailer – out of favour with the market for a while – to gain 2.0 per cent to $45.93.Archer Daniels Midland was another strong gainer, adding 4.6 per cent to $38.This was largely due to bullish expectations for ethanol, of which Archer Daniels is the leading producer. On Friday it appointed former Chevron executive Patricia Woertz as its new CEO.“The message being sent here is that in the eyes of the board, the future of this company is in energy,” said Len Teitelbaum of Merrill Lynch.Investors believe Archer Daniels is poised to benefit from the increasing amounts of ethanol that are being added to gasoline. ADM has gained more than 50 per cent since January.Chevron reported a 48 per cent increase in first-quarter net income to $4bn, which was boosted by its acquisition of Unocal. It was up 0.3 per cent to $61.17, in line with strong results for the rest of the sector.Steel stocks also gained on Monday after Merrill Lynch raised its rating on Nucor from “neutral” to “buy”. The S&P steel index has more than doubled since October of last year. Nucor, which is the largest of the “mini-mill” operators in the US, gained 5.6 per cent to $114.87, bringing with it US Steel, up 4.7 per cent to $71.75.Brokerage houses and investment banks were among the worst performers on Wall Street, beaten even more after the comments of reporter Maria Bartiromo on CNBC. The S&P investment banking index has fallen by 4.2 per cent in the past two days. Merrill Lynch finished the day down 3.3 per cent at $73.71 while Lehman Brothers shed 5.1 per cent to $71.75.“It’s nothing more than rotation,” said Barry Hyman, equity market strategist at Ehrenkrantz, King Nussbaum. “I think people on Wall Street can no longer walk and chew gum at the same time.”
100;NUE;Nucor Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;China trade bill fails to impress US steel producers;;US steel companies, supposed to be among the biggest beneficiaries of changed rules under the China trade bill, say they hope it never becomes law.The bill, passed by the US House this week as part of the complex package of deals agreed to win support for the Central American Free Trade Agreement, was hailed by its author as “the largest step towards strengthening our trade remedy laws in over 15 years”.Phil English, the Pennsylvania Republican who was one of half a dozen lawmakers who tied their votes for Cafta to the China bill, said the move to allow US companies to seek tariffs on subsidised Chinese imports would “send a strong signal to Beijing that Congress will not sit idly by while China's mercantilist trade policy injures US employers and destroys jobs”.But US steel companies are unimpressed. “As far as we're concerned it's a step backwards, not a step forward,” said Robert Johns, director of marketing for Nucor, the largest US steel producer.The Committee to Support US Trade Laws, which represents companies and trade unions that are heavy users of US anti-dumping laws, said that key provisions of the bill “are unworkable and ultimately damaging to US domestic industry”.Industry opposition to the China trade bill underscores one surprising aspect of this week's two-vote passage of Cafta in the House: despite the range of deals done with Republican lawmakers, the final costs for the administration may not be very high. The China bill, which would allow US companies to bring subsidies cases against “non-market economies” such as China, was disliked by the administration but grudgingly accepted as the price for Cafta votes.But from the perspective of US companies fighting off Chinese competition, it was watered down so much as to be worthless. And any attempt to strengthen the bill in the Senate will probably be vigorously opposed by the administration. The sugar industry, which had worked aggressively to defeat or alter the trade deal, also came away largely empty-handed. The St Petersburg Times in Florida, the largest sugar-producing state in the US, called it “the biggest defeat in two decades for the powerful sugar industry”.The deal allows for a modest increase in Central American sugar exports to the US, and the industry had wanted long-term assurances that sugar imports to the US would not rise. Instead, the administration offered only weak promises to prevent disruption to the US market.The biggest winner in the flurry of last-minute deal-making was probably the US textile industry. Under US pressure, the Central American governments agreed to modify the deal to increase the use of US fabrics in clothing that can now be shipped duty-free to the US.
101;NUE;Nucor Corp;2005-06-21T20:18:25Z;Oil and profit warnings leave Dow lower;;US stocks drifted mostly lower on Tuesday amid stubbornly high oil prices and a profit warning from a major steelmaker.Crude oil futures hit yet another high of $59.70 for July delivery before ending down 47 cents at $58.90.Adding to the gloom was a slide in the share price of Nucor following news that the steelmaker’s second-quarter earnings would come in towards the low end of its forecasts. The stock fell 4.3 per cent to $50.68.At the final bell, the S&P 500 index slipped 0.2 per cent to 1,213.62 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was slightly down at 10,599.67. Technology stocks performed a little better and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day 0.1 per cent higher at 2,091.07.For Todd Salamone at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, it was a “lacklustre and boring” day. “I think the market is biding its time, waiting for fresh economic data and second-quarter earnings season next month,” he said. Trading volume was relatively light, with 1.3bn shares changing hands at the New York Stock Exchange. Sixteen stocks gained for every 15 that declined on the Nasdaq while 15 advanced for every 17 decliners on the NYSE.The worst-performing stock was Central Parking, which slumped 14.7 per cent to $13.90 after the Nashville-based car park operator announced it had broken off talks about a potential sale of the company. The share price had climbed 16 per cent since March when the company hired Morgan Stanley to look at the possibility of a sell-off.There was some market-stirring news, however, from Haier, the Chinese appliance maker. The company said it had teamed up with two private equity firms to mount a $1.3bn bid for Maytag, the appliance giant behind Hoover vacuum cleaners.The Haier bid was well above the $2.1bn merger deal currently being discussed with Ripplewood Holdings, and Maytag’s share price jumped accordingly by 5.5 per cent to $16.06.Unocal also climbed 2.2 per cent $64.85 on reports that the Chinese energy company CNOOC might launch a $20bn takeover bid for the eighth-biggest US oil company. The offer would surpass Chevron’s $65bn offer. Chevron fell 0.9 per cent to $58.78.On the Nasdaq Genaissance jumped by 9.4 per cent to $1.16 after the company agreed to be acquired by Clinical Data for about $56m in stock, a premium of about 25 per cent over Genaissance’s closing price of $1.06. Clinical Data, meanwhile, was down 8.8 per cent at $18.70.Lennar, the third-biggest house builder in the US, reported that it had raised its outlook for the year because of higher house prices. Its shares rose 2.2 per cent to $63.41. “The continued strength of the housing sector shows that despite all the anecdotal evidence, all this talk about a housing bubble is premature,” Mr Salamone said.
102;NUE;Nucor Corp;2005-06-21T16:51:04Z;European bourses rally as oil prices slip;;After slipping on Monday, European shares regained upward momentum on Tuesday, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index pushing to a fresh three-year high of 1,145.05, up 0.52 per cent.Leading European steel companies suffered falls, led by Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker, which slumped 4.6 per cent to €0.63. Germany’s ThyssenKrupp dropped 1.5 per cent to €14.7 and France’s Arcelor lost 1.9 per cent to €16.43.The falls followed news that Japan’s Tokyo Steel Manufacturing had cut its July contract prices for a second consecutive month and Nucor, the US steel producer, had issued a profit warning.Analysts and traders also referred to fresh data from China, where domestic steel production rose 37.5 per cent year-on-year in May versus a world increase of 10.3 per cent, implying a reduced demand for foreign steel.CSFB’s steel analyst, Michael Shillaker, downgraded ThyssenKrupp, the German steelmaker, to “underperform”. “We no longer believe that ThyssenKrupp is the defensive play that we used to call it,” he said.He urged investors to remain cautious, saying “we are not yet past the potential point of maximum pessimism - the time when steel equity momentum should take off again in earnest”.Fiat led the auto sector, gaining 4.2 per cent to €6.28 after Sergio Marchionne, chief executive, said the group was looking to forge strategic alliances and that it would present its new industrial plan at its shareholder meeting on Thursday. Speculation following an article in Libero, the Italian newspaper, that businessman Carlo De Benedetti was seeking to buy the carmaker helped drive the gains.The sector was helped by a renewed push higher by the US dollar against the euro. Renault added 1.8 per cent to €71.35, while DaimlerChrysler gained 1 per cent to €34.27. Volkswagen was up 1.5 per cent to €37.78 and BMW climbed 1.7 per cent €37.France’s EADS climbed 3 per cent to €24.74 after a positive investor day in Paris.The company’s Airbus unit expects to deliver 450 planes in 2007 versus the 400 expected next year, management told investors.JP Morgan raised its full-year earnings per share estimate to €1.50 from €1.45 in spite of expected delays to deliveries of Airbus A380, the world’s biggest passenger aircraft.“We favour the stock over Boeing due to its cheaper valuation, a likely resolution to management issues in the near-term, and the prospects for a revived A350 program,” said Joseph Nadol at JPM.Swedish exporters climbed after the Riksbank, Sweden’s central bank, cut rates by 0.5 per cent to an historic low of 1.5 per cent. Atlas Copco surged 4.3 per cent to SKr122.5 while SKF rose 1.9 per cent to SKr81. Banks, however, suffered, with Svenska Handelsbanken dropping 1.6 per cent to SKr157.5, SEB falling 0.4 per cent to SKr135.5 and Nordea down 0.4 per cent to SKr70.Shares in Numico, the Dutch food producer, rose 3 per cent to €32.45 after spokesman Michiel Quarles said that the company would be interested in entering a joint venture with Danone or buying the French company’s baby-food business should it come up for sale.Danone had announced the day before that it was considering its options for the business after agreeing the sale of its HP sauce division to Heinz as part of a strategic repositioning. Danone shares added 0.5 per cent to €73.6.Shares in Axa, the French insurer, rose 2.22 per cent to €20.7 after the company fully disclosed the impact of a move to IFRS accounting standards, which involved restating net earnings to €3.7bn under IFRS versus €2.5bn under old French accounting methods.Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, meanwhile added 0.2 per cent to DKr316. Deutsche Bank issued a report suggesting that the impending acquisition of South Korean Jinro by Hite, another South Korean brewer in which Carlsberg has a 22 per cent stake, “will act as a catalyst for Carlsberg reviewing its investment and ultimately seeking to dispose of its stake”. The disposal would potentially enable Carlsberg to reduce its debt by 15 to 20 per cent, said Deutsche.Spain’s Cortefiel added 3.4 per cent to €19.02 after two private equity firms, PAI Partners and Permira Advisors, offered a 1.44bn ($1.8bn) counterbid for the retailer, trumping a bid from CVC Capital Partners.
103;NUE;Nucor Corp;2005-04-05T18:42:41Z;The Short View;;"Steel reaches its melting point at well above 1,000°C but starts to lose its structural strength at far lower temperatures.The white-hot steel market may not be melting, but signs of weakening abound - including in stock prices. While the S&P500 steel index rose 12 per cent in the first quarter, after soaring 58 per cent in 2004, stocks have been retreating since mid-March. US Steel shed 18 per cent last month; International Steel Group - which is about to be taken over by Lakshmi Mittal's Mittal Steel - Nucor and others have fallen from recent highs.Commodity bulls see this correction as a blip, citing tailwinds propelling the sector's rise. The problem is that several factors underpinning the rally have been eroded in recent months. First, China, centre of the commodities boom, has turned from voracious consumer to net exporter of steel. Smith Barney analysts in Asia note that China's steel consumption fell by 0.6 per cent in February, the first negative growth rate since 1997.Second, steel prices are cooling. Prices of hot rolled coil soared from $260 a tonne in 2002 to more than $750 late last year. While they remain healthy at about $600, industry watchers say they are hearing of prices softening to $550 and below. Meanwhile, the rising cost of coking coal and iron ore have punished steelmakers. The big producers are touting plans to raise prices, but recent efforts have failed to stick.There are other reasons to suspect that the sector will decline this year. First, the falling dollar was a boon to users of US steel and global pricing last year, but the longer-term consequences of the greenback's decline are having a negative impact on end users in Europe. Indeed, Arcelor, the world's largest steelmaker, recently cut production in the region amid softening demand.Furthermore, one industry veteran says, speculation that the US steelmakers are going to be acquired by foreign producers - following Mr Mittal's takeover of ISG - is folly. It is hard to imagine foreign companies buying steelmakers that have not been cleansed of their massive legacy costs through bankruptcy.""Mittal did what he did for one reason and one reason only: he bought assets dirt cheap,"" this industry source says. ""That game is over."""

Other action was limited amid a dearth of corporate news.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent to 10,800.82. The S&P 500 was marginally firmer at 1,213.55, and the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.1 per cent to 2,178.34.Traders, pundits and investors brimming with anticipation at the prospect of a so-called ""Santa Claus rally"" to end the year have been disappointed by the stock market's lacklustre performance in the first days of post-Christmas trading.Bulls took heart in the penultimate trading session of the year, however, as oil briefly fell back below $42 per barrel and US figures showed a bigger-than-expected drop in weekly jobless claims.Boeing, the aerospace group, took centre stage after it announced it had won a $1.3bn order for 10 of its new 7E7 Dreamliner commercial jets from Continental. But Boeing shares gave up early gains to fall 0.3 per cent to $51.90.Defence stocks edged higher despite a New York Times report that the Pentagon plans drastic spending cuts. Lockheed Martin rose 0.6 per cent to $55.60. Northrop Grumman edged up 0.3 per cent to $54.76.Airlines recovered some of their recent losses, with AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, up 1.6 per cent to $10.98. Continental Airlines rose 1.9 per cent to $13.70 and Delta Air Lines jumped 0.8 per cent to $7.51. US Airways fell 6.6 per cent to $1.14, however, as its Comair subsidiary continued to struggle to clear a backlog of lost luggage from cancelled flights on Christmas.Steelmakers led decliners amid mounting concerns that a flood of Chinese steel exports could lead to falling prices. US Steel fell 5.5 per cent to $50.04, while Nucor, a rival, dropped 6.4 per cent to $51.38. Allegheny Technologies, another steel maker, declined by 3.4 per cent to $21.38.Semiconductors were broadly higher. Applied Micro Circuits rose 5.9 per cent to $4.14, while Texas Instruments rose 0.7 per cent to $24.51. Intel, the world's biggest chip group, was flat at $23.35.Pfizer shares fell 0.9 per cent to $27.01 after the Wall Street Journal reported that prescriptions for the company's Celebrex painkiller fell by more than 50 per cent last week."
105;NUE;Nucor Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

Starbucks shares almost doubled, as they did in 2003, while eBay was up almost 80 per cent and Yahoo nearly 70 per cent.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank, said the stock performances reflected ?the market's reward for companies that are an integral part of everyday life?.Brands such as Apple and Starbucks define the daily routine of the new economy generation in the way Coca-Cola, General Electric and Sears, Roebuck did in the past. None of those companies made it into the top 100 performers of the S&P in 2004.Not that it was all about the new economy last year. Two old economy brands, Goodyear Tire & Rubber and Black & Decker, made the top 20. Goodyear, which is recovering after two years of losses, was helped by higher prices and buoyant demand for truck tyres in the US. Strong sales of heavy duty trucks in the US drove up Cummins, the diesel engine maker, whose shares rose more than 70 per cent.Two other big trends of the year, the surge in the oil price and the impact of China's growing appetite for raw materials, propelled some of the other stock winners. Four of the top 20 stocks in the S&P were energy companies, including TXU and Valero, while Nucor, the biggest maker of steel in the US, had a bumper year thanks to the doubling of the steel price.It was a bad year for large pharmaceuticals companies Merck was 481st in the index thanks to a 30 per cent fall in its share price but much better for the biotechnology sector.The winner, with a gain of 213.8 per cent, was Autodesk, the world's leading supplier of computer-aided design software for personal computers.The loser, with a decline of almost 50 per cent, was Ciena, the loss-making optical telecommunications equipment maker whose customers are still extremely cautious.

China consumes 30 per cent of annual world steel output of 1bn tonnes.The index comprises 13 steel companies, including Nucor, AK Steel, US Steel and Allegheny Technologies.The PHLX this week also said it would launch options on the Russell family of benchmark stock indices, which with the steel index brings the total number of indices traded on its new electronic system to 19.Mr Carrigan said it would unveil ""dozens"" of new products next year to offer hedge funds the ability to arbitrage between sector indices and broad-based indices.""If traders are seeking to buy the Russell 1,000 [index] but they have concerns about the banking sector they can eliminate the bank sector from the Russell by using bank options.

However, some analysts we unconvinced and said there remained many investors unwilling to participate in the market.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent lower at 10,289.10. The broader S&P 500 index was 0.2 per cent higher at 1,118.38, while the Nasdaq Composite index added 1 per cent to 1,869.65.Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at JP Morgan Private Bank, said increased buying of put options on equity indices such as the S&P 500 was ""an indicator of some fear …when people are buying puts they're looking to protect their broad equity exposure, [but] they're comfortable with what they own.""Weekly data on jobless benefit applications, which fell at the fastest rate since December 2001, helped vindicate some of Wall Street's optimism on the economy. However, data on oil inventories pointed to price pressures on crude futures, which rose.Mr Caffrey said the economic data supported the view that ""the backdrop is good, but some pressures remain within the system"".In a listless broader market, some stocks responded to company and sector-specific news.National Semiconductor reported strong profits but warned of a tough time ahead amid soft demand for its chips a week after Intel, the world's largest semiconductor company, disappointed investors with its mid-quarter update. National Semi shares jumped 12.3 per cent higher at $13.48 . They have fallen about 43 per cent since June.The NYSE-listed shares of Nokia rose 8.3 per cent to $13.77 after the Finnish mobile phonemaker increased its quarterly earnings guidance, citing strong demand.The news helped the shares of Texas Instruments, which makes chips for mobile handsets, rebound 10.3 per cent to $20.77, despite a trimmed estimate announced the previous day.Corning shares added 9.3 per cent to $11.09 after the fibre-optics group gave a mixed review of its business, raising sales forecasts for fibre-optic cables but warning of slowing demand for liquid-crystal displays.Elsewhere among technology shares, Apple Computer lost 1.8 per cent to $35.70 after Andrew Neff, analyst at Bear Stearns, cut his rating on the stock due to valuation concerns.Consumer-related stocks weighed on the Dow even though Procter & Gamble reiterated its quarterly profits forecasts. Shares in P&G gave up 1.1 per cent to $56.09 while Johnson & Johnson was 1.3 per cent lower at $57.51.The two declines in high-priced shares counted for much of the retreat in the price-weighted average.General Motors shares gave up 0.9 per cent to $42.82 as investors were reminded of its difficulties by a warning from American Axle, which supplies some of GM's parts, that earnings would be below prior estimates. American Axle shares were 2.8 per cent lower at $33.37.Among restaurant stocks, Yum Brands saw shares add 3.3 per cent to $40.61 after the operator of the Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell fast food restaurants reiterated its quarterly earnings estimate.In the same sector CBRL Group shares added 8 per cent to $35.08 after the operator of the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store restaurants reported lower quarterly earnings as a result of settling legal allegations of discrimination and labour law violations.Steel stocks made a solid showing on the top gainers list at the NYSE, with Nucor up 7.4 per cent to $88.36 after it raised its quarterly profits forecast by 44 per cent, saying rising steel prices helped its margins.Also higher were Oregon Steel, up 13.1 per cent to $17; International Steel Group, which added 5.7 per cent to $33.57; AK Steel Holding, up 8.6 per cent to $6.79; and US Steel, which gained 5.2 per cent to $39.96."
