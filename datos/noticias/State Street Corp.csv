Interest rates soared in late February and early March, Fed data showed.Companies that use commercial paper to fund day-to-day operations turned to other financing sources given the turmoil. The market has contracted by $28bn since March 11.The announcement of the programme and a related effort by the US central bank to shore up money market funds, one of the largest buyers of commercial paper, has helped ease pressures for the highest quality US companies. However, for groups with slightly lower credit ratings, borrowing costs remain elevated, leading to calls for the Fed to act speedily to make the facility operational.The appointment of managers comes just over a week after the Fed tapped BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, to oversee another emergency funding programme which will purchase billions of dollars in bonds, mortgage-backed securities and fixed-income exchange traded funds.Pimco and State Street are reprising their roles from the 2008 financial crisis, when both were hired by the Fed to run a similar commercial paper funding facility.The Fed said it had selected Pimco “after considering its knowledge and experience in the commercial paper market and in credit risk management”. 
1;STT;State Street Corp;2020-03-22T11:00:29Z;Costs to borrow ETFs jumps as volatility spikes;Borrowing activity surges as investors try to protect their assets from coronavirus swings;The spike in volatility across financial markets due to the coronavirus pandemic has sparked a surge in the use of exchange traded funds by market makers and other institutional investors that want to protect their positions from wild price swings.ETFs regularly account for a quarter of daily trading activity on the US stock market and this has risen to about 40 per cent on some of the most volatile days on Wall Street in March.The cost to borrow many of the largest and most heavily traded ETFs has jumped by an average of 40 per cent, reflecting the steep increase in demand.“Investors and portfolio managers who turned to derivatives, such as options and swaps, to try and hedge their long exposure have been shocked to see premiums [costs] explode as volatility has surged higher. Many of these investors and portfolio managers turned to the ETF market to create hedges and alpha plays [profitable trades] in this volatile market,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a New York-based data provider.Cost of ETF borrowing activity in the US market has risen from $3.1m per day on March 1 to about $4.3m, according to S3.State Street Global Advisors runs the world’s largest ETF, which is known as SPY. It tracks the S&P 500 index, the main US equity benchmark, and has assets of $226bn.The borrowing rate for SPY has jumped from as low as 10 basis points to 70bp, according to State Street.Using derivatives to construct large hedging positions has become more expensive and more cumbersome as investment banks have reduced their risk exposures, prompting more market participants to use ETFs.“The order book on S&P e-mini futures [the most widely used derivative contract] has become thinner and we have seen extremely elevated levels of trading for SPY throughout March,” said Marcus Miholich, head of the ETF capital markets group in Europe at State Street Global Advisors.The cost to borrow has also surged higher for other large ETFs including Invesco’s QQQ, which tracks the Nasdaq index, BlackRock’s EEM, the largest emerging markets ETF and BlackRock’s IWM, which tracks the Russell 2000 index, the benchmark for US small capitalisation stocks.Some exchange traded products, which allow investors to bet on price declines, have even seen their yearly borrowing costs surpass 10 per cent, an unusual development. Direxion’s DRIP and ERY, which are three times leveraged bets on declines for oil and energy companies, now cost 18.4 per cent and 13.6 per cent to borrow respectively.The Grayscale bitcoin ETF, known as GBTC, has seen its borrowing cost jump to 9.9 per cent, reflecting the turmoil in cryptocurrency markets.The surge in ETF borrowing costs has surprised observers. Borrowing costs are generally low because ETF providers are allowed to create new ETF units and to lend these to brokers to support liquidity in what are known as “create to lend” transactions. In addition, many institutional investors are sitting on large ETF positions, which they can lend out in return for a fee.S3 said it expected the costs for borrowing ETFs to climb further.“The cost of portfolio hedging will continue to increase and there will be a scarcity of supply available for borrowing in certain ETFs,” said Mr Dusaniwsky
2;STT;State Street Corp;2020-03-18T05:00:38Z;Extreme market stress puts $6.4tn ETF sector under acute pressure ;Vanguard and BlackRock fixed income funds suffer price dislocation;Legendary corporate raider Carl Icahn warned that trouble was brewing in the fast-growing exchange traded fund industry when he locked horns with BlackRock chief Larry Fink in 2015.The world’s largest asset manager had created an illusion of liquidity in high-yield bond ETFs that would lead to a destructive “blow up” for investors, the billionaire claimed. “We are riding for a fall. There is definitely a great risk [in high-yield ETFs],” Mr Icahn said.For now, such gloomy predictions appear to have been confounded by the performance of the vast bulk of ETFs during the turmoil that has convulsed markets because of the coronavirus pandemic and looming global recession.But questions are being raised about high-yield bond ETFs, which have seen record daily trading volumes during recent weeks. BlackRock’s flagship high-yield ETF, known widely by its ticker HYG, and its most direct competitor, State Street’s JNK, have both suffered large asset declines this month.High-yield ETFs have seen acute selling pressure. Many are exposed to US energy companies that could be forced to default on debt payments because of the sharp fall in oil prices following Saudi Arabia’s decision to declare a price war with other crude producers.Global assets held by exchange traded funds have doubled in size in less than four years, reaching a $6.4tn record at the end of 2019. This explosive growth has attracted scrutiny by regulators who are concerned about the influence of ETFs as they spread deeper and wider into financial markets worldwide. Regulators worry that ETFs could intensify market turmoil if their investors herd together in a charge for the exit. Both HYG and JNK have traded at significant discounts to their underlying indices this month. Such discounts add to concerns over whether investors are receiving a fair deal when they come to sell these ETFs. Marcus Miholich, head of the ETF capital markets group in Europe at State Street Global Advisors, says it is not unusual for high-yield ETFs to trade at a discount in periods of elevated market stress. “It is unfair to say there is a dislocation between the ETFs and the high-yield market. High-yield ETFs are more liquid and easier to trade than the basket of underlying bonds. Some of these bonds do not trade very much so their prices are stale because the market is moving so quickly. The ETF functions as the price discovery vehicle because this is where investors choose to transact,” says Mr Miholich.Samara Cohen, co-head of iShares markets and investments at BlackRock, says there was no evidence that increased trading activity in HYG was causing forced selling of the underlying high-yield bonds. “The ETF is the vehicle that investors choose to manage their risks and to allocate capital efficiently. Investors make thousands of times more trades in the ETF than through the underlying bonds,” says Ms Cohen.Jane Street Group, one of the largest ETF market makers, says elevated trading volumes indicated that investors were looking to high-yield ETFs to shift their credit risk because of increased liquidity challenges in the cash bond market. ETFs are not Harry Potter products. They can’t create magical liquidity“High-yield ETFs have continued to function at high volumes in stressed markets, supporting price discovery and risk transfer, even if it may not be at a price investors are seeking,” says Jane Street. Pricing dislocations have also appeared in BlackRock and Vanguard’s flagship fixed income ETFs as a result of the volatile conditions across the US fixed bond market.Vanguard’s $55bn total bond market ETF closed at a 6.2 per cent discount on March 12. The $71bn iShares core US aggregate bond ETF, known as AGG, closed at a 4.43 per cent discount on the same day. BlackRock and Vanguard both insist that these ETFs with their increased trading volumes are providing the most accurate and timely barometer of bond market conditions. ETFs regularly account for a quarter of daily trading activity on the US stock market and this has risen to about 40 per cent on some of the most volatile days on Wall Street over recent weeks.“ETF usage increases when volatility goes up. ETF trading also increases when market liquidity goes down,” says Ms Cohen. Ensuring that ETF trading remains orderly is therefore of critical importance to the overall stability of the US stock market.“There has been extraordinary market volatility and we haven’t seen any major problems with ETFs. They have continued to function as normal. If there continues to be no major issues, this should help allay some of the concerns among policymakers about any potential risk of ETFs,” says Sean Tuffy, a regulatory expert at Citi.Circuit breakers — temporary halts to trading — have been imposed a number of times this month to calm violent falls in the US stock market. Temporary halts to trading have caused problems for ETFs in the past. More than a fifth of all US-listed ETFs were forced to stop trading on a tumultuous day in August 2016 after the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 1,100 points shortly after opening and then rebounded by almost 600 points minutes later. But no similar problems have emerged in the latest bout of market turbulence, due in part to a tightening of trading rules.“Rule changes after 2016 have improved market stability. ETFs have behaved in an orderly fashion during this latest period of extreme market stress,” says Ms Cohen.The S&P 500 has fallen more than 25 per cent from its all-time high in February, marking an end to its 11-year bull market run. During this period, the largest ETF tracking the S&P 500 index, which is known as SPY, has registered trades worth more than $50bn for 14 consecutive days. SPY dealing volumes reached $113bn on February 28, a record for any trading instrument.Mr Miholich says that SPY has even been able to function as a price discovery vehicle during temporary halts to US trading. This is because the SPY ETFs, which are listed in Europe, were unaffected by the US circuit breakers and continued to trade.The vast majority of ETF trading occurs in the first and last hour of each trading day.This means the liquidity provided by ETFs “may not be stable” over time, cautions Sébastien Lemaire, head of ETF research at SocGen.If there is insufficient intraday liquidity provided by the ETF market, an investor might be forced to redeem their ETF shares in order to complete a trade using the underlying constituents, which could be a less efficient and more expensive process.“ETF liquidity is not infinite, and its cost and quantity are impacted by severe market conditions, just the same as any other security,” says Mr Lemaire.Hector McNeil, co-founder of HANetf, a fund incubator, also cautions that ETFs could not create liquidity “by magic” if the underlying market was struggling. “ETFs are not Harry Potter products. They can’t create magical liquidity,” he says. “If the underlying asset is suffering this will be reflected in the volatility of the ETF.”
3;STT;State Street Corp;2020-03-15T21:56:11Z;World’s three biggest fund houses shed $2.8tn of assets;Global sell-off signals end of boom years for asset managers;The world’s three biggest fund managers have seen their assets shrink by an estimated $2.8tn this year as a global sell-off in financial markets heralds a decisive end to the industry’s golden era of growth.BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors have all seen their assets under management fall sharply as a result of the recent market chaos, during which US stocks fell into bear market territory after more than a decade of gains and the FTSE 100 suffered its worst one-day drop since 1987.BlackRock’s assets hit a record of more than $7.4tn earlier this year, spurred by its iShares exchange traded fund arm. But that figure has now fallen bynearly $1.4tn to $6tn, according to FT calculations, as global equities crashed, including the S&P 500’s 20 per cent drop since its February peak.Shares in BlackRock have dropped 28 per cent since their February high, cutting the New York based group’s market value to $64bn. The company declined to comment.Vanguard’s assets reached $6.2tn in January, fell to $5.9tn by the end of February, and are now tracking at about $5.4tn based on recent market falls. Vanguard said assets had dipped in March but it was “still seeing positive cash flow”, including net investor inflows of more than $77bn in the first two months of the year.Tim Buckley, Vanguard chief executive, advised investors this month to “stay the course”. He added: “In my 30 years in the business, I’ve seen many market storms. Repricings are inevitable, sometimes violent, but never predictable. Panic and rash action aren’t your ally.”For active managers in liquid markets, the outlook is very difficult, and declining fees will no longer be countered by market buoyancyState Street Global Advisors, a unit of the US custodian bank of the same name, had assets of more than $3.1tn earlier this year. Assuming a fall in line with US equity markets, its assets will have fallen by about $600bn to $2.5tn in the past four weeks. The US group declined to comment.Jim McCaughan, former chief executive of Principal Global Investors, a US asset manager, said the sector’s resplendant era was probably coming to an end, even before the recent market rout. “But February 2020 will be the point when many people come to realise that it was happening,” he said.Although all three houses are renowned for their vast passive and exchange traded fund operations, they also have large high-fee-paying active portfolios.“For active managers in liquid markets, the outlook is very difficult, and declining fees will no longer be countered by market buoyancy,” Mr McCaughan said.Greggory Warren, senior stock analyst at Morningstar, the data provider, said fund managers had been hit hard by a “one-two punch” of market losses and outflows, which would cut management fees.He said BlackRock would likely perform better than most listed peers because of its large institutional client base and “fairly diverse” product mix. Just over half of BlackRock’s assets are in equity strategies, 31 per cent in fixed income, 8 per cent in multi-asset classes, 7 per cent in money market funds, and 2 per cent in alternatives.“February 2020 may well be the golden peak for those Goliaths who thrived from the relentless rise of passive investments,” said Amin Rajan, chief executive of consultancy Create Research. But he added central bank stimulus could see a return to the good times. “Having artificially inflated asset prices for so long, central banks’ credibility will be shot to pieces if markets go into prolonged free fall.”* This story has been corrected to state that world’s three biggest fund managers have seen their assets shrink by an estimated $2.8tn this year, not $2.5tn as stated earlier due to an editing error.
4;STT;State Street Corp;2020-02-28T01:15:14Z;Junk bond funds suffer worst outflows in more than a year;Investors dump high-yield ETFs on concern over financial impact of the coronavirus;Junk bond funds suffered their biggest outflows in more than a year during the market tumult of the past week, with more than half the withdrawals coming from a single exchange-traded fund.Investors pulled $6.8bn from mutual funds and ETFs that invest in global high-yield bonds in the week through to Wednesday, according to EPFR Global data, including a total of $4bn from BlackRock’s flagship high-yield ETF, known widely by its ticker HYG.Investors pulled $1.5bn from HYG on Tuesday alone, a record single-day redemption, helping drag the ETF’s assets down to $14bn by the end of Wednesday. In January, the fund’s assets sat at $20bn, near an all-time high.The second-largest junk bond fund, State Street’s JNK, suffered $1.2bn in redemptions for the week ended Wednesday, including $890m pulled from the fund on Tuesday, its biggest one-day redemption since the fund launched in 2007.The move away from high-yield bond funds mirrored a wave of selling activity across riskier assets as investors shifted into safer corners of the market, anticipating the economic impact of the coronavirus. The selling hit fever pitch on Thursday when US equities suffered their worst single-day loss since 2011.Tony Rodriguez, head of fixed income strategy at Nuveen, said sharp selling in junk bonds was reminiscent of the financial crisis. “This creates the possibility of global recessionary conditions. For most people it’s still not the base case but the downside is still significant from here.”The pressure on risk assets had widened the difference in the yield on high-yield bonds compared to the equivalent ultra-safe US Treasury bonds. The spread was 462 basis points on Thursday evening, according to the Ice Bank of America High-Yield index, 100bp higher than a week ago.The sell-off weighed on the performance of high-yield funds. Fidelity’s $1.7bn High Income Advantage fund, which invests across bonds and equities, stands out as one of the worst performers in Morningstar’s high-yield bond peer group, returning negative 3.5 per cent over the past week.Nuveen’s High Income bond fund, which is more than 80 per cent invested in corporate debt, also struggled this week, returning minus 2.1 per cent.“It’s not been the most fun week to be a high yield manager,” said Tom Stolberg, portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles, the Boston-based fund group. “If you didn’t think things were at fair value a week ago, they have certainly moved in the right direction.”
5;STT;State Street Corp;2020-02-24T05:00:27Z;BlackRock’s black box: the technology hub of modern finance;Used by rival fund managers, the reach of the Aladdin platform raises possible conflicts of interest;As toxic mortgage-backed securities tore through the financial system more than a decade ago, the US government turned to Larry Fink, one of their earliest pioneers, for help. Mr Fink made a fortune packaging mortgages together and selling off slices of the combined pools in the 1980s before founding BlackRock, which today stands as the world’s largest asset manager.As the crisis deepened, Mr Fink spoke to Hank Paulson, US Treasury secretary, more often than some chief executives of the big Wall Street banks, in brief, urgent calls. He offered the Treasury and Federal Reserve a powerful tool to gauge risk in the assets at the centre of the havoc. The arrangement would net BlackRock tens of millions of dollars in government contracts, awarded largely without a tender process, put it at the forefront of the fintech revolution and cement Mr Fink’s standing at the intersection of politics and finance.At the heart of this exchange was Aladdin, BlackRock’s vast technology platform. The system links investors to the markets, ensures portfolios hold the right assets and measures risk in the world’s stocks, bonds and derivatives, currencies and private equity.Aladdin’s influence has surged since the financial crisis. Today, it acts as the central nervous system for many of the largest players in the investment management industry — and, as the Financial Times has discovered, for several huge non-financial companies.Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors, the largest fund managers after BlackRock, are users, as are half the top 10 insurers by assets, as well as Japan’s $1.5tn government pension fund, the world’s largest. Apple, Microsoft and Google’s parent firm, Alphabet — the three biggest US public companies — all rely on the system to steward hundreds of billions of dollars in their corporate treasury investment portfolios.Yet the true reach of Aladdin is unknown outside of BlackRock. The New York-based manager last revealed exactly how much of the world’s assets sit on the system in February 2017, when they reached $20tn. BlackRock told the FT that total assets do not reflect how clients use the system. One former employee says the figure is no longer disclosed because of the negative attention the enormous sums attracted. In the past three years, Aladdin has added scores of new clients, the stock market has gained a third in value and the bond market is 13 per cent larger.Today, $21.6tn sits on the platform from just a third of its 240 clients, according to public documents verified with the companies and first-hand accounts. That figure alone is equivalent to 10 per cent of global stocks and bonds.“Aladdin has become a mainstay of the marketplace,” says Peter Kraus, chief executive of Aperture Investors and former head of AllianceBernstein, the $600bn investment group. “It has a huge historic client base.”Aladdin has fuelled BlackRock’s all-conquering rise by tightening its links with customers and diversifying its revenues. But the platform’s success has opened up new challenges. Competitors are fast developing rival platforms that are taking some of its business. The system’s scale — unparalleled for technology offered by a fund manager — has also created possible conflicts of interest. Most of all, its importance as a fintech hub has raised the prospect of a regulatory backlash.The world’s most powerful risk management system threatens to become a liability for its owner.After the financial crisis, a US regulatory push sought to label certain large banks and insurers as systemically important. Asset managers were expected to be included in this list, but the larger companies lobbied hard to avoid the outcome. They were ultimately successful, based on one single argument — investors who entrust fund managers with their assets technically hold them with one of a small group of specialist banks, so the assets are never on fund managers’ balance sheets.Platforms like Aladdin were not factored into the ruling, but as markets and investing become more reliant on technology the functions of these systems could play a role in future decisions.“Regulators will have to confront this issue as technology becomes more important and intertwined with the investment process,” says Monica Summerville, director of fintech research for Tabb Group, a consultancy. “They are going to have to take a stand.”Aladdin’s sprawling influence has prompted fears that it, or BlackRock, could act as a chokepoint if either faced a shock — a cyber attack, a rogue line of code or a sudden crisis for the company — destabilising the financial system.In January, the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, said the failure of a large portfolio and risk system, like Aladdin, “could cause serious consumer harm” or even “damage market integrity”.“The industry is becoming reliant on a small number of players such as Aladdin,” says Jon Little, former head of BNY Mellon’s international asset management business. “Yet [regulators] seem reluctant to regulate or intervene to supervise these key service providers directly.”Though Aladdin does not tell asset managers what to buy or sell, some argue that if a large portion of global assets respond to the warnings that Aladdin gives off, trillions of dollars will react to events — such as the outbreak of a pandemic or war in the Middle East — in the same way, causing dangerous herding behaviour. The more investment managers and asset owners rely on Aladdin to gauge risk, the less responsible they become for their portfolio decisions.This concern was highlighted by the Los Angeles County Employees’ Retirement Association, the $58bn US pension fund, in January. It cited the potential for “groupthink” as one reason it declined Aladdin’s risk capabilities.“Anything close to an oligopoly in risk management would be especially dangerous if there were any weakness in the system,” says Jim McCaughan, former chief executive of Principal Global Investors, the $476bn fund manager.Aladdin’s critical role within high-profile companies also makes it a prime target for cyber crime. Ryan Dodd, a former fund manager and founder of risk consultant Cyberhedge, says BlackRock and Aladdin are enticing targets for hackers, including those backed by nation states. “They provide a master key to unlock credentials of thousands of other high-value targets, such as the users of Aladdin,” he says.These risks are compounded by Aladdin’s complexity. Moving on and off the system can take years, because it often entails replacing a range of different systems and users have to contort the way they operate to fit Aladdin’s model. One recent client whose business transitioned to Aladdin over three years likened the process to “changing a tyre while speeding round a racetrack”.Rob Goldstein, chief operating officer for BlackRock, says Aladdin’s risk tools are designed to support, rather than replace, portfolio managers, adding that rival platforms offer an alternative, negating the idea the financial system was overly reliant on Aladdin.“Even though it’s a critical piece of infrastructure, there are many critical pieces of infrastructures that clients have in their inner workings,” Mr Goldstein says. “We live in an incredibly competitive environment.”The scale of BlackRock’s dominance in both the investment industry and in providing its plumbing has led to potential conflicts of interest. As the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock is among the top shareholders of most listed companies globally, including many Aladdin clients.BlackRock is the largest shareholder of Santander, for example, whose asset management unit joined the platform last year, and a major shareholder of HSBC and Credit Suisse, other recent clients. This has drawn concern from rivals that BlackRock’s influence over the companies as a major investor has helped convince them to choose Aladdin, an idea BlackRock rejects.In some cases, the potential conflicts are multi-layered. BlackRock is the third-largest shareholder in Apple, giving it clout over the tech company’s shareholder votes, while Sue Wagner, a co-founder of the fund manager, is a board member of both companies.Ms Wagner is also on the board of Swiss Re, another Aladdin client whose former vice-chairman, Mathis Cabiallavetta, is a BlackRock board member. Mark Wilson, former chief executive of Aviva, which uses Aladdin, accepted a seat on BlackRock’s board in 2018 while in his former role. This decision angered the UK insurer’s shareholders who worried it created a conflict of interest, as Aviva’s investment arm competes with BlackRock. He left Aviva six months later and remains on BlackRock’s board.Aladdin — which stands for asset, liability, debt and derivative investment network — began as a simple ledger for bond portfolios shortly after BlackRock was founded in 1988. As it grew, BlackRock extended its use for certain clients. The first was General Electric, which in 1994 was selling Kidder Peabody, the beleaguered brokerage, but was unsure how to price the assets on its balance sheet. A series of similar one-off arrangements eventually led BlackRock to offer Aladdin as a product in 2000.“When we did Kidder Peabody, it was an X-ray machine,” says Mr Goldstein. “When we had the opportunity to work on the most recent [financial] crisis, it was an MRI machine.”The system has expanded rapidly. BlackRock’s 2015 deal to acquire FutureAdvisor spawned an offshoot of the platform for financial advisers today used by Morgan Stanley and UBS. BlackRock also offers a version of Aladdin for custody banks, including BNY Mellon, that safeguard assets managed by fund groups like BlackRock. Last year, BlackRock acquired eFront, a private equity tech platform, for $1.3bn, extending Aladdin’s reach into less liquid assets.Powerful trends have buffeted Aladdin’s rise. Investing has become more electronic and reliant on big data. As the tools that process the information have become more complex, investors, fund managers and insurers have turned to larger platforms such as Aladdin to replace multiple specialised systems.Aladdin’s growth is reflected on BlackRock’s balance sheet. Technology revenue, dominated by Aladdin, hit $974m last year, just 7 per cent of the company’s total, but among the firm’s fastest growing areas. Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict this revenue will more than double in the next six years.Mr Fink has said he wants a third of BlackRock revenue to come from technology by 2022. This includes money from Aladdin but also fees from funds that clients select on the platform. The company offers discounts to institutions that invest in BlackRock funds and sign up to Aladdin.Aladdin’s income, locked up in steady, multiyear contracts, diversifies BlackRock’s income away from the fees it charges on assets, which dip during a market downturn.“It’s the tech subscription model that investors love,” says Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones. “It’s not sensitive to the market.”Aladdin’s dominance has attracted heightened competition. State Street, which runs $3tn of assets, bought Charles River, a popular platform for fund managers, for $2.6bn in 2018. It has since signed up four new clients, including Lazard Asset Management.Dimension, a platform from Copenhagen-based SimCorp, has also won a series of US clients, including the World Bank, and has a stable of European users, such as the investment units of Axa and UBS.In January, MSCI, an analytics provider, paid $190m for a minority stake in Burgiss Group, which specialises in private asset data. The deal is a direct response to Aladdin’s push beyond stocks and bonds.So far, BlackRock has conceded little ground to competitors, despite some offering cheaper and more flexible terms. Just one big client has publicly defected so far, the Italian fund house Pioneer when it was bought by Amundi, the €1.6tn French manager.“We chose to have complete control of our software,” says Yves Perrier, chief executive of Amundi, Europe’s biggest investment group. “I don’t want to be dependent on a competitor.”In 1986, Larry Fink led the mortgage department of First Boston, a large investment bank, and was on track to become its chief executive. Then, he lost $100m and was soon pushed out. Mr Fink had joined a decade earlier as a graduate trainee and rose rapidly. He generated hundreds of millions of dollars in part by selling mortgage-backed securities, but then made a fateful error. He misjudged a fall in interest rates, which allow mortgages to be repaid quicker, reducing their value to investors.The tale has become an origin story for Mr Fink’s second act at BlackRock and the genesis of its risk platform, Aladdin. But he leaves out one crucial detail.The scale of the loss was driven by his desire to beat his counterpart at Salomon Brothers, Lewis Ranieri. Mr Ranieri was later immortalised as a “big swinging dick” by Michael Lewis in Liar’s Poker, and was aggressively selling mortgage-backed securities. As the rivalry deepened, Mr Fink issued more than First Boston could sell, ending up with a large inventory on its balance sheet that would lose value when rates fell.For Mr Fink the episode proved the need for a portfolio management tool like Aladdin to assess risk. It also reveals the competitive drive behind Mr Fink and the group of First Boston colleagues who left to found BlackRock, many of whom remain today.“These are dynamite business people,” says one former First Boston colleague. “They can smell blood up the river.”
6;STT;State Street Corp;2020-02-18T04:00:28Z;US’s passive investing juggernauts break new ground in Britain;Approach pioneered by BlackRock and peers threatens UK’s personality-led investment culture;"BlackRock is already the world’s largest asset manager, but it is in touching distance of another crown: becoming Britain’s biggest.One of the strongest bastions of stockpicking, the UK is now following the US by embracing the low-cost, index-tracking approach pioneered by BlackRock and its American rivals Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors.The likely milestone for BlackRock also reveals the urgent threat facing the UK’s personality-led investment culture, which has long prized the idea of the stockpicker and defined the DNA of the City’s best-known domestic asset managers.Historically, the culture has helped the City resist the tide of passive investing, which simply promises to match the performance of a main index, such as the S&P 500 or FTSE 100, for a fraction of the fees demanded by active managers. However, the resistance is beginning to crumble.Index funds broke new ground in the UK in last year, when they attracted twice the volume of money as in 2018, according to the Investment Association, a trade body.“The threat from passive investments is very pronounced,” said Peter Sleep of Seven Investment, a multi-manager who invests in both active and index strategies. “The active fund industry is very fragmented and inefficiently structured, but it now has to adjust to lower costs and profit margin compression.”SCM Direct’s Alan Miller, the former active fund manager who now only invests in passive funds, is blunter: UK investors were “realising with anger and frustration that they have been fleeced by active managers for many years”.Just a fifth of actively managed UK equity funds outperformed their benchmark in the three years to the end of 2018, with the performance over five and 10 years showing only a modest improvement, according to research by S&P Dow Jones. Yet investors pay on average around eight times the fees for active funds than for passive ones, the Financial Conduct Authority said in its 2017 report into the fund management industry.None of Britain’s homegrown asset managers has escaped investors’ fury.Last year billions of pounds were pulled from Schroders, the largest UK manager by market value, and its rivals Standard Life Aberdeen and M&G. Schroders suffered its highest fund outflows in more than a decade, according to fund data company Morningstar, while SLA ranked as the worst-selling manager in Europe. Janus Henderson and Invesco’s UK business were also hit by significant outflows.Fuelled by stockpickers’ humdrum performance, the implosion of the once-lauded fund manager Neil Woodford and a growing awareness of the fees active managers command, many believe the passive juggernauts of BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street will steal more market share this year.The Woodford scandal was the “jolt that some people needed” to abandon active funds, said Kenneth Lamont, a senior analyst at Morningstar. “It can only play into the hands of passive.”If you are a large asset manager, you need to be in private assets. It’s a way to preserve margins even if your volume of assets under management goes downVanguard has enjoyed breakneck growth thanks to its ferocious fee cuts, propelling it into the ranks of Britain’s top 10 asset managers, with £90bn in UK assets. British investors poured around $40bn into BlackRock’s funds last year, swelling its UK asset pool to $950bn (£719bn). Only Legal & General Investment Management, with £847bn, is bigger than BlackRock in Britain.Britain’s home-grown asset managers are now scrambling to respond. Seeking safety in size is one strategy. The multibillion pound deals that created SLA and Janus Henderson were examples of midsize managers combining to shield their profit margins.And on Monday Jupiter Asset Management agreed to buy rival Merian Global Investors for £419m in a deal that, with a total of £65bn assets, will create Britain’s second-largest stockpicker focused on retail investors.Expanding beyond publicly traded equities and bonds — securities whose performance can be more readily replicated by an index — and into private assets such as real estate and infrastructure, where fees are less vulnerable, is another path some are taking.“If you are a large asset manager, you need to be in private assets,” said Massimo Tosato, former vice-chairman of Schroders. “It’s a way to preserve margins even if your volume of assets under management goes down.”For example, SLA launched a £60bn private assets business last year; Schroders snapped up specialist boutique BlueOrchard Finance, pushing its pool of private assets and alternative investments over £40bn.“The investment managers who will win in [the new] environment are those that have the platform to diversify their business in order to grow,” said Keith Skeoch, the chief executive of SLA. “Private markets are a good example of this.”It is a view echoed by Will Riley of Guinness Asset Management, which invests in asset managers. Smaller UK groups with a niche focus, such as equity boutique Liontrust, emerging markets specialist Ashmore and sustainability-focused Impax Asset Management, have emerged better than others.Perhaps most strikingly there are tentative signs that active managers are willing to address the question of fees. Fidelity International, which is famous in Britain for launching the career of star manager Anthony Bolton, challenged rivals when it cut headline fees on some of its active equity funds and introduced a variable portion that is only charged if the fund beats its benchmark index.Hugues Gillibert, chief executive of Fitz Partners, a fund-fee research company, argues that widespread adoption of this pricing strategy “would help to rebuild trust with investors”.The tough climate for UK active managers has been exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty. Last year a net £7bn was taken out of UK equity funds, the bread and butter of most City managers’ businesses, according to Morningstar.With the general election clearing the political uncertainty, some are prepared to offer a more full-throated defence of active management. Richard Pease, the veteran fund manager who founded Crux Asset Management, said investors were “missing the big picture” by piling into passive funds.“Fee cuts, combined with Woodford and one or two periods where active managers did less well, have seduced investors into thinking that cheap is best,” he said. “But it would be wrong to throw the baby out with the bathwater in light of the value that an active approach can deliver.”The US market, one already profoundly transformed by passive investing, is not without some encouraging examples for active managers. Morgan Stanley Investment Management, which has focused on touting its high-conviction, active approach, attracted a net $9.9bn into its active funds last year, while multi-boutique asset manager PGIM, which is owned by life insurance company Prudential Financial, sucked in $17.5bn, according to Morningstar.But if such examples provide some comfort, BlackRock and Vanguard are keeping up the pressure on UK active managers. After slashing fees on almost half of its European fund range last year, Vanguard plans to launch Britain’s cheapest private pension this year.The firm is also entering fund distribution and in January gained authorisation to offer investment advice to UK investors, posing a threat to wealth managers such as St James’s Place and Hargreaves Lansdown. “Fee compression is all about the passive guys gaining,” said Mr Lamont of Morningstar. “This is more than a warning signal [for active managers]. The writing is on the wall.”."
7;STT;State Street Corp;2020-02-08T11:00:43Z;Big investors ignore proxy advisers on controversial votes;BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street routinely vote to block environmental and social action at companies, research says;BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street routinely ignore their proxy advisers’ recommendations and vote to block environmental and social action at companies, according to research that rebuts claims that big asset managers blindly follow voting advice.The analysis by responsible investment charity ShareAction, on behalf of the Charities Responsible Investment Network, found that the world’s largest fund managers voted differently to their proxy advisers’ recommendations about three-quarters of the time on environmental, social and political lobbying proposals.The findings challenge accusations that asset managers “robo-vote” or automatically follow the recommendations of proxy advisers, which provide investors with advice on how to vote on issues from executive pay to director re-elections at annual meetings.The Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed new rules to reform the proxy advice industry after an influential lobbying campaign warned that proxy advisers wield too much power. A comment period on the proposals closed earlier this month, with the SEC expected to finalise the rules by the end of the second quarter.“Corporate lobby groups have managed to paint proxy advisers with a bad brush,” said Isobel Mitchell, co-author of the ShareAction report, which looked at the voting recommendations of Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, the two biggest proxy advisers.“Our research shows asset owners should be concerned about their managers’ own practices and behaviour influencing their voting decisions, rather than an over-reliance on the recommendations of proxy advisers, as is often claimed by business lobbyists.”Ms Mitchell questioned why many big investors, including traditional active managers such as JPMorgan Asset Management, were less likely to support environmental, social and political lobbying proposals than their proxy advisers.The research found that 65 per cent of the big investors examined backed company management on environmental, social and political lobbying proposals more often than their proxy adviser, a finding that will raise questions about how seriously asset managers are taking sustainability.Sarasin & Partners, CCLA, HSBC Global Asset Management and Aviva Investors were more likely than their proxy adviser to back environmental and social resolutions at annual meetings.Rakhi Kumar, head of ESG investments and asset stewardship at State Street Global Advisors, said the $3.1tn asset manager took a “case-by-case approach” to voting on proposals related to sustainability topics. She added that it would consider issues such as the materiality of the topic and whether the adoption of the proposal would promote long-term shareholder value.Sign up to the weekly FTfm newsletter and receive the best of the FT's asset management coverage delivered to your inbox every Monday morning.Sign up here with one clickState Street said last month that it would start voting against boards of big companies that lagged behind on ESG issues.BlackRock also announced that it would be “increasingly disposed to vote against management” that were not making sufficient progress on sustainability, as it unveiled a far-reaching plan to put ESG issues at the heart of its investment process last month.According to the ShareAction report, ISS recommended that investors back 79 per cent of the environmental, social and lobbying resolutions examined, compared to 54 per cent of the time at Glass Lewis.Gary Retelny, chief executive of ISS, said the company typically was supportive of ESG resolutions that asked for more disclosure from companies, believing it was important for shareholders to know what was going on at businesses.“We are very big on long-term shareholder value. That is the lens through which we evaluate many of these things,” he said.Courteney Keatinge, senior director of ESG research at Glass Lewis, said it looked at shareholder proposals on a case-by-case basis.“We carefully scrutinise whether adoption of these proposals would result in any long-term material benefit or risk mitigation for shareholders and take into account factors including the company's industry, size, operations, geography, and pertinent regulations and market norms.”
8;STT;State Street Corp;2020-01-28T12:30:07Z;State Street vows to turn up the heat on ESG standards;Fund manager will vote against boards of companies that lag behind peers;State Street’s $3.1tn investment arm is planning to start voting against the boards of big companies that lag behind on environmental, social and governance standards, a threat that is likely to reverberate in many corporate boardrooms. State Street Global Advisors, one of the biggest shareholders in many blue-chip companies thanks to its position as one of the world’s largest index fund providers, last year introduced what it calls a “responsibility factor” — a scoring system that measures how well companies do on various ESG metrics.Starting this coming proxy season, SSGA will “take appropriate voting action” against board members at big US, UK, Australian, Japanese, German and French companies that are laggards based on this measure and “cannot articulate how they plan to improve their score”, according to a letter being sent out to boards this week.Initially SSGA will focus on a smaller cohort of companies that are performing particularly poorly, but beginning in 2022 it will also start voting against the board members of all companies that have consistently underperformed their peers. “Ultimately, we have a fiduciary responsibility to our clients to maximise the probability of attractive long-term returns — and will never hesitate to use our voice and vote to deliver better performance for them,” said Cyrus Taraporevala, SSGA chief executive, in the letter. “This is why we are so focused on financially material ESG issues.”Diversity, sustainability and climate change have moved towards the top of corporate agendas in recent years, with many investors demanding that companies do better on a wide variety of matters that fall under the ESG umbrella. European investment groups have led the charge by targeting individuals over apparent ESG failings. Legal & General Investment Management voted against the election of 3,864 directors globally in 2018, citing climate change, diversity or other governance factors. UBS Asset Management and Allianz Global Investors have also increased their votes against directors over ESG-related concerns.US fund managers have generally been more reluctant to take similar actions, but State Street said a related diversity push since 2017 has managed to get 583 companies to add or commit to adding women to their boards. Meanwhile BlackRock’s founder Larry Fink sent a letter this month to corporate executives arguing that “in the near future . . . there will be a significant reallocation of capital” because of the threat of climate change, in particular.“Awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance,” Mr Fink wrote, saying that the $7tn-in-assets investment group would incorporate ESG fully into its investment framework and insist on companies disclosing sustainability-related metrics. SSGA’s “R-factor” is based on a system constructed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a San Francisco-based non-profit. In 2018 SASB rolled out an ESG disclosure framework designed specifically for investors, which has now been adopted by money managers with more than $30tn of assets. State Street sees the SASB’s framework as a minimum set of standards that companies should reach, and uses it together with other data inputs to rank companies both against local and industry peers. Companies can ask SSGA for their scores.Tying the R-factor to how it will vote may help State Street shape the disparate ESG ratings industry. “We believe a company’s ESG score will soon effectively be as important as its credit rating,” Mr Taraporevala wrote.Some investment group executives have been concerned that embracing ESG too zealously might alienate some clients, or stir up concerns that the asset-management industry’s biggest players have too much sway in corporate boardrooms. Wary of being accused of over-reach, investment groups stress that improving ESG standards, especially with respect to climate change and diversity, is vital because of the real financial consequences for companies.“We believe that addressing material ESG issues is good business practice and essential to a company’s long-term financial performance — a matter of value, not values,” Mr Taraporevala said in his letter.

9;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
10;STT;State Street Corp;2020-01-17T21:28:59Z;State Street: custody battle;Custodian banks are being squeezed by the shift from active to low-cost passive funds;Things are finally looking up for Boston-based State Street. A set of better-than-expected fourth-quarter results sent the trust bank’s shares 5 per cent higher on Friday. In the medium term, however, there is less to get excited about. Sustained pressure continues to be exerted on all of its businesses. Even after Friday’s gain, the stock is still down about a quarter from its January 2018 peak.State Street is one of the country’s largest asset managers alongside BlackRock, Vanguard and Charles Schwab, with $3.1tn in assets under management. Its core business, though, is custodian banking. It helps asset owners and managers execute, clear and settle trades along with record-keeping, and other back- and middle-office work. This is low-margin work traditionally deemed safe because of its steady and stable nature. That assumption is now being challenged as large asset managers, themselves squeezed by the shift from active to low-cost passive funds, demand lower fees.State Street is pushing back. Servicing fees — which account for over half of total annual revenue — rose by a modest 1 per cent in the December quarter, following five straight quarters of year-on-year declines. That still leaves them down 6 per cent for the year at $5.07bn. Pre-tax margin was 130 basis points lower for the year.The asset management business is also trying to reverse years of declining market share. Management fees fell 4 per cent in 2019 even as AUM rose nearly a quarter from the year before.Aggressive cost-cutting has helped to take out some of the sting of lower fees. But there are only so many costs you can take out. State Street is making the right noises in terms of jump-starting servicing fee growth and fourth-quarter results are an encouraging sign that some of what management is doing is working. But these efforts are already baked into State Street’s share price. Having trailed Bank of New York Mellon, a rival custodian bank, on a forward earnings multiple basis for most of 2019, State Street is now trading at a slight premium.

11;STT;State Street Corp;2020-01-17T16:02:02Z;State Street seeks buyer for Currenex currencies-trading system;Potential sale comes as exchanges scramble for market share;US bank State Street has held informal discussions aimed at finding a buyer for currencies trading platform Currenex, multiple people familiar with discussions said, in a move that could leave the system in the hands of an exchange seeking to expand in the $6.6tn-a-day market.State Street has been looking for a buyer for some time, with no success so far, these people said, after the bank bought it in 2007 for $564m. Discussions are not thought to have reach an advanced stage. In a statement, the bank said it “does not comment on rumours or speculation”.Stock exchange operators are prowling for deals in the fragmented market for currency trading, which has long been dominated by systems such as Currenex that pool exchange rates from disparate banks in an effort to give customers access to the best available prices.Currenex, founded in New York in 1999, was one of the first so-called electronic communications networks where banks could compete for business in this way. The client base is dominated by hedge funds, and its daily trading volumes are not released.“The platform space is very crowded and foreign exchange is an area where stock exchanges are building up a presence, so this is a good time for State Street to crystallise Currenex’s value,” said a senior electronic trading executive.Ed Tilly, chairman and chief executive of Cboe Global Markets, told the Financial Times that the exchange group “continues to look at opportunities across all asset classes, including foreign exchange”, but did not say whether he would specifically consider Currenex. “We’re always . . . looking for acquisitions that would complement our existing businesses, support the growth of our proprietary products or help us gain scale in a business,” Mr Tilly said. The company already owns CboeFX, previously known as Hotspot.Deutsche Börse paid $796m for corporate-focused trading venue 360T in 2015, and then spent a further $100m on GTX, a currency platform catering to hedge funds and speculative investors. A person familiar with the German exchange group’s thinking said it was “always on the lookout for bargains”.Many comparable systems have already been snapped up. Refinitiv, then Thomson Reuters, paid $625m for FXall in 2012. Bats, now owned by Cboe, bought Hotspot for $365m in 2015. In 2017, Euronext shelled out $153m for another smaller currency venue, FastMatch, while the CME Group bought Nex Group for $3.2bn in a deal that included currency-trading platforms under the EBS brand. Last year, the London Stock Exchange offered $27bn to buy Refinitiv, which also operates a key currencies-trading system.Overall volumes have grown in recent years. Data last year from the Bank for International Settlements show that a record $6.6tn was changing hands in the market on average every day. That was up from $5.1tn in the previous survey in 2016. But less of that total appears to be flowing through trading platforms, which have been battling declining volumes as investors and banks grow more efficient. Volatility has also slumped.Some banks are also struggling to justify connecting to large numbers of external systems. Citigroup, one of the largest foreign exchange banks in the world, has said it would withdraw from two-thirds of the trading venues it supports at present.“The problem is that there are a lot of platforms doing the same sort of things, the technology is often creaky and there is very little differentiation between venues,” said one head of electronic trading at a bank.
12;STT;State Street Corp;2020-01-15T05:00:30Z;The fallacy behind the rise of passive fund management;Ultra-low charges created an industry that hitched a lucrative free ride on the backs of stock pickers;"Passive fund management is a big success built on a big fallacy. The late Jack Bogle’s sales pitch encapsulates it: “Don’t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack.”That line is still highlighted in marketing by Vanguard, the mutual fund business Bogle founded. BlackRock and State Street, two other big US fund managers, have their own variants. The implication: funds that track stock and bond indices immunise their clients against human error.That is impossible. Someone has to build the haystack in the first place. In this case, it is active managers, who select securities they believe will outperform. But Bogle’s reassuring line, combined with ultra-low charges, has created an industry that has hitched a lucrative free ride on the backs of stock pickers. It is so successful that index funds will soon face the issue that confronts all titans, from Standard Oil to Facebook: their outsized impact on business and society.Vanguard and its two peers manage assets worth $15tn, most of it passively. That compares with a world stock and bond universe whose value is estimated at about $190tn by the US Investment Company Institute. Growth rates have been breathtaking. BlackRock, the largest of the Big Three, has increased client assets 20 times to $7tn over 15 years, according to S&P Global data.There are no signs of let-up. The global value of regulated index funds powered past the $10tn mark recently. The reason? “Fees are infinitesimally small because index funds have spawned competition hugely beneficial to the investor,” says Ben Johnson of Morningstar, the fund-ratings group. Charges may be less than 0.1 per cent annually for the exchange-traded index funds in which he is an expert.Private investors previously paid five to 10 times more to hold old-school mutual funds. Too often, traditional fund managers were rentiers, charging clients steeply to own the stock market.Index funds have blown a hole in that business model. But stock pickers still control about four-fifths of world equities. Besides, there is no reason to believe equity pricing would seize up, even if active managers owned far less. That is good news for compilers of capitalisation-weighted indices, and the passive managers who use them. The Big Three’s economies of scale will continue rising for years, luring more assets.At current rates, the Big Three will control over a quarter of S&P 500 equity by 2028, up from one-fifth in 2018, according to a paper last year from the National Bureau of Economic Research in the US. Their propensity to vote shares held for clients is above average, noted Lucian Bebchuk of Harvard Law School and Scott Hirst of Boston University. The Big Three are on course to control 40 per cent of the votes in American corporations in a couple of decades.In a similar scenario, about a dozen people would set the agenda for US public companies, according to John Coates, another academic. That would be a dangerous concentration of power. Vanguard’s Jim Rowley argues “there is no monolithic index fund gobbling everything up — instead there is a very diverse set of index funds [run by each passive manager]”. This seems disingenuous. The employees of any company share common values — passive fund governance wonks included. The greater the dominance of a few investors, the worse for shareholder democracy.Lobbying pressure on the Big Three will also grow. Following pressure from activists, BlackRock joined Climate Action 100+, which chivvies energy companies to cut emissions and announced new green funds. Some see that as good stewardship. But can investors whose votes are increasingly pivotal in takeovers and top appointments credibly claim to be passive? Not really. By voting, they are picking winners, or trying to, just like active managers.You could say the same of a range of index funds that are investing in everything from modish green ventures to marijuana companies. Here, compilers at index groups such as MSCI make bigger subjective calls on inclusion than they would for purely capitalisation-weighted benchmarks. Even these old warhorses cause distortions. Businesses included in popular indices have lower financing costs than others. Companies from the former Soviet Union listed in London partly for this reason.In the US, index funds stand accused of a far more incendiary anti-competitive impact. Their concentrated ownership of industries such as airlines and pharmaceuticals may push up travel and drug prices, some academics argue.The validity of such concerns matters less than their growing currency. As huge businesses, the Big Three will provoke growing hostility from politicians and regulators. Modern capitalism’s crisis of legitimacy is a function of its scale and disengagement.Groups that have accumulated trillions by outsourcing investment decisions look like a prime example of the problem. It is no longer enough for them to point out how low their charges are. Before he died last year, Bogle wrote that if index funds owned more than 50 per cent of the stock market it would not “serve the national interest”. That is one quote you will not find displayed prominently on Vanguard’s website.

The strong finish pushed global net ETF inflows for 2019 to $570.5bn, up 10.6 per cent on the $515.8bn registered during the previous year, according to preliminary data from ETFGI, a London-based consultancy.“New cash business for ETF providers globally over the past decade has now exceeded $3.7tn and the industry’s worldwide assets ended 2019 at a record $6.3tn,” said Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI.The rise of ETFs is transforming the fund industry with the two biggest providers, BlackRock and Vanguard, leading an aggressive price war on fees that is forcing rival managers to overhaul their business models just to survive.New business for BlackRock’s iShares ETF arm rose 8.2 per cent to $180.2bn last year while net ETF inflows for Vanguard jumped 28 per cent to $118.8bn.State Street, the third-largest provider by assets, gathered net ETF inflows of $31.2bn last year, rebounding strongly after a subdued performance in 2018.Paris-based Lyxor was the only top 20-ranked ETF provider to register withdrawals with disappointing outflows of $5.5bn.Investors’ growing appetite for ETFs is encouraging asset managers to develop new funds at a rapid rate. Last year 867 ETFs were launched by 219 providers. New rules introduced by US regulators will simplify the process of obtaining permission to launch ETFs, a change that is expected to drive competition and innovation.
14;STT;State Street Corp;2020-01-08T04:00:33Z;Low yields. Low fees. How’s a custody bank to make money?;State Street chief gambles on winning new business from asset managers under pressure;"“The industry’s pain becomes our gain,” said Ron O’Hanley, chief executive of State Street, providing a neat summary of his strategy for the Boston-based custody bank.The industry in question is not banking, but asset management, where State Street’s key customers operate.In recent years asset managers have passed plenty of their pain on to custody banks such as State Street, BNY Mellon and Northern Trust. With revenues under pressure from the rise of low-cost passive investing, money managers are less willing to pay up for custodians’ back office services: settling trades, holding securities, keeping records and exchanging currencies. This comes on top of other pressures on custody banks, notably falling interest rates and correspondingly lower interest income.State Street is expected to report revenues of about $11.6bn for 2019, down 3 per cent from the year before. The decline in profitability has been more dramatic: in the first three quarters of 2019, return on equity, at 9.5 per cent, was 4 percentage points lower than the year before.Mr O’Hanley thinks the shake-out in asset management will continue, and with it the pressure on custodial fees. His solution? Sell a wider range of services, becoming a full-service administrative outsourcer and helping money managers take costs out of their businesses.The centrepiece of the strategy was the $2.6bn acquisition of Charles River Development in July of 2018. Charles River provides order management and analytics tools for traders, what is known in the asset management industry as “front office” software. The vision is that combining trading software with State Street’s “middle office” tax and accounting software and “back office” custody services would allow State Street to lower clients’ total operating costs significantly.Yet investors panned the deal when it was first announced. State Street’s shares fell 8 per cent on the day, and plunged another 40 per cent before they bottomed over a year later, underperforming even those of slumping peer custody banks.That the shares have rallied since — State Street is the best-performing large bank stock over the past six months — contributes to Mr O’Hanley’s confidence in the deal.The idea of acquiring Charles River originated in partnership offers State Street received from competitors to Charles River in front-office software (the other big players in the front-end space are Bloomberg and BlackRock’s Aladdin platform).Mr O’Hanley recalled with a quiet laugh what the offers amounted to: they wanted to sell State Street’s custody offering to their own clients, have access to the data the custody business generates and control the client relationships.“Well, that sounds good; how many of those can I have?” he said wryly. State Street was at risk of ending up “in a position where we would be doing all the hard work yet being paid commodity rates”.It made more sense to own all the value to be gained from combining trading and custody tools, he added. “We went from viewing the situation as purely defensive to, ‘let’s go on the offence’.”Mr O’Hanley, who became State Street chief executive a year ago, knows a thing or two about the pressure on asset managers. He founded the investment management practice at McKinsey and then served as an executive at BNY Mellon’s asset management arm and Fidelity before joining State Street in 2015 to run its own asset management business — which pioneered the index-tracking exchange traded fund that has undercut traditional active managers.Investors and their advisers have always looked to drive down fund fees, he said, but after the financial crisis “it became seared in people’s brains: the sure way to increase your investment returns — the only sure way — is to lower your costs”. To top it off, the relative performance of active managers has been poor since the crisis.Most asset managers use trading tools developed in-house, Mr O’Hanley said, meaning there are enough potential new clients for the Charles River business without having to wrestle away those who have already picked Bloomberg or BlackRock.Investors will have to trust State Street on the strength of the deal pipeline for now, he said, but “front-to-back” deals combining its traditional and newly-acquired offerings are coming in faster than anticipated. “There has only been one deal announced publicly [with Lazard Asset Management], there is a second one not public, then there are five or six that are working their way through [negotiations].”Even asset managers with trillions of dollars under management are interested in outsourcing, he said. The pain means it is an industry that will continue to consolidate, with passive investment strategies driving out sub-par active managers, and the most efficient passive managers driving out the less efficient.And the winners will be decided, in large part, by the ability to control costs.“Twenty years ago, I don’t think you could find a CEO in [asset management] who could tell you, hey, what percentage of your costs are operations,” he said. “Now its very much on the CEOs’ agenda.”"
15;STT;State Street Corp;2019-12-18T05:00:28Z;State Street takes hit from TD Ameritrade-Schwab merger;ETF pioneer seeks new strategy to halt share loss;State Street, the number three player in the $4.3tn market for exchange traded funds, is scrambling to rethink its strategy for that business in the wake of the acquisition of online broker TD Ameritrade by rival Charles Schwab.TD Ameritrade has been a key retail distributor of ETFs from the Boston-based bank’s State Street Global Advisors asset management division, which is trying to reverse years of declines in market share.That relationship, however, could now give way to more intense competition for customers from Schwab’s own ETFs.TD “was where we had a distinct advantage — we were the house brand, if you will, for low-cost ETFs,” State Street chief executive Ron O’Hanley told the Financial Times.“I don’t think we will lose because of this, because we are on the Schwab platform, too, but the ability to gain [share] from that alone has probably gone away.”State Street established the ETF market with the 1993 creation of SPY, its S&P 500 tracker. While it still has a market-leading position with institutional investors, much of the recent growth in the industry has been in low-fee ETFs for retail investors, where Vanguard and BlackRock dominate.The rise of the retail ETF was a “strategic pivot that State Street missed”, Mr O’Hanley said.But the changes in the industry also create an opportunity to regain ground, according to Mr O’Hanley. He signalled that State Street would attempt to sell retail investors on the same qualities that have attracted institutional investors to its ETFs — the liquidity of trading in the funds’ shares, particularly in fixed income.“With the platform fees having gone away, and cost becoming comparable . . . we think this could be an opportunity for us to sell the liquidity story, to say to investors: OK, assuming you’ve got the fee where you want it, liquidity actually does matter.”State Street’s market share has fallen steadily since the turn of the millennium, when it stood at 70 per cent. It fell from 17 per cent to 16 per cent over the past 12 months, according to Morningstar.In an attempt to reverse the trend, it struck a deal with TD Ameritrade two years ago to promote SSgA ETFs on the platform via commission-free trading, nudging aside funds from competitors including Vanguard and market leader BlackRock. State Street said its share of low cost ETFs — which is defines as those charging management fees under 6 basis points — rose from almost nothing in 2017, when it struck the deal, to just over 3 per cent today, representing some $50bn in inflows.But TD Ameritrade made trading of all stocks and ETFs free in October, in response to a similar move from Schwab that rocked the online brokerage industry. Less than two months later, a weakened TD agreed to sell itself to Schwab for $26bn.Because Schwab has its own low-cost ETF offerings, SSgA funds may not enjoy “prime shelf space” at the combined company, as another State Street executive put it.A comeback will not be easy for State Street, said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. “They were caught flat footed and have lost share over the years,” he said, citing State Street’s failure to target financial advisers over the years. “They have a chance to claw back market share . . . [but] where the industry stands today is a level of competition that is as fierce as it’s ever been and it’s growing fiercer by the day.”
16;STT;State Street Corp;2019-11-21T17:14:43Z;State Street’s ‘Spider’ man takes an early bow;Jim Ross to leave exchange traded fund industry after almost three decades;Jim Ross, one of the most prominent people in the $6tn exchange-traded fund industry, is taking early retirement from his job as chairman of State Street’s pioneering ETF business.The ETF market has exploded in size and diversity over the past decade, seizing market share from traditional, active fund managers thanks to the funds’ low expenses. These listed, benchmark-mimicking vehicles offer investors exposure to a wide range of securities, and have become a vital tool for money managers who use them as building blocks for trades.Though the first ETF was launched in Canada, State Street created the first US version, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, in 1993. It was nicknamed “Spider” after its acronym, which stands for Standard & Poor’s Depositary Receipts. Mr Ross, 54, was part of the original SPDR team, having joined the Boston-based group in 1992 after a stint as an accountant at Ernst & Young, and has led the business since 2005. In 2016 he became chairman of SPDR, State Street’s now-$714bn ETF business, and will retire at the end of March.“I’m not sailing off into the sunset, but I’ve been running hard for 27 years, so it feels like the right time to step back,” Mr Ross told the Financial Times. “It’s been a great run, but there will be times when I’ll miss it.” The SPDR business will continue to be led by State Street Global Advisors executive vice-president Rory Tobin. After a break, Mr Ross plans to explore opportunities in private equity, venture capital or financial technology, but does not intend to take any senior full-time positions at any State Street rivals, he said. At the time Spider was launched, it was considered primarily a tool for institutional investors, a tradable version of the index-tracking funds that were starting to proliferate at the time. But today it manages nearly $280bn and is comfortably the most heavily traded equity security on the planet, with more than $15bn changing hands every day, leaving aside the various derivatives linked to the fund.Mr Ross is also on the board of the Investment Company Institute, a trade organisation for the US asset management industry, and chairman of its ETF committee. “Without question, Jim has been one of the most influential figures in the investment management industry,” Ron O’Hanley, State Street chief executive, said in a statement. “His role in creating many of the world’s first ETFs ensures he will go down in history as an instrumental player in perhaps the most important product innovation the industry has seen.”However, ETFs have become increasingly controversial in recent years, with some analysts and investors arguing that they make markets less efficient and may even cause or exacerbate crashes. Others say that the dominance of State Street, Vanguard and BlackRock — and the likelihood that this will become even more entrenched given the benefits that scale gives in ETFs — may even be anti-competitive. Some academics have argued that given their big stakes in many companies, some may feel less of an impetus to compete, a theory known as “common ownership”.Mr Ross is unconcerned by these arguments, saying: “I don’t think the theory is right.” Although big index fund managers like State Street are building up corporate governance teams, “our job is to track an index, not tell companies how to run their business”, he said.
17;STT;State Street Corp;2019-10-05T10:00:54Z;SSGA chief predicts world’s top fund manager will be Chinese;Cyrus Taraporevala says sector faces profound disruption over the next decade;The biggest fund manager will be Chinese in 10 years’ time, according to the chief executive of State Street Global Advisors, which manages $2.9tn of assets globally.Cyrus Taraporevala said the expected huge growth of the Chinese mutual fund industry, combined with the potential for Chinese companies to buy western managers, would lead to profound disruption in the sector.“I predict that China’s full emergence into the global capital markets and the rise of Chinese mega asset managers is going to be the biggest regional shift in the history of asset management,” he said. “Time, scale and momentum are on China’s side.”He added that assets under management in China had quadrupled since 2013to $1.7tn and were growing at 17 per cent per year. But there was much greater potential for further growth as only 8 per cent of personal financial assets were in funds, and regulators were trying to orchestrate a reallocation of capital from the country’s shadow banking sector into investment funds.China has emerged as a key battleground for foreign asset managers trying to expand globally and take advantage of the demographic shifts in the world’s most populous country.Mr Taraporevala, who has led the third biggest investment group by assets since November 2017, said digital disruption was also a threat to traditional fund managers. “I would not underestimate the ability of China’s fintech companies to leapfrog their western competitors,” he said.“Companies like Ant Financial and Tencent are going to move increasingly from money market funds and deposit products into the very heart of asset management. Ant Financial’s money market fund became the world’s largest money market fund in four years. Think about that.”SSGA received approval from the Chinese regulator in December to set up an onshore investment management wholly foreign-owned enterprise structure. It has since recruited Alex Sun from HSBC’s Jintrust Fund Management to the new role of head of China and Charles Zhao from Janus Henderson as head of institutions within the country.Jennifer Johnson, president and chief operating officer at Franklin Templeton, which manages $690bn, said China’s economy would far outweigh the US’s in a decade.“I don’t know if the largest asset manager is going to be Chinese then, but it will be one that has worked out how to do business in China,” she added. “I don’t think you can be a large asset manager if you do not have a presence in China.”This week the Wall Street Journal reported that BlackRock, the world’s biggest fund manager, had held talks with Tencent, the Chinese internet behemoth, about working together to produce tools for the Chinese market.Robert Kapito, a co-founder of BlackRock, warned last year that large Asian tech companies posed a disruptive threat to traditional fund managers.
18;STT;State Street Corp;2019-09-19T10:00:28Z;‘Green-friendly’ ETFs hold shares in groups with coal operations;Investments by two State Street-run funds raise questions over fund managers’ practices;Two exchange traded funds explicitly marketed as excluding fossil fuels are holding thousands of shares in mining and energy companies with significant coal operations, raising questions about fund managers’ marketing practices and the responsibility of regulators to clear confusion around what investments should count as green.One of the funds — the SPDR MSCI EAFE Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF — contains more than 3,000 shares of RWE, a German energy company that runs seven coal-fired power plants, including one in Aberthaw, Wales. The other fund — the SPDR MSCI Emerging Markets Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF — owns nearly 50,000 shares of Vale, a Brazilian mining company that produces 22m tonnes of coal ore, and 7,500 shares of Sasol, a South African miner which operates six coal mines. Both funds are managed by State Street Global Advisors.However, these are not the only funds in the $1tn green investment market with holdings that might not align with their eco-friendly image. A report from environmental research group InfluenceMap, shows a number of other funds branded with terms such as “low carbon” or “climate aware” that own companies that have fossil fuel reserves. Adrienne Buller, an analyst at InfluenceMap, said: “Whether it is intentional choice or carelessness, none of us can say. But the fact is [some of these funds] have the carbon intensity of a regular market-tracking ETF.” Out of 118 retail funds being marketed with a climate-related theme, InfluenceMap found 23 products — including funds from BlackRock, Russell Investments, Amundi and others — with exposure to companies that own fossil fuel reserves.State Street said InfluenceMap missed “important nuances” in its research, but noted MSCI, which provides the benchmarks on which the fossil fuel reserve free funds are based, would implement changes in November to address “some of the more stock specific nuances of companies residing in a low carbon industry”.Even after the review, the two funds would stay invested in “metallurgical” coal, which is used in the steelmaking process, State Street said. “Eliminating all carbon exposure would result in a heavily concentrated portfolio that may not be suitable for all investors.”Many of the funds named in InfluenceMap’s study are not explicitly labelled as excluding fossil fuels. One such fund is BlackRock's iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF, which is marketed as having less exposure to carbon than the broad market while maintaining market-like exposure to large and mid-cap stocks.BlackRock said: “The fund is named ‘low carbon’ to ensure investors understand the ETF is seeking lower carbon exposure — but it’s not a no-carbon fund.”Russell Investments noted another reason for keeping some fossil fuel holdings in climate friendly funds: “Many companies that hold fossil fuel reserves are also some of the largest investors in renewable technologies.”The EU has made some strides to set up a standardised “ESG taxonomy”, but as of now investment managers are free to pick their own terminology for their sustainable funds, which InfluenceMap says leaves investors unable to make “like-for-like, informed comparisons”.InfluenceMap compared climate-friendly investment funds to “organic” products in the 1970s and 1980s. “To begin with, the word ‘organic’ was used widely and largely indiscriminately for marketing purposes until regulators saw fit to closely regulate its use in labels and marketing materials. It may be that a similar approach is needed in the ESG, and particularly the climate themed fund market,” the group’s report said.Still, despite the significant grey area, there were some examples that crossed a line, said Ms Buller at InfluenceMap. “The average retail investor trying to invest responsibly wouldn’t expect [a climate-sensitive fund] to be invested in RWE,” she said. Earlier this year, RWE was targeted with protests by environmental activist group Greenpeace, which labelled the company “Europe’s biggest corporate CO2-emitter”.

19;STT;State Street Corp;2019-06-30T10:00:11Z;Asset managers focus on Asia as profits leap;International groups relish fast-growing market but there are challenges ahead;"Asia presents asset managers with the most exciting prospects of any region but traditional fund houses face a complex mix of strategic, operational and regulatory challenges that could slow down or even wreck their expansion plans.Profits and revenues for traditional asset management activities broke records in 2018 after a decade in which Asia hugely outstripped growth in the mature US and European markets.Asset management profits in the region jumped 200 per cent to about $32bn between 2007 and last year. By contrast, US profits increased 48 per cent to $43bn and European profits by 42 per cent to $20bn in the same period, according to McKinsey, the consultancy.Its forecast is that asset management revenues across Asia will reach $112bn by 2022, almost double the $66bn earned in 2017. More turbocharged growth for profits lies ahead but the opportunities to boost earnings are uneven, which will pose difficulties for global players wanting to strengthen their presence.FTfm spoke to Asia heads of business at six global asset managers to gain insight into the markets that they see as top priority. We also looked at their initiatives, plans and objectives and asked what they see as the risks to their Asian operations.“China receives a lot of attention but there are smaller markets in south-east Asia that also present important longer-term growth opportunities. Deep revenue pools exist in the more mature Australian and Japanese markets, where regulatory changes and shifts in client needs mean there is still strong growth potential.”Ms Buckingham notes that global investors, including highly sophisticated players, tend to be underallocated to Asia despite the region’s strong growth and the recent inclusion of China’s markets into widely followed equity and bond indices.She says: “Asia is a very important growth priority overall. We plan to bring our global capabilities in investment management and technology to markets across Asia, helping clients to deploy capital to a region that will continue to grow dramatically as a contributor to global gross domestic product.”China, Australia, Japan and smaller markets in south-east Asia.BlackRock has strengthened its senior Asia team with hires including Tony Tang, head of China; Deborah Ho, head of south-east Asia; and Kimberly Kim, head of the Asia Pacific financial institutions group.The adoption of BlackRock’s technology services, including Aladdin, will be boosted by the recent acquisition of eFront, an analytics provider for alternative investments. Educating investors about exchange traded funds is a priority. The company also aims to increase its participation in the dialogue over pensions and retirement planning.These include geopolitics, trade tensions and technology conflicts.Mr Watkins says strong fundamental drivers include population growth, wealth creation, regulatory reforms and maturing capital markets. These support attractive growth prospects for asset managers across Asia. He believes China’s asset management market will continue its explosive growth rate as individual wealth accumulates and institutional balance sheets expand further.JPMorgan is building in China with its eye on the next 100 years. As the structure of financial markets and the culture of investing evolves in China, it says more clients will seek internationally diversified, long-term strategies. JPMAM also plans to expand in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and Korea.The company recently recruited Sean Cunningham to be its Hong Kong-based head of Asia ETFs and launched a dedicated China A-shares strategic beta index. It has established an Asia Pacific alternative solutions group and hired Lyn Ngooi as a hedge fund investment specialist in Singapore. JPMorgan has hired more institutional client advisers in Australia. In response to demands for sustainable investing, it has excluded tobacco from multi-asset products in Australia.These include the acquisition of a majority interest in China International Fund Management, JPMAM’s onshore China joint venture, and tapping into the growing demand for feeder funds in south-east Asia to bring international products to local investors. It aims to maintain a diversified book of business to meet varying client needs, which will require offering competitive products across major asset classes.A further escalation in US-China trade tensions. The direction of travel for China, towards opening up to foreign competition and adopting market-based reform, is clear and well established but trade is just one aspect of the complex relationship between the countries.Mr MacNevin says Asian clients now demand more information about environmental, social and governance risks. This has stimulated interest in State Street’s proprietary ESG scoring system, which generates a unique ESG assessment score for listed companies globally.SSGA is focused on China and Korea as well as expansion into targeted intermediary channels across the region.The company has appointed Alex Sun as head of China and Charles Zhao as head of institutions, China. In Korea, its representative office in Seoul has been upgraded to the status of a wholly owned subsidiary and Um Tae-jong was recruited as country head in January 2018. SSGA has also hired Benjamin Colton as Asia Pacific head of stewardship to meet client demand for ESG strategies.State Street plans to use its Shanghai-based wholly foreign owned enterprise as a springboard to implement its business plan in mainland China where Mr Zhao will lead the effort to build new client relationships with a focus on offshore investment strategies.“Asia is a region of incredible opportunity and an increasingly important focus for global investors. We will continue to assess industry and market trends to ensure we are well positioned to maximise opportunities,” says Mr MacNevin.State Street’s strategy is to ensure that it stays close to market developments so that it can respond appropriately on behalf of clients.The inclusion of China A-shares and bonds in global indices will drive additional offshore flows to Chinese securities, says Mr Lo, who believes that global fund managers with China expertise will be key beneficiaries of new inflows. Invesco also aims to strengthen its presence in Australia, one of the world’s fastest-growing asset pools; it plans to serve institutional and retail clients in Australia.Invesco has comprehensive coverage in Asia but China is expected to present the most significant opportunities. Invesco Great Wall, established in 2003, is the company’s China joint venture and this is set to continue to be a growth engine. Invesco manages assets of more than $44bn in China; more than 80 per cent of Invesco Great Wall business is domestic.Invesco was ranked as number two foreign manager in China in 2018 and number one for onshore business by Z-Ben, the Shanghai consultancy. Its Jingyi money market fund was added to Ant Financial’s platform last year and has close to $14bn in assets. Invesco also launched a fixed income fund for investors to participate in opportunities presented by China’s Belt and Road Initiative.China is a critical pillar of growth for Invesco. The company remains focused on building its core strength with Chinese institutional investors, both onshore and offshore. On the retail side, it aims to enhance its distribution, most importantly on digital and ecommerce platforms.The US-China trade war and the uncertainty it has created is a risk that Invesco says it cannot ignore. An escalation could affect international investors’ sentiment towards China.With the rise of wealth platforms in Asia and its move away from a product focus towards investment advisory solutions and customisation, Schroders has been working with distributors to develop its digital tools and investment solutions. Its investment in WeInvest, the digital wealth technology provider, and digital client engagement tools such as investIQ have enabled it to build a deeper collaboration with distributors.China is Schroders’ priority, both as a source of investor inflows and a destination for capital. It is focused on the rapid growth in demand for pensions in the region’s large mature markets as well as China, and it points out that the onshore wealth market, especially in south-east Asia, China and India, is increasingly dominated by digitally sophisticated millennials.The company has strengthened its partnership network, signing a strategic agreement with Maybank Asset Management in late 2018. This will allow it to extend its presence in Malaysia. It is also building its onshore business in China with three new private funds targeting rich individuals and institutional investors.Schroders has made significant hires over the past year and it says it will continue to invest in areas that support its priorities, such as digital capabilities.The company sees fee compression, market volatility and the growth of low-cost digital sales platforms as the main challenges but points out that these are issues faced by all asset managers.Ms Torres says: “China is a very complex market for international asset managers. They need to have a clear, long-term strategy, the right teams, quotas and licences. They need to understand how to position their business, whether as product manufacturer, structurer and packager or a distributor. Some global investors are still hesitant to go into China but they need to be there. They underestimate the determination of Chinese policymakers to achieve their goals.”BNP Paribas AM is present in 10 Asian markets but its main priorities are China, Japan and Korea.The company launched a group-wide global sustainability strategy in 2019 that will focus on the three themes: the environment, equality and energy transition.It hired Gabriel Wilson-Otto as head of stewardship for Asia Pacific, a new role based in Hong Kong.BNP has also recruited Brian Kim in South Korea as an institutional sales director to focus on insurance clients.These include advancing the stewardship agenda across Asia, and introducing measuring and reporting on the progress of sustainability initiatives. BNP also plans to extend its strong relationships with institutional clients to increase inflows from pension clients and insurers.Ms Torres says the sheer speed of change across relatively young markets is a challenge to asset managers. Unanticipated shifts in regulations can present risks. Profit margins for asset management activities in the Asia Pacific region are higher than in the US or Europe but competition will increase the risk of margin compression. Ms Torres also highlights the challenges of integrating digital capabilities so managers can respond to the demands of younger clients."
20;STT;State Street Corp;2019-06-27T18:32:51Z;State Street settles claims it overcharged clients — again;Custody bank to pay $89m over mark-ups on use of Swift system;"State Street on Thursday reached an almost $89m settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission stemming from charges that the bank systematically overbilled its investment fund clients for custodial services — primarily by adding a fee for use of the SWIFT financial messaging network.The bank will pay the regulator a fine of just over $40m and over $48m in repayment of ill-gotten gains collected between 1998 and 2015.The SEC said in a statement that “fund expenses make a big difference to mutual fund investors and advisers; they have a right to receive honest information about what they’re paying for”.“Today’s announcement by the SEC relates to the billing errors that we self-disclosed in 2015,” State Street said in a statement. “We regret these invoicing errors and the impact on our clients. We have compensated the affected clients, with interest.”State Street has settled charges of overbilling before. In 2014 it paid $70m to settle class action suits brought by shareholders and bank employees, alleging in part that the bank overcharged for foreign exchange services. It denied the allegations. In 2017, the bank reached a $35m settlement with the SEC relating to charges that it charged clients hidden mark-ups on securities transactions.In its most costly settlement, it agreed in 2016 to pay the US Department of Justice and other regulators $530m to settle allegations that it overcharged clients by adding secret mark-ups to foreign exchange trades.The company statement on Thursday added: “We have not resolved at this time inquiries by all governmental authorities.”The core business of trust banks such as State Street is providing asset owner and asset manager clients with custodian services, trade clearing and settling, record-keeping, and other back- and middle-office work.State Street’s shares rose by 1 per cent in mid-day trading on Thursday. They have fallen by half since the beginning of 2018 as fee pressure, falling interest rates, and increasing competition have pressured profits."
21;STT;State Street Corp;2019-06-15T10:00:33Z;BlackRock, Vanguard and SSGA tighten hold on US boards;Regulators examine prospect of the Big Three becoming the Giant Three;BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors are on course to control four votes out of every 10 cast at large US companies, as regulators and policymakers probe the wider consequences of their increasing dominance of the investment market.The influence of the Big Three, which have mopped up trillions of dollars of index investments in recent years, is being viewed by politicians as a possible antitrust issue.BlackRock, Vanguard and SSGA, which collectively manage more than $14tn, account for a quarter of votes cast at S&P 500 companies. This is set to grow to 34 per cent over the next 10 years, and 41 per cent in 20, according to academics at Harvard Law School.“Policymakers and others must recognise — and must take seriously — the prospect of a Giant Three scenario. The plausibility of this scenario makes it important to understand the incentives of index fund managers,” wrote Lucian Bebchuk and Scott Hirst in a paper entitled The Specter of the Giant Three.The pair point out that BlackRock, Vanguard and SSGA have quadrupled their collective ownership stake in S&P 500 companies over the past two decades, with each fund manager typically holding 5 per cent or more of US public companies.They argue that the groups’ growing clout will lead to a lower rate of corporate interventions and allow company executives to be less restricted.“The Big Three . . . can be expected to have substantial incentives to be excessively deferential to the corporate managers of their portfolio companies. If the Big Three were to grow into the Giant Three, these deference incentives would operate to weaken beneficial constraints on corporate managers,” wrote Mr Hirst and Mr Bebchuk, a leading academic in the field of corporate governance.Rakhi Kumar, head of environmental, social and governance investments and asset stewardship at SSGA, did not agree that a greater concentration of ownership would lead to less scrutiny. “I doubt you would be able to find a company that says State Street is a pushover,” she said.The Harvard study will reignite a debate among politicians and regulators about whether the Big Three pose a risk of so-called common ownership, an argument made by US academics that index managers’ stakes in several companies in one sector incentivise them to constrain competition.This has led to regulatory investigations on both sides of the Atlantic and a strong defence from the biggest fund groups.The US Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have both looked at the risk, while the European Commission and Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, are studying the issue.“It is becoming more common for the same investors to hold shares in different companies in the same industry. And for those investors, fierce competition might not seem so appealing,” said Ms Vestager this year.“If one company outdoes its rivals, its shares will do well — but the shares of other companies in the industry might suffer. So for investors with holdings in several of those companies, it can be better if those companies don’t compete too hard.”Ms Kumar said she believed the common ownership argument was flawed. “By holding the entire index, there is no incentive for us to push one sector over another,” she said.Vanguard said it wanted portfolio companies to compete with each other and for the best performers to be rewarded. “A lack of competition among companies in a concentrated industry would have a negative impact on related companies and industries in which our funds invest,” it added.The increasing dominance of the largest fund groups also calls into question whether their stewardship teams, which oversee their voting and engagement at tens of thousands of investee companies, have sufficient resources.SSGA has 12 people dedicated to stewardship globally but Ms Kumar said the launch of the company’s new ESG scoring system and wider interest in governance from across the group meant it was not under-resourced.“It is integrated into the investment process — there are far more hands on stewardship within the business than just 12,” she added.Vanguard said it had 35 people in its investment stewardship team.BlackRock said it had 43 people working in stewardship, and added: “In order to protect and grow the value of our clients’ assets, we engage directly with companies and vote at shareholder meetings on issues that we believe are essential to building long-term value.”
22;STT;State Street Corp;2019-06-11T17:16:55Z;State Street forecasts weaker revenues as rates decline;Bank is the latest to warn that trading and interest income are under pressure;Shares in State Street slid on Tuesday after its chief financial officer forecast that revenues would be lower than expected in the second quarter in an early indication that the recent decline in interest rates will hit banks’ bottom lines.Eric Aboaf, speaking at an industry conference, said that due to “significant turn in the interest-rate environment”, the bank’s net interest income — accounting for roughly a fifth of total revenue — would be down 8 per cent in the second quarter, relative to the first.Fee income, which accounts for the remainder of revenue, is set to fall 1-2 per cent, because of lighter trade volume and lower volatility in the foreign exchange markets.“Rates are down 50 basis points, FX volatility continues to come down, there’s been spread compression in a number of areas. So we’re going to have a challenging quarter,” Mr Aboaf said.Previously, the company had forecast that net interest income would fall 1-2 per cent and fee revenue would be flat or slightly up.As expectations have increased that the Federal Reserve will cut US interest rates, perhaps as early as next month, investors have sold bank stocks, showing particular eagerness to rid themselves of the most rate-sensitive lenders.State Street has already seen sustained revenue pressure in its core custody business — helping asset owners execute, clear, settle and analyse trades — as large asset managers, facing margin pressure, have passed the pain along to suppliers. The trust banks have also seen deposit outflows, as institutional depositors have sought higher returns of their cash, and the unwinding of central bank bond holdings has pulled liquidity out of the financial system.State Street’s shares were down 2.4 per cent in afternoon trading in New York. They have lost about half their value since the beginning of 2018, while broad banking indices have fallen by about one-fifth. State Street’s performance has trailed that of the other large trust banks, Bank of New York Mellon and Northern Trust, which have less direct exposure to large asset managers.“We’ve continued to see a rotation from non-interest bearing into interest bearing deposits, and that’s been costly,” Mr Aboaf said on Tuesday. “On the other hand, the flattening yield curve this quarter . . . has resulted [in] lower reinvestment yields.”Pain has been evident across the banking sector. Also on Tuesday, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley said its securities business will probably disappoint analysts by making less money in the second quarter than in the first three months of the year.“A lot of the analyst models have us beating the first quarter. I’d be very surprised if that happened,” James Gorman told a New York conference.“The macro space is challenged, we had several weeks there where the IPO calendar was effectively shut, the M&A stuff has been lumpy, he said, adding: “When you’ve got this much noise politically . . . there’s not a lot of activity.”Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have already warned of tough trading conditions in the second quarter.
23;STT;State Street Corp;2019-05-09T11:41:21Z;Wall Street’s safe bet on trust banks turns sour;State Street and BNY Mellon are getting squeezed as investor clients seek lower fees;"Until recently, the big US trust banks were Wall Street’s idea of a safe bet.The likes of State Street and Bank of New York Mellon have long been the irreplaceable plumbing of the financial system, earning steady fee income by providing back-office services for investors. For years, they traded at wide premiums to their better-known and more risk-taking competitors in banking.But times have changed for State Street and BNY Mellon. Their core business of global custody — executing, settling and clearing trades, custody of securities and so on — is coming under pressure as customers seek lower fees for services and higher yields on deposits, and the more diversified JPMorgan Chase gains market share.In the first quarter, fee revenue from investor clients was down 8 per cent in aggregate at State Street and BNY Mellon. Over the past three months, shares in the two banks have underperformed bank indices by roughly 10 percentage points. In the 52 weeks to Thursday, State Street shares were off 35 per cent, while BNY Mellon stock had fallen 14 per cent.“The revenue yield they earn on assets under administration keeps going down,” said Jeffrey Harte, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, adding that he finds it hard to get excited about companies facing “continual pricing pressure in their core business”.The underlying problem for the trust banks is that their customers are struggling to deal with the rise of low-fee passive investment strategies. Money managers pay the trusts a tiny fraction of a percentage point on the assets moved or held, but as the managers’ margins are squeezed, they have pressed the trusts for ever-lower fees.In its first-quarter calls with analysts, State Street, which is the most exposed to the big asset managers that are suffering acute margin pressure, said it “continue[d] to see the ongoing impact of fee concessions”. BNY attributed soft fee income more to reduced client activity and a stronger dollar.One longtime investor in BNY Mellon said the trust banks boast “wonderful returns on equity and offer an incredible service at a very low price — we’re talking 1 basis point — but the thing I get agitated by is why they can’t have more pricing discipline”.JPMorgan has added to the pressure, drawing on its markets expertise to help clients with performance measurement and complex derivates portfolios. The bank won $1tn of custody assets from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, in 2017, and it increased custody fees faster than State Street or BNY Mellon last year.“We have had a multiyear investment programme in securities services technology,” said Teresa Heitsenrether, who leads the business for JPMorgan. “The combination of technology investments and operational knowhow has certainly contributed to our share growth.”At the same time, the end of the Federal Reserve’s rate-raising cycle poses particular problems for the trust banks. The general problem is that yields on loans and bonds stop increasing while deposit rates, which tend to lag behind, continue to rise. The effect is pronounced at the trust banks as they have few if any sticky retail deposits. Their institutional clients care about the last basis point.The situation is more acute still because the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet. When the Fed was buying Treasuries as part of its quantitative easing programme, it pushed cash into the hands of investors, and some of that cash ended up parked, interest-free, at trust banks. As the Fed has shrunk its balance sheet — quantitative tightening — the opposite has happened, draining the trusts’ balance sheets of cheap funding.The net result: interest-free deposits at State Street, BNY and Northern Trust, a smaller trust bank, have fallen by a whopping 28 per cent, or $44bn, in the past 12 months.“With QE you had a massive influx of liquidity and deposits into the system; with QT, you have seen the opposite of that,” said Steven Chubak, an analyst with Wolfe Research. As a result, “the trusts have seen a massive decline in non-interest bearing deposits”.Since December, when the market started to anticipate a pause in rate rises at the Fed, and to reflect investor nerves about QT, the three big trust banks have all underperformed banks in general, and their price-to-book ratios have fallen.The main strategy of the trusts in the face of the pressure on revenue has been to take out costs while offering more services to clients. But, as Mr Harte puts it: “You have to work pretty hard to win the arms race — providing more services for the same dollar.”"
24;STT;State Street Corp;2019-03-08T04:00:33Z;Campa must decide how the EBA decamps;Sorting out the Canary Wharf lease will be an early headache for the new boss;José Manuel Campa, the former Spanish minister turned Santander exec, is going back to the public sector as head of the European Banking Authority. But where? Officially his tenure could begin soon after the European Parliament signs off on the appointment in mid-March. That would mean starting the job at the EBA’s current HQ in Canary Wharf. But the agency is moving to France on June 3 in response to Brexit. An early headache for Campa — aside from shuttling between Madrid, London and Paris — will be sorting out the five years remaining on the EBA’s Canary Wharf lease. Subletting is an option and there is also a break clause. At least Campa isn’t facing the £500m bill confronting Guido Rasi of the European Medicines Agency, which bizarrely took out a 25-year lease until 2039 on its Canary Wharf HQ. It has already decamped to Amsterdam but had no break clause on its London home and last month lost a court ruling after seeking to escape the lease on the grounds Brexit was a “frustration”. Most people see it as a little more than that.Maurice Tulloch was delighted to land the chief exec role at Aviva on Monday. A nice birthday gift for the Scottish-Canadian high flyer who turns 50 this month. But the five months of uncertainty the company has faced in between ditching its last boss, Mark Wilson, and opting for Tulloch won’t end here. Not only will the new chief need to replace himself as head of the international business. There’s also chatter that his main internal rival for the job, UK boss Andy Briggs, is unlikely to hang around. (Might he be a contender for the vacant Royal London CEO role?) Finance director Tom Stoddard could be out of favour, too — after the preference share repurchase debacle last year. Commenting yesterday, Tulloch talked cryptically of having “inherited a great team [and] a deep bench”. “Most CEOs will make a couple of changes but that’s not something I’m deciding today.” Fall-out deferred perhaps.TalkTalk dragged a crop of analysts up to Salford, where it has moved to save costs, for its capital markets day on Tuesday. FibreNation, its plan to take on BT with a vast fibre network, featured heavily. The broadband company also talked up more modest plans to expand its existing network in York to nearby towns like Ripon. Yet the vigilant RBC analyst Wilton Fry spotted an odd coincidence. Just as analysts were listening to TalkTalk’s plans, a striking-off notice was issued by the registrar of companies for Bolt Pro Tem, the “holdco” for TalkTalk and CityFibre’s York network. Bolt Pro Tem had failed to file 2018 accounts on time. The issue was put down to a clerical error and everything is now in order. But it wasn’t the best time for the slip to become public.“Women, we make up 50 per cent of the population,” said Catherine McGuinness of the City of London Corporation. “It should be a question of normality, not diversity, to find us in leadership roles.” In the chilly environs of the London Stock Exchange, McGuinness stoically wore no coat as she presented the newly installed “Fearless Girl” statue on Tuesday. “She’s a symbol of just how much work there is to do,” said Cuan Coulter, Europe boss of State Street, the investment group that commissioned the statue. State Street, like most financial groups, is underweight on senior women. “There’s no silver bullet,” he said. Just a bronze eight-year-old.
25;STT;State Street Corp;2019-01-18T19:51:37Z;Asset management fee squeeze hits State Street;Bank to lay off 1,500 as asset servicing and index fund units both feel margin pressure;Pressure on asset management fees is having knock-on effects on the banks that service the industry, according to the new chief executive of State Street, one of the largest US trust banks.While State Street on Friday reported fourth-quarter results that largely met Wall Street forecasts, Ron O’Hanley, who took over as chief executive this month, said he was “not satisfied” by the performance.The rise of passive investment management has compressed margins for asset managers, Mr O’Hanley said, who in turn are pressuring their service providers to “do more for less”.State Street’s biggest business is asset custody, accounting and data management on behalf of money managers and other financial institutions.‘We are not satisfied with our recent performance” he added. “Structural costs are still too high and our automation efforts have not moved fast enough.”The bank announced a new round of employee lay-offs that would reduce the staff by 1,500 workers, or about 3 per cent, in high-cost locations such as Boston, New York and London.In December, State Street set out a cost-cutting program that would thin the ranks of senior managers by 15 per cent. The lay-offs announced Friday include those job cuts.While higher interest rates and strong foreign exchange trading results led to a 5 per cent increase in fourth-quarter revenues, equity market declines led to lower assets under management and fees remained under pressure. State Street’s pre-tax margin fell to 17 per cent in the the fourth quarter from 25 per cent the year before.The bank said that the expense reduction program would take out $350m in costs in 2019, the equivalent of 4 per cent of its 2018 cost base.State Street also manages index funds through its subsidiary, SSgA. That business is also under margin pressure, as rivals such as mutual-fund colossus Fidelity launch no-fee funds. SSgA, which launched the first exchange-traded fund 25 years ago, offers index products with fees as low as 3 basis points, or 3 cents for every $100 invested.State Street shares were up slightly in Friday afternoon trading. They have lost almost a third of their value since their peak early last year, underperforming the wider market and rival trust banks Bank of New York Mellon and Northern Trust.“It is hard to see the stock outperforming peers as the expense save program is needed to offset revenue pressure,” wrote KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl in a note to clients.
26;STT;State Street Corp;2019-01-15T00:00:24Z;State Street tells boards to focus on corporate culture;Asset manager wants companies to focus on ‘human capital’ to help create long-term value;"State Street Global Advisors is calling on boards to review their companies’ cultures and explain its alignment with their strategy, in the latest example of large investors emphasising intangible factors as a means to create long-term value.The world’s third-largest asset manager has written to the independent chairs or lead independent directors of more than 1,100 companies in the S&P 500, FTSE-350 and equivalent indices in Australia, France, Germany and Japan.The letter from Cyrus Taraporevala, SSGA chief executive, sets out how directors can assess, influence and report on their culture and says they should expect to answer questions on it from SSGA over the coming year.It builds on previous years’ letters focusing on sustainability, directors’ independence and gender diversity in the boardroom. Rakhi Kumar, head of SSGA’s asset stewardship team, said the letters had driven discernible changes in boards’ behaviour.It also follows letters sent in the past 18 months by BlackRock and Vanguard asking companies to explain what social purpose they serve and outlining a stronger stance on environmental, social and governance issues including disclosing the climate risks they face.“The intangibles do drive the bottom line,” Mr Taraporevala said in an interview. “They’re just becoming more important as more of the world moves to a new economy”, in which companies whose brands carry more weight than their hard assets are increasingly focused on managing their “human capital”.“Over the past several years we’ve seen the downside when culture is not aligned to strategy,” he said. But SSGA had found most directors were unable to articulate their company’s culture adequately or show how they manage it.Corporate culture was difficult to measure, Mr Taraporevala acknowledged. He pointed to research from the accounting firm EY, initiatives including the Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism and others, which found that such intangible assets now play a greater role in creating long-term value than tangible assets.Ms Kumar noted that the UK’s Financial Reporting Council last year formalised the board’s role in aligning a company’s culture with its purpose, values and strategy in the new UK corporate governance code.“The UK code often has a ripple effect across the market,” she said. “What shows up in the UK today will often be in other markets in the next five years.”Mr Taraporevala said he worried that the letter could be “misperceived as us trying to foist our values on” the companies in which it invests. But he described the initiative as being about “value, not values”.The letter comes after State Street announced plans to lay off 15 per cent of its senior managers. The company was in the middle of “a strategic transformation”, Mr Taraporevala said, in which culture and human capital played a part.“I would describe the culture as very client centric; a deep fiduciary culture; a collegial culture. It’s somewhat, frankly, cautious. But I think where we’re evolving the culture is to become more lean and performance-oriented, amping up the results.”"
27;STT;State Street Corp;2018-12-12T05:00:24Z;Index fund managers are too big for comfort;Investors such as BlackRock cannot keep quiet and hope that no one will notice them;Think of an industry in which three big companies have used technology and economies of scale to become oligopolies and wield power over other enterprises. It hails not from Silicon Valley but the US east coast.The industry in question is passive investment management, in which computers take the role of human stock pickers and money is channelled into index and exchange traded funds. The Big Three of the US industry — BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street — have gained such size and efficiency that they control 80 per cent of the money invested in US index funds.Even Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard and pioneer of the modern US index fund industry, is alarmed by their success. He has warned that, “if historical trends continue, a handful of giant institutional investors will one day hold voting control of virtually every large US corporation”.That is a scary prospect for the future relationship between companies and their investors. Chief executives such as Paul Polman, the departing head of Unilever, sigh at the short-termism of some shareholders and activists. Would life be better if they reported to huge robots?It might become quieter. Investors have traditionally expressed their displeasure with companies by selling shares, or by kicking up a fuss through public or private criticisms. The first tactic is barred to index funds: they have to hang on to stock in any company in an index, no matter how badly it is run. The weighting is set by a formula, not by individual discretion.Passive investors also have less incentive than activists to speak up and persuade a company to change strategy, since no single investment has much effect on their performance. Leo Strine, supreme court chief justice in Delaware, the state in which many US companies are incorporated, has described index funds as “the least active in exercising voice and judgment”.Companies should really want index fund companies not to remain silent, but to speak up. The worst of all worlds would be a shareholder base dominated by passive investors who are also passive owners, where most noise is made by a few activists who demand quick fixes. Index funds are naturally the most long term in outlook because they have no other choice.The Big Three have realised they cannot keep quiet and hope that no one will notice them. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, has taken to publishing an annual letter to chief executives, which is a clue to where power lies. In this year’s missive, he promised: “We must be active, engaged agents on behalf of the clients invested with BlackRock.” That involves hiring more overseers — BlackRock intends to double its “investment stewardship” staff in the next three years — and arranging more conversations with chief executives. It voted at 15,000 investor meetings on 130,000 proposals last year, while Vanguard “engaged” with 720 portfolio companies representing $1.6tn of its assets under management.As with investing, the giants are nothing if not efficient. They have their own governance guidelines and they do a lot of talking behind the scenes, following Theodore Roosevelt’s motto, “Speak softly and carry a big stick”. As one Dutch study suggested, they “exert structural power . . . in a way that is hidden from public view”.This gets results. A study of US companies held by passive mutual funds found that they performed better than their peers thanks to stricter governance, such as having more independent directors and fewer takeover defences. The fund groups are good at curbing misbehaviour.But their size and strength lead to two problems. First, they operate at such a scale that they tend to take a common approach to all companies. This is effective in imposing minimum standards in matters such as executive pay, but it does not amount to engaging deeply with corporate strategy in the same way as activist investors.Companies could be left ticking boxes for passive investors, while still being exposed to intense, targeted pressure from activists who have more time. Mr Fink insists that talking consistently to long-term shareholders such as BlackRock will help companies not to be picked on by those with “the shortest and narrowest of objectives”, but the jury is still out on that.Second, so few investors holding so much power would be worrying even if they were paragons. I sympathise with Vanguard’s decision to shine its spotlight on US makers of guns and opioids, but what happens if the giants team up against an innocent industry? It puts a premium on their judgment.Antitrust scholars worry about collusion — institutions with stakes in different companies in an industry encouraging them not to compete hard with each other (one study found that US airline prices are higher as a result). The evidence is mixed but, as the fund groups expand, their capacity to exert invisible influence over the companies in which they hold stakes strengthens.Like other consumer technologies, index funds have brought great benefits to ordinary investors. But Mr Bogle’s innovation, useful as it remains, may be working a little too well.john.gapper@ft.comBalance of power is the bedrock of capitalism / From Stanislas Yassukovich, Wynberg, Western Cape, South Africa
28;STT;State Street Corp;2018-10-23T12:30:12Z;How passive fund managers can shape the corporate landscape;They are proving pivotal in control contests, activist campaigns and mergers;The growing concentration in banking since the financial crisis, with more and more activity conducted by financial institutions regarded as “too big to fail”, is at least a well understood phenomenon. The growing concentration in asset management resulting from the rise of indexed and exchange traded funds is less understood, especially in relation to its consequences for corporate governance.The so-called big three indexed fund providers — Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock — are estimated to have controlled about 15 per cent of the S&P 500 in 2017. More broadly, more than 44 per cent of assets in US-domiciled equity funds are now managed passively, up from 19 per cent in 2009.If anything, these figures underestimate the power of passive fund managers because large numbers of shareholders do not vote, even in contested battles, so the voting power of those who do vote is leveraged.In a recent draft paper from which I have taken these numbers, John C Coates of Harvard Law School points out that the big three’s share of any contested vote now tends to be pivotal and that on current trends, even if growth starts to taper off, a majority of the 1,000 largest US companies will be controlled, in effect, by a dozen or fewer people over the next 10 to 20 years.This leads to what he calls the Problem of Twelve, his paper’s title, whereby ownership rights, including the critical right to elect directors, will be in the hands of this tiny group. Even if the growth in passive investing fails to follow the trajectory outlined by Mr Coates, it is clear that there is already a striking concentration of power.Concentrated power is always worrying. Yet, in this case, it also holds out the potential to solve one of the most intractable dilemmas in corporate governance. This was identified by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means in the 1930s as the divorce between ownership and control. The decline of owner-managers and their replacement by a fragmented plethora of outside investors meant that control rights in the corporation were not exercised effectively and that shareholders (principals) were unable to hold managers (agents) to account.The institutionalisation of investment in the postwar period re-concentrated voting power, but failed to overcome the principal-agent problem because professional fund managers had inadequate incentives to engage with management. A fund manager who incurred the costs of engagement saw the benefits of improved corporate performance spread across competitors’ portfolios. Increasing other people’s assets under management led to their reaping increased fees at no cost.Fund managers were also conflicted. They were reluctant to engage in activism because chief executives wanted autonomy and could be relied on to withdraw company pension business from the activist manager.At first blush, passive fund managers scarcely look cut out for engagement with management. Because their portfolios are far larger than those of active managers, the cost of monitoring and conducting a dialogue is high, especially given that they operate a very low-cost business model. Yet even with small governance teams, they can exert considerable power vis-à-vis corporate management because they tend to have similar attitudes and voting policies and are pivotal when it comes to control contests, activist campaigns and mergers.Hence the increased correlation in shareholder votes, particularly among the big three. Chief executives are acutely aware of all this. Mr Coates also points out that for a given portfolio company, growth in the size of an index fund will result in more shares being held, which is why concentration resulting from indexing is growing so fast. For each additional share and each additional dollar of assets under management, there is no additional cost to forming a view on a policy issue and applying it to the same company.He also argues that the conflict of interest in the fund manager’s position evaporates because voting power means a chief executive is more likely to want to offer business to an indexed fund manager than take it away. The difficulties inherent in this concentration of power are the same as those that apply to the stewardship approach to investing more generally. Do these indexed fund managers have the competence to make important judgments about the strategy and management of individual companies?There are questions, too, about legitimacy and accountability in relation to these unelected individuals who exercise power behind closed doors over the shape of the corporate landscape and the job prospects of millions of employees.And then there are antitrust issues. In a business with big economies of scale, incomers confront huge barriers. There will thus be, at the very least, calls for greater transparency, though surely not for drastic breaking up of indexed funds. They have given investors too good a deal for that to make sense.john.plender@ft.com
29;STT;State Street Corp;2018-10-15T03:01:31Z;Diversity beyond gender proves hard for investors to measure;Finding data on worker demographics is a challenge for responsible investment teams;When BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, took companies to task for the lack of women on corporate boards earlier this year, it struck a chord with Julie Gorte.A senior vice-president of Pax World Funds, Ms Gorte had spent nearly 20 years making that very point with the companies in which she invests.Progress has been slow. Less than a quarter of blue-chip board seats are held by women in the US, according to data from proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services, trailing the greater progress seen across many European countries.If efforts to increase gender diversity have been slow to take effect, addressing other areas of diversity has proved even harder, as Ms Gorte and others have discovered. This includes analysing boards’ mix on ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and social background. Yet investors often draw a blank with their research.They say they lack the basic data to judge how companies are faring on increasing diversity across their organisations and some are now actively pushing companies to disclose more information.“If you see a Hispanic name or black face, you can say yes this board has an ethnic minority on it,” Ms Gorte says. “But you are never really sure — does that person think of themselves as Latino? Are they there to represent that group? Making a determination often can be quite difficult.”Some investors look at how companies score on equality rankings, or seek out news reports that highlight harassment and discrimination at a given companyThe shift is being propelled by the more progressive public US pension plans, as well as advisers to city retirement and investment funds in New York and Chicago. Big money managers, such as BlackRock and State Street, which hold hefty sway in proxy contests, have also responded to the call.Investors have come to appreciate the value of boardroom diversity, both as a social imperative and a way to improve the mix of decision makers at the top of a company. Diverse boards are viewed as a way to mitigate against groupthink and legal risk.Moreover, progressive workplace policies are an important tool to recruit and retain employees, says Jackie VanderBrug, the head of sustainable and impact investment strategy in Bank of America’s wealth management division.There is also arguably a financial imperative for companies. Research from Bank of America this year showed that businesses with women in top roles and broad diversity policies generally saw lower earnings volatility and higher returns on equity.“There is clear evidence that having women on boards provides broader perspectives,” agrees Christopher Greenwald, head of sustainable investment research at UBS Asset Management. “It is important to have an effective and well-managed board with a range of skillsets [and] range of perspectives to question management in the long-term interest of shareholders.”Yet very few companies in the US disclose the ethnic make-up of their boards, according to John Roe, head of ISS Analytics.The company compiles its own data based on assessments of corporate boards. It shows that about 15.1 per cent of S&P 500 board seats were held by someone non-white in 2018, up from 13 per cent five years earlier. By contrast, census data show minorities make up roughly two-fifths of the US population. Smaller companies have fewer still. Just 8.5 per cent of board seats at small-cap companies in the S&P 600 are held by minorities, versus 7 per cent in 2013.In the UK, meanwhile, 8 per cent of FTSE 100 board seats were held by people of colour in 2017, against 14 per cent in the broader population.The New York City Comptroller, the chief fiscal officer of the city, has taken a direct approach. It asked the boards of 151 companies to detail their demographic breakdown, including sexual orientation, race and age.Generally, of companies that already provide diversity data, most tend to detail their board’s age and ethnicity. Some companies, however, such as insurer and asset manager Prudential Financial, and electric utility operator Edison International, have started to include sexual orientation data in their breakdowns.Investors often have to turn to alternative sources to find out what companies are doing to promote diversity. Some look at how companies score on the Human Rights Campaign’s annual equality ranking — a scorecard for how groups are faring on policies — or seek news reports that highlight harassment and discrimination at a given company.“The data is a challenge,” says Linda Giuliano, head of responsible investment at AllianceBernstein. “Do people want to be [asked about] their sexual orientation? . . . It creates a real dilemma.“It matters . . . but on the other hand it doesn’t feel right that we have to get that personal about an individual. ”Asset managers are trying to establish more sophisticated methods to guide their investment decisions. Kurt Summers, the treasurer of Chicago who manages the city’s $8bn investment portfolio, together with his team scores each investment decision across 200 factors relating to diversity, the environment and corporate governance. The data come from index providers such as MSCI as well as via its own research.Chicago and several other pension funds have told their Wall Street counterparts how they select investments. “You have the entire broker-dealer community taking notice and adjusting their market pitches based on what we and other . . . institutional investors are saying are [our] priorities,” Mr Summers says.“You have the ability to have a significant market impact, more so than any individual conversation with a company.”
30;STT;State Street Corp;2018-10-15T03:00:02Z;ETF industry’s record-breaking growth streak in danger of ending;;New business growth has slowed markedly for most of the leading providers of exchange traded funds this year even before the sell-off across global equity markets gathered pace last week.Net inflows for BlackRock have fallen by half to $85.8bn in the first nine months of 2018, compared with the same period last year, according to data provided by ETFGI, the London-based consultancy.New ETF business growth for Vanguard — which suffered disruptions to customer services on Wednesday of last week due to problems with its website and phone lines — has dropped by about a third to $68bn.State Street, the third largest ETF manager, is on track for another disappointing year after a lacklustre showing in 2017, which was only saved by a stampede by investors into US equities in the fourth quarter.Two exceptions stand out in the US. Charles Schwab, which has aggressively engaged in the ETF price war against rival managers, has seen a rise of 23 per cent in new ETF business to $22bn so far this year.Chicago-based First Trust has also managed to punch above its weight with inflows of $12.8bn so far this year, surpassing the $9.4bn gathered over the whole of 2017.Technical analysts at Société Générale have pointed out that the S&P 500 index is now trading close to critical multiyear support levels, reflecting uncertainty about whether the US market will stage a rebound or move lower.Investors have also been pulling money so far this year from ETFs that track European equity markets. This has strengthened the headwinds facing Paris-based Lyxor, the third largest player in the European ETF market, which has seen net new ETF inflows drop by 85 per cent so far this year to just $1.3m. DWS, the asset management business majority-owned by Deutsche Bank, has fared better with inflows running so far this year at a similar pace to 2017.As a result, the prospect of a fifth consecutive record-breaking year in 2018 for overall ETF industry growth appears to be increasingly unlikely.
31;STT;State Street Corp;2018-10-10T11:56:36Z;US small-cap stocks stutter on debt concerns;Leverage levels leave companies exposed to interest rate rises;Shares of small companies are lagging behind their larger counterparts on Wall Street as investors’ concerns shift from trade tensions to debt levels.A jump in yields on US Treasuries to a seven-year high, amid increasing signs of economic strength, has rippled through the US stock market. While the S&P 500, an index of large multinationals’ stocks, was off 1.5 per cent over the past week, the Russell 2000 index of small capitalisation stocks was down almost double that.“One of our biggest concerns around small-caps is their leverage,” said Jill Carey Hall, senior equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “That is now increasingly in focus given rising interest rates.”Leverage levels are higher for small-caps versus large-caps and roughly half the debt of companies in the Russell 2000 pays a floating rate versus about a quarter for S&P 500, she said.Bryan Reilly, a managing director at CIBC Private Wealth Management, added: “Despite higher interest rates typically being good for small-caps, leverage is very elevated and some investors may worry that [high-yield bond] spreads widen, which could raise the cost of funding for smaller companies.”Rising rates on the back of a strong economy can otherwise underpin small-caps, which tend to be US-focused.Investors also said that large-caps were bigger beneficiaries of easing trade tensions after a revamped Nafta deal  was arranged. Small-caps had outperformed earlier this year on concerns about global trade.“Small, more domestically oriented companies would stand to benefit if there is an increase in domestic production as a result of trade tariffs,” said Matthew Bartolini at State Street Global Advisors.
32;STT;State Street Corp;2018-09-29T04:00:00Z;BlackRock and State Street weigh in on debate over regulating ETFs;;Asset managers have sounded a warning over proposals designed to help investors better understand trading costs for exchange traded funds as US regulators look to strengthen rules governing the $3.6tn domestic industry. The industry broadly supports the call by the Securities and Exchange Commission for greater disclosure of transaction costs, but providers including BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) disagree with the regulator over how these should be calculated and who should be the responsible party.ETFs and the cost of investing in them have come under scrutiny from regulators worldwide following the rapid growth of the industry.The SEC proposals “show a level of maturity in the US ETF market,” said Jennifer Choi, chief counsel at the Investment Company Institute, the association that represents US asset managers, who control $29.7tn in assets.The proposal calls for more disclosure over bid-ask spreads, which is the difference between what buyers and sellers of a particular ETF are willing to pay. This gap can create trading costs for investors.The SEC proposed in June that ETF providers disclose the median bid-ask spread for each product’s most recent fiscal year as well as offer interactive calculators to allow prospective buyers to compare these costs between investments.The regulator invited the industry for a response by October 1.BlackRock, SSGA and the ICI argue, however, that the data in the regulator’s suggested metric would be out of date.“The median bid-ask spread for the most recent fiscal year is not a particularly useful data point for investors, as it may not be representative of the trading experience of investors due to the staleness of the data,” BlackRock said.Noel Archard, global head of ETF product for SSGA, said: “You might not be comparing apples to apples.”BlackRock and SSGA want the SEC to consider using an average measure relating to a more recent time, such as the past 30 days, while the ICI has suggested using a hypothetical example.The ICI also said providing information on bid-ask spreads only became possible by assessing market data. It could not be controlled by ETF providers themselves.The three also argue that online trading cost calculators should be provided by a third party such as a data provider or even the SEC, citing the costs and complexities of such a tool. “If the commission nevertheless wishes to move forward with an interactive calculator . . . we believe it should be located in one central location,” the ICI said in its letter to the SEC.Bid-ask spreads are typically not disclosed by ETF providers. Information on them is available from the brokers and wealth managers, which distribute the products but the details provided vary.The SEC has also proposed lowering the barriers for bringing products to market by allowing the creation of some ETFs without its prior approval.The body approved its first ETF in 1992. The US has become the biggest market for the products, accounting for more than 70 per cent of the $5tn assets invested in them globally, according to data provider ETFGI. However, the US industry has been covered by a patchwork of rules that the SEC is trying to combine into one set of regulations.“The proposed rule and form amendments are designed to create a consistent, transparent, and efficient regulatory framework for ETFs and to facilitate greater competition and innovation among ETFs,” the SEC said in June.
33;STT;State Street Corp;2018-09-10T04:00:03Z;State Street chief takes aim at high-cost index providers;;The former boss of State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third biggest asset manager, has called the decision by Fidelity, its Boston rival, to sell no-fee funds a “shot across the bow” to index providers.Ron O’Hanley, who led SSGA for three years and is due to take over as chief executive of the wider State Street group at the end of the year, said the high-profile launch put the cost of using brand-name benchmarks into sharp relief.“It’s a reaction to the fees that the index providers continue to impose on money managers and investors,” he told FTfm. “If you look at where costs have been coming down, it’s the management fees. Where they have not is the cost of using indices.”In the global price war that has gripped the passive fund management industry, the biggest fee cutters are running out of costs to slash. Several managers have blamed this on the high fees they are forced to pay index providers for using their benchmarks.Fidelity Investments, the $2.5tn fund group, launched two index funds last month that would give investors no-fee exposure to US and international stocks. The announcement caused the shares of its rivals to dive.Fidelity was able to create such low-cost vehicles by shunning external index providers such as S&P, MSCI and FTSE Russell, and instead using proprietary benchmarks.SSGA, the $2.7tn investment group, relaunched its own range of ultra low-cost exchange traded funds last year, with expense ratios dropped to as low as 3 basis points, or 3 cents for every $100 invested.The company also brought out three proprietary indices focused on US large-cap companies, US small-caps and the total US equity market. It replaced FTSE Russell as the benchmark provider on three of its ETFs.Mr O’Hanley, who joined SSGA from Fidelity in 2015, said he expected to see more ETF providers launching in-house benchmarks and replacing external providers for certain products as the industry courted cost-conscious retail investors.“If you are a retail client who is a long-term investor in the markets, you are looking for exposure to the US large-cap market, not necessarily the S&P 500,” he said of the most popular index of large US stocks. Inclusion in the S&P 500 is determined by the benchmark’s selection committee and it has some notable absentees, such as Tesla, the electric car company.But Mr O’Hanley added that many institutional investors, such as hedge funds, were willing to pay slightly higher costs in order to invest in ETFs based on certain indices as they wanted exposure to a defined set of stocks.Such investors would continue to be the biggest users of SSGA’s flagship product, SPY, the world’s largest ETF that tracks the S&P 500.Last year the Financial Times reported on plans by several of the biggest ETF providers to launch an industry “co-operative” to create stock market benchmarks that would rival those offered by index providers.
34;STT;State Street Corp;2018-09-10T03:01:34Z;Asian funds are slow off the mark in global market;Regional providers predict strong growth from a low base;"Assets invested in exchange traded funds and products regularly hit new highs. BlackRock, the world’s biggest fund manager, forecasts that the value of ETFs could reach $12tn globally by 2023, up from about $5tn today.The US has blazed a trail of interest in the market. The country had ETF and ETP assets of $3.6tn at the end of July out of a global total of $5.12tn according to data from ETFGI, while assets in Europe were $828bn. Asia, perhaps surprisingly given the pace of economic growth in China and financial reform in the region, languishes in third place.The most commonly cited reason for this lag is the way funds are sold across Asia. Distribution across the region is typically based on commission-linked sales, which do not favour products such as ETFs, which are openly traded on stock exchanges and designed as a lower-cost product.ETFs have flourished in markets such as the US, UK and Australia, which have large numbers of financial advisers that do not benefit from recommending higher-cost products for their clients.“Distribution here in Asia is still very captive. The move to a fee-based distribution model is happening, but it is very slow compared with the US and Europe,” says Axel Lomholt, head of the international ETF business at Vanguard. Matt Arnold, head of ETF strategy and research across Asia-Pacific at State Street Global Advisors, agrees. “No doubt, it has been a barrier,” he says.There are signs of change. The emergence of large European wealth managers, keen to establish bigger footprints in the region in order to capture wealthy clients, should also hasten progress, says Susan Chan, head of ETF and index investing for Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. “It is definitely becoming more accommodating,” she says.ETF providers also think that more emphasis on transparency will shine a light on product costs which, in turn, should favour ETFs.Progress is slow, however. “It is a big challenge for us to expand to retail investors,” says Koei Imai, head of ETFs at Nikko Asset Management, whose business primarily serves institutional investors.The Japanese group recently launched a yen-hedged ETF domiciled in Tokyo for investors to manage currency risk when they invest in the US. Aimed at smaller banks that have fewer resources to hedge than their larger peers, Nikko’s goal is to broaden the range of clients to whom ETFs would seem attractive.One fact blurring the picture is that many Asia-based investors use ETFs in their portfolios but do so for products domiciled outside the region. Obtaining data on this is difficult, says Jackie Choy, director of ETF research in Asia for Morningstar. He has, for instance, heard of pension funds in Korea and Taiwan using US-domiciled ETFs in their international allocations, investments that will then be recorded as part of US ETF assets under management rather than categorised as Asian. Sometimes foreign-domiciled products can be cheaper than local ones.“US-domiciled ETFs and Ucits [EU-approved alternative investments funds] play a big role here in the region,” says Mr Lomholt. “We know it is significant.”Despite access to products globally, a strong local ETF market is still desirable. Investment groups China Asset Management and Samsung Asset Management of South Korea are among those that have recently launched ETFs in the region.The US is one country, one system …Asia is many countries and many systems“The good thing about having a local ETF market is that mom and pop investors can buy ETFs more easily,” Mr Arnold says. “You have the full suite of asset classes available to you.” Mr Imai notes that investors that choose products in foreign jurisdictions also run the risk of double taxation.One fillip to Asia-domiciled assets could be ETF Connect, a trading link that would give Chinese investors access to Hong Kong-listed exchange traded funds and give Hong Kong investors a route to buy ETFs listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. This would remove another barrier to increased ETF take-up: numerous different regulatory regimes across the region.“The US is one country, one system; Europe, many countries and one system,” says Mr Choy, referring to Ucits, the EU regulatory framework that means a fund can be domiciled in one country but sold across the bloc. “Asia is many countries and many systems.”ETF Connect would fortify trading schemes connecting Shanghai and Shenzhen with Hong Kong that are aimed at eroding investment barriers between Hong Kong and mainland China.Market participants believe this ETF Connect link could be launched within months but are sceptical whether it will immediately pave the way for a massive boost to locally domiciled ETF assets.Ms Chan describes herself as “cautiously optimistic” but warns that the scheme will be more complicated than opening a stock exchange. “People will want to see how it opens, how it operates,” she adds.“It holds a lot of promise,” says Mr Arnold, but he also cautions there is currently a lack of detail. “We definitely need more information.”"
35;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
36;STT;State Street Corp;2018-09-01T10:00:00Z;Taking the helm: why asset management bosses are getting the top jobs;;"The journey to the top of a global finance company is straightforward if recent hires are anything to go by: simply take over the asset management division, launch profitable products, open up new markets and wait for the chief executive role to become available.From State Street in Boston and Macquarie in Sydney to Investec in London and Johannesburg, financial services conglomerates have promoted asset management heads to run the entire company.Some commentators say this is due to how these executives helped build their businesses. Others say it is more to do with their skills in risk and people management. Another factor is how asset management is now a key part of global finance.“Asset managers are right at the centre of a modern capitalist economy,” says Keith Skeoch, co-chief executive of Standard Life Aberdeen.He led the investment business of Standard Life, a UK insurer, for 11 years before taking control of the group in 2015 and merging with Aberdeen Asset Management two years later.Martin Gilbert, his co-chief executive at SLA, says: “When we both started in asset management it’s hard to believe what a cottage industry it was. Asset managers were the poor relations. Now it’s a huge worldwide business.”The latest spate of promotions for asset management bosses began last November when State Street Corporation said Ronald O’Hanley would succeed Jay Hooley as chief executive at the end of 2018. Mr O’Hanley had run State Street’s $2.7tn asset management business since 2015.In February, Investec said Hendrik du Toit, head of fund management, would become joint chief executive of the Anglo-South African group from next month.Shemara Wikramanayake is the most recent asset management head to reach the top. She will become chief executive of Macquarie, the Australian financial services group, having run its asset management business for a decade.Other asset management bosses mentioned as potential group CEO material include Mary Callahan Erdoes, head of JPMorgan’s $1.7tn asset management business, and Euan Munro, who launched the SLA Gars fund and runs Aviva’s £348bn ($450bn) investment division.Mr Skeoch is not the only executive to be promoted from running the investment business of an insurer to leading the company. A decade ago Tim Breedon did the same at Legal & General.The promotions reflect the role of investment management divisions in running insurers’ assets. These units went on to manage money for clients and grew to become large and profitable parts of the wider business. More recently insurers have looked to spin off their asset management arms.Mr O’Hanley, a fund management veteran, agrees with Mr Skeoch and Mr Gilbert that the industry has grown in importance during his career, which is a factor in recent promotions.“Over 20 years, asset managers have gone from being a niche in financial services […] to being an integral part of the broad provision of capital to markets,” he says.He points out that the investment industry has become more prominent since the financial crisis, after which banks and insurers pulled back capital markets activities, giving asset managers a bigger role.Sarah Dudney, client partner at the Buy-Side Club, an investment industry recruitment company, says the asset management bosses who have been promoted have three sets of skills: the ability to drive profits, certain psychological traits and outside interests.On profitability, Ms Dudney points to Ms Wikramanayake’s 10-year stint as head of Macquarie’s A$495bn ($364bn) asset management division. In this time, the business became the world’s largest infrastructure investor and a significant driver of the group’s earnings, contributing a third of net profit. Last financial year, operating profits for asset management reached A$1.7bn — up 10 per cent on the previous 12 months.“She built a business that could not be replicated easily,” says Ms Dudney. “She focused on where the profit was.”Investment bosses gain a broad outlook from running a business that has a global operation, even if the wider company is domestically focused, says Dean Frankle, a principal at Boston Consulting Group.Not all fund management leaders can run the wider organisation, he claims. “It’s more correlation than causation,” he says of recent appointments. “It comes down to individuals being in the right place at the right time.”At Standard Life Investments, Mr Skeoch oversaw the development of the flagship Global Absolute Return Strategies (Gars) fund. Despite its recent problems, for a while it was one of Europe’s best-selling funds. Its initial success boosted SLI and raised Mr Skeoch’s profile.Ms Dudney says the same ability to create profit can be seen in Mr du Toit, who focused on high-margin products such as emerging market debt funds at Investec, and Mr O’Hanley, who has embraced innovation and technology at SSGA. “State Street will be one of the first companies to be fully automated,” Ms Dudney says.When it comes to the leaders’ personalities, Ms Dudney says all “are intuitively skilled with people”.Mr Skeoch agrees that the ability to forge relationships with staff is crucial for executives who lead investment divisions, which typically have fewer but better-paid staff than other sectors. “It’s a human capital business,” he says. “One of the biggest roles is managing people.”The third trait that Ms Dudney says the new bosses have in common is outside interests, or “hinterland”, as she terms it.Mr du Toit is a marathon runner and likes endurance sports, while Mr O’Hanley is an ocean sailor. His yacht, Privateer, came second in last year’s Rolex Fastnet Race. Ms Wikramanayake, meanwhile, is involved with the Serendipity Scholarship Fund, which helps gifted children from developing countries to study in Australia and New Zealand.Ms Dudney says outside interests give executives a broad perspective. “They all have quite a significant life outside work.”State Street’s decision to promote Mr O’Hanley can be viewed as a reflection of the size of the bank’s fund management operations.Though only the 14th-largest lender by assets in the US, State Street’s investment business is the third-biggest in the world. For years it ran the most-successful exchange traded funds business, though it has lost ground to BlackRock and Vanguard.Before joining the company in 2015, Mr O’Hanley was president of asset management and corporate services at Fidelity Investments, SSGA’s Boston rival, having previously run BNY Mellon Asset Management.He says his experience as a one-time client of State Street made him a strong contender for the top job.About 80 per cent of State Street revenues come from asset servicing, working for other asset managers and owners; the rest is from investment management. “In some respects it was quite natural that one criteria for choosing the next CEO was someone who had been a client of those services,” he adds.Cyrus Taraporevala has taken over from Mr O’Hanley as chief executive of SSGA, having followed his predecessor from Fidelity in 2016.In July, State Street announced a $2.6bn cash deal to buy Charles River Development, an investment management services provider. State Street will use the acquisition to improve its technology and data systems for clients. The deal will conclude at the end of the year as Mr O’Hanley takes the reins.For almost 40 years Investec, the banking group, has been led by founders Stephen Koseff, Bernard Kantor and Glynn Burger. In February it said it was shifting control to a new generation, including making asset management boss Hendrik du Toit joint chief executive.The change from Mr Koseff to Mr du Toit and Fani Titi, group chairman since 2011, will take place next month.Mr du Toit was a university economics lecturer before starting an investment career with Old Mutual. He moved to Investec in 1991 and set up the asset management division, now a global fund business with more than £100bn of assets.Having led Investec Asset Management from London, Mr du Toit will continue to be based in the UK, while Mr Titi will work in South Africa.Investec’s board had been working on the succession plan since November 2015 and the pair were chosen for their “good combination of skills”, Mr Koseff said at the time of the announcement.Macquarie opted for a longtime insider when it chose Ms Wikramanayake to replace chief executive Nicholas Moore in November.Ms Wikramanayake has been with the Australian bank for more than 30 years, and has held positions in nine cities across six countries. Following a stint as a corporate lawyer, her Macquarie career has included advisory and infrastructure roles, as well as establishing offices.Macquarie, known as the “millionaire factory” due to its high executive remuneration, paid Ms Wikramanayake A$18.9m last year, making her one of the highest-earning executives in global asset management.Under her leadership, the investment business became profitable but courted controversy in Britain over its ownership of Thames Water, which last year was fined £20m for dumping raw sewage into the Thames.Ms Wikramanayake has tried to avoid the limelight. In an interview with FTfm last year, she said: “I really value privacy. Anonymity is such a luxury and I don’t think everyone appreciates that.”Keeping a low profile will be a hard task when she joins the top table of global banking chief executives in November."

The withdrawal helped to push the net outflow from European equities funds to $166m and its 25th consecutive week of redemption.“When it comes to the UK, there is a lot of concern about what is going to be happening with Brexit — the chance of there being a no-deal or a hard Brexit — the impact could be significant from day to day getting goods from the EU to more operational issues around trading securities,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors.While capped by Brexit concerns this week, European funds have been dogged for the past several months by weaker economic growth compared with the US — where the economy and corporations are enjoying a boost from tax cuts and other stimulus — as well as political concerns around the rise of populism in Italy.Elsewhere, investors’ conviction around US equities solidified as indicated by a $7.2bn net inflow to these funds, the highest amount in 11 weeks, and a rise in benchmark indices such as the S&P 500 to fresh all-time highs.“A lot of investors are playing offence when they can and defence when they need to,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors. “US equity right now is the best place to play offence. The US is still benefiting from a significant amount of stimulus. GDP is above 4 per cent, unemployment is below 4 per cent and earnings growth above 20 per cent for two consecutive quarters.”Investors also drew comfort this week from a US bilateral trade deal with Mexico to revamp Nafta, even if it remains unclear whether Canada, the trade pact’s third partner, would sign up to the revised agreement and what the outcome meant for US trade relations with China.Investor appetite for emerging markets, where funds have seen significant outflows this year, returned, but the rebound may be shortlived given a flare-up of economic turmoil in Argentina on Thursday, a day after EPFR’s reporting period.Emerging market equity funds took in $404m, only their second inflow during the past 15 weeks, and emerging market bond funds eked out a $46m intake, snapping a four-week outflow streak.“There has not been a fundamental reason why news on Argentina or Turkey would result in a sell-off or rally in emerging markets assets whereas we have seen a lot of that,” Mr Gokhman said, arguing that the two countries represent a small amount of the emerging markets universe, especially when compared with Asian countries.“It is sentiment-driven buying and selling.”

They complain that we are misusing our rights as shareholders to enforce arbitrary political or social “values” because we raise environmental, social and governance concerns with the boards of the companies in which we invest.This completely misrepresents the mission of State Street Global Advisors and other large index fund managers. We seek long-term value for millions of ordinary investors in a world that has become increasingly obsessed with short-term results. That goal, not some political agenda, is why we have developed a rigorous, research-based shareholder engagement programme. We raise all kinds of issues with boards that might materially impact their company’s ability to generate sustainable returns over the long haul.While our active funds can sell a company if we disagree with its executives, our index funds cannot choose the shares in which they invest. We are essentially permanent capital and cannot turn the S&P 500 into the S&P 499. That means we need to take a long-term perspective on behalf of our clients. At a time when some activist shareholders are keen on extracting short-term profits from companies, we provide a healthy and necessary counterweight.Our primary fiduciary obligation to our investors is to maximise the probability of attractive long-term returns. Flows into index-based strategies have increased so dramatically over the past few years that we must take this responsibility more seriously than ever. Millions of individual investors count on the low-cost access to markets around the world provided by exchange traded funds and other trackers. This has democratised access to markets that were once available and affordable only to larger institutional investors.We carefully select the issues we focus on with companies, based on rigorous research into their impact on investment performance. For example, numerous studies show that diversity at the board level leads to better decision making, fewer reputational crises and ultimately better returns. This is the reason why we placed the Fearless Girl statue on Wall Street and issued specific guidance to boards to take steps to improve diversity. Performance was our motivation, not politics. This is just one example of how we seek to maximise transparency around our views, the research underpinning them, and our voting intentions. Others can be found in our new 2017 asset stewardship report that provides details on our proxy voting and engagement on thousands of management and shareholder proposals in 82 different countries across the globe.In addition, while we will use the data and analytics provided by proxy advisers, we never outsource our voting decisions and we urge other institutional investors not to do so. These issues are too important to outsource and they are growing more complex.Increasingly, our clients are pushing for more clarity on non-traditional investment issues. They want to know how companies are incorporating climate risk into their long-term strategy; whether they are adopting best practices around corporate governance, board quality and pay policies; how they are adapting to technology disruptions that could threaten their industries.We need only look to recent corporate scandals around poor internal controls to remind us of the importance of active shareholder engagement.Far from injecting politics into boardrooms, we believe our focus on active stewardship in a rapidly changing and complex world is more important than ever for ensuring healthy public markets, resilient economic growth and shared prosperity. We are creating long-term value; not imposing values.The writer is president and chief executive officer of State Street Global AdvisorsRecognise the value of engagement activities / From Robin Hindle Fisher, London, UK"

Revenue in the three months to June rose 8 per cent year-on-year to $3bn. Net income rose 20 per cent to $698m.

41;STT;State Street Corp;2018-07-16T03:00:37Z;Trade war fears blunt growth in global ETF industry;Inflows into exchange traded products fall more than a third to $223bn in first half;State Street suffered net outflows of more than $7bn from its exchange traded fund arm in June as fears about a global trade war blunted growth across the ETF industry in the first half of 2018.President Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on imports from China, Europe and Canada has caused weakness across many stock markets. This has led to a marked slowdown in new business for asset managers globally.Worldwide inflows into ETFs (funds and products) dropped to $223bn in the first half of 2018, down more than a third on the same period last year, according to ETFGI, a data provider. The sharp decline in growth comes after four consecutive years of record inflows into ETFs, which have attracted the bulk of new money in the global asset management industry.Hope of a swift resolution to trade tensions have faded, prompting warnings from analysts.“Suddenly the world is facing the most serious outbreak of protectionism since the 1930s,” said Dario Perkins, a managing director at TS Lombard, the London-based economic consultancy. “Protectionism didn’t cause the Great Depression but it certainly prolonged it.”Investors have pulled billions from funds linked to emerging markets and European equities, which are seen as vulnerable to damage from a trade war.State Street, the New York-listed bank, registered outflows of $7.2bn from its ETFs last month alone, dragging this business into negative territory by the end of the first half.BlackRock also weathered heavy ETF outflows of more than $5bn in June. The world’s largest asset manager has attracted $52.7bn in new ETF business this year, down 63 per cent on the first six months of 2017.Christopher Harris, an analyst with Wells Fargo in New York, said overall new business growth for BlackRock was running below the company’s 5 per cent target, due mainly to the slowdown in ETF inflows.Wells Fargo has trimmed its 12-month target for BlackRock shares, which were trading at just over $508 on Friday, from $550 to $545.Wei Li, head of iShares Emea investment strategy at BlackRock, said investors were making greater efforts to build resilience into portfolios as a result of the combination of trade tension and moves by US and European central banks to normalise monetary policy.“Gold ETFs have attracted steady inflows until very recently even though the price hasn’t performed strongly this year and there has been a huge appetite for US government bond ETFs following increases in short-term rates,” said Ms Li.New ETF business for Pennsylvania-based Vanguard, the nearest rival to BlackRock, dropped 48 per cent to just over $43bn in the first half.WisdomTree, the New York-listed manager, has also been hit by first-half withdrawals of $4.2bn. WisdomTree’s shares have fallen 28 per cent this year.In Europe, Amundi, UBS and DWS, the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank, have all seen a slowdown in ETF growth after political tensions in the UK, Italy and Germany led investors to retreat from equity markets.ETF inflows for Lyxor, the Paris-based asset manager, sank 96 per cent to just $233m in the first half.“There were massive outflows from ETFs linked to European equities in the second quarter. These were offset in Europe by inflows into US equity, commodities and safe haven government bond ETFs,” said Arnaud Llinas, head of ETFs and indexing at Lyxor.Mr Llinas said he believed the slowdown was a blip. “We have never before had as many conversations with potential clients including private banks and wealth managers as so far this year,” he said.Investors’ appetite for risk, however, could be further damaged by Mr Trump’s decision this month to impose tariffs on an additional $200bn of imports from China.Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild wealth management, said it was an “uncomfortable but undeniable fact” that Mr Trump was right to complain about trade imbalances. “The US has been one of the most open economies on the planet and the playing field [on trade] is not level,” he said.

These include demonstrating to new staff during recruitment and induction that they welcome LGBT employees and encouraging senior managers to show support by participating in LGBT networks and events.A chief concern is ensuring that global asset managers with offices in the 73 countries where homosexuality is illegal are aware of local laws and attitudes, and provide support to employees who work or travel there.“Applying policies globally is undoubtedly a challenge as many countries are on different trajectories when it comes to issues such as gender diversity and LGBT,” said Pete Horrell, UK managing director at Fidelity International. “Of course none of this can be a substitute for any reforms governments should push forward themselves, but we definitely have a role.”The IA also recommended encouraging heterosexual colleagues to participate in LGBT networks and events at their employer as allies and that asset managers offer all employees training to broaden their understanding of LGBT issues.“Everyone should feel able to bring their whole selves to work,” said Chris Cummings, chief executive of the IA. “Whilst legislation over the past decade has rightly given LGBT+ colleagues the rights and protections others can enjoy, culture and preconceptions don’t always follow changes to the law.”Many fund managers have established LGBT and allied networks and have stepped up efforts to ensure areas such as parental leave and recruitment are unbiased according to gender or sexuality. Jupiter Asset Management and Man Group recently launched pride networks for employees.Those efforts have been more visible this month with some organisations, including Hermes Investment Management and the IA, using the colours of the rainbow flag in their online corporate logos. Schroders, the UK’s second-largest listed manager, also used the colours across the main doors of its offices in New York and London.“Everyone who visits us will see that support,” said Alex Ross-Parkinson, who works in Schroders’ intermediary business development team and who set up the group’s LGBT network three years ago.Both colleagues and clients attended his wedding two years ago but he said there was still work to be done throughout the industry as a whole to make LGBT employees more visible and comfortable with expressing their identities at work.“For our industry there is a long way to go” said Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes and leader of the company’s unity group.Financial services has a reputation for being a culturally traditional industry said Jess McNicholas, a managing director at State Street, meaning that visible gestures of support from colleagues are important. Employees at State Street can flag their status as “allies” on the group’s internal communications system.“To know there was a cohort of strong allies made them [employees] be more confident about being out in the workplace,” she said.Michael Mayer, who chairs the LGBT network at Legg Mason, said all employees need to be able to “[bring] their authentic selves to work every day”.Prejudice against non-heterosexual people is costly and damaging for organisations, said Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management.“A company that encourages staff to lie is not a great place to work. A company with a culture of dishonesty is not a great company to do business with,” he said. “An LGBT person who wastes time being careful what they say at work will be under stress. Stress makes people perform badly at work.”Additional reporting by Owen Walker
43;STT;State Street Corp;2018-06-28T09:00:27Z;US advisers shy away from newfangled ETFs;Why some investment veterans still prefer to stick to no-frills vanilla products;"As exchange traded funds grow in popularity, designers are devising new flavours of the investment vehicles in order to expand the marketplace.However, rather than embracing these new offerings, the registered investment advisers (RIAs) that have been the most enthusiastic about ETFs are content to stick with the classic hits that attracted them to the products in the first place.Passive index ETFs give investors cheap exposure to broad asset classes. They provide returns based on the performance of, say, the S&P 500 at a cost as low as a single basis point. Many investors have achieved good returns without the high fees associated with active mutual funds.Asset managers are now launching more sophisticated ETFs that track indices based on factors other than companies’ market capitalisation.Some advisers, though, remain cautious in their approach to such products. Herb Morgan is the chief investment officer for San Diego’s Efficient Market Advisors, a company that only uses ETFs. He puts all $4.3bn of his clients’ assets into passive index funds and is sceptical of newer types. “I have yet to see empirical data supporting alternative methods of indexing,” Mr Morgan says.I don’t like an active ETF because we want to make the management decision ourselvesMitch Reiner started investing in ETFs in the late 1990s at his Atlanta-based agency Capital Investment Advisors, where he is a managing partner. Nearly two decades on, “the fundamental way we use ETFs has not changed”, Mr Reiner says.Asset managers have launched a number of novel funds in the marketplace. These include so-called smart beta offerings (which track an index constructed using factors other than market capitalisation); inverse ETFs (which generate returns when a given market’s value decreases); and active products (which have an element of active management but with a lower fee).Fred Fern founded Los Angeles-based Churchill Management in 1963 and began investing in ETFs roughly a decade ago.His company tries to pick the winning sector within each market cycle and uses ETFs that focus on certain themes such as technology. “I don’t like an active ETF because we want to make the management decision ourselves,” he says.Yet ETF inflows continue to target the lowest-cost index products, such as the vanilla S&P 500 funds that have helped swell asset managers like Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors.Creative Planning, an advisory firm in a suburb of Kansas City, views ETFs as a long-term holding and does not actively trade them. “If an adviser is trading them all day, which many of them do, then they aren’t really any different than someone investing and holding an active mutual fund, results-wise,” says Peter Mallouk, president at Creative Planning.Indeed, many advisers say the draw of a simple index ETF is that it is passive. “By removing the active component, I lose the ability to beat the index, but I also lose the chance to lose against the index — which I think is more important,” Mr Morgan says.This is not to say that advisers are putting their clients’ money into an index and twiddling their thumbs, however. Advisers can attempt to improve their clients’ returns by allocating varying amounts to different indices within a portfolio — a process Mr Morgan calls “active beta management”.ETFs are catching up with mutual funds in the average investor’s vocabulary. “Up until 2013, 2014, we did need to explain what an ETF was,” says Marshal McReal, principal at Garde Capital in Seattle.With large managers such as Vanguard and BlackRock’s iShares running trillions of dollars in such funds, investors’ awareness of ETFs is likely to grow further still."
44;STT;State Street Corp;2018-06-16T04:00:37Z;Brexit contingencies: asset managers put plans into action;A third of big investment companies have opted for Dublin or Luxembourg;Asset managers are losing patience with politicians over the slow pace of Brexit negotiations, with several deciding it is better to assume the worst and fire the starting gun on their contingency plans.FTfm contacted more than 40 large asset managers with significant operations in the UK. A third outlined plans to beef up or move parts of their operation to Dublin or Luxembourg, both major fund management centres.For those still working on detail, the clock is ticking. The focus for the industry is on making a smooth move to deliver services to clients whatever happens, says Dan Waters, managing director at ICI Global, the trade body for international fund managers.“[We hope] there is a reasonable and workable financial services agreement,” he says. “But we don’t know what that will look like. The world is scary enough as it is.”According to the European Fund and Asset Management Association, the worst outcome is a “super hard” Brexit where there is no UK-EU deal and no co-operation partnerships in place.“This is so complicated,” says Peter De Proft, Efama director-general. “It would be helpful if as soon as possible we could know how business will need to adapt. Clarity and transparency is politely all we can ask for.”Among the groups to have firmed up their plans, Baring Asset Management, the $300bn US group, is to open a Dublin office, while Morgan Stanley Investment Management has said it will expand its business in the Irish capital.Many smaller companies are, however, scrambling to finalise their arrangements. A wave of applications for licences has been submitted to authorities in Ireland and Luxembourg. Most are from smaller fund managers exploring their options.The Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, the Luxembourg financial regulator, and the Central Bank of Ireland have been swamped by applications, say market sources. Neither regulator would comment.In the two years since the vote to leave the EU, numerous asset managers have stuck patiently to the line that they need clarity on a final deal before committing to changes.The tone is hardening with frustrated managers saying they have to act now to protect clients in the event of a hard Brexit.“There may be a transition deal later this year. This could buy the industry more time but we mustn’t become complacent,” said Dave Mace, who runs the Luxembourg branch of MFS, the $492bn US fund group.Stuart Dunbar, partner at Baillie Gifford, said: “It is future-proofing. We have to look after our European-domiciled clients.” The Edinburgh-based £178bn manager has not finalised its plans but it told FTfm that it will establish a management company “with substance” within the EU before next March.“Because we have no certainty we have to take action to secure our relationships with our European clients,” Mr Dunbar said. “If you are going to do it, you have to do it with commitment. You want the office to feel like a functioning office and the cost is not insignificant.”Jonathan Greenwold, general counsel at Aspect Capital, the $7.3bn London hedge fund, said it was “a case of planning for the worst but hoping for best”.“Brexit planning has been challenging given the politically driven and therefore unpredictable nature of the discussions,” he said.Legg Mason, the $754bn US investment manager which is preparing to open a Dublin office this year, echoed the view that it would prepare for a worst-case scenario. “Continued uncertainty around the future of some of the delegation and passporting of products and services has meant that, while remaining flexible, we have to take action now,” said Ed Venner, chief operating officer of global distribution.Hermes Investment Management, which was recently part-sold to Federated Investors, has plans to open a management company in Dublin. “Of course, we keep a keen eye on the ever-evolving political landscape and look for clarity and certainty from the treasury, the regulators and other key bodies [around Brexit]”, said Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive.“However, we recognise that we must make appropriate contingency plans in the absence of certainty, in order to ensure to the extent possible that we remain able to manage our clients’ assets in line with their expectations of us.”Baring Asset Management, the $300bn US group, is to open a Dublin office and hire five people.Hermes Investment Management already has a £9bn Ucits range domiciled in Ireland. It will establish a management company there and appoint senior staff to oversee governance and risk management. It will also open sales branches in Germany and Denmark.Legal & General Investment Management was given authorisation for a management company in May, which will be operational this year, The £983bn manager is recruiting.Legg Mason already operates self-managed Ucits and AIFM funds in Ireland. Its Dublin office will open this year — with more staff. It has applied for a Ucits licence and anticipates asking for new permissions “depending on how Brexit negotiations unfold”.Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the $469bn US fund business, will establish an office in Dublin to complement its offshore operations there. It has made several applications to the regulator. Luxembourg will remain its largest base in the EU.Principal Global Investors has set up a Dublin company. Its fund platform is already domiciled there. “The main challenge with Brexit has been the contingency planning because we don’t know what the rules will be,” says chief executive Jim McCaughan.Standard Life Aberdeen said in February that it would establish an investment and distribution business in Dublin. The £646bn group already has funds domiciled in both the city and Luxembourg. It is applying for a licence to become a Mifid investment company.State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest investment company with $2.8tn under management, has sought approval to make its Amsterdam, Brussels and Milan offices branches of its Irish entity. It expects Brexit to have a limited effect on its European operation.Columbia Threadneedle Investments is planning to beef up its Luxembourg team with “a handful” of new employees, focused on risk, client management and oversight. The £366bn group is in the process of applying to the regulator to expand its Luxembourg-based management company. It plans to transfer 20 funds in its Oeic range to the Sicav.Janus Henderson Investors opened an office in Luxembourg in 1985. The £265bn group will move “a number” of oversight roles there. It already has three Ucits fund ranges, two in Luxembourg one in Ireland.Jupiter Asset Management is establishing an office and management company in Luxembourg and says recruiting staff is “well advanced”. It has applied to the regulator for approval for a management company, which will be a Ucits management company and an alternative investment fund manager.M&G is setting up “a new legal corporate structure” in Luxembourg that will be staffed by about 30 additional hires in legal, compliance and risk roles. It has already received regulatory approval from the CSSF, the Luxembourg regulator. The group says this will be up and running before the UK’s exit from the EU.MFS already has a management company in Luxembourg, which it plans to beef up and use as its European hub post-Brexit. It will expand its team there from seven to about 20. It has applied to the regulator for permission to conduct more investment management services.T Rowe Price, the $1tn US manager, has an office in Luxembourg and is in the process of seeking permission to extend its current activities. London will remain its main office in Emea with the creation of a new management company.It will not move jobs from London but may add to staff in Luxembourg as its business develops.The remainder of the managers with a big presence in the UK fall into two camps: those that cannot yet speak publicly about their plans and those that decline to provide information.The former include Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh manager, which says it will set up a management company with substance within the EU by the end of next March.BlackRock, the world’s biggest manager, has still to make final decisions about its post-Brexit business. It believes clients’ interests will be best served by keeping its options open for as long as possible.First State, the Australian group, already operates pooled funds out of Dublin. Its plans for an EU-domiciled subsidiary management company are at an advanced stage.Goldman Sachs Asset Management has still to decide whether its EU management company will be in Ireland or Luxembourg but it is talking to regulators. It expects to move “a small number of people”.Man Group will take “the necessary steps” to avoid disruption. It already has licensed entities in the Netherlands, Ireland and Liechtenstein. It says it may “enhance its EU footprint as regulations become clearer”.Another manager that has not yet finalised its Brexit strategy is Old Mutual Global Investors. The company serves its European clients primarily via its Ireland-domiciled fund range.Those that declined to provide information included BlueBay, Franklin Templeton, GAM, HSBC Asset Management, Investec, Northern Trust, SEI Investments, Vanguard and Wellington.AllianzGI, which manages €513bn, says its strength in Europe and growing business in the UK put it in a good position to deal with Brexit. Chief executive Andreas Utermann works from London.Europe’s largest fund manager, Amundi, has its HQ in France and does not expect to change how it services clients. Its funds are available to UK investors via Sicav feeders.Aspect Capital, the $7.3bn UK hedge fund, has offices in London, Connecticut and Hong Kong. Another office in the EU is unlikely but it would consider using a third-party platform.Aviva Investors, which manages £353bn, says it will serve EU clients after Brexit via its Luxembourg Sicav range. It already has a presence in France and Ireland.Axa Investment Managers has fund management centres in Paris and London. It has UK-domiciled fund ranges catering for British clients as well as Luxembourg and Ireland ranges for cross-border clients.BMO Global, the Canadian owner of F&C Asset Management, says there is no need for substantial changes.BNY Mellon Investment Management, along with its subsidiary Insight Investment, the UK’s second-biggest manager by assets, and its boutiques including Newton, will use their legal entities in Luxembourg and Ireland to service EU clients. They have applied to regulators for extra permissions.Capital Group, the $1.7tn US investment house, says its operations in Geneva, London and Luxembourg give it enough heft in Europe to compete post-Brexit.Invesco, which owns Invesco Perpetual in the UK, has separate fund ranges for clients in different EU jurisdictions and client-relationship teams in various countries to meet local need.Fidelity International, the $255bn Bermuda-based asset manager, already has offices in Luxembourg and Dublin. It employs 920 people in Europe outside the UK. It has been hiring in its Dublin office, which employees more than 250 workers, but denied this was related to Brexit.JPMorgan Asset Management has operated in Luxembourg for more than 30 years, with $300bn invested in its 180 Luxembourg-domiciled funds. The office has 170 staff.Kames Capital, a subsidiary of Netherlands-based Aegon Asset Management, has had a Dublin operation since 2007 and sells to 16 European countries including the UK. Aegon has large offices in Frankfurt and Madrid.Swiss-owned Pictet Asset Management is watching Brexit talks closely, but feels it has enough offices to cope with any fallout.Pimco, the $1.8tn bond manager, has bases in London and Munich and funds domiciled in Ireland and Luxembourg. It does not expect significant disruption.About 80 per cent of Polar Capital’s £12bn assets are held in a Dublin Ucits umbrella fund. It expects to hire more people in the EU as part of its diversification strategy.Royal London Asset Management, the £113bn fund group, says it will not set up an office in the EU but provided no details.US manager Russell Investments has offices in Paris, Milan, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London, and two European fund ranges. The main one is domiciled in Ireland while it also has authorised funds in the UK.Schroders, the UK’s second-biggest listed fund group, employs more than 700 staff in nine EU offices outside the UK, including 250 in Luxembourg. The £447bn fund manager has obtained additional permissions across the EU, as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, to continue to serve European institutional clients.
45;STT;State Street Corp;2018-06-09T10:00:26Z;Funds ‘snowball’ means big firms can only get bigger;Increasing concentration of assets in megafunds leads to warning about volatility;The asset management snowball is in full roll. The industry’s largest funds are hurtling along, attracting billions of dollars of assets, while small competitors struggle to keep up.From mutual funds and exchange traded funds to private equity and other alternative vehicles, the story is the same: the biggest products are growing rapidly as assets are increasingly concentrated in the megafunds.The implications for the market and consumers are huge.“As investors entrust their money to fewer products, assets come under the control of fewer individuals, who ultimately make fewer but larger decisions,” said Warren Miller, chief executive of Flowspring, a US data analysis group focused on asset managers.“This will lead to increasing volatility in financial markets, particularly in bear markets. Given that the main drivers of this trend show no signs of abating, we expect concentration to continue increasing.”According to Flowspring, the largest 1 per cent of mutual funds manage 45 per cent of industry assets. That figure is 72 times larger than all the assets managed by the bottom half. This is the highest concentration in two decades and has increased dramatically since the financial crisis. In 2009, the amount managed by the top 1 per cent was just over 30 times that of the bottom half. The ratio was as low as 22:1 in 2006.Mr Miller pointed to the causes of this concentration.The largest managers already benefit from economies of scale and the ability to increase revenues while keeping fixed costs low. They are better positioned to cut fees, thus attracting more investors.These managers can afford to invest significantly in technology, which further reduces costs and improves performance through effective data analysis. They are also better placed to meet rising regulatory costs, which for can cripple smaller managers.The bigger the advantage enjoyed by larger players, the more they can invest in flagship products, leading to lower fees stronger performance and funds that are more attractive to investors. Mr Miller argued that a bigger driver of growth was the strong performance of the funds rather than their ability to scoop up assets.Some of Europe’s largest funds have grown at breakneck speed in the past year. Pimco’s GIS Income fund, for example, was Europe’s best-selling in 2017 and has doubled in size over the past year, thanks to €30bn inflows, according to Morningstar (it has suffered outflows in each of the past three months).Two other European giants, M&G’s €27bn Optimal Income fund and JPMorgan’s €25bn Global Income fund, have each grown by about 30 per cent.Sean Collins, chief economist at the Investment Company Institute, the global trade body, reported a big move into lower-cost products. His analysis showed that 77 per cent of assets are held in the cheapest quarter of mutual funds. “What that means for smaller funds is they need to do something to reduce their fees or they need to find an area that is underserved or where they have expertise.”ETFs, low-cost competitors to mutual funds, have also experienced significant growth in the cheapest products.Data from ETFGI, which tracks the industry, show that fewer than 7 per cent of ETFs charge 10 basis points or less, yet these products hold more than a third of total assets. More than half of ETF assets are in products charging 20bp or less.“Cost is a criteria people look at very early on in their decision making because it’s one of the easiest things to get data on,” said Deborah Fuhr, managing partner at ETFGI. “Like when buying cornflakes, if all the products look the same and there is little difference in quality, consumers tend to go for the cheapest.”The ETF market is dominated by three players: iShares by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street.Ms Fuhr said it was hard for newer players to compete when offering routine products. The world’s most popular ETF, State Street’s $265bn SPY, which tracks the S&P 500 index of the largest US companies, turned 25 this year. Competing products from iShares and Vanguard are the second and fourth largest ETFs.“There is a huge first-mover advantage in ETFs,” said Ms Fuhr. “It’s harder for firms that have me-too products to attract assets.”The concentration story is similar elsewhere. Data on alternative investment managers from the European Securities and Markets Authority, the EU watchdog, show a concentration of assets in the largest products.Just 2 per cent of alternative funds offered to European investors, including real estate, private equity, hedge funds and funds of funds, are above €1bn in size yet they manage about 46 per cent of Europe’s total alternative assets. By contrast, about 95 per cent of alternative funds are below €500m and they hold just 40 per cent of assets.The main driver for funds flowing into the largest alternative funds is institutional investors under pressure to put cash to work. Only the biggest managers are equipped to take on their significant allocations.Last year private equity funds raised $484bn globally, according to Preqin, the data provider. The last time it was near that level was 2007, when $414bn flowed into the industry.The fundraising has been heavily skewed towards big commitments made to large players. Apollo raised $25bn in just a few months to build the largest buyout fund, while CVC Capital Partners attracted €16bn.Preqin’s analysis showed that the average size of the largest private equity funds, those of more than $1bn, has grown to $2.8bn over the past decade. “The gaps between the haves and have-nots is widening,” said Christopher Elvin, head of private equity products at Preqin. “There is a pool of the very largest managers — and then there is everyone else.”He said much of the money raised by the largest private equity funds in recent years is recycled capital. “They are putting it back with managers who have already produced good returns and, in some cases, increasing allocations,” he added. “It’s a natural circle.”
46;STT;State Street Corp;2018-05-17T23:56:55Z;Loan funds attract new money as interest rates rise;Asset class enjoyed its strongest inflows in more than a year in the past week;Investors put more money into bank loan funds in the past week than at any time in more than a year, as rising interest rates increased the attraction of floating-rate assets over traditional bonds.Loan funds had net inflows of $925m in the week to Wednesday, the largest intake in 55 weeks, according to EPFR Global.The flows came in the same week that the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury hit a seven-year high above 3 per cent, and after shorter-term rates rose sharply this year in line with expectations of Federal Reserve rate hikes.Loans typically pay a floating rate, which increases along with underlying rates. By contrast, rising rates erode the value of fixed-rate securities.Funds that invest in high-yield bonds, which pay a fixed rate, suffered outflows of $1.3bn in the past week, EPFR said.“We have definitely seen a lot of interest,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors, citing “the rising rate environment especially on the short end of the curve where the [Federal Reserve] does have a lot of influence”.The US central bank has been raising short-term rates since December 2015, but the pace has accelerated in the past year and a half, pushing short-term rates higher. US three-month Libor has risen to 2.33 per cent from 1.45 per cent at this time last year. Interest on bank loans is typically tied to Libor.Bank loans tend to be senior to other forms of borrowing, putting them high in the pecking order of payments if a company defaults. But these investments are not without risk, especially in times of strong demand.“We have been bullish, but we are starting to get more cautious,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors. “There has been a lot of new issuance in the first quarter. The problem when borrowers take on more floating rate debt as a percentage of their total liabilities is that it hastens their inability to pay that floating rate coupon.”The value of the US leveraged loan market passed the $1tn mark for the first time in recent weeks, sparking concern in some quarters. Lending standards can deteriorate when demand is strong, and so-called covenant lite loans, which have fewer investor protections, accounted for 80 per cent of the total issued in April, according to S&P Global.Elsewhere in the EPFR data, which covers the week ended on Wednesday, funds investing in Chinese equities attracted $545m of new cash, making for eight consecutive weeks of net inflows. That is the longest streak since the first quarter of 2013.Funds that buy shares of the Greater China area, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan as well as the mainland, drew more than $300m, the most since June 2015.Investors said enthusiasm for the Chinese economy and the inclusion of domestic Chinese stocks, known as A-shares, in the benchmark MSCI emerging market index next month were offsetting concerns about trade tensions with the US.US stock funds also had a good week, with net inflows of $8.8bn, a nine-week high, while emerging market bond funds remained under pressure. Net redemptions for the latter totalled $1.27bn.
47;STT;State Street Corp;2018-05-14T03:00:31Z;Scepticism persists on ‘ETFs for good’;Investors want responsible options but remain concerned about performance;Widespread protests against lax US gun laws erupted in February after the mass shooting of 17 people at a high school in Florida.The tragedy also sparked renewed debate about the role of investment managers in providing support for the firearms industry.Many US exchange traded funds follow broad equity benchmarks that require them to hold shares in gun makers and retailers that sell firearms. But perhaps surprisingly, some ETFs that employ environmental, social and governance metrics also hold gun companies, prompting questions about the rules governing these funds.In response to investor concerns, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, decided to exclude firearms manufacturers and retailers from a range of six ESG-focused equity and bond ETFs.BlackRock’s lead has not been followed by its competitors Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors, the second and third-largest players in the ETF industry. Both have said they will engage with gun companies but they remain under pressure to take more decisive action.The American Federation of Teachers, a union representing 1.7m members, said in April that pension schemes investing in tracker funds should demand new gun-free products. It has also urged pension fund trustees to consider divesting from all gun manufacturers.Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI, a London-based consultancy, says the variety of ESG-focused ETFs now available meant that investors needed to look carefully at their underlying construction before making any commitment.“There is no clear definition of what constitutes an ESG ETF and that has been a source of confusion for investors,” says Ms Fuhr.Around $17.7bn is invested globally across 140 ESG-focused ETFs, according to ETFGI. These include “themed” funds that focus on clean energy, climate change, water investment strategies and gender diversity. However, the majority of invested assets sit in broader products that evaluate ESG metrics across entire stock markets.Investor interest so far remains modest, with ESG-focused ETFs attracting net inflows of $4.2bn last year, compared with $3.7bn in 2016 — but is only a tiny fraction of the $654bn in new business registered by the ETFs globally in 2017.Rory Tobin, global head of ETFs for State Street Global Advisors, says investors accepted that ESG was “a force for good” but uncertainty over definitions has led to wide variations in investor appetite for ESG across European markets.The slow pace of adoption also reflects the mixed results of numerous studies of the links between ESG policies and the financial performance of companies.“We find that US investors are concerned that they will have to sacrifice performance and they are unable to quantify [how much],” notes Mr Tobin. “But in Europe, we find that ESG is being used successfully by some wealth managers to attract younger investors and millennials who are concerned about environmental and social issues.”ESG is being used successfully by some wealth managers to attract younger investors and millennials who are concerned about environmental and social issuesLoren Fox, director of research for Financial Times company Money-Media, says its data show 41 per cent of the largest US financial advisers used general ESG funds in 2017, up from 33 per cent in 2016, suggesting appetite for the theme is growing.MSCI, the indices and analytics provider, added its voice to the debate in November. It examined 1,600 companies globally and found those with high ESG ratings reported higher profitability and dividend yields. They also demonstrated stronger risk management skills, which translated into higher market valuations. Evidence of improvements in ESG scores also served as a useful indicator of better future financial performance.Nuveen, the $970bn US asset manager, has worked with MSCI to create customised ESG indices for ETFs. These take account of steps that companies are taking to improve their ESG scores and include additional carbon metrics that measure exposures to the threat of climate change.Martin Kremenstein, Nuveen’s head of ETFs, says: “We aimed to provide investors with ETFs that have been built using a consistent methodology.”Camilla Ritchie uses a range of ESG-focused ETFs in the sustainable investment portfolios that she runs at 7IM, the London-based wealth manager. “I mainly use regional equity ESG ETFs and often ask providers if they are planning any new launches as more product innovation would be helpful to sustainable investment portfolio managers,” says Ms Ritchie.Mr Kremenstein says the historic criticism that ESG required investors to surrender returns in order to feel good about their portfolio was now being widely questioned.“This criticism is no longer true as ESG-based ETFs can deliver risk-adjusted rewards comparable to conventional market capitalisation-weighted ETFs.”

New business for this group totalled just $3bn in 2017, a disappointing result given the strong US stock market performance which ended the year at an all-time high.The other 95 per cent of funds, which charge fees of 56bp or more, suffered combined outflows of $275bn, according to ICI’s analysis.“Competition continues to push down expense ratios as the industry meets cost-conscious investors’ demand for lower cost funds,” said Shelly Antoniewicz, ICI senior director of industry and financial analysis.Boston Consulting Group said downward pressure on fees was intensifying because of increased competition among asset managers for the business of large institutional clients and the growing bargaining power of large distributors selling funds to retail investors.Brent Beardsley, a senior partner at BCG, said a “winner-takes-all” trend was becoming stronger.Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager and historically the most aggressive competitor on fees, has gathered record breaking inflows for six consecutive years. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, enjoyed its best year, pulling in $367bn in net cash. BlackRock and Vanguard have played a major role in escalating a price war that has drawn in other passive fund managers, including State Street and Charles Schwab.The ICI analysis indicated that fee competition among passive managers had a significant effect on investor inflows into tracker funds.The cheapest quartile of domestic US equity trackers, with fees of less than 20bp, had inflows of $208bn in 2017. The remainder could only attract $20bn.A similar but less extreme split in flows was registered in passively managed international equity funds, and also bond and hybrid trackers.Divyesh Hindocha, a partner with Mercer, the investment consultant, said institutional investors were well placed to assess the risks and rewards of active management “but retail investors may be predisposed to focus purely on costs which should really be a secondary consideration to the quality of the fund offering. This could be harmful to wealth creation for retail investors,” he said.Mr Beardsley said profit margins for asset managers would fall. “Asset managers may know what is coming but they still have to take the actions necessary. Some bold moves will be required.”
50;STT;State Street Corp;2018-05-06T09:00:25Z;Top public pension funds delve deeper into equities;Only one of the 16 largest funds has raised its exposure to bonds since 2008;Public pension funds held assets worth about $5.9tn at the end of 2016, making them one of the most important groups of institutional investors globally.Many of the largest PPFs, which include Canada’s CDPQ and CPPIB, Japan’s GPIF and Sweden’s AP retirement system, have undertaken significant asset allocation changes over the past decade, shifting from bonds and into equities and alternatives.These changes are partly a response to the low interest rates that have persisted since the 2007-08 financial crisis.The asset allocation shifts also reflect the desire of PPFs to broaden their investment capabilities by hiring external managers and building in-house portfolio teams.More than two-thirds (68 per cent) of the assets of the 16 largest PPFs was held in bonds or cash in 2008, according to State Street Global Advisors.This allocation had dropped to just under 56 per cent by the end of 2016 with only one of the 16 funds raising its exposure to bonds since 2008.A few large Asian PPFs hold more than 90 per cent of their assets in domestic government bonds and have yet to diversify.Interest rates on domestic government bonds are too low for most PPFs to meet their pension promises, forcing them to look elsewhere for income. The average equity holding across the 16 PPFs rose from 19 per cent to 28 per cent between 2008 and 2016.Allocations to alternatives (real estate, private equity, hedge funds, infrastructure and commodities) have also risen from less than 12 per cent in 2008 to an average of 16.2 per cent in 2016. This is still low.Property, which offers a hedge against inflation, has seen significant inflows from PPFs which have also increased their exposure to private equity.Infrastructure holdings remain low due to a lack of opportunities while hedge fund allocations are little changed since 2008.
51;STT;State Street Corp;2019-01-15T00:00:24Z;State Street tells boards to focus on corporate culture;Asset manager wants companies to focus on ‘human capital’ to help create long-term value;"State Street Global Advisors is calling on boards to review their companies’ cultures and explain its alignment with their strategy, in the latest example of large investors emphasising intangible factors as a means to create long-term value.The world’s third-largest asset manager has written to the independent chairs or lead independent directors of more than 1,100 companies in the S&P 500, FTSE-350 and equivalent indices in Australia, France, Germany and Japan.The letter from Cyrus Taraporevala, SSGA chief executive, sets out how directors can assess, influence and report on their culture and says they should expect to answer questions on it from SSGA over the coming year.It builds on previous years’ letters focusing on sustainability, directors’ independence and gender diversity in the boardroom. Rakhi Kumar, head of SSGA’s asset stewardship team, said the letters had driven discernible changes in boards’ behaviour.It also follows letters sent in the past 18 months by BlackRock and Vanguard asking companies to explain what social purpose they serve and outlining a stronger stance on environmental, social and governance issues including disclosing the climate risks they face.“The intangibles do drive the bottom line,” Mr Taraporevala said in an interview. “They’re just becoming more important as more of the world moves to a new economy”, in which companies whose brands carry more weight than their hard assets are increasingly focused on managing their “human capital”.“Over the past several years we’ve seen the downside when culture is not aligned to strategy,” he said. But SSGA had found most directors were unable to articulate their company’s culture adequately or show how they manage it.Corporate culture was difficult to measure, Mr Taraporevala acknowledged. He pointed to research from the accounting firm EY, initiatives including the Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism and others, which found that such intangible assets now play a greater role in creating long-term value than tangible assets.Ms Kumar noted that the UK’s Financial Reporting Council last year formalised the board’s role in aligning a company’s culture with its purpose, values and strategy in the new UK corporate governance code.“The UK code often has a ripple effect across the market,” she said. “What shows up in the UK today will often be in other markets in the next five years.”Mr Taraporevala said he worried that the letter could be “misperceived as us trying to foist our values on” the companies in which it invests. But he described the initiative as being about “value, not values”.The letter comes after State Street announced plans to lay off 15 per cent of its senior managers. The company was in the middle of “a strategic transformation”, Mr Taraporevala said, in which culture and human capital played a part.“I would describe the culture as very client centric; a deep fiduciary culture; a collegial culture. It’s somewhat, frankly, cautious. But I think where we’re evolving the culture is to become more lean and performance-oriented, amping up the results.”"
52;STT;State Street Corp;2018-12-12T05:00:24Z;Index fund managers are too big for comfort;Investors such as BlackRock cannot keep quiet and hope that no one will notice them;Think of an industry in which three big companies have used technology and economies of scale to become oligopolies and wield power over other enterprises. It hails not from Silicon Valley but the US east coast.The industry in question is passive investment management, in which computers take the role of human stock pickers and money is channelled into index and exchange traded funds. The Big Three of the US industry — BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street — have gained such size and efficiency that they control 80 per cent of the money invested in US index funds.Even Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard and pioneer of the modern US index fund industry, is alarmed by their success. He has warned that, “if historical trends continue, a handful of giant institutional investors will one day hold voting control of virtually every large US corporation”.That is a scary prospect for the future relationship between companies and their investors. Chief executives such as Paul Polman, the departing head of Unilever, sigh at the short-termism of some shareholders and activists. Would life be better if they reported to huge robots?It might become quieter. Investors have traditionally expressed their displeasure with companies by selling shares, or by kicking up a fuss through public or private criticisms. The first tactic is barred to index funds: they have to hang on to stock in any company in an index, no matter how badly it is run. The weighting is set by a formula, not by individual discretion.Passive investors also have less incentive than activists to speak up and persuade a company to change strategy, since no single investment has much effect on their performance. Leo Strine, supreme court chief justice in Delaware, the state in which many US companies are incorporated, has described index funds as “the least active in exercising voice and judgment”.Companies should really want index fund companies not to remain silent, but to speak up. The worst of all worlds would be a shareholder base dominated by passive investors who are also passive owners, where most noise is made by a few activists who demand quick fixes. Index funds are naturally the most long term in outlook because they have no other choice.The Big Three have realised they cannot keep quiet and hope that no one will notice them. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, has taken to publishing an annual letter to chief executives, which is a clue to where power lies. In this year’s missive, he promised: “We must be active, engaged agents on behalf of the clients invested with BlackRock.” That involves hiring more overseers — BlackRock intends to double its “investment stewardship” staff in the next three years — and arranging more conversations with chief executives. It voted at 15,000 investor meetings on 130,000 proposals last year, while Vanguard “engaged” with 720 portfolio companies representing $1.6tn of its assets under management.As with investing, the giants are nothing if not efficient. They have their own governance guidelines and they do a lot of talking behind the scenes, following Theodore Roosevelt’s motto, “Speak softly and carry a big stick”. As one Dutch study suggested, they “exert structural power . . . in a way that is hidden from public view”.This gets results. A study of US companies held by passive mutual funds found that they performed better than their peers thanks to stricter governance, such as having more independent directors and fewer takeover defences. The fund groups are good at curbing misbehaviour.But their size and strength lead to two problems. First, they operate at such a scale that they tend to take a common approach to all companies. This is effective in imposing minimum standards in matters such as executive pay, but it does not amount to engaging deeply with corporate strategy in the same way as activist investors.Companies could be left ticking boxes for passive investors, while still being exposed to intense, targeted pressure from activists who have more time. Mr Fink insists that talking consistently to long-term shareholders such as BlackRock will help companies not to be picked on by those with “the shortest and narrowest of objectives”, but the jury is still out on that.Second, so few investors holding so much power would be worrying even if they were paragons. I sympathise with Vanguard’s decision to shine its spotlight on US makers of guns and opioids, but what happens if the giants team up against an innocent industry? It puts a premium on their judgment.Antitrust scholars worry about collusion — institutions with stakes in different companies in an industry encouraging them not to compete hard with each other (one study found that US airline prices are higher as a result). The evidence is mixed but, as the fund groups expand, their capacity to exert invisible influence over the companies in which they hold stakes strengthens.Like other consumer technologies, index funds have brought great benefits to ordinary investors. But Mr Bogle’s innovation, useful as it remains, may be working a little too well.john.gapper@ft.comBalance of power is the bedrock of capitalism / From Stanislas Yassukovich, Wynberg, Western Cape, South Africa
53;STT;State Street Corp;2018-10-23T12:30:12Z;How passive fund managers can shape the corporate landscape;They are proving pivotal in control contests, activist campaigns and mergers;The growing concentration in banking since the financial crisis, with more and more activity conducted by financial institutions regarded as “too big to fail”, is at least a well understood phenomenon. The growing concentration in asset management resulting from the rise of indexed and exchange traded funds is less understood, especially in relation to its consequences for corporate governance.The so-called big three indexed fund providers — Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock — are estimated to have controlled about 15 per cent of the S&P 500 in 2017. More broadly, more than 44 per cent of assets in US-domiciled equity funds are now managed passively, up from 19 per cent in 2009.If anything, these figures underestimate the power of passive fund managers because large numbers of shareholders do not vote, even in contested battles, so the voting power of those who do vote is leveraged.In a recent draft paper from which I have taken these numbers, John C Coates of Harvard Law School points out that the big three’s share of any contested vote now tends to be pivotal and that on current trends, even if growth starts to taper off, a majority of the 1,000 largest US companies will be controlled, in effect, by a dozen or fewer people over the next 10 to 20 years.This leads to what he calls the Problem of Twelve, his paper’s title, whereby ownership rights, including the critical right to elect directors, will be in the hands of this tiny group. Even if the growth in passive investing fails to follow the trajectory outlined by Mr Coates, it is clear that there is already a striking concentration of power.Concentrated power is always worrying. Yet, in this case, it also holds out the potential to solve one of the most intractable dilemmas in corporate governance. This was identified by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means in the 1930s as the divorce between ownership and control. The decline of owner-managers and their replacement by a fragmented plethora of outside investors meant that control rights in the corporation were not exercised effectively and that shareholders (principals) were unable to hold managers (agents) to account.The institutionalisation of investment in the postwar period re-concentrated voting power, but failed to overcome the principal-agent problem because professional fund managers had inadequate incentives to engage with management. A fund manager who incurred the costs of engagement saw the benefits of improved corporate performance spread across competitors’ portfolios. Increasing other people’s assets under management led to their reaping increased fees at no cost.Fund managers were also conflicted. They were reluctant to engage in activism because chief executives wanted autonomy and could be relied on to withdraw company pension business from the activist manager.At first blush, passive fund managers scarcely look cut out for engagement with management. Because their portfolios are far larger than those of active managers, the cost of monitoring and conducting a dialogue is high, especially given that they operate a very low-cost business model. Yet even with small governance teams, they can exert considerable power vis-à-vis corporate management because they tend to have similar attitudes and voting policies and are pivotal when it comes to control contests, activist campaigns and mergers.Hence the increased correlation in shareholder votes, particularly among the big three. Chief executives are acutely aware of all this. Mr Coates also points out that for a given portfolio company, growth in the size of an index fund will result in more shares being held, which is why concentration resulting from indexing is growing so fast. For each additional share and each additional dollar of assets under management, there is no additional cost to forming a view on a policy issue and applying it to the same company.He also argues that the conflict of interest in the fund manager’s position evaporates because voting power means a chief executive is more likely to want to offer business to an indexed fund manager than take it away. The difficulties inherent in this concentration of power are the same as those that apply to the stewardship approach to investing more generally. Do these indexed fund managers have the competence to make important judgments about the strategy and management of individual companies?There are questions, too, about legitimacy and accountability in relation to these unelected individuals who exercise power behind closed doors over the shape of the corporate landscape and the job prospects of millions of employees.And then there are antitrust issues. In a business with big economies of scale, incomers confront huge barriers. There will thus be, at the very least, calls for greater transparency, though surely not for drastic breaking up of indexed funds. They have given investors too good a deal for that to make sense.john.plender@ft.com
54;STT;State Street Corp;2018-10-15T03:01:31Z;Diversity beyond gender proves hard for investors to measure;Finding data on worker demographics is a challenge for responsible investment teams;When BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, took companies to task for the lack of women on corporate boards earlier this year, it struck a chord with Julie Gorte.A senior vice-president of Pax World Funds, Ms Gorte had spent nearly 20 years making that very point with the companies in which she invests.Progress has been slow. Less than a quarter of blue-chip board seats are held by women in the US, according to data from proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services, trailing the greater progress seen across many European countries.If efforts to increase gender diversity have been slow to take effect, addressing other areas of diversity has proved even harder, as Ms Gorte and others have discovered. This includes analysing boards’ mix on ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and social background. Yet investors often draw a blank with their research.They say they lack the basic data to judge how companies are faring on increasing diversity across their organisations and some are now actively pushing companies to disclose more information.“If you see a Hispanic name or black face, you can say yes this board has an ethnic minority on it,” Ms Gorte says. “But you are never really sure — does that person think of themselves as Latino? Are they there to represent that group? Making a determination often can be quite difficult.”Some investors look at how companies score on equality rankings, or seek out news reports that highlight harassment and discrimination at a given companyThe shift is being propelled by the more progressive public US pension plans, as well as advisers to city retirement and investment funds in New York and Chicago. Big money managers, such as BlackRock and State Street, which hold hefty sway in proxy contests, have also responded to the call.Investors have come to appreciate the value of boardroom diversity, both as a social imperative and a way to improve the mix of decision makers at the top of a company. Diverse boards are viewed as a way to mitigate against groupthink and legal risk.Moreover, progressive workplace policies are an important tool to recruit and retain employees, says Jackie VanderBrug, the head of sustainable and impact investment strategy in Bank of America’s wealth management division.There is also arguably a financial imperative for companies. Research from Bank of America this year showed that businesses with women in top roles and broad diversity policies generally saw lower earnings volatility and higher returns on equity.“There is clear evidence that having women on boards provides broader perspectives,” agrees Christopher Greenwald, head of sustainable investment research at UBS Asset Management. “It is important to have an effective and well-managed board with a range of skillsets [and] range of perspectives to question management in the long-term interest of shareholders.”Yet very few companies in the US disclose the ethnic make-up of their boards, according to John Roe, head of ISS Analytics.The company compiles its own data based on assessments of corporate boards. It shows that about 15.1 per cent of S&P 500 board seats were held by someone non-white in 2018, up from 13 per cent five years earlier. By contrast, census data show minorities make up roughly two-fifths of the US population. Smaller companies have fewer still. Just 8.5 per cent of board seats at small-cap companies in the S&P 600 are held by minorities, versus 7 per cent in 2013.In the UK, meanwhile, 8 per cent of FTSE 100 board seats were held by people of colour in 2017, against 14 per cent in the broader population.The New York City Comptroller, the chief fiscal officer of the city, has taken a direct approach. It asked the boards of 151 companies to detail their demographic breakdown, including sexual orientation, race and age.Generally, of companies that already provide diversity data, most tend to detail their board’s age and ethnicity. Some companies, however, such as insurer and asset manager Prudential Financial, and electric utility operator Edison International, have started to include sexual orientation data in their breakdowns.Investors often have to turn to alternative sources to find out what companies are doing to promote diversity. Some look at how companies score on the Human Rights Campaign’s annual equality ranking — a scorecard for how groups are faring on policies — or seek news reports that highlight harassment and discrimination at a given company.“The data is a challenge,” says Linda Giuliano, head of responsible investment at AllianceBernstein. “Do people want to be [asked about] their sexual orientation? . . . It creates a real dilemma.“It matters . . . but on the other hand it doesn’t feel right that we have to get that personal about an individual. ”Asset managers are trying to establish more sophisticated methods to guide their investment decisions. Kurt Summers, the treasurer of Chicago who manages the city’s $8bn investment portfolio, together with his team scores each investment decision across 200 factors relating to diversity, the environment and corporate governance. The data come from index providers such as MSCI as well as via its own research.Chicago and several other pension funds have told their Wall Street counterparts how they select investments. “You have the entire broker-dealer community taking notice and adjusting their market pitches based on what we and other . . . institutional investors are saying are [our] priorities,” Mr Summers says.“You have the ability to have a significant market impact, more so than any individual conversation with a company.”
55;STT;State Street Corp;2018-10-15T03:00:02Z;ETF industry’s record-breaking growth streak in danger of ending;;New business growth has slowed markedly for most of the leading providers of exchange traded funds this year even before the sell-off across global equity markets gathered pace last week.Net inflows for BlackRock have fallen by half to $85.8bn in the first nine months of 2018, compared with the same period last year, according to data provided by ETFGI, the London-based consultancy.New ETF business growth for Vanguard — which suffered disruptions to customer services on Wednesday of last week due to problems with its website and phone lines — has dropped by about a third to $68bn.State Street, the third largest ETF manager, is on track for another disappointing year after a lacklustre showing in 2017, which was only saved by a stampede by investors into US equities in the fourth quarter.Two exceptions stand out in the US. Charles Schwab, which has aggressively engaged in the ETF price war against rival managers, has seen a rise of 23 per cent in new ETF business to $22bn so far this year.Chicago-based First Trust has also managed to punch above its weight with inflows of $12.8bn so far this year, surpassing the $9.4bn gathered over the whole of 2017.Technical analysts at Société Générale have pointed out that the S&P 500 index is now trading close to critical multiyear support levels, reflecting uncertainty about whether the US market will stage a rebound or move lower.Investors have also been pulling money so far this year from ETFs that track European equity markets. This has strengthened the headwinds facing Paris-based Lyxor, the third largest player in the European ETF market, which has seen net new ETF inflows drop by 85 per cent so far this year to just $1.3m. DWS, the asset management business majority-owned by Deutsche Bank, has fared better with inflows running so far this year at a similar pace to 2017.As a result, the prospect of a fifth consecutive record-breaking year in 2018 for overall ETF industry growth appears to be increasingly unlikely.
56;STT;State Street Corp;2018-10-10T11:56:36Z;US small-cap stocks stutter on debt concerns;Leverage levels leave companies exposed to interest rate rises;Shares of small companies are lagging behind their larger counterparts on Wall Street as investors’ concerns shift from trade tensions to debt levels.A jump in yields on US Treasuries to a seven-year high, amid increasing signs of economic strength, has rippled through the US stock market. While the S&P 500, an index of large multinationals’ stocks, was off 1.5 per cent over the past week, the Russell 2000 index of small capitalisation stocks was down almost double that.“One of our biggest concerns around small-caps is their leverage,” said Jill Carey Hall, senior equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “That is now increasingly in focus given rising interest rates.”Leverage levels are higher for small-caps versus large-caps and roughly half the debt of companies in the Russell 2000 pays a floating rate versus about a quarter for S&P 500, she said.Bryan Reilly, a managing director at CIBC Private Wealth Management, added: “Despite higher interest rates typically being good for small-caps, leverage is very elevated and some investors may worry that [high-yield bond] spreads widen, which could raise the cost of funding for smaller companies.”Rising rates on the back of a strong economy can otherwise underpin small-caps, which tend to be US-focused.Investors also said that large-caps were bigger beneficiaries of easing trade tensions after a revamped Nafta deal  was arranged. Small-caps had outperformed earlier this year on concerns about global trade.“Small, more domestically oriented companies would stand to benefit if there is an increase in domestic production as a result of trade tariffs,” said Matthew Bartolini at State Street Global Advisors.
57;STT;State Street Corp;2018-09-29T04:00:00Z;BlackRock and State Street weigh in on debate over regulating ETFs;;Asset managers have sounded a warning over proposals designed to help investors better understand trading costs for exchange traded funds as US regulators look to strengthen rules governing the $3.6tn domestic industry. The industry broadly supports the call by the Securities and Exchange Commission for greater disclosure of transaction costs, but providers including BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) disagree with the regulator over how these should be calculated and who should be the responsible party.ETFs and the cost of investing in them have come under scrutiny from regulators worldwide following the rapid growth of the industry.The SEC proposals “show a level of maturity in the US ETF market,” said Jennifer Choi, chief counsel at the Investment Company Institute, the association that represents US asset managers, who control $29.7tn in assets.The proposal calls for more disclosure over bid-ask spreads, which is the difference between what buyers and sellers of a particular ETF are willing to pay. This gap can create trading costs for investors.The SEC proposed in June that ETF providers disclose the median bid-ask spread for each product’s most recent fiscal year as well as offer interactive calculators to allow prospective buyers to compare these costs between investments.The regulator invited the industry for a response by October 1.BlackRock, SSGA and the ICI argue, however, that the data in the regulator’s suggested metric would be out of date.“The median bid-ask spread for the most recent fiscal year is not a particularly useful data point for investors, as it may not be representative of the trading experience of investors due to the staleness of the data,” BlackRock said.Noel Archard, global head of ETF product for SSGA, said: “You might not be comparing apples to apples.”BlackRock and SSGA want the SEC to consider using an average measure relating to a more recent time, such as the past 30 days, while the ICI has suggested using a hypothetical example.The ICI also said providing information on bid-ask spreads only became possible by assessing market data. It could not be controlled by ETF providers themselves.The three also argue that online trading cost calculators should be provided by a third party such as a data provider or even the SEC, citing the costs and complexities of such a tool. “If the commission nevertheless wishes to move forward with an interactive calculator . . . we believe it should be located in one central location,” the ICI said in its letter to the SEC.Bid-ask spreads are typically not disclosed by ETF providers. Information on them is available from the brokers and wealth managers, which distribute the products but the details provided vary.The SEC has also proposed lowering the barriers for bringing products to market by allowing the creation of some ETFs without its prior approval.The body approved its first ETF in 1992. The US has become the biggest market for the products, accounting for more than 70 per cent of the $5tn assets invested in them globally, according to data provider ETFGI. However, the US industry has been covered by a patchwork of rules that the SEC is trying to combine into one set of regulations.“The proposed rule and form amendments are designed to create a consistent, transparent, and efficient regulatory framework for ETFs and to facilitate greater competition and innovation among ETFs,” the SEC said in June.
58;STT;State Street Corp;2018-09-10T04:00:03Z;State Street chief takes aim at high-cost index providers;;The former boss of State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third biggest asset manager, has called the decision by Fidelity, its Boston rival, to sell no-fee funds a “shot across the bow” to index providers.Ron O’Hanley, who led SSGA for three years and is due to take over as chief executive of the wider State Street group at the end of the year, said the high-profile launch put the cost of using brand-name benchmarks into sharp relief.“It’s a reaction to the fees that the index providers continue to impose on money managers and investors,” he told FTfm. “If you look at where costs have been coming down, it’s the management fees. Where they have not is the cost of using indices.”In the global price war that has gripped the passive fund management industry, the biggest fee cutters are running out of costs to slash. Several managers have blamed this on the high fees they are forced to pay index providers for using their benchmarks.Fidelity Investments, the $2.5tn fund group, launched two index funds last month that would give investors no-fee exposure to US and international stocks. The announcement caused the shares of its rivals to dive.Fidelity was able to create such low-cost vehicles by shunning external index providers such as S&P, MSCI and FTSE Russell, and instead using proprietary benchmarks.SSGA, the $2.7tn investment group, relaunched its own range of ultra low-cost exchange traded funds last year, with expense ratios dropped to as low as 3 basis points, or 3 cents for every $100 invested.The company also brought out three proprietary indices focused on US large-cap companies, US small-caps and the total US equity market. It replaced FTSE Russell as the benchmark provider on three of its ETFs.Mr O’Hanley, who joined SSGA from Fidelity in 2015, said he expected to see more ETF providers launching in-house benchmarks and replacing external providers for certain products as the industry courted cost-conscious retail investors.“If you are a retail client who is a long-term investor in the markets, you are looking for exposure to the US large-cap market, not necessarily the S&P 500,” he said of the most popular index of large US stocks. Inclusion in the S&P 500 is determined by the benchmark’s selection committee and it has some notable absentees, such as Tesla, the electric car company.But Mr O’Hanley added that many institutional investors, such as hedge funds, were willing to pay slightly higher costs in order to invest in ETFs based on certain indices as they wanted exposure to a defined set of stocks.Such investors would continue to be the biggest users of SSGA’s flagship product, SPY, the world’s largest ETF that tracks the S&P 500.Last year the Financial Times reported on plans by several of the biggest ETF providers to launch an industry “co-operative” to create stock market benchmarks that would rival those offered by index providers.
59;STT;State Street Corp;2018-09-10T03:01:34Z;Asian funds are slow off the mark in global market;Regional providers predict strong growth from a low base;"Assets invested in exchange traded funds and products regularly hit new highs. BlackRock, the world’s biggest fund manager, forecasts that the value of ETFs could reach $12tn globally by 2023, up from about $5tn today.The US has blazed a trail of interest in the market. The country had ETF and ETP assets of $3.6tn at the end of July out of a global total of $5.12tn according to data from ETFGI, while assets in Europe were $828bn. Asia, perhaps surprisingly given the pace of economic growth in China and financial reform in the region, languishes in third place.The most commonly cited reason for this lag is the way funds are sold across Asia. Distribution across the region is typically based on commission-linked sales, which do not favour products such as ETFs, which are openly traded on stock exchanges and designed as a lower-cost product.ETFs have flourished in markets such as the US, UK and Australia, which have large numbers of financial advisers that do not benefit from recommending higher-cost products for their clients.“Distribution here in Asia is still very captive. The move to a fee-based distribution model is happening, but it is very slow compared with the US and Europe,” says Axel Lomholt, head of the international ETF business at Vanguard. Matt Arnold, head of ETF strategy and research across Asia-Pacific at State Street Global Advisors, agrees. “No doubt, it has been a barrier,” he says.There are signs of change. The emergence of large European wealth managers, keen to establish bigger footprints in the region in order to capture wealthy clients, should also hasten progress, says Susan Chan, head of ETF and index investing for Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. “It is definitely becoming more accommodating,” she says.ETF providers also think that more emphasis on transparency will shine a light on product costs which, in turn, should favour ETFs.Progress is slow, however. “It is a big challenge for us to expand to retail investors,” says Koei Imai, head of ETFs at Nikko Asset Management, whose business primarily serves institutional investors.The Japanese group recently launched a yen-hedged ETF domiciled in Tokyo for investors to manage currency risk when they invest in the US. Aimed at smaller banks that have fewer resources to hedge than their larger peers, Nikko’s goal is to broaden the range of clients to whom ETFs would seem attractive.One fact blurring the picture is that many Asia-based investors use ETFs in their portfolios but do so for products domiciled outside the region. Obtaining data on this is difficult, says Jackie Choy, director of ETF research in Asia for Morningstar. He has, for instance, heard of pension funds in Korea and Taiwan using US-domiciled ETFs in their international allocations, investments that will then be recorded as part of US ETF assets under management rather than categorised as Asian. Sometimes foreign-domiciled products can be cheaper than local ones.“US-domiciled ETFs and Ucits [EU-approved alternative investments funds] play a big role here in the region,” says Mr Lomholt. “We know it is significant.”Despite access to products globally, a strong local ETF market is still desirable. Investment groups China Asset Management and Samsung Asset Management of South Korea are among those that have recently launched ETFs in the region.The US is one country, one system …Asia is many countries and many systems“The good thing about having a local ETF market is that mom and pop investors can buy ETFs more easily,” Mr Arnold says. “You have the full suite of asset classes available to you.” Mr Imai notes that investors that choose products in foreign jurisdictions also run the risk of double taxation.One fillip to Asia-domiciled assets could be ETF Connect, a trading link that would give Chinese investors access to Hong Kong-listed exchange traded funds and give Hong Kong investors a route to buy ETFs listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. This would remove another barrier to increased ETF take-up: numerous different regulatory regimes across the region.“The US is one country, one system; Europe, many countries and one system,” says Mr Choy, referring to Ucits, the EU regulatory framework that means a fund can be domiciled in one country but sold across the bloc. “Asia is many countries and many systems.”ETF Connect would fortify trading schemes connecting Shanghai and Shenzhen with Hong Kong that are aimed at eroding investment barriers between Hong Kong and mainland China.Market participants believe this ETF Connect link could be launched within months but are sceptical whether it will immediately pave the way for a massive boost to locally domiciled ETF assets.Ms Chan describes herself as “cautiously optimistic” but warns that the scheme will be more complicated than opening a stock exchange. “People will want to see how it opens, how it operates,” she adds.“It holds a lot of promise,” says Mr Arnold, but he also cautions there is currently a lack of detail. “We definitely need more information.”"
60;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
61;STT;State Street Corp;2018-09-01T10:00:00Z;Taking the helm: why asset management bosses are getting the top jobs;;"The journey to the top of a global finance company is straightforward if recent hires are anything to go by: simply take over the asset management division, launch profitable products, open up new markets and wait for the chief executive role to become available.From State Street in Boston and Macquarie in Sydney to Investec in London and Johannesburg, financial services conglomerates have promoted asset management heads to run the entire company.Some commentators say this is due to how these executives helped build their businesses. Others say it is more to do with their skills in risk and people management. Another factor is how asset management is now a key part of global finance.“Asset managers are right at the centre of a modern capitalist economy,” says Keith Skeoch, co-chief executive of Standard Life Aberdeen.He led the investment business of Standard Life, a UK insurer, for 11 years before taking control of the group in 2015 and merging with Aberdeen Asset Management two years later.Martin Gilbert, his co-chief executive at SLA, says: “When we both started in asset management it’s hard to believe what a cottage industry it was. Asset managers were the poor relations. Now it’s a huge worldwide business.”The latest spate of promotions for asset management bosses began last November when State Street Corporation said Ronald O’Hanley would succeed Jay Hooley as chief executive at the end of 2018. Mr O’Hanley had run State Street’s $2.7tn asset management business since 2015.In February, Investec said Hendrik du Toit, head of fund management, would become joint chief executive of the Anglo-South African group from next month.Shemara Wikramanayake is the most recent asset management head to reach the top. She will become chief executive of Macquarie, the Australian financial services group, having run its asset management business for a decade.Other asset management bosses mentioned as potential group CEO material include Mary Callahan Erdoes, head of JPMorgan’s $1.7tn asset management business, and Euan Munro, who launched the SLA Gars fund and runs Aviva’s £348bn ($450bn) investment division.Mr Skeoch is not the only executive to be promoted from running the investment business of an insurer to leading the company. A decade ago Tim Breedon did the same at Legal & General.The promotions reflect the role of investment management divisions in running insurers’ assets. These units went on to manage money for clients and grew to become large and profitable parts of the wider business. More recently insurers have looked to spin off their asset management arms.Mr O’Hanley, a fund management veteran, agrees with Mr Skeoch and Mr Gilbert that the industry has grown in importance during his career, which is a factor in recent promotions.“Over 20 years, asset managers have gone from being a niche in financial services […] to being an integral part of the broad provision of capital to markets,” he says.He points out that the investment industry has become more prominent since the financial crisis, after which banks and insurers pulled back capital markets activities, giving asset managers a bigger role.Sarah Dudney, client partner at the Buy-Side Club, an investment industry recruitment company, says the asset management bosses who have been promoted have three sets of skills: the ability to drive profits, certain psychological traits and outside interests.On profitability, Ms Dudney points to Ms Wikramanayake’s 10-year stint as head of Macquarie’s A$495bn ($364bn) asset management division. In this time, the business became the world’s largest infrastructure investor and a significant driver of the group’s earnings, contributing a third of net profit. Last financial year, operating profits for asset management reached A$1.7bn — up 10 per cent on the previous 12 months.“She built a business that could not be replicated easily,” says Ms Dudney. “She focused on where the profit was.”Investment bosses gain a broad outlook from running a business that has a global operation, even if the wider company is domestically focused, says Dean Frankle, a principal at Boston Consulting Group.Not all fund management leaders can run the wider organisation, he claims. “It’s more correlation than causation,” he says of recent appointments. “It comes down to individuals being in the right place at the right time.”At Standard Life Investments, Mr Skeoch oversaw the development of the flagship Global Absolute Return Strategies (Gars) fund. Despite its recent problems, for a while it was one of Europe’s best-selling funds. Its initial success boosted SLI and raised Mr Skeoch’s profile.Ms Dudney says the same ability to create profit can be seen in Mr du Toit, who focused on high-margin products such as emerging market debt funds at Investec, and Mr O’Hanley, who has embraced innovation and technology at SSGA. “State Street will be one of the first companies to be fully automated,” Ms Dudney says.When it comes to the leaders’ personalities, Ms Dudney says all “are intuitively skilled with people”.Mr Skeoch agrees that the ability to forge relationships with staff is crucial for executives who lead investment divisions, which typically have fewer but better-paid staff than other sectors. “It’s a human capital business,” he says. “One of the biggest roles is managing people.”The third trait that Ms Dudney says the new bosses have in common is outside interests, or “hinterland”, as she terms it.Mr du Toit is a marathon runner and likes endurance sports, while Mr O’Hanley is an ocean sailor. His yacht, Privateer, came second in last year’s Rolex Fastnet Race. Ms Wikramanayake, meanwhile, is involved with the Serendipity Scholarship Fund, which helps gifted children from developing countries to study in Australia and New Zealand.Ms Dudney says outside interests give executives a broad perspective. “They all have quite a significant life outside work.”State Street’s decision to promote Mr O’Hanley can be viewed as a reflection of the size of the bank’s fund management operations.Though only the 14th-largest lender by assets in the US, State Street’s investment business is the third-biggest in the world. For years it ran the most-successful exchange traded funds business, though it has lost ground to BlackRock and Vanguard.Before joining the company in 2015, Mr O’Hanley was president of asset management and corporate services at Fidelity Investments, SSGA’s Boston rival, having previously run BNY Mellon Asset Management.He says his experience as a one-time client of State Street made him a strong contender for the top job.About 80 per cent of State Street revenues come from asset servicing, working for other asset managers and owners; the rest is from investment management. “In some respects it was quite natural that one criteria for choosing the next CEO was someone who had been a client of those services,” he adds.Cyrus Taraporevala has taken over from Mr O’Hanley as chief executive of SSGA, having followed his predecessor from Fidelity in 2016.In July, State Street announced a $2.6bn cash deal to buy Charles River Development, an investment management services provider. State Street will use the acquisition to improve its technology and data systems for clients. The deal will conclude at the end of the year as Mr O’Hanley takes the reins.For almost 40 years Investec, the banking group, has been led by founders Stephen Koseff, Bernard Kantor and Glynn Burger. In February it said it was shifting control to a new generation, including making asset management boss Hendrik du Toit joint chief executive.The change from Mr Koseff to Mr du Toit and Fani Titi, group chairman since 2011, will take place next month.Mr du Toit was a university economics lecturer before starting an investment career with Old Mutual. He moved to Investec in 1991 and set up the asset management division, now a global fund business with more than £100bn of assets.Having led Investec Asset Management from London, Mr du Toit will continue to be based in the UK, while Mr Titi will work in South Africa.Investec’s board had been working on the succession plan since November 2015 and the pair were chosen for their “good combination of skills”, Mr Koseff said at the time of the announcement.Macquarie opted for a longtime insider when it chose Ms Wikramanayake to replace chief executive Nicholas Moore in November.Ms Wikramanayake has been with the Australian bank for more than 30 years, and has held positions in nine cities across six countries. Following a stint as a corporate lawyer, her Macquarie career has included advisory and infrastructure roles, as well as establishing offices.Macquarie, known as the “millionaire factory” due to its high executive remuneration, paid Ms Wikramanayake A$18.9m last year, making her one of the highest-earning executives in global asset management.Under her leadership, the investment business became profitable but courted controversy in Britain over its ownership of Thames Water, which last year was fined £20m for dumping raw sewage into the Thames.Ms Wikramanayake has tried to avoid the limelight. In an interview with FTfm last year, she said: “I really value privacy. Anonymity is such a luxury and I don’t think everyone appreciates that.”Keeping a low profile will be a hard task when she joins the top table of global banking chief executives in November."

The withdrawal helped to push the net outflow from European equities funds to $166m and its 25th consecutive week of redemption.“When it comes to the UK, there is a lot of concern about what is going to be happening with Brexit — the chance of there being a no-deal or a hard Brexit — the impact could be significant from day to day getting goods from the EU to more operational issues around trading securities,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors.While capped by Brexit concerns this week, European funds have been dogged for the past several months by weaker economic growth compared with the US — where the economy and corporations are enjoying a boost from tax cuts and other stimulus — as well as political concerns around the rise of populism in Italy.Elsewhere, investors’ conviction around US equities solidified as indicated by a $7.2bn net inflow to these funds, the highest amount in 11 weeks, and a rise in benchmark indices such as the S&P 500 to fresh all-time highs.“A lot of investors are playing offence when they can and defence when they need to,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors. “US equity right now is the best place to play offence. The US is still benefiting from a significant amount of stimulus. GDP is above 4 per cent, unemployment is below 4 per cent and earnings growth above 20 per cent for two consecutive quarters.”Investors also drew comfort this week from a US bilateral trade deal with Mexico to revamp Nafta, even if it remains unclear whether Canada, the trade pact’s third partner, would sign up to the revised agreement and what the outcome meant for US trade relations with China.Investor appetite for emerging markets, where funds have seen significant outflows this year, returned, but the rebound may be shortlived given a flare-up of economic turmoil in Argentina on Thursday, a day after EPFR’s reporting period.Emerging market equity funds took in $404m, only their second inflow during the past 15 weeks, and emerging market bond funds eked out a $46m intake, snapping a four-week outflow streak.“There has not been a fundamental reason why news on Argentina or Turkey would result in a sell-off or rally in emerging markets assets whereas we have seen a lot of that,” Mr Gokhman said, arguing that the two countries represent a small amount of the emerging markets universe, especially when compared with Asian countries.“It is sentiment-driven buying and selling.”

They complain that we are misusing our rights as shareholders to enforce arbitrary political or social “values” because we raise environmental, social and governance concerns with the boards of the companies in which we invest.This completely misrepresents the mission of State Street Global Advisors and other large index fund managers. We seek long-term value for millions of ordinary investors in a world that has become increasingly obsessed with short-term results. That goal, not some political agenda, is why we have developed a rigorous, research-based shareholder engagement programme. We raise all kinds of issues with boards that might materially impact their company’s ability to generate sustainable returns over the long haul.While our active funds can sell a company if we disagree with its executives, our index funds cannot choose the shares in which they invest. We are essentially permanent capital and cannot turn the S&P 500 into the S&P 499. That means we need to take a long-term perspective on behalf of our clients. At a time when some activist shareholders are keen on extracting short-term profits from companies, we provide a healthy and necessary counterweight.Our primary fiduciary obligation to our investors is to maximise the probability of attractive long-term returns. Flows into index-based strategies have increased so dramatically over the past few years that we must take this responsibility more seriously than ever. Millions of individual investors count on the low-cost access to markets around the world provided by exchange traded funds and other trackers. This has democratised access to markets that were once available and affordable only to larger institutional investors.We carefully select the issues we focus on with companies, based on rigorous research into their impact on investment performance. For example, numerous studies show that diversity at the board level leads to better decision making, fewer reputational crises and ultimately better returns. This is the reason why we placed the Fearless Girl statue on Wall Street and issued specific guidance to boards to take steps to improve diversity. Performance was our motivation, not politics. This is just one example of how we seek to maximise transparency around our views, the research underpinning them, and our voting intentions. Others can be found in our new 2017 asset stewardship report that provides details on our proxy voting and engagement on thousands of management and shareholder proposals in 82 different countries across the globe.In addition, while we will use the data and analytics provided by proxy advisers, we never outsource our voting decisions and we urge other institutional investors not to do so. These issues are too important to outsource and they are growing more complex.Increasingly, our clients are pushing for more clarity on non-traditional investment issues. They want to know how companies are incorporating climate risk into their long-term strategy; whether they are adopting best practices around corporate governance, board quality and pay policies; how they are adapting to technology disruptions that could threaten their industries.We need only look to recent corporate scandals around poor internal controls to remind us of the importance of active shareholder engagement.Far from injecting politics into boardrooms, we believe our focus on active stewardship in a rapidly changing and complex world is more important than ever for ensuring healthy public markets, resilient economic growth and shared prosperity. We are creating long-term value; not imposing values.The writer is president and chief executive officer of State Street Global AdvisorsRecognise the value of engagement activities / From Robin Hindle Fisher, London, UK"

Revenue in the three months to June rose 8 per cent year-on-year to $3bn. Net income rose 20 per cent to $698m.

This has led to a marked slowdown in new business for asset managers globally.Worldwide inflows into ETFs (funds and products) dropped to $223bn in the first half of 2018, down more than a third on the same period last year, according to ETFGI, a data provider. The sharp decline in growth comes after four consecutive years of record inflows into ETFs, which have attracted the bulk of new money in the global asset management industry.Hope of a swift resolution to trade tensions have faded, prompting warnings from analysts.“Suddenly the world is facing the most serious outbreak of protectionism since the 1930s,” said Dario Perkins, a managing director at TS Lombard, the London-based economic consultancy. “Protectionism didn’t cause the Great Depression but it certainly prolonged it.”Investors have pulled billions from funds linked to emerging markets and European equities, which are seen as vulnerable to damage from a trade war.State Street, the New York-listed bank, registered outflows of $7.2bn from its ETFs last month alone, dragging this business into negative territory by the end of the first half.BlackRock also weathered heavy ETF outflows of more than $5bn in June. The world’s largest asset manager has attracted $52.7bn in new ETF business this year, down 63 per cent on the first six months of 2017.Christopher Harris, an analyst with Wells Fargo in New York, said overall new business growth for BlackRock was running below the company’s 5 per cent target, due mainly to the slowdown in ETF inflows.Wells Fargo has trimmed its 12-month target for BlackRock shares, which were trading at just over $508 on Friday, from $550 to $545.Wei Li, head of iShares Emea investment strategy at BlackRock, said investors were making greater efforts to build resilience into portfolios as a result of the combination of trade tension and moves by US and European central banks to normalise monetary policy.“Gold ETFs have attracted steady inflows until very recently even though the price hasn’t performed strongly this year and there has been a huge appetite for US government bond ETFs following increases in short-term rates,” said Ms Li.New ETF business for Pennsylvania-based Vanguard, the nearest rival to BlackRock, dropped 48 per cent to just over $43bn in the first half.WisdomTree, the New York-listed manager, has also been hit by first-half withdrawals of $4.2bn. WisdomTree’s shares have fallen 28 per cent this year.In Europe, Amundi, UBS and DWS, the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank, have all seen a slowdown in ETF growth after political tensions in the UK, Italy and Germany led investors to retreat from equity markets.ETF inflows for Lyxor, the Paris-based asset manager, sank 96 per cent to just $233m in the first half.“There were massive outflows from ETFs linked to European equities in the second quarter. These were offset in Europe by inflows into US equity, commodities and safe haven government bond ETFs,” said Arnaud Llinas, head of ETFs and indexing at Lyxor.Mr Llinas said he believed the slowdown was a blip. “We have never before had as many conversations with potential clients including private banks and wealth managers as so far this year,” he said.Investors’ appetite for risk, however, could be further damaged by Mr Trump’s decision this month to impose tariffs on an additional $200bn of imports from China.Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild wealth management, said it was an “uncomfortable but undeniable fact” that Mr Trump was right to complain about trade imbalances. “The US has been one of the most open economies on the planet and the playing field [on trade] is not level,” he said.

These include demonstrating to new staff during recruitment and induction that they welcome LGBT employees and encouraging senior managers to show support by participating in LGBT networks and events.A chief concern is ensuring that global asset managers with offices in the 73 countries where homosexuality is illegal are aware of local laws and attitudes, and provide support to employees who work or travel there.“Applying policies globally is undoubtedly a challenge as many countries are on different trajectories when it comes to issues such as gender diversity and LGBT,” said Pete Horrell, UK managing director at Fidelity International. “Of course none of this can be a substitute for any reforms governments should push forward themselves, but we definitely have a role.”The IA also recommended encouraging heterosexual colleagues to participate in LGBT networks and events at their employer as allies and that asset managers offer all employees training to broaden their understanding of LGBT issues.“Everyone should feel able to bring their whole selves to work,” said Chris Cummings, chief executive of the IA. “Whilst legislation over the past decade has rightly given LGBT+ colleagues the rights and protections others can enjoy, culture and preconceptions don’t always follow changes to the law.”Many fund managers have established LGBT and allied networks and have stepped up efforts to ensure areas such as parental leave and recruitment are unbiased according to gender or sexuality. Jupiter Asset Management and Man Group recently launched pride networks for employees.Those efforts have been more visible this month with some organisations, including Hermes Investment Management and the IA, using the colours of the rainbow flag in their online corporate logos. Schroders, the UK’s second-largest listed manager, also used the colours across the main doors of its offices in New York and London.“Everyone who visits us will see that support,” said Alex Ross-Parkinson, who works in Schroders’ intermediary business development team and who set up the group’s LGBT network three years ago.Both colleagues and clients attended his wedding two years ago but he said there was still work to be done throughout the industry as a whole to make LGBT employees more visible and comfortable with expressing their identities at work.“For our industry there is a long way to go” said Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes and leader of the company’s unity group.Financial services has a reputation for being a culturally traditional industry said Jess McNicholas, a managing director at State Street, meaning that visible gestures of support from colleagues are important. Employees at State Street can flag their status as “allies” on the group’s internal communications system.“To know there was a cohort of strong allies made them [employees] be more confident about being out in the workplace,” she said.Michael Mayer, who chairs the LGBT network at Legg Mason, said all employees need to be able to “[bring] their authentic selves to work every day”.Prejudice against non-heterosexual people is costly and damaging for organisations, said Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management.“A company that encourages staff to lie is not a great place to work. A company with a culture of dishonesty is not a great company to do business with,” he said. “An LGBT person who wastes time being careful what they say at work will be under stress. Stress makes people perform badly at work.”Additional reporting by Owen Walker
68;STT;State Street Corp;2018-06-28T09:00:27Z;US advisers shy away from newfangled ETFs;Why some investment veterans still prefer to stick to no-frills vanilla products;"As exchange traded funds grow in popularity, designers are devising new flavours of the investment vehicles in order to expand the marketplace.However, rather than embracing these new offerings, the registered investment advisers (RIAs) that have been the most enthusiastic about ETFs are content to stick with the classic hits that attracted them to the products in the first place.Passive index ETFs give investors cheap exposure to broad asset classes. They provide returns based on the performance of, say, the S&P 500 at a cost as low as a single basis point. Many investors have achieved good returns without the high fees associated with active mutual funds.Asset managers are now launching more sophisticated ETFs that track indices based on factors other than companies’ market capitalisation.Some advisers, though, remain cautious in their approach to such products. Herb Morgan is the chief investment officer for San Diego’s Efficient Market Advisors, a company that only uses ETFs. He puts all $4.3bn of his clients’ assets into passive index funds and is sceptical of newer types. “I have yet to see empirical data supporting alternative methods of indexing,” Mr Morgan says.I don’t like an active ETF because we want to make the management decision ourselvesMitch Reiner started investing in ETFs in the late 1990s at his Atlanta-based agency Capital Investment Advisors, where he is a managing partner. Nearly two decades on, “the fundamental way we use ETFs has not changed”, Mr Reiner says.Asset managers have launched a number of novel funds in the marketplace. These include so-called smart beta offerings (which track an index constructed using factors other than market capitalisation); inverse ETFs (which generate returns when a given market’s value decreases); and active products (which have an element of active management but with a lower fee).Fred Fern founded Los Angeles-based Churchill Management in 1963 and began investing in ETFs roughly a decade ago.His company tries to pick the winning sector within each market cycle and uses ETFs that focus on certain themes such as technology. “I don’t like an active ETF because we want to make the management decision ourselves,” he says.Yet ETF inflows continue to target the lowest-cost index products, such as the vanilla S&P 500 funds that have helped swell asset managers like Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors.Creative Planning, an advisory firm in a suburb of Kansas City, views ETFs as a long-term holding and does not actively trade them. “If an adviser is trading them all day, which many of them do, then they aren’t really any different than someone investing and holding an active mutual fund, results-wise,” says Peter Mallouk, president at Creative Planning.Indeed, many advisers say the draw of a simple index ETF is that it is passive. “By removing the active component, I lose the ability to beat the index, but I also lose the chance to lose against the index — which I think is more important,” Mr Morgan says.This is not to say that advisers are putting their clients’ money into an index and twiddling their thumbs, however. Advisers can attempt to improve their clients’ returns by allocating varying amounts to different indices within a portfolio — a process Mr Morgan calls “active beta management”.ETFs are catching up with mutual funds in the average investor’s vocabulary. “Up until 2013, 2014, we did need to explain what an ETF was,” says Marshal McReal, principal at Garde Capital in Seattle.With large managers such as Vanguard and BlackRock’s iShares running trillions of dollars in such funds, investors’ awareness of ETFs is likely to grow further still."
69;STT;State Street Corp;2018-06-16T04:00:37Z;Brexit contingencies: asset managers put plans into action;A third of big investment companies have opted for Dublin or Luxembourg;Asset managers are losing patience with politicians over the slow pace of Brexit negotiations, with several deciding it is better to assume the worst and fire the starting gun on their contingency plans.FTfm contacted more than 40 large asset managers with significant operations in the UK. A third outlined plans to beef up or move parts of their operation to Dublin or Luxembourg, both major fund management centres.For those still working on detail, the clock is ticking. The focus for the industry is on making a smooth move to deliver services to clients whatever happens, says Dan Waters, managing director at ICI Global, the trade body for international fund managers.“[We hope] there is a reasonable and workable financial services agreement,” he says. “But we don’t know what that will look like. The world is scary enough as it is.”According to the European Fund and Asset Management Association, the worst outcome is a “super hard” Brexit where there is no UK-EU deal and no co-operation partnerships in place.“This is so complicated,” says Peter De Proft, Efama director-general. “It would be helpful if as soon as possible we could know how business will need to adapt. Clarity and transparency is politely all we can ask for.”Among the groups to have firmed up their plans, Baring Asset Management, the $300bn US group, is to open a Dublin office, while Morgan Stanley Investment Management has said it will expand its business in the Irish capital.Many smaller companies are, however, scrambling to finalise their arrangements. A wave of applications for licences has been submitted to authorities in Ireland and Luxembourg. Most are from smaller fund managers exploring their options.The Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, the Luxembourg financial regulator, and the Central Bank of Ireland have been swamped by applications, say market sources. Neither regulator would comment.In the two years since the vote to leave the EU, numerous asset managers have stuck patiently to the line that they need clarity on a final deal before committing to changes.The tone is hardening with frustrated managers saying they have to act now to protect clients in the event of a hard Brexit.“There may be a transition deal later this year. This could buy the industry more time but we mustn’t become complacent,” said Dave Mace, who runs the Luxembourg branch of MFS, the $492bn US fund group.Stuart Dunbar, partner at Baillie Gifford, said: “It is future-proofing. We have to look after our European-domiciled clients.” The Edinburgh-based £178bn manager has not finalised its plans but it told FTfm that it will establish a management company “with substance” within the EU before next March.“Because we have no certainty we have to take action to secure our relationships with our European clients,” Mr Dunbar said. “If you are going to do it, you have to do it with commitment. You want the office to feel like a functioning office and the cost is not insignificant.”Jonathan Greenwold, general counsel at Aspect Capital, the $7.3bn London hedge fund, said it was “a case of planning for the worst but hoping for best”.“Brexit planning has been challenging given the politically driven and therefore unpredictable nature of the discussions,” he said.Legg Mason, the $754bn US investment manager which is preparing to open a Dublin office this year, echoed the view that it would prepare for a worst-case scenario. “Continued uncertainty around the future of some of the delegation and passporting of products and services has meant that, while remaining flexible, we have to take action now,” said Ed Venner, chief operating officer of global distribution.Hermes Investment Management, which was recently part-sold to Federated Investors, has plans to open a management company in Dublin. “Of course, we keep a keen eye on the ever-evolving political landscape and look for clarity and certainty from the treasury, the regulators and other key bodies [around Brexit]”, said Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive.“However, we recognise that we must make appropriate contingency plans in the absence of certainty, in order to ensure to the extent possible that we remain able to manage our clients’ assets in line with their expectations of us.”Baring Asset Management, the $300bn US group, is to open a Dublin office and hire five people.Hermes Investment Management already has a £9bn Ucits range domiciled in Ireland. It will establish a management company there and appoint senior staff to oversee governance and risk management. It will also open sales branches in Germany and Denmark.Legal & General Investment Management was given authorisation for a management company in May, which will be operational this year, The £983bn manager is recruiting.Legg Mason already operates self-managed Ucits and AIFM funds in Ireland. Its Dublin office will open this year — with more staff. It has applied for a Ucits licence and anticipates asking for new permissions “depending on how Brexit negotiations unfold”.Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the $469bn US fund business, will establish an office in Dublin to complement its offshore operations there. It has made several applications to the regulator. Luxembourg will remain its largest base in the EU.Principal Global Investors has set up a Dublin company. Its fund platform is already domiciled there. “The main challenge with Brexit has been the contingency planning because we don’t know what the rules will be,” says chief executive Jim McCaughan.Standard Life Aberdeen said in February that it would establish an investment and distribution business in Dublin. The £646bn group already has funds domiciled in both the city and Luxembourg. It is applying for a licence to become a Mifid investment company.State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest investment company with $2.8tn under management, has sought approval to make its Amsterdam, Brussels and Milan offices branches of its Irish entity. It expects Brexit to have a limited effect on its European operation.Columbia Threadneedle Investments is planning to beef up its Luxembourg team with “a handful” of new employees, focused on risk, client management and oversight. The £366bn group is in the process of applying to the regulator to expand its Luxembourg-based management company. It plans to transfer 20 funds in its Oeic range to the Sicav.Janus Henderson Investors opened an office in Luxembourg in 1985. The £265bn group will move “a number” of oversight roles there. It already has three Ucits fund ranges, two in Luxembourg one in Ireland.Jupiter Asset Management is establishing an office and management company in Luxembourg and says recruiting staff is “well advanced”. It has applied to the regulator for approval for a management company, which will be a Ucits management company and an alternative investment fund manager.M&G is setting up “a new legal corporate structure” in Luxembourg that will be staffed by about 30 additional hires in legal, compliance and risk roles. It has already received regulatory approval from the CSSF, the Luxembourg regulator. The group says this will be up and running before the UK’s exit from the EU.MFS already has a management company in Luxembourg, which it plans to beef up and use as its European hub post-Brexit. It will expand its team there from seven to about 20. It has applied to the regulator for permission to conduct more investment management services.T Rowe Price, the $1tn US manager, has an office in Luxembourg and is in the process of seeking permission to extend its current activities. London will remain its main office in Emea with the creation of a new management company.It will not move jobs from London but may add to staff in Luxembourg as its business develops.The remainder of the managers with a big presence in the UK fall into two camps: those that cannot yet speak publicly about their plans and those that decline to provide information.The former include Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh manager, which says it will set up a management company with substance within the EU by the end of next March.BlackRock, the world’s biggest manager, has still to make final decisions about its post-Brexit business. It believes clients’ interests will be best served by keeping its options open for as long as possible.First State, the Australian group, already operates pooled funds out of Dublin. Its plans for an EU-domiciled subsidiary management company are at an advanced stage.Goldman Sachs Asset Management has still to decide whether its EU management company will be in Ireland or Luxembourg but it is talking to regulators. It expects to move “a small number of people”.Man Group will take “the necessary steps” to avoid disruption. It already has licensed entities in the Netherlands, Ireland and Liechtenstein. It says it may “enhance its EU footprint as regulations become clearer”.Another manager that has not yet finalised its Brexit strategy is Old Mutual Global Investors. The company serves its European clients primarily via its Ireland-domiciled fund range.Those that declined to provide information included BlueBay, Franklin Templeton, GAM, HSBC Asset Management, Investec, Northern Trust, SEI Investments, Vanguard and Wellington.AllianzGI, which manages €513bn, says its strength in Europe and growing business in the UK put it in a good position to deal with Brexit. Chief executive Andreas Utermann works from London.Europe’s largest fund manager, Amundi, has its HQ in France and does not expect to change how it services clients. Its funds are available to UK investors via Sicav feeders.Aspect Capital, the $7.3bn UK hedge fund, has offices in London, Connecticut and Hong Kong. Another office in the EU is unlikely but it would consider using a third-party platform.Aviva Investors, which manages £353bn, says it will serve EU clients after Brexit via its Luxembourg Sicav range. It already has a presence in France and Ireland.Axa Investment Managers has fund management centres in Paris and London. It has UK-domiciled fund ranges catering for British clients as well as Luxembourg and Ireland ranges for cross-border clients.BMO Global, the Canadian owner of F&C Asset Management, says there is no need for substantial changes.BNY Mellon Investment Management, along with its subsidiary Insight Investment, the UK’s second-biggest manager by assets, and its boutiques including Newton, will use their legal entities in Luxembourg and Ireland to service EU clients. They have applied to regulators for extra permissions.Capital Group, the $1.7tn US investment house, says its operations in Geneva, London and Luxembourg give it enough heft in Europe to compete post-Brexit.Invesco, which owns Invesco Perpetual in the UK, has separate fund ranges for clients in different EU jurisdictions and client-relationship teams in various countries to meet local need.Fidelity International, the $255bn Bermuda-based asset manager, already has offices in Luxembourg and Dublin. It employs 920 people in Europe outside the UK. It has been hiring in its Dublin office, which employees more than 250 workers, but denied this was related to Brexit.JPMorgan Asset Management has operated in Luxembourg for more than 30 years, with $300bn invested in its 180 Luxembourg-domiciled funds. The office has 170 staff.Kames Capital, a subsidiary of Netherlands-based Aegon Asset Management, has had a Dublin operation since 2007 and sells to 16 European countries including the UK. Aegon has large offices in Frankfurt and Madrid.Swiss-owned Pictet Asset Management is watching Brexit talks closely, but feels it has enough offices to cope with any fallout.Pimco, the $1.8tn bond manager, has bases in London and Munich and funds domiciled in Ireland and Luxembourg. It does not expect significant disruption.About 80 per cent of Polar Capital’s £12bn assets are held in a Dublin Ucits umbrella fund. It expects to hire more people in the EU as part of its diversification strategy.Royal London Asset Management, the £113bn fund group, says it will not set up an office in the EU but provided no details.US manager Russell Investments has offices in Paris, Milan, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London, and two European fund ranges. The main one is domiciled in Ireland while it also has authorised funds in the UK.Schroders, the UK’s second-biggest listed fund group, employs more than 700 staff in nine EU offices outside the UK, including 250 in Luxembourg. The £447bn fund manager has obtained additional permissions across the EU, as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, to continue to serve European institutional clients.
70;STT;State Street Corp;2018-06-09T10:00:26Z;Funds ‘snowball’ means big firms can only get bigger;Increasing concentration of assets in megafunds leads to warning about volatility;The asset management snowball is in full roll. The industry’s largest funds are hurtling along, attracting billions of dollars of assets, while small competitors struggle to keep up.From mutual funds and exchange traded funds to private equity and other alternative vehicles, the story is the same: the biggest products are growing rapidly as assets are increasingly concentrated in the megafunds.The implications for the market and consumers are huge.“As investors entrust their money to fewer products, assets come under the control of fewer individuals, who ultimately make fewer but larger decisions,” said Warren Miller, chief executive of Flowspring, a US data analysis group focused on asset managers.“This will lead to increasing volatility in financial markets, particularly in bear markets. Given that the main drivers of this trend show no signs of abating, we expect concentration to continue increasing.”According to Flowspring, the largest 1 per cent of mutual funds manage 45 per cent of industry assets. That figure is 72 times larger than all the assets managed by the bottom half. This is the highest concentration in two decades and has increased dramatically since the financial crisis. In 2009, the amount managed by the top 1 per cent was just over 30 times that of the bottom half. The ratio was as low as 22:1 in 2006.Mr Miller pointed to the causes of this concentration.The largest managers already benefit from economies of scale and the ability to increase revenues while keeping fixed costs low. They are better positioned to cut fees, thus attracting more investors.These managers can afford to invest significantly in technology, which further reduces costs and improves performance through effective data analysis. They are also better placed to meet rising regulatory costs, which for can cripple smaller managers.The bigger the advantage enjoyed by larger players, the more they can invest in flagship products, leading to lower fees stronger performance and funds that are more attractive to investors. Mr Miller argued that a bigger driver of growth was the strong performance of the funds rather than their ability to scoop up assets.Some of Europe’s largest funds have grown at breakneck speed in the past year. Pimco’s GIS Income fund, for example, was Europe’s best-selling in 2017 and has doubled in size over the past year, thanks to €30bn inflows, according to Morningstar (it has suffered outflows in each of the past three months).Two other European giants, M&G’s €27bn Optimal Income fund and JPMorgan’s €25bn Global Income fund, have each grown by about 30 per cent.Sean Collins, chief economist at the Investment Company Institute, the global trade body, reported a big move into lower-cost products. His analysis showed that 77 per cent of assets are held in the cheapest quarter of mutual funds. “What that means for smaller funds is they need to do something to reduce their fees or they need to find an area that is underserved or where they have expertise.”ETFs, low-cost competitors to mutual funds, have also experienced significant growth in the cheapest products.Data from ETFGI, which tracks the industry, show that fewer than 7 per cent of ETFs charge 10 basis points or less, yet these products hold more than a third of total assets. More than half of ETF assets are in products charging 20bp or less.“Cost is a criteria people look at very early on in their decision making because it’s one of the easiest things to get data on,” said Deborah Fuhr, managing partner at ETFGI. “Like when buying cornflakes, if all the products look the same and there is little difference in quality, consumers tend to go for the cheapest.”The ETF market is dominated by three players: iShares by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street.Ms Fuhr said it was hard for newer players to compete when offering routine products. The world’s most popular ETF, State Street’s $265bn SPY, which tracks the S&P 500 index of the largest US companies, turned 25 this year. Competing products from iShares and Vanguard are the second and fourth largest ETFs.“There is a huge first-mover advantage in ETFs,” said Ms Fuhr. “It’s harder for firms that have me-too products to attract assets.”The concentration story is similar elsewhere. Data on alternative investment managers from the European Securities and Markets Authority, the EU watchdog, show a concentration of assets in the largest products.Just 2 per cent of alternative funds offered to European investors, including real estate, private equity, hedge funds and funds of funds, are above €1bn in size yet they manage about 46 per cent of Europe’s total alternative assets. By contrast, about 95 per cent of alternative funds are below €500m and they hold just 40 per cent of assets.The main driver for funds flowing into the largest alternative funds is institutional investors under pressure to put cash to work. Only the biggest managers are equipped to take on their significant allocations.Last year private equity funds raised $484bn globally, according to Preqin, the data provider. The last time it was near that level was 2007, when $414bn flowed into the industry.The fundraising has been heavily skewed towards big commitments made to large players. Apollo raised $25bn in just a few months to build the largest buyout fund, while CVC Capital Partners attracted €16bn.Preqin’s analysis showed that the average size of the largest private equity funds, those of more than $1bn, has grown to $2.8bn over the past decade. “The gaps between the haves and have-nots is widening,” said Christopher Elvin, head of private equity products at Preqin. “There is a pool of the very largest managers — and then there is everyone else.”He said much of the money raised by the largest private equity funds in recent years is recycled capital. “They are putting it back with managers who have already produced good returns and, in some cases, increasing allocations,” he added. “It’s a natural circle.”
71;STT;State Street Corp;2018-05-17T23:56:55Z;Loan funds attract new money as interest rates rise;Asset class enjoyed its strongest inflows in more than a year in the past week;Investors put more money into bank loan funds in the past week than at any time in more than a year, as rising interest rates increased the attraction of floating-rate assets over traditional bonds.Loan funds had net inflows of $925m in the week to Wednesday, the largest intake in 55 weeks, according to EPFR Global.The flows came in the same week that the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury hit a seven-year high above 3 per cent, and after shorter-term rates rose sharply this year in line with expectations of Federal Reserve rate hikes.Loans typically pay a floating rate, which increases along with underlying rates. By contrast, rising rates erode the value of fixed-rate securities.Funds that invest in high-yield bonds, which pay a fixed rate, suffered outflows of $1.3bn in the past week, EPFR said.“We have definitely seen a lot of interest,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors, citing “the rising rate environment especially on the short end of the curve where the [Federal Reserve] does have a lot of influence”.The US central bank has been raising short-term rates since December 2015, but the pace has accelerated in the past year and a half, pushing short-term rates higher. US three-month Libor has risen to 2.33 per cent from 1.45 per cent at this time last year. Interest on bank loans is typically tied to Libor.Bank loans tend to be senior to other forms of borrowing, putting them high in the pecking order of payments if a company defaults. But these investments are not without risk, especially in times of strong demand.“We have been bullish, but we are starting to get more cautious,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors. “There has been a lot of new issuance in the first quarter. The problem when borrowers take on more floating rate debt as a percentage of their total liabilities is that it hastens their inability to pay that floating rate coupon.”The value of the US leveraged loan market passed the $1tn mark for the first time in recent weeks, sparking concern in some quarters. Lending standards can deteriorate when demand is strong, and so-called covenant lite loans, which have fewer investor protections, accounted for 80 per cent of the total issued in April, according to S&P Global.Elsewhere in the EPFR data, which covers the week ended on Wednesday, funds investing in Chinese equities attracted $545m of new cash, making for eight consecutive weeks of net inflows. That is the longest streak since the first quarter of 2013.Funds that buy shares of the Greater China area, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan as well as the mainland, drew more than $300m, the most since June 2015.Investors said enthusiasm for the Chinese economy and the inclusion of domestic Chinese stocks, known as A-shares, in the benchmark MSCI emerging market index next month were offsetting concerns about trade tensions with the US.US stock funds also had a good week, with net inflows of $8.8bn, a nine-week high, while emerging market bond funds remained under pressure. Net redemptions for the latter totalled $1.27bn.
72;STT;State Street Corp;2018-05-14T03:00:31Z;Scepticism persists on ‘ETFs for good’;Investors want responsible options but remain concerned about performance;Widespread protests against lax US gun laws erupted in February after the mass shooting of 17 people at a high school in Florida.The tragedy also sparked renewed debate about the role of investment managers in providing support for the firearms industry.Many US exchange traded funds follow broad equity benchmarks that require them to hold shares in gun makers and retailers that sell firearms. But perhaps surprisingly, some ETFs that employ environmental, social and governance metrics also hold gun companies, prompting questions about the rules governing these funds.In response to investor concerns, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, decided to exclude firearms manufacturers and retailers from a range of six ESG-focused equity and bond ETFs.BlackRock’s lead has not been followed by its competitors Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors, the second and third-largest players in the ETF industry. Both have said they will engage with gun companies but they remain under pressure to take more decisive action.The American Federation of Teachers, a union representing 1.7m members, said in April that pension schemes investing in tracker funds should demand new gun-free products. It has also urged pension fund trustees to consider divesting from all gun manufacturers.Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI, a London-based consultancy, says the variety of ESG-focused ETFs now available meant that investors needed to look carefully at their underlying construction before making any commitment.“There is no clear definition of what constitutes an ESG ETF and that has been a source of confusion for investors,” says Ms Fuhr.Around $17.7bn is invested globally across 140 ESG-focused ETFs, according to ETFGI. These include “themed” funds that focus on clean energy, climate change, water investment strategies and gender diversity. However, the majority of invested assets sit in broader products that evaluate ESG metrics across entire stock markets.Investor interest so far remains modest, with ESG-focused ETFs attracting net inflows of $4.2bn last year, compared with $3.7bn in 2016 — but is only a tiny fraction of the $654bn in new business registered by the ETFs globally in 2017.Rory Tobin, global head of ETFs for State Street Global Advisors, says investors accepted that ESG was “a force for good” but uncertainty over definitions has led to wide variations in investor appetite for ESG across European markets.The slow pace of adoption also reflects the mixed results of numerous studies of the links between ESG policies and the financial performance of companies.“We find that US investors are concerned that they will have to sacrifice performance and they are unable to quantify [how much],” notes Mr Tobin. “But in Europe, we find that ESG is being used successfully by some wealth managers to attract younger investors and millennials who are concerned about environmental and social issues.”ESG is being used successfully by some wealth managers to attract younger investors and millennials who are concerned about environmental and social issuesLoren Fox, director of research for Financial Times company Money-Media, says its data show 41 per cent of the largest US financial advisers used general ESG funds in 2017, up from 33 per cent in 2016, suggesting appetite for the theme is growing.MSCI, the indices and analytics provider, added its voice to the debate in November. It examined 1,600 companies globally and found those with high ESG ratings reported higher profitability and dividend yields. They also demonstrated stronger risk management skills, which translated into higher market valuations. Evidence of improvements in ESG scores also served as a useful indicator of better future financial performance.Nuveen, the $970bn US asset manager, has worked with MSCI to create customised ESG indices for ETFs. These take account of steps that companies are taking to improve their ESG scores and include additional carbon metrics that measure exposures to the threat of climate change.Martin Kremenstein, Nuveen’s head of ETFs, says: “We aimed to provide investors with ETFs that have been built using a consistent methodology.”Camilla Ritchie uses a range of ESG-focused ETFs in the sustainable investment portfolios that she runs at 7IM, the London-based wealth manager. “I mainly use regional equity ESG ETFs and often ask providers if they are planning any new launches as more product innovation would be helpful to sustainable investment portfolio managers,” says Ms Ritchie.Mr Kremenstein says the historic criticism that ESG required investors to surrender returns in order to feel good about their portfolio was now being widely questioned.“This criticism is no longer true as ESG-based ETFs can deliver risk-adjusted rewards comparable to conventional market capitalisation-weighted ETFs.”

74;STT;State Street Corp;2018-05-07T03:00:28Z;Winner-takes-all trend gains traction in US asset management;Mutual funds with lowest fees win the most investor inflows;The cut-throat price war among US asset managers intensified last year as mutual funds with the lowest fees won by far the most investor inflows, according to the Investment Company Institute, the trade association.Fees are becoming crucial in determining success or failure for investment managers, particularly in the US where actively managed funds that aim to pick winning stocks have lost market share to low-cost trackers that follow a broad benchmark.Forty-three per cent of US equity funds cut their charges last year, with active managers that invest in domestic stocks facing bruising competition.Only the cheapest active US domestic equity funds — those priced in the lowest 5 per cent of their peer group with fees of less than 56 basis points — could attract positive net inflows last year. New business for this group totalled just $3bn in 2017, a disappointing result given the strong US stock market performance which ended the year at an all-time high.The other 95 per cent of funds, which charge fees of 56bp or more, suffered combined outflows of $275bn, according to ICI’s analysis.“Competition continues to push down expense ratios as the industry meets cost-conscious investors’ demand for lower cost funds,” said Shelly Antoniewicz, ICI senior director of industry and financial analysis.Boston Consulting Group said downward pressure on fees was intensifying because of increased competition among asset managers for the business of large institutional clients and the growing bargaining power of large distributors selling funds to retail investors.Brent Beardsley, a senior partner at BCG, said a “winner-takes-all” trend was becoming stronger.Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager and historically the most aggressive competitor on fees, has gathered record breaking inflows for six consecutive years. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, enjoyed its best year, pulling in $367bn in net cash. BlackRock and Vanguard have played a major role in escalating a price war that has drawn in other passive fund managers, including State Street and Charles Schwab.The ICI analysis indicated that fee competition among passive managers had a significant effect on investor inflows into tracker funds.The cheapest quartile of domestic US equity trackers, with fees of less than 20bp, had inflows of $208bn in 2017. The remainder could only attract $20bn.A similar but less extreme split in flows was registered in passively managed international equity funds, and also bond and hybrid trackers.Divyesh Hindocha, a partner with Mercer, the investment consultant, said institutional investors were well placed to assess the risks and rewards of active management “but retail investors may be predisposed to focus purely on costs which should really be a secondary consideration to the quality of the fund offering. This could be harmful to wealth creation for retail investors,” he said.Mr Beardsley said profit margins for asset managers would fall. “Asset managers may know what is coming but they still have to take the actions necessary. Some bold moves will be required.”

The average equity holding across the 16 PPFs rose from 19 per cent to 28 per cent between 2008 and 2016.Allocations to alternatives (real estate, private equity, hedge funds, infrastructure and commodities) have also risen from less than 12 per cent in 2008 to an average of 16.2 per cent in 2016. This is still low.Property, which offers a hedge against inflation, has seen significant inflows from PPFs which have also increased their exposure to private equity.Infrastructure holdings remain low due to a lack of opportunities while hedge fund allocations are little changed since 2008.

77;STT;State Street Corp;2018-04-12T02:43:18Z;Fed proposes cuts to capital requirements for largest banks;Tweak to controversial leverage ratio will benefit custody banks in particular;The Federal Reserve is proposing to reduce the amount of capital the US’s biggest banks are required to hold by modifying the way a key leverage ratio is calculated.The more relaxed regime would benefit all eight US banks branded as systemically important, but it would do most for the custody banks State Street, BNY Mellon and Northern Trust.On Wednesday the Fed and another bank regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, announced a plan to revise a metric known as the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, which has long been a source of discontent at big banks.The Fed said: “The proposed changes seek to retain a meaningful calibration of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards while not discouraging firms from participating in low-risk activities.”The central bank, which is now led by appointees of Donald Trump, announced the proposal with no fanfare.But Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, which wants tougher regulation of Wall Street, said: “This rule would be easily the most significant rollback of post-crisis risk controls for the largest banks since Trump took office.”The central bank said the changes would reduce the aggregate amount of tier one capital required by the US’s eight systemically important banks by a net $400m, or approximately 0.04 per cent, at the level of their holding companies.But that figure was described as “wildly misleading” by Mr Stanley. He said $400m was the amount of capital the banks could immediately return to their shareholders if the proposal were finalised today.“But this rule could lower capital requirements by many tens or even hundreds of billions in capital if the banks change their balance sheets to load up on assets that regulators assign a low risk weight — such as AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities before the crisis, or Greek debt today,” Mr Stanley said.The change would replace a static leverage ratio with a more “dynamic” metric that takes into account the different risk profiles of banks. The custody banks, which specialise in keeping financial assets safe, tend to engage in mostly low-risk activity.Work on the proposal began under the Fed’s former regulatory chief, Dan Tarullo, an appointee of Barack Obama. He has now been replaced by Trump pick Randal Quarles.Big banks are currently required to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of more than 5 per cent — comprising a minimum 3 per cent plus a 2 per cent buffer. For lower-risk institutions the proposal would reduce the buffer to 1 per cent.The Fed did not release estimates of how the proposal would reduce the capital requirements of individual banks.Mr Stanley said: “During the 2008 crisis leverage capital was by far the best protection against bank failure . . . This action is short-sighted and irresponsible and shows that regulators are caving in to the agenda of too big to fail banks.” 
78;STT;State Street Corp;2018-04-11T09:40:08Z;Fidelity fires broadside in battle to cut fund fees;Bermuda-based group launches range of Irish-domiciled equity tracker funds;Fidelity International has returned fire on its rivals in the ferocious price war being fought by investment managers in Europe — with a new range of low-cost index-tracking funds.Bermuda-based Fidelity is to launch six Irish-domiciled equity index funds and trim fees on three UK-domiciled index funds in response to price competition.BlackRock, DWS, Lyxor, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors have already cut fees for tracker funds, trading punches in an effort to win market share.Lyxor took the competition to new heights in March with the creation of a range of 16 core exchange traded funds with expense ratios ranging from as low as four basis points to 12bp.Fidelity’s new Irish-domiciled funds will track broad equity benchmarks covering the US, Europe, Japan, Asia Pacific ex-Japan, developed, global and emerging markets. Annual management fees will be between 6bp and 20bp.It has also reduced the ongoing charges figure on its UK-domiciled US, world and emerging markets index funds by 1bp to bring the fees into line with the new Irish range.Nick King, head of indexing and exchange-delivered products at Fidelity, said the decision to create the Irish-domiciled range was “certainly not” related to Brexit.Fund managers will be unable to freely “passport” [sell] UK-domiciled funds across Europe after the UK leaves the EU. These restrictions will not apply to funds domiciled in Dublin or Luxembourg where investment decisions are delegated back to portfolio managers based in London.“Fidelity has always maintained separate fund ranges for the UK versus the rest of the world. Our existing UK-domiciled index funds can be passported but they are not distributed or actively marketed in Europe as they are predominantly designed for UK investors with only a sterling share class,” said Mr King.The price war escalated further on Thursday after DWS (formerly Deutsche Asset Management) announced fee cuts for five ETFs linked to the US Treasury and Euro cash markets.DWS reduced all-in fees to between 10 basis points and 17bp from a range between 15bp and 20bp previously.Hortense Bioy, a director at Morningstar, the data provider said the latest round of fee cuts showed that price war was “clearly far from over”.“We are likely to see rivals respond to these new price cuts by reducing their fees too,“ said Ms Bioy, adding that this would put pressure on revenues earned by smaller ETF managers.The price cuts by Fidelity, which is led by Abigail Johnson, and DWS coincide with a slowdown in new-business growth for ETF providers in Europe. Investors ploughed $27.4bn in new cash into European-listed ETFs in the first three months of 2018, a fall of 22.6 per cent when compared with the first quarter of the previous year, according to ETFGI, a London consultancy.Concerns about the threat of a trade war between the US and China have dented investors’ confidence. This led to withdrawals from European-focused equity ETFs in March.
79;STT;State Street Corp;2018-04-06T04:01:07Z;Fund managers forced to confront endemic gender pay gap;Asset managers report even bigger gaps than rest of UK financial services industry;In conference rooms across the City of London and Edinburgh in recent weeks, hordes of ashen-faced women have sat through presentations detailing how much more their companies pay their male colleagues over them.The fund management industry’s gender pay gap was long-suspected to be wide. But the disclosures, mandated by the UK government for companies with more than 250 domestic staff, have shown the extent of the disparity. Even for an industry that has always had a heavy gender imbalance, the revelations have caused consternation.“It’s a difficult environment here with little buy-in from the top on dealing with this,” said a woman in a senior position at an asset manager with a particularly large gap.Bev Shah, chief executive of City Hive, a network for women in asset management, said no one should be surprised by the big gaps: “You just have to walk around the investment floor and open your eyes to know what the numbers will look like.”The average pay gap across asset management groups is 28.5 per cent, while the bonus gap is 55.4 per cent. This compares with a national average pay gap of 9.7 per cent and financial services pay gap of 22.2 per cent.At the most extreme, Wellington Management, the $1tn US fund company with just under 300 staff in the UK, reported a pay gap of 44.7 per cent and a bonus gap of 84.6 per cent. This means women receive £55.30 for every £100 earned by male colleagues, while for those receiving a bonus, women take home just £15.40 for every £100 paid to men.Though the data do not indicate that companies are paying men and women differently for doing the same job, the disparity is more a sign of companies having more higher-paid male workers than female. Many of the managers with the largest gaps attribute the difference to a lack of women in senior positions. With companies forced to report gender pay figures every year, the emphasis now turns to what they will do to narrow gaps over the long term.Wellington said it was confident it pays men and women equally for work of equal value. It added: “Diversity of talent and thought are central to delivering high quality service and investment outcomes for our clients. As a result, we remain steadfastly committed to achieving greater levels of diversity and gender balance.”John Streur, chief executive of Calvert Research and Management, a $10bn group that specialises in responsible investment, said Wellington’s bonus disparity showed how men hold most of the high-paid portfolio jobs positions at the company. “There is no case for having these roles dominated by men,” he said.Calvert is a subsidiary of Eaton Vance, the $450bn US manager, neither of which employ more than 250 workers in the UK and so are not required to publish the data. Mr Streur said he intended to publish his company’s pay data voluntarily.Investec, which manages $141bn of assets, reported the second biggest pay gap at 43.4 per cent, although its bonus gap of 57.8 per cent is more comparable with other managers. The company said the pay gap was due to it historically having a high proportion of men in senior roles — though it added that it has several initiatives to address this imbalance.It has set a target of having 30 per cent of women in senior leadership roles by 2023 and changed recruitment processes to ensure shortlists and interview panels are balanced. It has also introduced diversity training and improved leave benefits.Pimco, the $1.75tn bond manager, reported a pay gap of 39 per cent and bonus gap of 81 per cent — the second largest among those reporting. Much of the disparity is understood to be due to the company having fewer women in portfolio management roles. Pimco pointed to its involvement in several industry initiatives to promote gender diversity.Another manager with a large bonus gap, T Rowe Price with 72.9 per cent, said the disparity was partly due to it being an independent asset manager and not subject to bonus cap restrictions that insurer or bank-affiliated groups fall under. “As a firm with a higher concentration of more highly compensated roles in the UK . . . there was always a possibility we would be towards the higher end of the range,” said Robert Higginbotham, head of global investment management services.At the other end of the scale, a handful of managers reported numbers that were below the wider financial services average and much closer to the national average.State Street Global Advisors, the $2.8tn US manager, reported a pay gap of 11.8 per cent and a bonus gap of 24 per cent. The wider State Street banking group first set goals of improving gender diversity in 2012 and has continued to raise its targets. It aims to have women representing 36 per cent of staff at senior vice-president level and above by 2023.BlueBay Asset Management, the $60bn fixed income specialist, reported the smallest pay gap of 8.8 per cent, with a bonus gap of 38 per cent. James Brace, the company’s general counsel and head of diversity, said the narrower pay gap was due to less disparity among senior employees’ salaries. “We believe we are an employer of choice and paying people fairly, being inclusive and creating a diverse work environment supports this objective,” he said.Another manager that appeared at the more favourable end of the scale was Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh-based company with £180bn under management. It reported a pay gap of 17.9 per cent and a bonus gap of 25.5 per cent. However, its numbers were skewed because its analysis did not include the company’s 43 partners, who are predominately men. Under the rules, partners who are deemed as self-employed do not need to be included in the report, though several accounting firms that operate under such structures included partners’ pay in their analyses.All eyes will be on how the industry responds to the first year of reporting and whether initiatives will pay off. But Ms Shah warned that there are no easy fixes and said she would worry if they narrow too quickly. “Promoting and hiring just because of gender is detrimental — no matter what the job, it should always go to the best candidate on merit,” she said.“There are many studies that show a business case for more women in the workplace and improvements to the bottom line. This is a happy outcome but should not be the reason for evening up the scale. Gender equality is a good enough reason.”Follow on Twitter: @owenwalker0
80;STT;State Street Corp;2018-03-12T04:14:05Z;Volatility drives first ETF outflows in two years;February shake-up forced $23.5bn out of funds that track US equities;The blast of volatility that shook Wall Street in February drove investors to pull money from exchange traded funds that track US equities for the first time in two years.The US withdrawals have raised questions over whether the ETF industry can sustain its breakneck pace of expansion after four consecutive years of record breaking growth that have pushed global ETF assets above the $5tn mark.Investors have poured more than $1tn in new money into US-listed equity ETFs over the past five years, helping to fuel a bull run for the US stock market which hit an all-time high on January 26. But worries about high valuations and rising interest rates triggered a correction for the benchmark S&P 500 index which dropped 10 per cent by February 8 in volatile trading conditions.The correction was accompanied by net outflows of $23.5bn last month from ETFs that track US and Canadian equities, according to ETFGI, a consultancy.Investors also pulled $5bn in February from ETFs linked to bonds issued by US companies amid concerns that the US central bank could increase monetary tightening in response to inflationary pressures.State Street, the manager of the largest ETF that tracks the S&P 500 index, saw net outflows of $25.3bn from its US ETF business last month while Invesco, which oversees the most popular ETF tracking the Nasdaq index, registered US withdrawals of $2bn. WisdomTree, the New York-listed manager that some observers believe is a potential target for others that want to expand their ETF presence, saw US outflows of around $790m in February. In contrast, BlackRock and Vanguard, the world’s largest asset managers, both attracted positive US inflows, but at a slower rate than last year.Matthew Bartolini, who oversees US ETF research for State Street, said the US stock market had “stumbled [last month] after an exuberant sprint” in January. He added that the “big question” was whether the developments in February marked the end of the bull market for US stocks and bonds.He said the recovery for the S&P 500 after February’s correction suggested that the stock market had “got away with just a skinned knee, not a broken ankle”.Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted that its proprietary Bull and Bear barometer returned to signal a “buy” for equities at the start of March after surging to an extreme level in February and delivering a clear “sell” warning.Karim Chedid, an investment strategist with BlackRock which recently upgraded US equities to “overweight” from “neutral”, said “the correction in February does not reflect a change in macroeconomic or corporate fundamentals which continue to be strong. The pullback in risky assets may even present some attractive entry points”.Earnings for the US stock market are forecast to rise by around 19 per cent in 2018 but uncertainty over the outlook for equities has been amplified by President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium, a move that threatens to spark a damaging trade war with the EU and China.That threat led an acceleration in outflows in the first week of March with investors pulling a further $10bn from US equity funds, according to EPFR, the data provider.“A trade war would represent a real source of uncertainty. President Trump’s new tariff policy will have a larger impact on fund flows if the situation escalates,” said Matthieu Guignard, global head of product development for Amundi, the French asset manager.Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI, noted that February’s outflows from US ETFs were not accompanied by withdrawals in either Europe or Asia.“European listed ETFs have attracted inflows of around $25.9bn already this year. Growth should accelerate as regulatory changes, such as Mifid II, will help to spur adoption across Europe where usage by retail investors in particular remains far lower than in the US,” said Ms Fuhr.Assets held in ETFs listed in Europe will almost triple from $811bn currently to around $2.2tn by the end of 2022, according to Citi, the US investment bank.“We expect ETFs share of the overall European fund market to rise to match that in the US. ETFs represent 17.7 per cent of the $19.3tn US fund market, but currently only 4.7 per cent of the $17.4tn invested in European funds,” said Citi.

82;STT;State Street Corp;2018-03-11T16:43:07Z;Passive investment and ownerless companies;The great benefits of tracker funds come, inevitably, with costs;Passive investment funds, which aim to track market indices rather than outperform them, do not control the majority of investor capital — yet. But they are already dominating the top positions on shareholder registers at the world’s biggest companies.Of the 10 largest UK companies by market capitalisation, eight have BlackRock and Vanguard, huge US fund managers that focus on passive products, as their largest and second-largest shareholders, respectively. In the US, only tech founders’ personal stakes interfere with passives investors’ supremacy at big companies. At smaller ones, the passives are pushed out of pole position more often — but are almost always significant owners.From one perspective, this is a very good thing indeed. Passive products offer a way for savers to get exposure to key asset classes at a very low cost. Most active managers, after all, fail to beat the indices after fees, and picking managers is not much easier than picking stocks themselves. If fewer smart people are paid to engage in the zero-sum game of security selection, good.Yet the rise of passive investment is worrisome, too. It is the job of a corporate board to keep an eye on management. But who watches the watchers? The answer at one point was investors, who have skin in the game. The big passive investors, however, own shares in tens of thousands of companies. Keeping a close eye on all of them would be a massive task and their incentive for doing so is diluted. Passive funds more closely resemble pieces of market infrastructure than owners. They are not structured to supervise corporate governance. They are structured to keep costs low, and the two are at odds. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street (another big passive manager) together have $14tn in assets under management. They have less than 100 people on their governance teams.The tensions inherent to passive investing are rising to the surface. Passive funds companies came under pressure after the recent school shooting in Florida, for their ownership stakes in gun companies. Proxy advisers — to which passive funds delegate much of their governance responsibilities — are under increasing scrutiny. Two companies, ISS and Glass Lewis, dominate the business. Critics complain they have outsized influence and are insufficiently transparent.The passive companies are aware they need to do more. They have committed to increasing their governance staff and pushing their governance standards. This is laudable. The sheer volume of companies they invest in means they will always, to a large extent, be box-ticking. But they need to box-tick as thoroughly and efficiently as possible, a job for which they are badly understaffed at present.Consider, at the same time, implications of passive investors becoming more active on governance. There is always going to be a very small number of dominant passive fund companies. Scale is what keeps the costs low. Do we want a few fund companies casting the decisive votes over, for example, corporate social responsibility policies? When a board election is, in effect, a fight over strategy, do we trust the passive managers to make the call?Probably not. The success of any individual company will always be of minor importance to them. At best, they can encourage the right structural policies for how board members are elected and how boards are run.The rise of passive investment has done a great deal of good. In terms of the supervisory role of the investor — a key to strong markets — it comes with inevitable costs. It is up to other investors to fill the gaps it leaves behind.
83;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink.

84;STT;State Street Corp;2018-03-03T07:00:27Z;Passive fund managers face showdown in US gun debate;BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have promised to raise corporate governance levels;BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard struck an analogous note this year as one after another of the world’s largest fund managers announced they were beefing up corporate governance and stewardship in 2018.The fund giants, which collectively oversee $14tn in assets, called on companies to make a positive contribution to society, as they unveiled plans for their corporate governance teams.“Companies must benefit all their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers and the communities in which they operate,” said Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive.The trio have faced accusations in the past that they do not do enough to monitor controversial issues, including climate change and excessive executive pay.Now they collectively face their biggest test yet to show just how seriously they are taking their renewed focus on stewardship as the debate over the role of gunmakers and distributors intensifies, following the deadly massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida last month.The fractious discussion around gun control has highlighted the challenges BlackRock and rival passive fund managers face as they demand better behaviour from companies and led to questions about whether they can truly exert influence on companies they invest in.“[The passive managers] are out with their huge marketing pitches right now on corporate governance, but you wonder how serious it really is,” says a senior figure in the fund industry.But each of the companies has been vocal about the important role passive fund managers can play in driving up standards in businesses across the word this year. Their argument is that they are long-term investors that have no choice but to stay invested, meaning stewardship is vital to ensuring a company performs strongly.Tim Buckley, chief executive of Vanguard, told a conference this year: “Corporate governance is an absolute priority . . . We care about governance, not strategy.”The $5tn fund house plans to grow its corporate governance team by 50 per cent in 2018 and is setting up a new European stewardship team, as part of its efforts to drive up global standards across Europe. It also co-signed a letter calling for companies to move away from short-termism.Mr Fink, meanwhile, called for a “new model of shareholder engagement” in his yearly letter to companies in January and said the $6.3tn asset manager would double the size of its corporate governance team.In this letter Mr Fink wrote: “A company’s ability to manage environmental, social, and governance matters demonstrates the leadership and good governance that is so essential to sustainable growth, which is why we are increasingly integrating these issues into our investment process.”SSgA said it would clamp down on executive pay. Nick Good, co-head of SSgA’s global SPDR business, said at a recent conference: “We are stewards of a large part of the US economy, and it’s important to do that properly. If we didn’t do that, we’d open ourselves up to opprobrium from our investors. We can do more, but it’s a step up from where we were.”The debate on gun control is among the most high-profile stewardship issues fund managers will grapple with this year. There are questions over whether gun manufacturers and distributors are doing enough to make arms safer and ensure they do not fall into the wrong hands.BlackRock, Vanguard and SSgA are all large shareholders in gunmakers and distributors through their index funds. This means they invest in companies such as American Outdoor Brands, formerly known as Smith & Wesson, and Sturm Ruger because they are constituents of an index, rather than based on the investment case.In the wake of the recent Florida school shooting, which left 17 people dead, BlackRock and SSgA have said they will engage with gunmakers.Unlike an active manager, which can sell its shares in a company if it disagrees with how the company operates or believes it could face potential losses, passive fund managers have to hold on to their stocks in line with the index. Without the threat of divestment, there are questions over what real influence they have.“We will be engaging with weapons manufacturers and distributors to seek greater transparency from them on the ways that they will support the safe and responsible use of their products,” SSgA said. “We will also seek to ensure that any shareholder resources used to influence legislation and regulations, or fund other advocacy efforts is consistent with the company’s public views.”Vanguard did not comment directly on its interactions with gunmakers, saying it believes it “can be more effective in advocating for change by not publicly disclosing the nature of engagements with portfolio companies”.It added: “With respect to engagement, Vanguard engages companies on a wide variety of governance issues ranging from board composition, executive compensation, and director elections, to oversight of risk and strategy.”What impact they will have remains to be seen, but the news that the three fund houses have stepped up their efforts on wider stewardship issues has been widely welcomed by others in the investment industry, which is coming under intense pressure from the public and politicians to better police the companies they own.Deborah Gilshan, governance and stewardship director at Standard Life Aberdeen, the UK’s largest listed fund house, described it as a “good thing”.“The more capital that can be used to steward companies, the more pressure boards get to look at these issues, that can only be a good thing for investors and savers,” she added.But that increased pressure will be from a low base. The trio currently have less than 100 people managing the governance of trillions of dollars worth of investments across thousands of companies in hundreds of countries around the world.One senior individual involved in stewardship suggested that even with plans to increase staff numbers, the fund houses are likely to have more people working in marketing than governance, which begs the question just how important they see the issue, especially given the rising expectations and rhetoric for how active they should and will be.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, an non-profit that campaigns for a better investment system, says the voting records of passive fund managers in 2018 would show how seriously they are taking their stewardship duties, arguing that a vote against management is a key governance tool. “The vote is the key risk management tool because [passive fund managers] cannot exit [their investment],” she said.According to data from Proxy Insight, BlackRock and Vanguard backed management proposals at annual meetings at least 90 per cent of the time in the year to June 2017, while SSgA supported almost 87 per cent. In contrast, Allianz Global Investors backed management just 77 per cent of the time.The fund managers say they engage behind the scenes, rather than routinely publicly criticise or vote against companies at annual meetings, but will escalate if necessary.Ms Howarth says: “It has been thought for too long that passive meant sitting back and tracking an index. That is clearly inadequate,” she said. “It is really important that the passive fund managers invest in building world-class teams on corporate governance. Sheer size means their votes have a hell of an impact.”A chief executive of a rival asset manager said BlackRock, Vanguard and SSgA have the capacity to drive up standards at companies around the world. “The proof will be in the pudding,” he added.Many individual investors are connected to the firearms industry — even if they do not realise it.This is because many pension funds, mutual funds and exchange traded funds are invested in gun stocks. More than 40 ETFs invest in gun stocks, such as BlackRock’s iShares Russell 2000 ETF, State Street’s SPDR portfolio 600 Small Cap ETF and Vanguard’s Small Cap ETF.BlackRock and Vanguard are now among the top shareholders of three publicly traded gun companies: Sturm Ruger, American Outdoor Brands and Vista Outdoor.Although there have been suggestions that passive funds could shun gun stocks if index providers opted to remove them, such a move is likely to be divisive. This is because while some investors see guns as a so-called “sin” stock, others are happy to back the sector.Joe Linhares, European chief executive of Russell Investments, the asset manager, says one of the big challenges for asset managers when it comes to stewardship issues is that investors rarely agree on what makes something morally good and bad.“Everyone’s exclusions are different. Some clients don’t like oil companies, some don’t want firearms. Some don’t want animal testing. Where does it start and where does it stop?”A spokesperson for BlackRock said: “We are working with clients who want to exclude from their portfolios weapons manufacturers or other companies that don’t align with their values. We currently have more than $200bn in assets under management for clients in these types of portfolios.” Attracta Mooney
85;STT;State Street Corp;2018-02-20T05:00:39Z;Low volatility funds fail to protect investors;Specialist ETFs lose more than mainstream US stocks in market correction;"A number of exchange traded funds (ETFs) designed to protect investors from sharp stock market gyrations lost more money than mainstream US stocks during a sell-off this month, underperforming in precisely the conditions in which they were meant to thrive.Low volatility ETFs, launched by asset managers including BlackRock and State Street, were billed as a way of buying the least volatile parts of a market or index such as the S&P 500 index. They mimic the return of a big index but are weighted towards low volatility stocks and are designed to lose less in the event of a correction.Yet, instead of protecting UK investors against the sharp sell-off in US stocks this month, the three ETFs tracking low volatility versions of the S&P 500 index lost more than the mainstream index over some of the most volatile days.The US stock market slide began on February 2, following the publication of positive US jobs data. Over the next seven days, the S&P 500 index fell 2.9 per cent, while investors in Blackrock’s $1.4bn iShares Edge S&P 500 Minimum Volatility Ucits ETF lost 4.1 per cent over the period and State Street’s SPDR S&P 500 was down 4.4 per cent in total return terms.Another fund designed to give a higher yield than mainstream stocks was PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Ucits ETF. It lost less over the week, at just under 2 per cent. But over the month to February 15 it had also lost more than the index.Investors in SPDR S&P 500 Ucits ETF have also experienced a more turbulent ride than the broader index over six months, according to risk data from FE Analytics, with the share price fluctuating more dramatically than the mainstream benchmark.Critics say US low volatility strategies are vulnerable to interest rate rises because they are more heavily weighted towards sectors such as utilities, which are vulnerable when rates and bond yields rise, and were punished in the recent correction.“People walk into low volatility ETFs thinking they will deliver the same performance as the wider market with lower volatility. But that is not the case,” said Shaun Port, chief investment officer at Nutmeg, an online investment platform. “Minimum volatility ETFs are also a bet on bond yields and you have to be cautious about using them.”Analysts said former low volatility stocks could become higher-risk as the economic climate shifted.“Among the potential pitfalls to low volatility investing is the reliance on past risk data,” said Hortense Bioy, director of passive fund research at Morningstar. “There is no guarantee that the least volatile stocks historically will remain so going forward. In fact, these stocks may become more volatile as more money flows into them and their valuations increase, as has been witnessed in recent years.”Low volatility ETFs tend to favour bond-like stocks which have offered steady dividends in a period of ultra-low interest rates. However, they have become increasingly popular and expensive as money has flowed into asset managers’ low volatility products.Higher interest rates benefit financial stocks and other sectors that have traditionally been seen as higher risk; these are also the sectors to which low volatility ETFs are less exposed.BlackRock limits the extent to which its iShares S&P 500 Minimum Volatility ETF can diverge from the S&P 500 index to manage its stock and sector risk. But the ETF still looks very different from a mainstream US fund, with far less exposure to tech giants such as Amazon and Apple and greater exposure to utilities and consumer staples stocks.BlackRock and State Street insisted their low volatility funds fulfil their function over the long term. State Street added that low volatility ETFs perform best in periods of extended downturn but cannot be expected to work in all conditions or in short periods of volatility.iShares said that on the basis of a net asset value return, based on the change in the value of the fund’s assets rather than share price, its low volatility ETF had outperformed the S&P 500 index during the period of volatility.Anthony Kruger of iShares European specialist sales team said: “The iShares S&P Min Vol ETF has performed as it was designed to during the recent market sell-off and has outperformed the parent benchmark on a relative basis.”Oliver Smith, portfolio manager at IG, said: “Amid the recent sell-off, US low volatility ETFs have all performed in lock step and performed worse than the mainstream index.”"
86;STT;State Street Corp;2018-02-18T07:00:26Z;Vanguard creates new European stewardship team;$5tn asset manager has faced criticism for failing to influence corporate policies;Vanguard is to establish a new European stewardship team in a push by the world’s second largest asset manager to drive up corporate governance standards across Europe.The creation of the new London team follows mounting criticism of Vanguard for failing to use its clout as one of the world’s largest investors to influence corporate policies on contentious issues such as climate change and executive pay.Adrienne Monley has been appointed head of investment stewardship for Europe to lead a team that is expected to grow to five members before the end of 2018.“We take our obligation to advocate in our investors’ best interests very seriously across the globe. This is the right time to establish a new team in London, given the growth of our ownership in European companies,” said Glenn Booraem, Vanguard’s head of corporate governance.Ms Monley is currently a strategist in the US stewardship team that historically has managed all of Vanguard’s proxy voting and engagement activities worldwide. Vanguard also plans to expand its global stewardship team to around 30 by the end of this year.Mick McAteer, co-founder of the Financial Inclusion Centre, a non-profit investor campaign group, said Vanguard’s move was “a positive development”.“There is nothing contradictory about running low-cost passive management funds that benefit investors and good, active stewardship and governance. The key test now will be whether this new team delivers results,” said Mr McAteer.Bill McNabb, Vanguard chairman, wrote a letter this month appealing to company bosses to step up their efforts to discuss their long-term strategic plans and responses to risks, such as global warming, with investors.The letter was cosigned by nine other investment groups overseeing $15tn in assets including State Street, Neuberger Berman and Hermes along with Calstrs, the second-largest US public pension scheme.“There are issues of enduring interest to us as long-term investors as we seek a deeper understanding of our investee companies to inform our voting and engagement activities,” said Mr McNabb.Pennsylvania-based Vanguard’s $5tn assets are mainly held in large index-tracking funds and it regards itself as a permanent shareholder in all of the world’s largest publicly traded companies. Unlike a traditional active investment manager, Vanguard is unable to sell out if it disagrees with the strategy of a company, so it views dialogue and engagement as core to its stewardship approach. This has developed into a policy of “quiet diplomacy” pursued via private meetings with companies. Senior Vanguard staff insist this approach has yielded positive results but critics question why its voting record has rarely demonstrated any public dissent to the policies of its investee companies.Vanguard voted in favour of more than 90 per cent of US company management proposals on executive pay, boards of directors and governance structures that were proposed at 3,946 shareholder meetings in the year to June 2017.The record in Europe is almost identical, with Vanguard voting in favour of more than 90 per cent of company management proposals in the UK, Germany and France over the past three years, according to Proxy Insight, the data provider.
87;STT;State Street Corp;2018-02-12T03:41:20Z;Index error causes Carillion losses for ETF investors;S&P Dow Jones Indices failed to remove company from dividend-focused index;An error by the index provider S&P Dow Jones Indices led to unexpected losses for investors in a popular exchange traded fund following the collapse of Carillion, the UK’s second-largest construction group.Carillion announced in July that it would axe dividend payouts to investors following a shock profit warning, which resulted in the departure of its then chief executive Richard Howson.That should have resulted in its exclusion in December from the UK Dividend Aristocrats ETF that tracks an index made up of companies with a long history of paying high or rising dividends, as calculated by S&P Dow Jones Indices. The ETF is managed by State Street Global Advisors, the asset management arm of State Street, the US bank.Carillion was allocated a 0.54 per cent weighting in the ETF, which held assets of £101.8m at the time of the December rebalancing. This translates into a £550,000 stake, which the ETF should have sold in December.Charles Stanley, the UK wealth manager, contacted both State Street and S&P Dow Jones Indices in January after identifying the problem.“Our chief concern is the interests of our clients. While we understand errors can occur, it is our view that the both the index provider and the ETF manager have a fiduciary responsibility to their end investors to ensure that they are not adversely affected by this oversight,” said Lynn Hutchinson, senior ETF analyst at Charles Stanley.Noel Archard, global head of product for State Street’s ETF business, said: “We have asked S&P if they intend to restate the benchmark returns — essentially adjusting the index as if Carillion had been removed in December. It is our understanding at this time, that per S&P’s review, the benchmark will not be adjusted for the error.”A spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices declined to comment on any discussions with Charles Stanley.“We did determine that Carillion should have been removed from the S&P UK High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index at the December 2017 rebalance. On January 17, after having gone into administration, Carillion was removed from the index in accordance with the index methodology,” said the S&P spokesperson.
88;STT;State Street Corp;2018-02-11T05:00:29Z;ETF market smashes through $5tn barrier after record month;Tectonic shift causes profound changes across global asset management industry;Investors ploughed more than $100bn in new cash into exchange traded funds in January, a record monthly inflow that helped drive assets held in ETFs globally above the $5tn mark for the first time.The surge in January follows four consecutive years of record breaking inflows into ETFs, a tectonic shift that is sending shockwaves across the entire asset management industry.Rising disenchantment with the high fees and inconsistent performance of traditional mutual funds that try to pick winning stocks is encouraging investors worldwide to move into low-cost trackers that follow a broad index. This growing shift is forcing some asset managers to pursue acquisitions to defend their business models and is driving up closures of actively managed mutual funds.Net new inflows into exchange traded funds and products reached $105.7bn in January, according to preliminary data from ETFGI, a London-based consultancy. The final total is expected to be higher when January data from the Australian ETF market become available.“The ETF industry has passed the $5tn mark for assets far more quickly than almost anyone anticipated,” said Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI. “But ETFs represent only a small fraction of invested assets worldwide. We are still only in the early stages of ETF adoption in many regions and there is huge potential for further ETF growth in fixed income markets globally.“Progress toward the $10tn milestone may also prove faster than currently expected if market conditions remain favourable.”BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, attracted net inflows of just over $28bn into its iShares ETF arm in January, up 46 per cent on the same month a year ago.Pennsylvania-based Vanguard, the world’s second largest asset manager, had a quieter start to 2018 with net ETF inflows of just over $11bn in January, down around 30 per cent on the same month last year.The four-year surge in ETF inflows has coincided with an extended rally in the US stock market, with the benchmark S&P 500 index hitting an all-time high on January 26.The first US listed ETF, known as SPY, tracks the S&P 500 index.SPY, which is run by State Street Global Advisors, marked its 25th anniversary in January by breaking above the $300bn milestone.That threshold was passed after State Street registered net ETF inflows of just under $30bn in January, more than 10 times higher than the same month last year.Market strategists have been paying close attention to ETF and mutual fund flows as a barometer of the health of the prolonged bull market in US equities, which have traded towards the top of their historic valuation range.Increases this year in long-term US interest rates towards 3 per cent have encouraged investors to pull money out of US Treasuries and high-yield corporate bonds and to rotate into equities. More than $3bn was withdrawn from high-yield bond ETFs in January alone, while more than $41bn flowed into ETFs that track North American equities.Bank of America Merrill Lynch warned at the start of February that its proprietary Bull and Bear indicator had surged to an extreme level, delivering a clear “sell” signal for equities. BofAML has warned for months that a correction in US equities was increasingly likely and the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its largest ever one-day points fall on February 5, a day of wild volatility on Wall Street that was followed by further sharp falls across stock markets worldwide last week.Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BofAML, said corporate earnings reports would act as a crucial determinant as to whether the equity sell off was a temporary correction or the start of a bear market.“The best sign that companies do not believe that profits have peaked would be resumption of strong corporate buybacks in coming weeks,” said Mr Hartnett.BlackRock said the US stock market slide was “mainly driven by an unwinding of popular trades betting on low equity volatility”. Although the short-term outlook for equities was highly uncertain, the correction provided “an opportunity to add risk to portfolios,” said BlackRock.Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer of UBS Wealth Management, said “while volatility may persist in the very near term, we remain confident that the [equity] bull market remains intact.“We may have moved from being ‘overdue’ for a pullback to approaching ‘overdone’ with this sell-off.”
89;STT;State Street Corp;2018-02-09T16:43:15Z;Asset managers: a fitting conclusion;For large institutions this is a time to avoid investments that track others;Only one thing rises sharply in bear markets, goes the old joke: correlation. For the largest institutions — pension schemes, sovereign wealth funds and the like — it pays to sidestep investments which closely track all other asset prices.Start with some of the largest listed fund management groups. In a time of extreme market volatility, avoid those which move most closely with equities, assets that are highly sensitive to shifts in sentiment.In the US, home to nine of the top 10 managers by assets under management, the performance of an index of the largest — including BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors — has matched closely that of the S&P 500 over two decades. Generally, confusing correlation with causality is a mistake, but in this case, one could make an exception. Outflows from US equity funds last week (to Wednesday) of $34bn were treble those coming out of European and Asian products.When America sneezes, market clichés spread. As such, it is worth noting that Europe’s listed portfolio managers do not always exhibit the same link as their largest US peers. True, shares in London-listed Schroders do exhibit a close link with the FTSE and broader European indices. Smaller ones, such as Jupiter Asset Management, have much less quantitative connection. Europe’s largest, Amundi, has too little trading history as a quoted company to measure accurately.Count on actions speaking louder than words.

90;STT;State Street Corp;2018-02-05T04:00:40Z;Stock lending by ETF operators worries investors;Fund managers must take care over quality of collateral;When a hedge fund wants to bet a price of a company will fall, it often turns to an exchange traded fund.Using a process known as securities lending, the ETF will loan stock in a company to a hedge fund (for a fee or other benefit) and receive collateral in return, usually in the form of either stocks or cash.The hedge fund can then profit by selling the stock immediately and then buying it back when it falls in value — a process known as short selling. For the ETF, securities lending generates extra returns, which managers say can help reduce costs and improve performance.But some investors are concerned about loaning out stocks, arguing the income generated by securities lending is unlikely to offset the risks, especially in market downturns.Ben Seager-Scott, chief investment strategist at the Tilney Group, is wary of the technique. “It does add an extra level of complexity to otherwise plain vanilla trackers or ETFs and could add to the risks in periods of market shocks,” he says.One concern for investors is the quality of collateral an ETF accepts when it lends out its holdings. Although ETF providers typically receive stocks or cash that, when exchanged, are worth more than the securities loaned out, some worry this would not be enough in times of market stress.Mr Seager-Scott says: “I see a number of physical ETFs that often have the majority of their securities out on loan with seriously mismatched collateral — for example, holding equity collateral against government bonds on loan.“Day to day, this tends not to have an impact — but it could well do if we had another market crisis.”Theo Nijssen, a director at Kempen Capital Management, says that he has often asked funds to stop engaging in the practice. “You can imagine in a high-risk scenario these [government bonds] would go up in price, while the collateral could tank,” he says.Despite such objections, many popular funds regularly accept equities for bonds. BlackRock’s iShares Core UK Gilts, for example, has about two-thirds of the fund on loan at any one time and accepts equities and other ETFs as collateral.A spokesperson for BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, says it takes “a rigorous, hands-on approach to managing risk throughout the securities lending process”.Another concern for investors is whether cash or securities are best for collateral. In Europe, asset managers typically take securities as collateral and charge a fee. In the US, cash is often used as collateral, with the ETF provider then investing that cash to try to make a higher return rather than receiving a fee.Peter Sleep, a fund manager at Seven Investment Management, the UK wealth manager, says cash collateral creates additional risk because “you have to invest the cash to get a return and even the lowest risk investment can lead to losses”.“In 2008 many US investors took cash and put that cash into what appeared to be low-risk bond funds and incurred quite large losses in the financial crisis, whereas European investors sailed serenely on,” he says.There are also risks that the counterparty goes bankrupt, losing the ETF’s stocks on the way. Even so, says David Mazza, head of ETF investment strategy at OppenheimerFunds, the US investment house, the benefits of securities lending outweigh the risks for investors. “It has the ability to add incremental returns that can help make the charges to the fund decrease. As an investor you can benefit from that practice,” he says.It is a view echoed by Rory Tobin, global co-head of SPDR ETFs at State Street Global Advisors. He says that many of the largest ETF providers have strict policies in place to protect investors, including requirements for “over-collateralisation”.Providers typically also offer an indemnity that means that if the borrower goes bust, the asset manager will guarantee to buy back the securities that have been lost. Even so, Mr Tobin says, “We still have clients across Europe who express a strong desire for funds that do not lend.”Investors who want to avoid ETFs that engage in securities lending may find their options limited. According to Morningstar, about 30 per cent of ETFs based in Europe lend out securities, while almost 71 per cent of US ETFs have a stock lending programme.With this in mind, Mr Nijssen says it is vital investors do proper due diligence. “There has to be an economic rationale behind securities lending. If as an investor you can’t understand the rationale, you should be wary — you should be on top of it.”
91;STT;State Street Corp;2018-02-05T04:00:27Z;Index tracking ETFs deny any ‘abdication’ of stewardship role;Automatic stock inclusion complicates oversight on corporate governance standards;The rise of exchange traded funds has changed the nature of ownership between listed companies and their investors. Managers of “physical” ETFs are compelled to own shares because of the stock’s inclusion in a particular basket, meaning that they cannot readily divest in protest over a company’s behaviour.Yet the rise of the ETF market has coincided with a growing emphasis on responsible ownership, where investors are expected to take companies to task over how they are combating climate change, improving gender diversity and curbing excessive executive pay.“At the same time as ETFs have grown rapidly, we have seen a very rapid rise in this issue of stewardship,” says Yo Takatsuki, a director in BMO Global Asset Management’s governance and sustainable investment team.Are these two trends fundamentally at odds with each other? The biggest ETF providers deny the idea that the rise of index-tracking vehicles has lessened shareholders’ ability to push companies to change.Barbara Novick, vice-chairman and co-founder at BlackRock (above), who heads its public policy and investment stewardship teams, says holding stock in such vehicles “doesn’t mean we are passive as an investor”.“The idea of long-term stable capital does change the nature of the engagement,” says Ms Novick. But coming with it, she adds, is “a desire to engage more actively”.Providers of ETFs also point out that divesting from a stock completely as an act of protest is exceptional, even among active managers. “The concept of divesting from a stock is a last resort — you are making a pretty big statement,” says Mr Takatsuki.“We don’t approach it through the nuclear option,” says Rakhi Kumar, head of environmental, social and governance investment strategy at State Street Global Advisors, who likens it to “being stuck in a relationship where divorce is not an option — it may take years to see eye to eye.”Others are more sceptical. Although some ETF providers do engage with the companies their products invest in, an increasingly passive shareholder base is “dangerous”, says StJohn Gardner, head of investment management at private bank Arbuthnot Latham. “Clearly if you are an ETF provider, one of the key advantages is the low cost of them and therefore you don’t want to pay for large teams of people on a corporate governance level,” he adds.Yet research last year by data provider Morningstar suggests there had not been an “abdication” of stewardship duties.“On the contrary, index managers like BlackRock, Vanguard, and SSgA are increasingly taking an active role in the oversight of investee companies,” the report concluded, after surveying the 12 largest providers of index funds and ETFs that together have more than $20tn in assets under management.“Nearly all the firms we surveyed apply the same principles to all their holdings irrespective of whether they are in active or passive portfolios.”Morningstar found that the world’s biggest index investing groups have expanded their stewardship or corporate governance teams in recent years, although conversations with asset managers indicate the workload they face is massive.At State Street, Ms Kumar’s stewardship team has grown from four to a dozen staff over the past four years. They meet between 600 and 700 companies each year, covering around 45 per cent of State Street’s assets under management.“Passive funds are not passive owners,” says Jim Rowley, head of active and passive portfolio research at Vanguard. Its stewardship team conducts around 1,000 meetings, conference calls or visits to companies each year.Ms Novick at BlackRock concedes even active managers can be daunted by this scale of oversight, with many using the recommendations of proxy advisers to decide how to vote on pay awards and board appointments.With the biggest groups admitting the scale of the task in helping steward the companies, the challenge that faces smaller ETF providers in performing the same task is even more apparent.
92;STT;State Street Corp;2018-02-05T03:30:34Z;State Street chief takes aim at the cost of servicing;Bank’s chief executive-to-be says activities will move to front office;"Not long before Ron O’Hanley was named the next chief executive of State Street, the world’s second-biggest trust bank, a New York analyst set out his challenge in blunt terms. The business of keeping financial assets safe and accounted for, he said, is “the world’s worst oligopoly”.There are a handful of big players, high barriers to entry due to tight regulation and expensive technology — and unrelenting pressure on margins. Every cent an investor spends on the humdrum business of custody and record-keeping is a cent that doesn’t accrue, ultimately, to a nurse or a firefighter with a pension fund.The pressure to do everything for less results in “terrible, sometimes value-destroying pricing,” said the analyst, Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Mr O’Hanley doesn’t see it that way. Appointed as president and chief operating officer in November, he is due to step up to be chief executive of the 226-year-old bank, the second oldest in the US, by the end of the year. He accepts that the core business of servicing assets can be tough, but says that is where the creativity is.He cites a recent example in which State Street worked with a quantitative hedge fund to develop a dynamic trading plan, so the fund could adapt the day’s scheduled orders according to the flow of news. In another case, the company helped a big public pension fund to shift from a defined-benefit to a defined-contribution scheme, “unitising” its pool of assets.In other words, the company is moving beyond the humdrum business of custody. Or as Mr O’Hanley puts it, from the middle office to the front office.He’s been in charge of 20% of the business; now it’s the rest he has to worry about“That’s what the industry needs to be able to do,” he says, during an interview in his office overlooking the trading floor at State Street’s art deco headquarters in Boston. A day later the bank reported fourth-quarter results showing a 7 per cent spike in servicing fees from a year earlier, on $33tn of assets.“It’s no longer enough to just say that we’re a great custodian or a great accountant,” he says, noting that servicing accounts for about four-fifths of State Street’s revenues, which came to $11.2bn last year. “Now it really is around information and information management and data; how do I make it available and useful to [clients] in their investment process.”Other big trust banks are in the grip of management changes. At Bank of New York Mellon, the biggest with $15.5bn in revenues, new chief executive Charlie Scharf, 52, is trying to fuse skills he learnt while running JPMorgan Chase’s retail bank with technology insights he picked up during a four-year spell on the west coast with Visa. At Northern Trust in Chicago, Michael O’Grady, 52, the former finance chief and head of the asset-servicing unit, has recently replaced Frederick “Rick” Waddell, 64.Mr O’Hanley — who joined State Street in 2015 following stints at Fidelity Investments, BNY Mellon and McKinsey — was previously chief executive of State Street Global Advisors, the bank’s investment arm which is the world’s third-biggest fund manager by assets.The key question is how much performance is alpha, or factor-based — and whether the client can get a similar result more cheaplyIt will be up to the 60-year-old asset-management veteran to show that he can get a grip on servicing, says Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. According to Wells Fargo figures, combined assets under custody at the top three independent trust banks, plus JPMorgan, rose from about $23tn in 2001 to $82tn last year but fees as a percentage of those assets dropped from 3.5 basis points to 2.3bps over that period, on a trailing 12-month basis.“He’s been in charge of 20 per cent of the business; now it’s the rest he has to worry about,” says Mr Kleinhanzl.By his side will be Cyrus Taraporevala, the new president and chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. He will have challenges of his own. The exchange-traded fund business, for example, lost ground last year to BlackRock and Vanguard. That’s tough to take for a company that launched the first US-listed ETF in 1993.Year founded: 1792Assets: $2.8 trillion, Dec 31 2017Employees: 37,000Headquarters: BostonOwnership: Publicly listedTicker: STTBetsy Graseck, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says Mr O’Hanley showed he was “a long-term thinker” during his spell at SSGA, pushing it into higher-margin products. Active strategies now account for less than 8 per cent of SSGA’s $2.8tn in AUM.The key question, says Mr Taraporevala, is how much performance is alpha, or factor-based — and whether the client can get a similar result more cheaply. “How much can we deliver in an index, what can we deliver in a factor-based way, what are the true active pieces that the client couldn’t get in a more cost-effective way?” he asks.Putting all that together “is the new active,” Mr Taraporevala says.Both men say they are generally pleased at the direction of financial-regulatory reform under the Donald Trump administration. As Mr Taraporevala says, there’s a recognition that the “pendulum” had swung too far after the financial crisis, penalising banks with overzealous rules.We’re actually helping investors get their job done at a lower costMr O’Hanley expects relief for the specialist custody banks on a metric known as the supplementary leverage ratio, for example, which calculates capital as a percentage of total assets. That was not a constraint during the crisis, he notes, when State Street’s balance sheet was swollen with cash as big asset-manager clients liquidated their holdings.“You really don’t want us in a time of crisis trying to push that stuff off,” he says. “It was very beneficial to regulators to kind of know where that cash was; it was a daily barometer on investment sentiment.”Meanwhile Mr O’Hanley will keep pushing on a decade-long technology upgrade. Wave one involved moving a fifth of applications to the cloud; wave two (2015-20) is about meeting client needs in real time.If all goes to plan, State Street’s return on equity could be an industry-leading 15 per cent by 2020, says Mr Mayo, from 10.6 per cent last year.“We’re actually helping investors get their job done at a lower cost and therefore to higher benefits to themselves,” says Mr O’Hanley. “There’s not any place I’d rather be.”Age 60Total pay $9mEducation Syracuse university; MBA, Harvard Business SchoolCareer

93;STT;State Street Corp;2018-02-03T11:00:24Z;State Street ramps up pressure on excessive executive pay;Group will publicly demonstrate unease over lavish packages by abstaining from votes;"State Street Global Advisors is to get tough on executive pay — and it will signal its displeasure over lavish packages by refusing to back them. Previously, the $2.8tn-in-assets manager voted “for” or “against” on pay. Now the Boston group, the manager of the world's largest passive investment fund, will indicate its unhappiness by abstaining.Rakhi Kumar, head of corporate governance at SSGA, said that last year the group had voted against nearly 600 of 5,200 pay proposals. It had concerns over 300 more, which it classed as “qualified support”.In this year’s round of shareholder meetings, SSGA will make clear its unease by abstaining.“Sometimes you have a concern on structure, sometimes there could be a one-off payment that . . . makes us uncomfortable,” Ms Kumar said.“It’s something typically we supported with a heavy heart. That will be more transparent now.”Passive investment groups are increasingly using their influence after trillions of dollars flowed into exchange-traded and index-tracking funds. Unlike traditional mutual funds, passive funds cannot sell shares if they think a management or board is doing a poor job.With many institutional investors adopting environmental, social and governance principles, it has increased the pressure on the big three, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, to take a more active approach.Some corporate governance experts say an abstention does not go far enough. They argue that votes against pay packages are more powerful.Larry Fink, BlackRock chief, last month sent a letter to corporate executives arguing that “every company must not only deliver financial performance but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society”.He also promised to double the number of people in the asset manager’s “shareholder stewardship” team.“The time has come for a new model of shareholder engagement,” Mr Fink wrote.SSGA has tried to take a lead before. It made a splash a year ago with “Fearless Girl”, a sculpture that appeared to be staring down the charging bull in lower Manhattan.The group followed that with a promise to unsettle companies with all-male boards. In 400 instances it voted against the re-election of the chair or most senior member of a board’s nominating and governance committee.Ms Kumar said that SSGA’s abstention drive would begin with votes on pay but could cover other management proposals.She said that talks had started with big companies about how they should interpret such a vote.This kind of engagement should be routine for companies that effectively manage “permanent capital”, said Cyrus Taraporevala, SSGA chief executive.The firm launched the first US-listed ETF – the SPDR S&P 500 ETF – 25 years ago; it currently has more than $302bn in assets and is the most-traded security in the world, with an average daily trading volume of $25bn. He said: “We don’t have the luxury of saying, ‘we’ll deliver to you the S&P 499, because we didn’t like this last company so we sold it out’.“This is a huge focus for us, and it’s something our clients increasingly want us to do.”"
94;STT;State Street Corp;2018-01-24T12:27:57Z;World’s largest ETF roars past $300bn in assets;SSGA’s S&P 500 tracker hits milestone on its 25th birthday;"The bull market in US stocks has created the first $300bn exchange-traded fund. Assets at State Street Global Advisors’ SPDR S&P 500 fund passed the landmark on Monday, almost exactly 25 years after it started trading.Almost universally known by its ticker symbol of SPY, the fund was the first ETF to be launched, and owes the landmark to the enduring popularity of the S&P 500 as a benchmark, as well as to the current strong performance of the US market and the ongoing shift to passive investing.“It’s a pretty special number,” said Jim Ross, the chairman of SSGA’s SPDR business. “We have a growing market, even an accelerating one, and we’ve seen inflows. I look forward to it hitting $400bn and $500bn.”Even though there are now more than 3m stock market indices that could be used as the basis for ETFs, the S&P 500 alone accounts for $500bn in assets.The second and fourth largest ETFs, with market caps of $153.7bn and $90.3bn and offered by BlackRock’s iShares division and Vanguard respectively, also track the S&P 500.SPY gathered $6.2bn in new inflows in 2017. The competing BlackRock and Vanguard ETFs attracted inflows of $30.3bn and $15bn respectively, according to ETFGI, a London consultancy.These ETFs, known as IVV and VOO respectively, both carry total expense ratios of 4 basis points which compares with the 9bp annual charge for SPY.SPY’s inflows for the month so far have reached $12bn, and it has been propelled to its landmark by the 6 per cent gain in the index since the start of the year. The fund is also a prime beneficiary of the so-called Trump rally: its assets under management passed $200bn on election day in 2016 and has grown at an annual equivalent rate of 42 per cent since then.SPY’s domination of the market trading volume is even greater than its share of assets, in part because institutions tend to use it more than they use the other S&P 500 ETFs.Nick Good, co-head of the SSGA SPDR business, said the fund was increasingly being used instead of futures contracts on the index; SSGA claims that it accounts for 25 per cent of daily trading volume in all ETFs, equivalent to the volumes of the next 18 largest ETFs combined. It is sufficiently liquid that an average of 3,250 shares change hands each second.SSGA pointed out that the fund had reached the $300bn landmark a matter of days before the anniversary of its first trade, on January 29 1993. Since then ETFs, which track an index but can be traded minute by minute through the day on a stock exchange, have proved far more successful than traditional closed-end mutual funds in attracting flows of funds from investors."
95;STT;State Street Corp;2018-01-19T05:00:32Z;Price war bites as world’s largest exchange traded fund turns 25;State Street’s flagship SPY loses ground to BlackRock and Vanguard;State Street celebrates the 25th anniversary of the launch of the first US-listed exchange traded fund on Monday, a date that will be marked by a bellringing event at the New York Stock Exchange on January 29.The moment could also evoke alarm bells for the Boston-based manager, which has lost ground to BlackRock and Vanguard, its larger and more aggressive competitors.State Street’s flagship exchange traded fund, known as SPY, was launched in January 1993 and has grown into the world’s largest and most widely traded fund with assets of $283bn. It has delivered an annualised net return of 9.56 per cent since launch, compared with the 9.71 per cent return registered by the US benchmark S&P 500 index. A $100 stake invested at the time of SPY’s launch would be worth $980 now.SPY gathered $6.2bn in new inflows in 2017, helped by a 19 per cent rally for the S&P 500, which hit a record high at the end of December.The directly competing ETFs run by BlackRock and Vanguard, which also track the S&P 500 index, attracted much higher inflows of $30.3bn and $15bn respectively, according to ETFGI, a London consultancy.These ETFs, known as IVV and VOO respectively, both carry total expense ratios of 4 basis points which compares with the 9bp annual charge for SPY.Vanguard and BlackRock reduced fees more aggressively to win new business and senior executives at State Street admit in private that they have been slow to respond in the cut-throat price war.“The difficulty with cutting fees is that it reduces the resources available for marketing, sales support and client education initiatives.” says Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI. “It can be challenging for any manager to strike the right balance between fee cuts to win new client business and protecting revenues to support ongoing operations,” she said.20.7mUnits traded in SPY each day in 2017. This compares with more than 1m for IVV and 492,000 for VOOAs a custody bank, State Street is also one of the world’s largest providers of asset services to hundreds of investment managers. Some observers believe that this role as a service provider has constrained the ETF unit’s ability to compete aggressively on pricing out of a fear of upsetting long-established and profitable relationships with other fund managers.Last October State Street did respond to rivals with the creation of an ultra-lost cost range of 15 core ETFs, following similar initiatives that were implemented several years ago at BlackRock, Charles Schwab and Deutsche Bank.Ben Johnson, director of passive funds research at Morningstar, the data provider says: “State Street historically suffered from a lack of focus on the ETFs that make the core building blocks of investors’ portfolios. BlackRock created its US core range to respond to losing market share to Vanguard. This is a tactic that BlackRock replicated in other regions and which has also been mimicked successfully by other players.”Rory Tobin, co-head of the State Street Global Advisors ETF business, says: “It is early days but the reception from clients to the repricing has been very positive. We have seen about $7bn in new inflows since the launch of the ultra-low-cost ETF suite and we will look to add to the range with complementary funds to appeal to wealth managers and model portfolio providers.”SPY still has a significant advantage over competitors as one of the world’s most widely used trading instruments. Turnover for SPY averaged more than 20.7m units a day in 2017, compared with just over 1m units daily for IVV and only 492,000 for VOO.SPY is also much more widely used as a hedging tool by US market makers, with short interest averaging $43bn a day last year, compared with $753m for IVV and $329m for VOO, according to information from S3 Partners, a US financial analytics provider.“The liquidity advantages of SPY over its rivals, such as its high trading volumes and the ready availability of inventory for short sellers, have eroded over time and are likely to diminish further,” Mr Johnson says.The growing competitive pressures on SPY were mirrored across the entirety of State Street’s ETF business, which saw global net inflows shrink to $40.6bn last year from $62.5bn in 2016, a decline of more than a third. In contrast, BlackRock and Vanguard attracted record new ETF business growth. Vanguard’s ETF inflows jumped 54 per cent to $149bn in 2017 while BlackRock’s iShares ETF arm surged to $248bn, up nearly 80 per cent.The lacklustre performance of State Street’s ETF business has been accompanied by a significant number of senior staff changes.The liquidity advantages of SPY over its rivals have eroded over time and are likely to diminish furtherThe veteran Jim Ross, who played a central role in the development of SPY, moved to the position of chairman of the ETF business in May 2016 to make way for two new co-heads: Nick Good and Mr Tobin.One of their first moves was to hire Claire Perryman from BlackRock in October 2016 to lead State Street’s ETF business in the UK.Noel Archard, another BlackRock veteran, was recruited in May last year as head of global product along with Seth Morrison who came from Vanguard to lead marketing for the ETF business.State Street also appointed Kathryn Sweeney as head of institutional sales for its ETF business in the Americas in June. She previously worked for Goldman Sachs.The most significant personnel change occurred in November when Ron O’Hanley, then head of the asset management division, moved up to the role of group chief executive. Mr O’Hanley named Cyrus Taraporevala, one of his most trusted lieutenants, as chief executive of State Street Global Advisors.A State Street alumnus who did not wish to be named said: “A lot of money has been pumped into the ETF business. There will be expectations for an improvement, particularly with Mr O’Hanley’s move from asset management to the role of group CEO. The heat is now on.”
96;STT;State Street Corp;2018-01-19T01:33:05Z;Bullish outlook boosts inflows into equity funds;Investor confidence over economic growth leads to best start to year since at least 2013;Flows into equity funds are poised for their best start to the year since at least 2013 as global markets achieve fresh highs on enthusiasm about economic growth throughout the world.In the latest week, investors poured $23.8bn into equity funds, taking the year-to-date total to more than $40bn, according to estimates from fundtracker EPFR Global. That is on par with the more than $40bn inflow for the same period five years ago.Final data will be available next month because different funds have different reporting schedules.The rush to global equities comes as investors celebrate a global scenario of synchronised economic growth.“Everyone thinks the goldilocks scenario will continue in 2018, but some of us are worrying this is the last hurrah,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors.Everyone thinks the goldilocks scenario will continue in 2018, but some of us are worrying this is the last hurrahAmong the indexes that have hit fresh highs this year are the US S&P 500 and the UK FTSE 100.EPFR said that the flows showed appetite for the global growth story versus individual markets. The countries that attracted notable amounts of fresh cash mid-month were those focused on small markets, such as Vietnam, Malaysia and Russia.Meanwhile, continuing a years long shift of investors of all stripes into exchange traded funds, assets under management for the group collectively tracked by EPFR passed the $5tn market for the first time in the latest week.Inflows to emerging market funds continued a recent run with both equity and bond funds focused on emerging markets pulling in more than $3bn each, extending inflow streaks dating back to December.Investors pointed to valuations for emerging markets being attractive versus developed areas like the US, as well as US dollar weakness, which benefits countries that have borrowed heavily in US dollars in recent years.Mr Gokhman also saw more upside.“A simple stat that I like using: EM constitutes about 34 per cent of global [gross domestic product] and 23 per cent of global equity market cap,” he said. “Just for it to get to that proportionate level, you have quite a bit of upside.”Bond funds took in just $5.7bn overall, and investors withdrew just under $200m from funds dedicated to US Treasury bonds amid rising yields and comments from high-profile investors that the great bond bull market may finally be coming to an end.Inflation protected bond funds, however, saw a record net inflow of $1.52bn to cap off 13 consecutive weeks of inflows as concerns about inflation tick up. Flows into mortgage backed bond funds hit an eight-week high.Junk bond funds reversed last week’s intake of $1.46bn for an outflow of $2.5bn, the largest net redemption in four weeks.Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors, said the junk bond outflow could be a harbinger for broader risk appetite.“It does not mean a huge correction [in equities] — just do not expect to be running at a breakneck pace for all of 2018,” he said. “The thought is just champagne and caviar for everyone — it may be more Bud Light and potato chips.”
97;STT;State Street Corp;2018-01-13T04:00:29Z;High-flying US tech stocks face early test in 2018;Sector’s slow start to the year has yet to show signs it will rattle confidence;Tech is no longer the leading performer in the US stock market. Amid the almost euphoric start to the year for global equities, it might be easy to overlook a change that could yet shape the tenth year of the bull market.In the US, industrials, consumer discretionary and materials, whose fortunes are all closely tied to the strength of the American economy, have this week outshone a sector that trounced everything else in 2017.The tax cuts signed into law by Donald Trump will pose a challenge to the tech sector’s market dominance this year if the US economy finds a higher gear and polishes the profits and revenues of those sectors most sensitive to faster growth. Given the tech sector also pays a lower effective tax rate than others, it has less to gain from the reduction in the corporate tax from 35 per cent to 21 per cent.Some investors have not wasted any time. Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, late last year downgraded the tech sector to neutral from overweight in favour of sectors such as financials and industrial shares, which he sees as being bigger beneficiaries from tax reform.“The tech sector’s low effective tax rate (19 per cent versus 26 per cent for the S&P 500) means it has little to gain from tax reform,” he says.Given the sheer dominance of the tech sector last year — its 37 per cent gain was almost double that of the wider S&P 500 — it is easy to forget that over the past 18 months it has had periods on the back foot when hopes for the reflation trade have been at their most intense.The two-month period, for example, between Mr Trump’s election and the end of 2016 was marked by fevered expectations that a Republican-controlled Congress and White House would take US growth above 3 per cent and lead to higher inflation. During that period, the tech sector gained just 1.1 per cent versus 16.5 per cent for financials, 7 per cent for industrials and 5.4 per cent for materials.The tech sector’s low effective tax rate means it has little to gain from tax reformBut if some believe a more buoyant US economy will make investors less willing to pay a premium for the revenue growth and profit growth that the tech sector — and particularly behemoths such as Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet and Microsoft — generate, others voice caution about writing off the possibility that tech will once again end the year at least among the stock market’s best performers.Despite underperforming for the first two weeks of the year, the sector has plenty of tailwinds and the consensus among investors remains upbeat. And its performance matters. The tech sector is the S&P 500’s largest at almost 24 per cent of the index, so any declines for tech present a significant hurdle for a rise in the overall index, which many strategists and investors predict for 2018.“It is business performance” that has been driving tech stocks, says Jonathan Golub, Credit Suisse’s chief US equities strategist.Behind the 2017 gains for tech was profit growth that repeatedly outpaced that of the broader market. In the third quarter, for example, tech earnings jumped 20 per cent per share from a year ago while the aggregate number for the index was just 6.4 per cent, FactSet data show.Wall Street analysts expect the tech sector to stand out again in fourth-quarter earnings season, which begins this month. Tech companies are forecast to report earnings growth of 16 per cent and revenue growth of 11 per cent compared with 10.2 per cent and 6.8 per cent for the S&P 500, respectively. But other sectors, such as energy and materials, are forecast for better growth.Despite the eye-catching gains for tech, valuations for the sector are not at a record high. Number-crunching at Credit Suisse, which includes internet retailers in tech versus the official S&P 500 category breakdown which slots them to the consumer discretionary sector, puts tech trading at 19.5 times forward earnings versus 18.1 for the S&P 500. By contrast during the dotcom bubble at the end of 1999, tech traded at 44.5 times versus 24.3 times for the broader index.“When you think about the world today, where is the growth coming from?” says Michael Lippert, a portfolio manager at Baron Capital. “It is coming from this massive generational shift globally that is going to all things digital.”But the outsized role that a handful of companies such as Facebook and Amazon are playing in that shift brings its own risks, including the threat of a regulatory backlash, some investors say.“If the regulatory framework shifts from financial to technology companies that could be a risk whether from the European Union or the US government,” says Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “The idea being that tech has become too big and too influential and in need of being regulated further or broken up to deal with risks they cause given their perceived influence on events — elections being one of them.”If that is a simmering threat — and not Mr Arone’s base case scenario — a more immediate challenge for the sector is whether its biggest players can meet Wall Street’s high expectations for the fourth quarter. Any disappointments and investors expect tech stocks to be punished and possibly severely so.Combine that with the current optimism around the implications of the tax cuts, and the high-flying tech sector risks further underperformance in January. But we are still in the first month of the year and any “policy driven weakness” might be seen as a buying opportunity, says Mr Underhill of Capital Innovations.
98;STT;State Street Corp;2018-01-03T05:00:29Z;ETF providers hope Mifid II will spur European growth;Regulatory shake-up to provide more transparency on trading of passive investment vehicles;The answer to one of the mysteries of financial markets will start to emerge this month when a spotlight shines across Europe’s exchange traded fund industry.Just how much trading occurs in ETFs across Europe has been an unsolved puzzle since the first of these low-cost index-tracking funds listed on Germany’s Deutsche Börse in April 2000.ETF trading has since spread to 25 exchanges across Europe, but no accurate record of activity has been required by regulators. About 70 per cent of ETF trading in Europe goes unreported because it occurs via private bilateral over-the-counter transactions.This should begin to end from Wednesday with the introduction of sweeping European rules designed to strengthen protection for investors and improve transparency across the continent’s financial markets. The package of regulations, known as Mifid II, requires comprehensive, detailed reporting of ETF trades.The passive investment industry, which is dominated by BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, are betting Mifid II will set their European businesses on a growth path akin to the US, where usage has spread far more widely and deeply. Assets held in US-listed ETFs stood at $3.5tn at the end of November, compared with just $790bn across all European-listed ETFs, according to ETFGI.“Demand from investors for all low-cost investments vehicles, such as index-tracking funds as well as ETFs, will grow dramatically as a result of the greater transparency introduced by Mifid. ETFs are set to become a much more significant part of investors’ portfolios,” says Stephen Cohen, the head of BlackRock’s iShares ETF business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.The lack of data has deprived investors of an accurate picture of the pricing and liquidity of ETFs in Europe, deterring many from using them. For the first time, pre-trade and post-trade disclosures of the details of orders submitted to and transactions conducted on trading venues across Europe will be published.“Improvements in the efficiency and cost of ETF transactions as a result of Mifid II should lead to more investors adopting ETFs,” says Manooj Mistry, Emea head of passive asset management at Deutsche Asset Management.While this consequence of Mifid II is being welcomed by the industry, any explosive growth of ETFs in Europe is likely to bring concern. In May, Ireland’s central bank questioned if retail investors grasp how the performance of an ETF might change in periods of elevated market volatility. That worry was echoed last month by Paul Andrews, the secretary-general of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, an umbrella body for securities regulators, who said questions needed to be asked about whether ETFs could cope with price or liquidity shocks that were likely to arise as central banks tighten monetary policy.ETFs have become a “critical” piece of market infrastructure, he noted, and Iosco was concerned the use of ETFs could lead to trading disruptions if large numbers of investors rushed for the exit during a period of market stress.The requirement to report trades is not the only way in which Mifid II is expected to prove a catalyst for ETFs in Europe. The regulations also impose tighter restrictions on the generous commission payments that asset managers in Europe were historically permitted to pay fund distributors in return for selling their products. Regulators believe these financial inducements have helped to promote sales of unsuitable and expensive products to investors. These payments, also known as retrocessions, can account for up to 65 per cent of the management fee of a fund.Distributors, such as banks, will only be able to receive retrocession payments under Mifid II if they provide execution-only services or if they offer access to third-party products from a competitor while also providing a high level of service, such as ongoing financial advice. Given ETFs do not pay commissions to distributors anyway, they are expected to benefit from the restrictions.Countries such as the UK and the Netherlands that have already imposed a ban on commission payments by asset managers to distributors have seen ETFs winning a growing share of new investor inflows at the expense of traditional mutual funds.Mr Cohen of BlackRock also believes Mifid II will trigger far wider interest in ETFs among retail investors in Europe where adoption rates have been slow. He notes that retail investors hold half of the total assets invested in ETFs in the US, while in Europe institutional investors account for about 90 per cent of ETF holdings.“The US provides a template for how retail investor adoption of ETFs could evolve over the next three to five years. US financial advisers have undertaken significant changes to their business models with a greater focus on low-cost building blocks and model portfolios constructed with ETFs. The Mifid rule changes will be very positive for ETFs,” he argues.A further change in the status of ETFs under Mifid II could also prove beneficial, executives say. On Wall Street, US market makers make extensive use of ETFs as hedging instruments alongside derivative contracts to protect themselves against other risks in their trading books. This is less common in Europe as ETFs were not recognised as eligible securities pre Mifid II.The leading ETF players in Europe, BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, Lyxor and Amundi are all fighting a cut-throat price war on fees that has already helped them wrest money away from active managers. Investors ploughed $106.6bn into European-listed ETFs in the first 11 months of 2017, with BlackRock winning almost 36 per cent of those new inflows.Mifid II looks set to ignite ETF growth in Europe, leaving active managers with a daunting challenge to defend their businesses and raising worries for those who believe the index-tracking vehicles have not been truly tested in periods of market stress.
99;STT;State Street Corp;2017-12-28T13:01:47Z;Index funds: cut-price consciences;Asset managers should pay more attention to governance matters;Market moochers account for an alarmingly large proportion of the world’s share universe. Index trackers popular for cut-price rates hold close to one-third of US stocks and a quarter of money under management in the UK. Yet they have little interest in using their size to take control, which helps explain the growing influence of activist investors. Their engagement in issues over pay and board diversity has been as lacklustre as their contribution towards price discovery.Following criticism, the likes of State Street, Vanguard and BlackRock are changing tack and bulking up governance teams. Listen to the companies themselves and you might think the days of outsourcing voting policy to proxy advisers such as ISS are over. Glenn Booraem, Vanguard’s head of corporate governance, describes his colleagues as “passive investors but active owners”.Data from Proxy Insight show that passive investors are still finding their voice. Between July 2016 and July 2017, 91.5 per cent of BlackRock’s votes were in favour of management proposals — only slightly below the 92.3 per cent approval rate the year before. State Street and Vanguard’s voting records follow the same trend.A charitable explanation is that asset managers prefer not to engage with day-to-day concerns and save themselves for big ticket changes. Because they cannot choose when to sell out, passive funds see themselves as advocates for long-termism. Alternatively, they may simply be happy with the way things are run.More likely the votes signal a degree of inattention at odds with dynamic stewardship claims. New teams created to consider governance issues are relatively small — 20 or 30 people charged with looking at thousands of companies. This is a relatively meagre effort. Moody’s predicts that by 2021, passive funds will control more than half of all US stocks and bonds. If they want to fulfil their promise of engagement, the asset managers behind those funds need to put more of their earnings into governance.

Higher interest rates and tax cuts that are on the brink of becoming law this week have also fuelled the rally.The living will regime, a central pillar of the Dodd-Frank reforms introduced after the Lehman crisis, is aimed at improving the safety and soundness of the financial system and avoiding the need for government bailouts. Regulators have powers to force banks to shed chunks of their business if they persistently fail to meet the required standard.Last year, only Citigroup received an entirely passing grade. Then, the two regulators ruled that five banks’ living wills had “deficiencies”, meaning they were “not credible, or would not facilitate an orderly resolution”.One of those five, Wells Fargo, failed to fix the problems, prompting watchdogs to place restrictions on its business, although these have since been lifted.This year, none of the plans had “deficiencies”. Four banks — Citi, JPMorgan Chase, State Street and Bank of New York Mellon — got the all clear. The others have been told that their subsequent submissions require “additional work”.The Fed has signalled it is open to letting banks submit their resolution plans every two years, instead of annually.

PensionBee has built an online platform that allows customers to track their various pensions. Users list their employment history and the platform brings their pensions into a single plan, which is managed by Legal & General, BlackRock or State Street. The fintech has £100m of assets under management, with a further £125m of pension in the process of being transferred. It charges annual fees between 0.5 per cent and 0.95 per cent, at the low end of most actively managed funds.[The deal] is a great example of how fintechs are becoming part of the longstanding ecosystem in more formal waysState Street’s investment will help the company to expand into new markets, such as Ireland and the Netherlands, as well as expanding its assets under management, said Ms Savova. The chief executive said the company aimed to reach assets under management of £10bn-£15bn by 2022. “But that would still only be 1 per cent of the UK market,” she said. State Street is the latest big bank to invest in one of the UK’s myriad fintech start-ups. Goldman Sachs this year bought a stake in Neyber, the online employee lender, and in 2015 Spain’s BBVA invested in Atom Bank, the app-based bank available on mobile devices. The US global custody bank has been following the digital disruption of financial services closely and last year Jay Hooley, its chief executive, wrote an article entitled, “The fintech ultimatum: adapt or die”. State Street will become the biggest external shareholder in PensionBee with an observer seat on its board of directors, which is chaired by Mark Wood, the former chief executive of UK insurer Prudential.Ms Savova, who started talking to State Street about its investment last year when seven months pregnant, said: “They are currently the biggest proponent of gender equality in the boardroom and the interactions I have had with them only reinforces this.”She added that the deal was “a great example of how fintechs are becoming part of the longstanding ecosystem in more formal ways”.

The inflows marked the fourth consecutive week investors have added cash to the sector.“The regulatory backdrop has become more favourable and that increases the likelihood of buybacks and dividend increases,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors.Comments by Jay Powell, President Donald Trump’s nominee to serve as chair of the Federal Reserve, late last month setting the stage for a potential easing of financial regulations helped to reignite interest in financial stocks.The progression of corporate tax cuts through Congress has further increased the positive sentiment on banks. Republican leaders have said they are determined to pass a tax package before the end of the year.Mr Bartolini said that banks would be among the bigger beneficiaries of lower domestic tax rates. They now pay effective tax rates of more than 30 per cent versus more than 25 per cent for the broader S&P 500 index, he estimated.Financial stocks have gained 6 per cent since investors returned from the Thanksgiving holiday, outperforming the 1.3 per cent rise by the wider market.“Some of it has been a rotation into more value-oriented cyclical names,” said Terry Simpson, a strategist with BlackRock. “People are getting more comfortable with the [economic] growth story.”As they rejig portfolios into year-end, investors have shifted out of healthcare, industrials and real estate funds. Another popular bond proxy, funds that invest in utilities, recorded their sixth week of outflows in the past seven weeks.Funds that specialise in tech stocks, which investors have been selling in favour of financials of late, saw modest inflows after suffering the first outflows in eight weeks at the end of November. The $264m added to tech funds in the week to December 6 was roughly a quarter below the average weekly inflow for the asset class this year.Tech is the clear outperformer year-to-date, up 36 per cent, nearly double financials at 19 per cent.Ben Mandel, a strategist with JPMorgan Asset Management, cautioned that while he favours financial shares, it was not yet a fact that the Fed would ease regulations on the country’s banks.“We haven’t seen Jay Powell in the driver seat,” he said.

104;STT;State Street Corp;2017-11-27T05:00:57Z;BlackRock and Vanguard are smart beta’s biggest winners;Smaller groups grow fast, but are dwarfed in comparison;BlackRock’s smart beta assets have ballooned by almost 180 per cent to $288bn over the past five years, leaving rival asset managers scrambling to close the gap on the world’s largest fund house.The figures, collected by Morningstar, the data provider, show the New York-listed investment manager and its chief rival, Vanguard, have been the big winners when it comes to the growth of smart beta.These strategies, which act as a halfway house between active and passive fund management, have become popular in recent years as investors have sought out market-beating returns at a cheaper price. BlackRock and Vanguard are the only asset managers globally with more than $100bn in smart beta products.They have benefited from their position as the world’s largest exchange traded fund providers, drawing on their decades of experience in ETFs and factor investing to establish their hold on the smart beta market.Well known fund managers, such as Deutsche Bank, Amundi and UBS, however, do not even rank in the top 10.Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, thinks BlackRock and Vanguard will continue to dominate the leader board.“It will be exceedingly difficult for anyone to catch up,” he says. “The lead they have could shrink a bit, but I don’t think anyone can overtake them.”Smart beta strategies typically take a standard index fund but tweak it in an attempt to generate above-market returns, such as by investing based on how cheap stocks are, or on their fundamentals, rather than their market capitalisation.“There are a whole class of investors who are to some degree disillusioned with active management, but not so disillusioned that they are willing to simply own the market,” Mr Johnson adds. “They want something more.”Rob Nestor, head of iShares smart beta at BlackRock, says the manager decided this area was a “critical focus” about two and a half years ago, and started pouring in resources. This included hiring Andrew Ang, now head of factor investing strategies at BlackRock and one of the best-known names in the field.The rapid growth of smart beta in recent years “is sustainable for quite some time”, says Mr Nestor, adding: “We believe we are just in the early days of adoption.”Morningstar figures going back to 2012 show that ALPS has been the fastest growing of the 10 largest smart beta managers over that time. Its assets under management have increased by more than 4,000 per cent, though from a low base, to stand at $6bn.Invesco PowerShares and State Street Global Advisors have had the slowest growth in smart beta assets since 2012, at 87 per cent to nearly $50bn and 118 per cent to around $40bn respectively.Over that time, SSGA has lost its position as the fourth-largest smart beta manager to WisdomTree.Mr Johnson suggests State Street and PowerShares have not experienced the same rapid growth as their rivals because they have been slow to develop their ranges. “SSGA was much later to the game in bringing strategic beta to the market place,” he says.Rory Tobin, global co-head of SSGA’s SPDR exchange traded fund arm says that the asset manager only launches a product where it is “convinced of the investment case for it”.“Our experience is that uptake of a smart beta product varies according to investor appetite for more complex and esoteric approaches,” Mr Tobin adds.“Even the most vanilla smart beta strategy can seem opaque next to more intuitive market capitalisation-based investments.”Dan Draper, head of global exchange traded funds for Invesco, says the company recently bought a rival ETF provider, Source, and has announced plans to acquire Guggenheim Investments’ ETF business. He says the businesses offer a range of smart beta ETFs.Even the most vanilla smart beta strategy can seem opaqueAsset growth when it comes can happen fast. Charles Schwab’s smart beta business has expanded by more than 1,600 per cent to $26bn over five years. FlexShares — managed by investment firm Northern Trust — and First Trust have both experienced rapid growth of more than 400 per cent.Charles Schwab launched its first smart beta funds 10 years ago, but investors began piling in after the strategies developed a track record, says Jon­a­than de St Paer, head of product strategy and development at the US fund manager.Over the past few years there has been a rush to market. “We are seeing an explosion of products,” says Mr de St Paer. “I would be really surprised if some of these are around in the next few years.”However, Ryan Issakainen, ETF strategist at First Trust, which launched its first smart beta funds a decade ago, expects demand to “continue to grow and perhaps grow faster” than at its current rate.“Most investors may have heard a bit here or there, but they are just becoming familiar with how to use smart beta funds in portfolios,” he adds, “so there is plenty of room for growth.”
105;STT;State Street Corp;2017-11-27T05:00:51Z;Smart beta: what’s in a name?;The initial simplicity of the marketing concept is now a complex mess;Smart beta, as a marketing concept, has taken the investing world by storm. Investment managers are funnelling money into funds that track indices based on factors other than companies’ market capitalisation. It has allowed those who missed out on lucrative business in passively managed exchange traded funds (ETFs) — dominated by the big three: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors — to catch up. Some 103 companies now sponsor smart beta ETFs, according to BlackRock.Some analysts hope that smart beta could rescue markets from themselves. As passive indexing has come to dominate flows into equity markets, concerns have grown that market cap-weighted funds distort asset prices and leave investors over-concentrated in larger companies.Art Cashin, a UBS veteran on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, says: “ETFs and passive investments, by their very nature, are beginning to build inefficiency in the market, and I don’t believe that will be resolved happily.”Paul Woolley, who heads the London School of Economics’ centre for the study of market dysfunction, says moving from an underperforming active fund to a cap-weighted fund involves selling stocks that have been losing and buying winners.That is the opposite of what investors should be doing, as it aids price momentum and makes the market prone to bubbles. Smart beta, by systematically leaning against the market, may correct that. However, the initial simplicity of the idea has degenerated into the kind of mess that used to typify old-fashioned active mutual funds.The term smart beta is self-contradictory, and the ideas behind it are not new. William Sharpe, the Nobel laureate who originated the concept of beta, says the term makes him “definitionally sick” and doubts the strategies can work in the long term.Cliff Asness, co-founder of AQR, one of the world’s largest quantitative hedge fund groups, dislikes the term, but has admitted defeat.“Language is democratic,” Mr Asness says. “I like the strategies and not the term. It’s relabelling. It’s been a good marketing relabel, and it’s probably benefiting me too.”So what has smart beta come to mean? Beta is drawn from Mr Sharpe’s capital asset pricing model, which holds that the return on any stock can be broken down into the return attributable to the market as a whole (beta) and the idiosyncratic risks of a given company (alpha).Beta, by its definition, is dumb. All you need to capture it is to buy stocks in proportion to their index weight. Smart beta uses passive investing techniques — minimising expenses on salaries, research and trading — while trying to beat the index.The term smart beta started with actuaries helping passive managers to cut their costs. If you could replicate the index while not buying every stock in it, you could save money.With the advent of US groups Research Affiliates and WisdomTree more than a decade ago, it came to mean including all of the stocks in an index, but weighting them by a means other than market capitalisation. Even equal-weighting, where every stock in a 100-member index would have a 1 per cent weight no matter what their size, could count as smart.Intech, a subsidiary of fund management group Janus Henderson, had been offering rigorously quantitative funds for years before, based on the ideas of Robert Fernholz, published in 1982, which showed that cap-weighted indexing was not efficient.Intech targets a “rebalancing premium”. Weight an index by other means than market cap and periodic rebalancing becomes vital. This allows a manager, in Intech’s words, to “capture the volatility created as stock prices move up and down”.Rebalancing will involve selling relatively successful stocks that have gained and buying losers. It is an automatic discipline to sell nearer to the top and buy nearer to the bottom.However, asset manager Robeco’s head of selection research, David Blitz, says different investment factors “are widely regarded as distinct phenomena”, and adds: “The fact many factor investment strategies do not require much rebalancing to begin with also makes it unlikely that these modest amounts of rebalancing are the main driver of their return.”Some indices are weighted in favour of factors that have been shown to outperform over time.Such tilts are not new. They go back at least as far as the three-factor model, published by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French in 1992, which expanded the formula for investment returns to include value (or cheapness) and size. Their research found that cheap and small companies both tended to outperform in the long run.Active quantitative funds try to exploit those factors and find others. The agreed list includes: value, size, momentum (winners tend to win and losers to lose), low volatility (stocks that do not move as much as the market do better over time) and quality (which refers to strong balance sheets and reliable profitability). All have been staples of quantitative hedge funds for years.The average investor is terrible at factor timingA factors arms race is under way. One academic paper in 2014 counted at least 300 putative factors that had been put forward. Funds now offer mixtures of investment factors, while advisers can offer to manage portfolios by timing which ones they buy.Whether this is possible is a matter of fierce debate. Research Affiliates chief executive Rob Arnott argues that factors can be timed, based on how expensive they are, and the most popular factors can become overcrowded, such as momentum, which has performed very well this year. But Mr Asness believes timing is difficult and expensive, and valuations of popular factors are not extreme.The evidence from practice is that factor timing is very difficult. Aneet Chachra, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, says evidence from ETFs suggests “the average investor is terrible at factor timing”.Mr Chachra analysed the largest 20 smart beta ETFs listed in the US, which were all invested according to equal-weighted, low-volatility or high-dividend-yield factors from May 2014 to May 2017.Comparing the days when dividend ETFs saw net buying (when units were created) and net selling (when units were redeemed), they undershot the S&P 500 by an average of 2.4 percentage points. The dividend ETF matched the S&P over the whole period. This suggests the ETFs were return-chasing — in other words buying whatever is doing well. The implication is that timing does not pay off.For low-volatility ETFs, investors, on average, lagged behind the S&P by 2 percentage points even though the factor was about 3 percentage points ahead.For equal-weighted ETFs, investors, on average, paid 1 per cent more than they sold them for. This would compound poor performance, and equal-weighted ETFs did indeed lag behind the S&P by 3.5 percentage points over the period.Smart beta ETFs can offer sensible ways to try to beat the market, and lean against anomalies, at a low price. But their problems are growing clearer. The danger is they will reintroduce the problems of traditional active management — managers try strategies that only work momentarily, while investors lose money by trying to time factors.
106;STT;State Street Corp;2017-11-27T05:00:45Z;Lack of smart beta benchmarks fuels concerns;Analysts are warning of the risks;Whether you call it smart beta, strategic beta or factor investing, it has been one of the most popular investment strategies of recent years.A hybrid between active and passive investment management, these funds take a passive strategy but modify it according to one or more factors, such as favouring cheaper stocks or screening them according to dividend payouts, in order to generate better returns.However, some experts are warning that smart beta returns might not be as good as some providers are forecasting. Of particular concern to many analysts is the rigour with which smart beta factors are assessed via so-called back tests. The prevalence of data mining, in which performance data are tested until the desired result is achieved, is seen as a problem. Traditional funds, in contrast, tend to be back tested against established benchmarks.“You have to be careful with the data back test,” says Hortense Bioy, director of passive fund research in Europe at data provider Morningstar, adding that there are many instances where a manager has been tempted to “tweak” the model to improve the results.It is critical, she says, that the back tests are conducted to model for different market stresses, not just the most optimistic scenarios.Concerns about back tests are justified, says Antti Suhonen, director of solutions at MJ Hudson-Allenbridge, the invest­ment adviser, and finance professor at Aalto University in Finland. “There is an element of data mining,” he says. “You don’t have established benchmarks and common terminology in this space.”Even the strategy’s pioneers are asking questions. Rob Arnott is chief executive of Research Affiliates, which developed some of the world’s first smart beta indices. Last year, he warned that some products could go “horribly wrong”. He said the investment management industry “must make every effort to avoid being duped by historical returns”.Eric Ervin, chief executive of Reality Shares, a San Diego-based research firm that offers three smart beta exchange traded funds, says there are some “heavily marketed back tests” that might not stand up to rigorous analysis.In his previous role as a wealth manager, Mr Ervin says he could only really be satisfied that back tests were valid once he had run the numbers himself. “You have to ask yourself: ‘Does this strategy make sense?’” says Mr Ervin.Reality Shares focuses on dividend growth strategies using a stock ranking methodology that assesses a company’s ability to grow dividends, based on elements such as free cash flow (the cash left after operational and capital expenditure) and historical earnings growth.“From our side we are mindful of the dangers of data mining — a lot of due diligence goes in,” says Ana Harris, head of equity portfolio strategists, Emea at State Street Global Advisors.She adds that conversations with investors interested in the products “can last for several years before the execution”, though in most cases growing understanding of smart beta, including more media coverage and company efforts at education, mean such long time frames are unusual.As with any product there are risks. Ms Harris cites investors who got their fingers burnt after a rush to low-volatility strategies in 2009, triggered by the global financial crisis. Markets recovered more rapidly than anticipated, and low-volatility funds suffered.From investors’ current standpoint it is easy to see the appeal of smart beta strategies. As regulators and research providers have questioned the value of the traditional stockpicking fund manager, investors have increasingly favoured a product that promises better returns and lower fees. Smart beta strategies typically charge higher fees than traditional index products but still cost less than actively managed funds.Smart beta managers have been scooping up assets from their active counterparts. Assets under management in smart beta funds are on track to hit $1tn by the end of the year, according to FT analysis of Morningstar data. The strategy has been the fastest-growing section of asset management over the past five years. Multiple smart beta products have been launched in the past few months.But as the strategies become more prevalent, industry figures predict smart beta products will grow in complexity. “We’re starting to see more appetite for more complex solutions,” says Ms Harris. Ms Bioy agrees: “Multi-factor products are definitely getting traction.” She cautions investors to proceed carefully and understand the strategy. “That is key.”
107;STT;State Street Corp;2017-11-27T05:00:31Z;ESG investing and smart beta combination grows in popularity;A responsible tilt for a niche strategy;A “niche of a niche” is one description of the combination of socially responsible investment with smart beta factors. The practice of marrying the two approaches is far from mainstream, but both strategies are growing in popularity, particularly among institutional investors.The recent launch of indices and funds offering smart beta incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations indicates there is investor appetite out there.MSCI brought out its New Factor ESG Target Indexes in September, for example. These allow investors to integrate a responsible investment approach alongside smart beta factors that hunt good-value and low-volatility assets.Candriam Investors Group introduced a range of specialised ETFs in June. In the US, providers Oppenheimer, NuShares and Columbia Threadneedle run socially responsible smart beta ETFs.A survey by FTSE Russell shows nearly half (46 per cent) of global asset owners have an allocation to smart beta, and 41 per cent of those using it or considering its use anticipate applying ESG considerations.The trend for big pension funds and similar investors to incorporate ESG screening in investment strategies is well established. “In the Nordics and Australia, in particular, it is the price of institutional admission [as an asset manager],” says Heidi Ridley, global chief executive of Rosenberg Equities, the quantitative arm of Axa Investment Managers.Adding an ESG screen to smart beta strategies generally entails applying a filter for ESG factors before adding the traditional smart beta factor tilts such as momentum or value. Approaches on screening vary but are likely to both exclude stocks based on measures of controversy such as tobacco or arms, and to make a positive selection of stocks with good ESG ratings, such as green energy.Rosenberg has been running a combined strategy for three years, and by the end of this year will have added ESG screening to all its strategies. The approach adds value and “fits well with our long-term philosophy, as even in our smart beta strategies, we are not looking for short term factors”, says Ms Ridley.The investment manager evaluates companies on the basis of volatility, quality, tail risk and ESG.Ossiam, an affiliate manager of Natixis Global Asset Management, is a quantitative investment specialist. In June, the provider merged its main minimum variance fund with an ESG filtered version. Bruno Monnier, portfolio manager at Ossiam, says there are further smart beta factors that offer synergies with ESG, and the group plans to switch at least half of its fund range to an ESG-filtered methodology.The main challenge in running ESG-filtered smart beta strategies, according to Ms Ridley, lies in having a sufficiently broad universe of stocks to allow for screening.State Street Global Advisors, which is preparing to launch a fund combining ESG screening and smart beta early next year, has identified similar difficulties. Stocks rated highly for ESG may not have the required smart beta characteristics — SSGA focuses on factors including value, low-volatility and momentum — and vice versa.I don’t believe we should have general ESG ratings published . . . as a universal truthHighly rated ESG stocks do not score well for momentum and are typically larger cap. This makes it difficult to apply a rules-based approach, says Jennifer Bender, director of research for the global equity beta solutions team at SSGA. “Fortunately, modern portfolio construction techniques offer a way to solve the problem,” she adds.Data issues are another hurdle. Companies are not typically required to disclose on ESG matters, as they are on financial ones. “We hired people to do research company-by-company,” says Ms Bender, but a lot of the information remains subjective. There is also significant variation across data providers.The lack of standardisation is not necessarily viewed as a problem. “I don’t believe we should have general ESG ratings published on Bloomberg as a universal truth,” says Koen Van de Maele, global head of investment solutions at Candriam.“It is better to have your own screening process and approach to ESG integration and not to over-simplify.”Those yet to enter this niche market question whether there is sufficient demand. “The difficulty is ensuring that what we build meets the demand of enough investors to be worth building,” says Chris Mellor, head of equity and commodity product management, Emea, at Invesco’s PowerShares.“There are almost as many approaches to ESG as there are investors”, he says.ESG is not a factor in the same way as momentum or value. It is, rather, a risk-and-return characteristic, but it has yet to be established that it offers a reliable long-term premium, argues Ms Bender.Still, for some investors, it is increasingly a starting point in their investment decisions.
108;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will.

115;STT;State Street Corp;2017-11-05T05:00:40Z;Fund companies lift the lid on workforce ethnic diversity;Pressure mounts on industry to shed its ‘pale, male and stale’ image;Several of the world’s largest asset managers have publicly shared data on the ethnic diversity of their workforces for the first time, with others committing to collect this information from next year as pressure mounts on the investment industry to tackle its “pale, male and stale” image.The Financial Times contacted 35 asset managers, investment consultants and the UK trade body to collect information about their workforces following a high-profile report that laid bare the industry’s overwhelmingly male, white, middle-aged and hetero­sexual bias.Legal & General Investment Management, the UK’s largest fund house, Janus Henderson, the £265.5bn asset manager, Schroders, US-based T Rowe Price and Standard Life, the insurer that merged with Aberdeen Asset Management, are among the companies that responded with details about the ethnic make-up of their staff.BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, Capital Group, Legg Mason, Aberdeen and M&G Investments, the £282bn investment arm of Prudential, had previously revealed their data to the FT. State Street, the US bank with a $2.6tn investment arm, and Fidelity International have committed to collecting more statistics next year.“It is becoming widely recognised that diversity of people in the workplace is essential for diversity of thought, which ultimately leads to better outcomes for our customers,” says Anne Richards, chief executive of M&G. “The industry has come a long way in recent years, but there is still much work to be done.”The results show a mixed picture, with M&G and Capital Group revealing a higher proportion of workers from ethnically diverse backgrounds overall than in investment jobs. For Capital Group, which had the most diverse overall workforce of all companies providing data, the proportion almost halved to 22 per cent for better-paid investment jobs, while M&G showed a decline from 19 per cent to 12 per cent.Standard Life Aberdeen, which shared figures for investment professionals before the merger was completed, said 10 per cent of investment managers who reported their ethnicity were from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds at Aberdeen, with 11 per cent reporting the same at Standard Life. The proportion of non-white people in the UK is 14 per cent, according to the 2011 census, compared with 39 per cent in the US.Some companies, such as BlackRock, revealed data on their overall workforces but declined to share figures for minority workers that manage money. One in 10 employees at LGIM who shared information about their ethnicity were from minority backgrounds, while the proportion was 20 per cent for Schroders.Mercer, the investment consultant, was the only group with specific targets for improving ethnic diversity. It aims for 13 per cent of its UK employees to come from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds by 2020, compared with 10 per cent currently. Standard Life Aberdeen said it will set diversity targets for the merged group.The Investment Association trade body, Vanguard, GAM, Franklin Templeton and Fidelity Investments were among the groups that did not share their data, although some participate in the Diversity Project, an industry-led group that reported in September that managers are overwhelmingly male, white, middle-aged and heterosexual.The UK initiative has emphasised the importance of gathering data to drive improvements in representation.Asset managers have historically refused to share demographic data about their employees for fear of being singled out for criticism, but public pressure has changed attitudes in recent years.M&G Investments, Capital Group and Legg Mason shared their data with the FT last year for the first time, and 24 groups have shared selective statistics anonymously with the Diversity Project to inform its campaign to extend information about gender diversity to other issues such as ethnicity, sexuality, age and disability.Research conducted by Mercer on behalf of the project foufnd that 38 per cent of 650 polled investment managers had a private-school education, compared with 7 per cent of the UK population. Only 3.6 per cent had disabilities, compared with 11 per cent in the UK.The survey suggested asset managers have been relatively successful in hiring ethnically diverse candidates. Sixteen per cent of respondents said they were from minority backgrounds compared with 14 per cent of the UK population. However, only 1 per cent identified as black, African, Caribbean or black British, compared with 3 per cent of the population as a whole.
116;STT;State Street Corp;2017-10-31T13:34:16Z;ETF price wars deepen as Deutsche cuts fees at flagship fund;Providers scrambling to grab as much share in passive investment landscape as possible;The passive investment price wars deepened further this week with Deutsche Bank cutting the cost of its flagship junk bond fund and Franklin Templeton unveiling a series of cheap country-focused exchange traded funds.Deutsche Bank’s asset management trimmed the expense ratio of its $281m Xtrackers USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF from 25 basis points to 20bp, making it about half as expensive as the two big junk bond ETFs from BlackRock and State Street. That means it costs 20 cents annually to buy $100 worth of the ETF.Also on Monday, Franklin Templeton Investments unveiled a series of 16 ETFs that track the stocks of a country or region, such as Australia, Germany, Japan or Europe as a whole, most of which cost just 9bp annually.The ETFs are part of Franklin’s LibertyShares ETF arm, which launched last year and now manages just under $1bn.The mammoth flows of investor money into ETFs and other passive index-tracking funds continued this year, despite a pick-up in the performance of many traditional active fund managers, with the total universe of ETFs crossing the $4tn mark earlier this year.However, this has resulted in a mounting price war among ETF providers, which are scrambling to grab as much market share in the passive investment landscape as possible — especially with the entry of new players such as Franklin Templeton and Goldman Sachs Asset Management.Some analysts even speculate that it will only be a matter of time before some simple ETFs essentially become free.“The fee wars have ramped up over the past few weeks,” said Ben Johnson, head of ETF research at Morningstar, the data provider.“Despite all the new products, investor interest is still mostly for plain vanilla, cheap products. And that’s where we’ve seen the flows go this year.”However, Mr Johnson pointed out that the pressure on fees was broadening out from simple products to more complicated “smart beta” and fixed income ETFs as well. “The price war is pervasive.”Earlier this month, State Street reduced the price of 15 of its smaller ETFs in response to competition from BlackRock and Vanguard — the two other big players in the passive investment universe.The annual price of two US equity ETFs was slashed to just 3bp, or 3 cents per $100 invested.The liquidity of ETFs is important to big investors that want to trade easily in and out of a fund without moving the underlying market, explaining why State Street has kept the price of its flagship $255bn US equity ETF at 9bp despite the competition.But underscoring how price is now a bigger battleground, State Street also started using its own indices for three ETFs, dropping more expensive benchmarks licensed from FTSE Russell.That followed Charles Schwab launching an ETF that tracked its own index of 1,000 big US companies at an expense ratio of just 5bp, pitting it head to head with Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street’s flagship US equity ETFs.The competition from increasingly cheap passive products is bleeding into the traditional active asset management industry as well.The average expense ratios of US equity funds have fallen from about 99 cents for every $100 invested in 2000 to 63 cents in 2016, according to the Investment Company Institute.
117;STT;State Street Corp;2017-10-28T04:00:51Z;When Silicon Valley came to Wall Street;Mainstream asset managers have begun using big data and machine learning;Gilead Sciences recently reached an $11.9bn agreement to acquire Kite Pharma for a 50 per cent premium to its monthly average stock price. Five days before the US takeover was announced, an artificially intelligent computer predicted it.The algorithm, developed by Dataminr, a New York-based technology group, had noticed unusual social media chatter and options activity and alerted its clients about a possible buyout of Kite by a large biotech company. The following week, shares in Kite jumped 28 per cent.The prediction was not the first time clever social media analysis had anticipated a market movement before investors, analysts and journalists. For years, boutique hedge funds have used computers to crunch alternative data sources to gain a competitive edge over their rivals.However, as artificial intelligence makes predictions more sophisticated and active managers come under pressure to reduce costs and improve returns, mainstream investment companies such as Schroders, Axa Investment Managers, JPMorgan Asset Management, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, State Street, NN Investment Partners and Fidelity have also begun using big data or machine learning to aid investment decisions.“There has been a blurring between traditional judgmental managers and quantitative managers,” says Gideon Smith, Europe chief investment officer at AXA Rosenberg Equities, the quantitative investment arm of France-based Axa Investment Managers. AXA Rosenberg said earlier this month it would integrate machine learning and big data into its investment processes.“Any role where you are doing something repetitive is ripe to be done faster, quicker, cheaper by machines and robots, and so it is beholden on all of us in the asset management industry to look at what we do . . . and [whether] it is something that a machine might be able to do better.”As cheaper, passively managed funds grow in popularity and attract assets away from active managers, investment houses have come under fierce pressure to cut fees and improve performance. Under the spotlight of investors, regulators and passive rivals, active managers hope that artificial intelligence can help traditional fund houses beat the market and rein costs in.2.5 quintillionBytes of data created every dayWith this in mind, Schroders, the UK’s largest listed asset manager, has embarked on ambitious plans to recruit data scientists. It has expanded its data team from two to 18 over the past two years and plans to hire more staff as portfolio managers get used to the technology.“There are all these big data sets that could be useful to inform the investment decisions that stockpickers are making,” says Mark Ainsworth, head of data insights at Schroders. “But they don’t currently exist in a form that is useful for investment managers.“You can get a computer to make some sort of sense of a large body of text.”According to Mr Ainsworth, Schroders’ data team accurately predicted how many betting shops the UK’s competition regulator would force Ladbrokes and Gala Coral to sell following a £2.2bn deal to create the UK’s largest gambling house.“The alternative is to put an intern in front of Google Maps for six weeks,” he says.For years, small tech groups have attempted to woo traditional money managers with machine learning technology, arguing that it was a strategic imperative for investment companies to understand the 2.5 quintillion bytes of data that are created every day. But until now many mutual fund groups have struggled to make the transition because of a lack of in-house expertise and the high cost of valuable information.In the past few years, breakthroughs in machine learning and so-called natural-language processing, where computers learn to interpret human language, have made it possible for artificial intelligence to decipher social media communication, patent filings, satellite images and even analyst calls.191*Number of start-up tech companies offering alternative data analysis to financial institutionsThese developments have piqued the interest of big investment groups. “Unstructured data have grown exponentially,” says Javier Rodriguez-Alarcon, head of quantitative investment strategies for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.“You have a gap between the amount of information and the ability to process it, and [for a long time] the only way to close that gap was to hire lots of Javiers.“Now you can capture that gap by using computers.”Almost a third of asset managers surveyed this year by Tabb Group, a capital markets consultancy, said they were using alternative data, with 64 per cent saying they believed it could help them beat their benchmarks. The most popular information was social media data, supply-chain analysis, business performance information and web traffic.Their interest has led to an explosion in the number of start-up tech companies offering alternative data analysis to financial institutions. There are now 191 providers around the world, according to AlternativeData.org, a data provider on the industry set up by YipIt Data.*“There has definitely been a significant increase from traditional mutual funds in the past year,” says Emmett Kilduff, founder of Eagle Alpha, a well-known alternative data provider.“There are some macro factors: a lot of money is going to passive and quantitative [funds], so the discretionary guys are trying to become more quantamental [quantitative and fundamental].”The effects of a shift towards quantitative investing using machine learning tools will be significant for financial markets.If companies attempt to control data signals or the same few vendors provide underlying technology to multiple asset managers, there could be concerns about crowding and competition.90%Percentage of quantitative funds using data science and machine learning“Does the regulator know what the changes to the market will be if people don’t know what is happening on the margins?” says Daniel Tammas-Hastings, founder of RiskSave, a robo-advice start-up. “If we built a machine-learning algorithm now and asked it to trade individual accounts, it would take two, three years before we knew whether it was right.”Obstacles remain for traditional fund managers, who are often trained in economics and finance rather than data science or technology.“They are too big, they are too slow,” says Scott Borgerson, co-founder of CargoMetrics, a maritime data analytics group, which is now a hedge fund. “These are big data Silicon Valley things, not Wall Street things.”Stockpickers usually do not buy and sell stocks more than once within a trading day and cannot always benefit from a data-driven signal that is only a few hours ahead of a company announcement.“There are many challenges for someone who is not native in data science to start using these tools,” says Armando Gonzalez, chief executive of RavenPack, which provides social media and news analysis to investors. “I would say 90 per cent of quantitative funds and 30 per cent of fundamental [managers] are using these tools.”*This article has been amended from the original to update the number of providers and correct the originator of the data.Big data and artificial intelligence are not just used in investment decisions. Many of the largest fund houses and banks have also rushed to launch cheap, automated advice platforms known as robo-advisers, which use technology to recommend funds based on simple questions.Their belief is that automation online will reshape the market for financial advice by appealing to younger and less wealthy savers. HSBC, Investec, BlackRock, Deutsche Asset Management, Schroders, Aberdeen Asset Management and Lyxor are among the financial institutions that have bought or invested in robo-advice.Citigroup has estimated the robo-advice market globally could reach $5tn over the next decade.“As the population becomes more digital . . . there is a massive opportunity for lenders to expand through automation,” says Shaun Port, chief investment officer at Nutmeg, the online investment manager in which Schroders invested more than £12m.“That’s the only way you can grow with a huge population and the need to keep costs low.” Nutmeg employs four data scientists in a team of 98 and wants to hire more next year.Regulators have welcomed robo-advisers. In April, the UK set out new rules to free online providers from the heavier regulation associated with traditional financial advice. Last year, the Financial Conduct Authority said it wanted to encourage the growth of robo-advisers as a way to offer investment help to a greater number of people.For asset managers the hope is that automated advice could help them save money. “The drivers for active managers is to come up with top-line increases while reducing cost and speed,” says Tej Vakta, head of wealth management at Capgemini, a consultancy and technology provider.
118;STT;State Street Corp;2017-10-20T09:36:13Z;Japan equity funds suffer record outflows ahead of election;Investors opt not to trust forecasts of Shinzo Abe victory after other polling snafus;Japan equity funds suffered record outflows in the past week as traders and investors turned defensive after a stirring run up for share prices ahead of the country’s snap elections on Sunday.According to EPFR Global, investors withdrew $4.4bn from funds focusing on Japanese equities in the week to Wednesday, the largest net outflow since the research group began tracking data in 2002.The withdrawals came as Japanese equity markets have rallied sharply since early September, with the Topix index sitting at its best level since 2007, while the Nikkei 225 price weighted average at 21,457 has returned to a level last seen in 1996.The rally in share prices reflects anticipation of a victory by prime minister Shinzo Abe. and a larger majority for his Liberal Democratic party and a personal mandate for reform.Many market participants, having been caught out by erroneous polling forecasts ahead of major elections in recent years, have opted for a defensive stance ahead of the vote.“We are thinking Abe will get what Theresa May wanted, but did not get,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors. “People are worried about elections because polls have often been incorrect.”Mr Gokhman added that the investment stakes are likely higher if Mr Abe loses than if he wins, given the sharp gains for Japanese equities.“If Abe does win, it is fully priced in. If he loses, you have a correction,” Mr Gokhman said. “If you are a tactical trader, it makes some sense to take a little bit out of your Japanese position and put it on the sidelines until after the election results.”Market participants also booked profits last week on South Korean equities, where net outflows totalled $630m, the largest amount since the week of April 20 2016, EPFR said. South Korea’s Kospi index is up more than 20 per cent this year.Overall, however, global investors poured a collective $8bn into equity funds with those dedicated to US equities accounting for the biggest share at $7.5bn, a 17-week high.“It is not surprising,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors. “On the back of all-time record highs, investors continue to plough into equity exposure, especially the US.”This week, US benchmarks touched fresh highs with the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaching the 23,000 mark on positive US earnings reports led by IBM, UnitedHealth and Johnson & Johnson.
119;STT;State Street Corp;2017-10-16T17:09:57Z;State Street escalates price war over exchange traded funds;New business for exchange traded funds operations lags behind its main rivals this year;The cut-throat price war among exchange traded fund providers escalated on Monday after State Street announced fee reductions on 15 ETFs with $11bn in assets in an effort to respond to intense competition from BlackRock and Vanguard.New business growth for State Street’s ETF operations has lagged behind well behind its main rivals so far in 2017 as the overall market continues to grow rapidly.State Street has attracted $13.5bn in net ETF inflows in the first nine months of this year while BlackRock has gathered just under $194bn and Vanguard has registered $112bn in new ETF business, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy.“It’s part of State Street’s bid to keep up with BlackRock, Vanguard and Schwab,” said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. “At this point it has little choice than to make a move like this.”The fee cuts range from 4 basis points to as much as 48bp for State Street’s broad emerging markets ETF, known by its ticker SPEM.State Street’s move is designed to lure more professional fund managers into using ETFs as part of clients’ portfolios.So called model portfolios that are constructed entirely or mainly with ETFs have become increasingly popular among US wealth managers.State Street provides the asset allocation advice that underpins these model portfolios as well as ETFs that form building blocks for portfolios.“Financial advisers are using these products as the core of their portfolios in larger and larger numbers,” said Nick Good, co-head of State Street’s SPDR business.In an further effort to save costs, State Street also decided to self-index three ETFs by using benchmarks that have been created in-house by the Boston-based asset manager in lieu of those managed by FTSE Russell, reflecting growing dissatisfaction with the fees charged by established index providers.The Financial Times reported in May 2017 that executives at some of the big ETF providers have considered the idea of forming an industry “co-operative” that would potentially create its own indices.State Street was the world’s largest ETF manager until 2003, when it was overtaken by iShares.It lost its second spot ranking in terms of ETF assets under management in 2015 to Vanguard, which has cut fees repeatedly and enhanced its reputation as a low-cost provider.Industry observers have often noted that State Street historically has proved slow to respond to fee cuts by rivals.Last year, State Street reshuffled its senior ETF management team, moving the veteran Jim Ross to the position of chairman to make way for two new co-heads: Nick Good and Rory Tobin.Competition across the ETF industry globally is intensifying rapidly. Invesco, the US asset manager, has made two acquisitions this year in a drive to strengthen its position.Atlanta-based Invesco paid $1.2bn to buy the ETF arm of Guggenheim in addition to paying an undisclosed price to acquire the London-based ETF provider Source.JPMorgan has announced plans to offer ETFs in Europe in the near future while Franklin Templeton has launched ETF operations in the US, Canada and Europe over the past year.
120;STT;State Street Corp;2017-10-16T14:18:18Z;State Street shifts to home-grown indices for three US stock ETFs;;State Street has dropped Russell indices and begun to compile its own baskets for three US-focused exchange-traded funds, underlining the race to cut costs and the backlash against fees charged by index providers in the burgeoning industry.The Boston-based asset manager will move away from Russell’s indices on three of its ETFs: the SPDR Russell 3,000, SPDR Russell 1,000 and SPDR Russell 2,000. The funds will be renamed the SPDR Portfolio Total Stock Market ETF, the SPDR Portfolio Large Cap ETF and SPDR Portfolio Small Cap ETF.As part of the decision, State Street will slice the expense ratio on the first two funds to 0.03 per cent from 0.1 per cent. The small cap funds’ expense ratio will fall in half, from 0.1 per cent to 0.05 per cent.In all three cases, the new indices were created and sponsored by State Street Global Advisors. ICE Data, an arm of IntercontinentalExchange, will be responsible for day-to-day management and calculation of the indices.The decision by State Street, which is among the biggest ETF sponsors, highlights asset managers’ frustration with the fees they need to pay in order to use the indices that are tracked by their funds. While fees vary, the biggest industry players can pay tens of millions of dollars a year to licence indices. Meanwhile, the boom in ETFs has been a boon to the main index providers, S&P Dow Jones Indices, MSCI and FTSE Russell.The Financial Times reported in May 2017 that executives at some of the big ETF providers have considered the idea of forming an industry “co-operative” that would potentially create its own indices.State Street on Monday also said it will cut the fees it charges on 12 other ETFs, to what it described as equal to or below the lowest fee ETF in its category. The move comes amid intense competition in a sector that has seen rapid flows by investors seeking low-cost, passive exposure to a broad variety of assets.Here is a look at the changes in fees:Read more:
121;STT;State Street Corp;2017-10-15T04:43:32Z;BlackRock and Vanguard’s climate change efforts are glacial;The engagement excuse on global warming is wearing thin, writes Attracta Mooney;BlackRock, a large investor in companies that rely heavily on fossil fuels, does not seem a likely environmentalist.But one year ago, the world’s largest asset manager issued a stark warning about global warming. “Investors can no longer ignore climate change,” said the fund house, which oversees $6tn in assets.The New York-listed company argued that even if one did not agree with the science, investors could not disregard the “swelling tide of climate-related regulations and technological disruption”. Investors, it said, needed to act to protect their portfolios.Yet just a few months later, BlackRock appeared to forget its own warning. Throughout the year to June 2017, the fund house repeatedly voted against resolutions at annual general meetings that called on companies to provide more clarity about how they might be affected by climate change.According to Proxy Insight, the data provider, BlackRock voted against so-called scenario-planning climate change resolutions, which are typically put forward by shareholders and often not supported by management, at 14 oil and gas companies, including Southern Company, Noble Energy and Hess. It backed the measures at just two, the big oil majors ExxonMobil and Occidental.In most cases, the resolutions asked that companies annually assess how they might be affected by measures to limit temperature rises to 2C, in line with the 2015 Paris agreement.BlackRock is not alone in its inconsistent voting. JPMorgan and Vanguard, which have also warned of the risks posed by climate change, failed to back resolutions at 14 companies, but supported them at two. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-largest fund house, supported resolutions at eight oil and gas companies, abstained at five and voted against at three, according to Proxy Insight.This patchy record makes little sense. If a fund house believes climate change could hurt stocks over the longer term, it seems sensible that investors should demand as much information as possible on these risks at all companies.Investors with inconsistent records typically explain the difference in their voting record as “engagement”. Big investors often speak to management privately during the year, and particularly before AGMs, and will try to use their influence to change company policy behind the scenes.This is BlackRock’s explanation for its voting record. It says it takes “climate change seriously and engages with relevant companies”.“We do vote for shareholder proposals on climate when we think our engagement has not led to the change we seek,” BlackRock told FTfm. “We don’t decide how to vote based solely on our views on the issue under consideration. Our vote reflects our assessment of the company’s response to our engagement in light of the long-term financial impact.”But almost two years after the Paris agreement, the excuse of engagement is wearing thin. Climate change will not just affect a few, it has the ability to alter entire sectors radically. And secret discussions will not drive the sector-wide disclosure that is required.As Carolyn Hayman, who co-chairs Preventable Surprises, a lobby group, says: “We are talking about systemic risk from climate change that will effect the whole economy worldwide. [Investors] have a fiduciary duty to understand this.“A case-by-case approach doesn’t get the sector-wide change that is really needed. No one but the people engaging can know what the impact of engaging is. [This] requires a top-down approach rather than company by company.”The climate change issue is here to stay. Even with the US withdrawing from the Paris agreement, governments show few signs of slowing down their drive to limit global warming — including France and the UK, which will both ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2040.Investors will of course continue filing resolutions at a wide variety of companies over climate change. But it is now up to the world’s biggest investors to put their vote where their mouth is. A couple of high-profile protest votes that generate nice headlines is no longer good enough.As Ms Hayman says: “A lot of investors are very concerned and are voting against management in really large numbers [on climate change resolutions]. It’s time for Vanguard and BlackRock to get with the project.”Attracta Mooney is the FT’s investment correspondent
122;STT;State Street Corp;2017-10-06T18:02:05Z;UBS wins £11bn investment mandate from UK councils;Swiss group fends off LGIM, Deutsche AM and BlackRock for pooled-pensions contract;UBS Asset Management has won one of the UK industry’s biggest investment mandates after securing an £11bn deal to manage the pension assets of nearly 1m British council workers once run by Legal & General and State Street.The shake-up is part of the consolidation of England and Wales’s local authority pension funds, started by George Osborne, the former chancellor.The Swiss group secured the contract from the Local Government Pension Scheme’s Access pool, which combines the assets of 11 local authority schemes, including those of Cambridgeshire and Kent.The merging of council pension funds across the UK is expected to result in a radical overhaul of the country’s asset management industry. Various pension pots, including the Welsh pool, have already warned they will cull asset managers as they hunt down cheaper fees and better investment returns.Nearly £6.3bn of Access’s passive assets that UBS will manage from next year are run by Legal & General Investment Management, and just under £4bn by State Street Global Advisors. UBS already accounts for £770m of the passive assets.The Swiss group triumphed after a beauty parade that included tenders from LGIM, Deutsche Asset Management and BlackRock.“I am delighted we have started the process of pooling early with some tangible, long-term savings and look forward to a smooth transition to UBS,” said Andrew Reid, chairman of Access’s joint committee.Malcolm Gordon, head of UK institutional at UBS Asset Management, said the decision was “a great endorsement” of its indexing capability.Mr Osborne had called on local authorities across the UK to pool their assets in supersized “wealth funds” in a bid to cut costs and increase efficiencies, in the biggest shake-up ever of council pension funds.In June, it was announced that Janus Henderson and Royal Bank of Canada would manage hundreds of millions of pounds for London council workers.State Street declined to comment. LGIM could not be reached for comment.Earlier this year, UBS AM won a passive mandate to manage A$17bn (£10bn) for AMP Capital, the Australian asset manager.The LGPS group said the move, a consolidation of its passive equity mandates, would save it £5m annually, an increase from its earlier estimate of £4m. Access’s total assets stood at £41bn at the end of March.England and Wales’s 89 local authority schemes, which collectively oversee £217bn, are rushing to pool their cash into eight separate partnerships as part of the government’s plans. They have until next April to get their pools up and running.It is expected the assets will be transferred to UBS by the end of March. The Swiss group will initially manage the funds until March 2028.
123;STT;State Street Corp;2017-10-01T16:19:29Z;Top investment groups push for action on climate risks;BlackRock and others demand disclosure at US energy companies, analysis shows;Large investment groups including BlackRock and Vanguard have stepped up pressure on US energy companies to address the risks associated with climate change, despite the Trump administration’s lack of action to address the threat.An analysis of shareholder votes at this year’s annual meetings showed investors have taken a more active role in pushing for information on climate risks, often voting for improved disclosure against company board recommendations. In votes at seven of the largest US energy companies this year, the 30 largest investors switched their votes to support disclosure on climate risk a total of 38 times, having opposed similar resolutions in 2016, according to ShareAction, a campaign group. The data come from regulatory filings compiled by Proxy Insight, an information service. The increasingly assertive position taken by large investors had its most significant impacts at ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum, two of the largest US oil groups. There was majority support for proposals calling on the companies to publish regular reports on the possible impact on their businesses of policies to address the threat of climate change. In both cases, BlackRock and Vanguard, the world’s two largest fund managers, voted to support the proposals. Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Standard Investments, the largest active manager in the UK, said the group backed motions calling for climate-related disclosure because it wanted to “encourage greater ownership of the risks of climate change at board level”. As an index investor, you can hold all the companies in your portfolio to the same standard. You don’t need regulationState Street Global Advisors has been one of the most active large fund managers in pushing boards to take account of climate change. Rakhi Kumar, its head of environmental, social and governance investments, said that with holdings in about 10,000 companies worldwide, the group could have a very broad influence. “As an index investor, you can hold all the companies in your portfolio to the same standard. You don’t need regulation,” she said. Many investors have been stepping up their engagement with companies over climate change, generally seeking more transparency on the potential risks to earnings. BlackRock, for example, identified climate risk disclosure as one of its five investment stewardship priorities for 2017-18. However, there have been some wide variations in fund managers’ votes on climate-related issues. In “key climate votes” this year as assessed by the 50/50 Climate Project, another group that works with investors on the issue, BlackRock voted for relevant proposals 9 per cent of the time and Vanguard 15 per cent, compared to 61 per cent for State Street. BlackRock said its approach was to “engage primarily through direct dialogue but [we] will exercise our right to vote against management recommendations where we do not see sufficient progress.” Ms Kumar at State Street said the group used both “vote and voice” to persuade boards to assess climate risk. Edward Kamonjoh, executive director of the 50/50 Climate Project, said he expected investors to seek better explanations from fund managers when they decide not to support climate-related resolutions. “Large fund managers with poor voting records on climate risk can expect public challenges on the dichotomy between their engagement priorities and voting practices,” he said.Demand side remains wedded to fossil fuels / From Carolyn Hayman, London, UK
124;STT;State Street Corp;2017-09-25T03:00:48Z;Global fund houses hold crunch talks with FCA to clarify Mifid;New EU rules clash with US law and threaten to disrupt industry’s biggest companies;Forty of the world’s largest asset managers and banks held an emergency summit in London with the Financial Conduct Authority last week, in a last-ditch attempt to persuade the UK’s financial regulator to clarify new rules that threaten to disrupt their global operations.Asset managers and banks face a shake-up in their operations within weeks when European regulations known as Mifid II come into force. However, tough disclosure requirements on how asset managers pay for third-party research clash with existing US regulations.No solution emerged from the secret meeting between the FCA and senior executives from BlackRock, JPMorgan, Vanguard, State Street and Schroders, as well as representatives from top investment banks.“The FCA said, ‘Trust us, we hope to come to an agreement that will keep everyone happy’,” said a senior executive who was present at the meeting, but who did not wish to be named. “They were very keen to demonstrate that they understand the seriousness of the issue.”“We were assured that the FCA, European Commission and SEC [the US regulator] have their very highest calibre people working together, but it is now only a matter of weeks before [we have to be ready],” he said.Large asset managers typically run global portfolios that invest in multiple jurisdictions and rely on research and information that is gathered continuously across different time zones.They believe the efficient management of these global portfolios is threatened by Mifid II, which is effective from January 3. The FCA is responsible for enforcing Mifid rules in the UK, the world’s second-largest asset management industry, which hosts the industry’s biggest international names.Payments for research under the Mifid II rules must be separated out from trading costs so that clients understand clearly what they are being charged for.This change, known as unbundling, presents problems for managers operating in Europe when they receive research that originated from outside the EU.US asset managers are concerned that they will be blocked from freely sharing US analyst research paid for via trading commissions across their global trading operations.Lawyers and associations representing asset managers have repeatedly asked the FCA to clarify how they can continue to receive broker research from outside the EU and remain compliant with the new rules.The FCA’s response has been to insist that US managers must take further steps if they cannot separate out research costs and trading commissions paid to US brokers.The regulator has said that US managers operating in Europe must “fully account” for research inputs using objective benchmarks or metrics to make an assessment.The FCA has further insisted that US managers must have systems and controls to ensure that receiving research from a broker does not induce an asset manager to place trading orders with that same organisation or “give rise to any other conflicts of interest” that might be detrimental to clients.But time is running out, according to the executive that attended the London summit held on Tuesday at the Investment Association, the UK trade body.The London meeting coincided with appeals on the other side of the Atlantic by two investment trade bodies to the SEC. They asked the US regulator to refrain from pursuing US managers if their actions fail to satisfy new European standards.The FCA’s stance poses a significant challenge for US brokers. Under US rules, they cannot receive direct payments for research unless they are formally registered as investment advisers.This means, in theory, that these brokers will not be able to provide research to European clients — who will be obliged to make direct payments for research services — from January.The two associations have asked the SEC to allow “no-action relief” if US managers continue to link research payments and trading costs together, as has been their historic practice.The Securities and Financial Markets Association, which counts investment managers with $34tn in assets as members, said it feared that US-based investment advisers and broker dealers could be precluded from operating in the EU by the European restrictions on research payments.The Investment Company Institute has also sought assurances that the SEC will not take legal action if asset managers continue to conduct trades on behalf of European and US clients that might include transactions where research payments have not been unbundled.“Investment advisers may be forced to place competing trades in the same security into the market, resulting in worse execution [outcomes] for clients overall,” wrote Dorothy Donohue, acting general counsel at ICI.
125;STT;State Street Corp;2017-09-25T03:00:17Z;Treasure map of the ETF world revealed;Identifying institutions that own marketable securities is tough for asset managers;Asking an exchange traded fund provider “just who is buying your ETFs?” often prompts the unsatisfactory reply “all types of investors”.A peculiarity of the $4.4tn ETF industry is just how little is known about many of the institutions that own these marketable securities that track an index, commodity or bond. This is a big obstacle for asset managers trying to expand in a rapidly growing sector.“Asset managers find it very challenging to obtain data on which investors are using their ETFs or a competitor’s products,” says Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI, the data provider.Identifying ETF investors is difficult due to a scarcity of publicly available data on investor type, size and location, as well as the products they use.“It can feel as if someone has dropped a bag of money outside the front door and then run off,” says Frank Spiteri, head of distribution at ETF Securities, the London-based asset manager.To better understand the ETF industry’s investor base, ETFGI examined regulatory filings from more than 70 countries. It identified 4,450 institutional investors and more than 8,000 mutual funds that held one or more ETFs in 2016.$100bnValue of ETFs held by Bank of America Merrill LynchBanks, brokers, investment advisers and insurers count among the largest users of ETFs, which have also become popular among US university endowments. ETF adoption is rising among US pensions funds, and both hedge fund managers and traditional mutual fund managers are making greater use of ETFs to put money to work quickly or as protection against other positions going wrong.According to ETFGI’s global ownership survey, Bank of America Merrill Lynch holds the top position as the largest institutional user of ETFs, with holdings of more than $100bn.The survey, known as ETFGI’s treasure map, shows that about $256bn of ETF assets are also held by Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, UBS, BMO, JPMorgan and Citigroup, which control massive positions due to their dual roles as market makers and investment advisers. Japan’s central bank has developed into a major holder of ETFs which it has used to pump money into the stock market as part of its quantitative easing programme. Several Japanese insurance companies including the National Mutual Insurance Federation of Agricultural co-operatives, Nippon Life, Daido Life and Dai-ichi Life also hold substantial ETF investments.ETFGI’s report identifies ETF holdings of at least $1bn at four hedge fund managers: Passport Capital, Citadel, Two Sigma and Parallax Volatility Advisers. Citadel Securities is also a prominent ETF market maker.Ms Fuhr reckons there has been an increase of at least 44 per cent in the number of institutional investors using ETFs over the past five years.But this is highly likely to be an underestimate. New business for ETF managers grew at a record-breaking rate for a fourth consecutive year in 2017. Investors have ploughed close to $434bn into ETFs in the first eight months of this year, already surpassing the net inflows of $391bn registered over the whole of 2016.Understanding which investors might be potential clients is vital for any manager looking to launch ETFs or to expand their business in the face of cut-throat competition from the industry’s top three: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street.“It would be transformational for asset managers to accurately know who is holding their ETFs,” said an industry veteran who did not want to be named.He added that some managers chose to address particular client types, such as pension funds, across Europe, whereas others preferred to look at all clients in a country.“Client types versus geography — both matter, but geography is inescapable in Europe, where country and language experience are necessary,” he said.Mark Fitzgerald, head of equity product management for Europe at Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, says discovering where ETF investor flows originate is hard and “the picture is very different from one country to another”.“Vanguard has focused on markets that suit our core message on the importance of low costs. In Europe, we have focused initially on the UK, Netherlands and Switzerland, and we are now looking to expand in Germany,” says Mr Fitzgerald.For an entrant, the biggest challenge from this lack of data is identifying the key client segments and geographies for our distribution effortsSome managers hire specialists to trawl through share registers from custodians to obtain data. However, fees for this type of service can run to more than $15,000 for a single ETF.Mr Spiteri says it is essential to mine data from multiple sources such as Bloomberg, the financial information group, company reports, share registers and the registers held by depositories and custodians. Market intelligence from dealing desks and other portfolio managers also helps.“It can never be a perfect science but it is vitally important, as it helps an ETF provider to understand their clients better and manage their business more effectively,” he says.Nick King, head of ETFs at Fidelity International, the UK-based asset manager, says anonymity of transactions in ETFs is frustrating for entrants that are used to having direct contact with the client every time they trade.“For an entrant, the biggest challenge from this lack of data is identifying the key client segments and geographies for our distribution efforts. This issue is compounded when looking to enter an area of the market that is relatively undeveloped, such as smart beta products,” says Mr King.He adds that using CRM [customer relationship management] tools, and building close relationships with clients and market participants can help ETF managers identify who is behind a transaction.Andrew McCollum, a managing director at Greenwich Associates, the US consultancy, estimates that only one in five US institutions currently use ETFs. This illustrates the potential for ETFs to spread more widely in the US, as well as other countries around the world where ETF adoption is far less advanced.Mr McCollum says that internal guidelines or restrictions that limit or prohibit the use of ETFs by institutions are “falling by the wayside” as evidence mounts that peer investors are using ETFs safely and effectively.A survey of 187 institutional investors published by Greenwich this month found that guidelines restricting equity ETF usage among non-users dropped from 20 per cent in 2015 to 9 per cent last year. Restrictions on bond ETF usage among non-users fell around 25 per cent, to 19 per cent, over the same period.

127;STT;State Street Corp;2017-09-10T04:02:42Z;Best-known high yield funds ‘disappoint’;Underwhelming returns are blamed on fees;The world’s two largest high yield corporate bond ETFs mark their 10th anniversary this year — yet both face questions over whether they have provided investors with the performance they promised.BlackRock’s flagship $18.3bn high yield ETF, along with its closest rival, State Street’s $12.5bn bond fund, have become essential investment tools.BlackRock’s HYG has delivered annualised returns of 5.7 per cent since its launch in April 2007. However, its performance target, the Markit iBoxx Liquid High Yield Index, registered annualised returns of 6.2 per cent over the same period.State Street launched JNK in November 2007 and has delivered annualised returns of 5.9 per cent since. But it too has underperformed against its stated benchmark — the Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Very Liquid Index, which has registered annualised returns of 8.1 per cent.High yield is one of the more challenging fixed income markets for both active managers and index tracking ETFs. Not all high yield bonds trade every day so pricing can be more problematic than in a more liquid market, such as US government bonds, where liquidity is plentiful.Traditional active managers that aim to beat the market by picking individual bonds claim that the pricing and liquidity challenges of the high yield market provide them with an advantage over passive ETFs, which cannot deviate from strict preset rules.Stephen Baines, portfolio manager at Kames Capital, the Edinburgh-based investment house, says the returns delivered by HYG and JNK are “somewhat disappointing” due in part to their fees, which were higher than for ETFs that track equity markets. Annual management fees for HYG and JNK are 49 basis points and 40bp, respectively, compared with an average of about 26bp for equity ETFs.Mr Baines believes the US high yield bond market is simply “too big” for any single ETF to track efficiently.There are about 1,900 individual bonds trading in the US high yield market but the major ETFs hold around only 1,000 securities.“This means these trackers have taken the decision to ignore hundreds of securities, leaving behind plenty of selection opportunities for active managers,” says Mr Baines.Despite the opportunities, underperformance is widespread among active high yield managers, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, the data provider. Its analysis suggests fewer than one in 10 active managers outperformed the index in 2016. Over the past 10 years, just under 97 per cent of active managers have underperformed the US high yield index.Matthew Tucker, head of the iShares fixed income strategy team at BlackRock, says ETFs have provided investors with more choice.“There are some very good active high yield funds that investors can choose if they have a firm conviction that these managers will continue to deliver outperformance. HYG sits in the top half of the pack for returns over the past decade, once fees are taken into account,” he says.Mr Tucker rejects criticisms of HYG’s performance in tracking its benchmark. “BlackRock has delivered consistently strong tracking between HYG and its underlying index, outperforming by 2 bps annually since inception, once the drag from the management fee is taken into account,” he says.Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street, says changes in the methodology of calculating JNK’s target index have distorted the historic performance comparisons between the ETF and its benchmark.“The historic data are not an accurate reflection of the current performance of JNK in how well it tracks its benchmark,” he says. He adds that State Street has revamped its portfolio management systems and support teams, resulting in a marked improvement in JNK’s tracking performance.Mr Bartolini rejects the view that index-tracking high yield ETFs exclude too many securities. “JNK provides a highly diverse exposure to the high yield market in a single wrapper,” he says. “Active managers have on average around 300 holdings in their high yield portfolios so they are taking more concentrated bets with more exposure to single stock risks.”Mr Tucker notes ETFs such as HYG increasingly are used as tools by active high yield managers to help them reduce costs and to manage risks. “So the ETF is not always a competitor to an actively managed high yield fund,” he says.In addition, high yield ETFs are now used widely in the highly sophisticated model portfolios offered by wealth managers and broker dealers.“Only ETFs can provide the liquidity and low transaction costs required for asset allocation changes or rebalancing by these investment portfolios, which are often very large,” says Mr Tucker.

This deal has boosted Invesco’s ETF assets by around $20bn. The Atlanta-based manager is also in discussions about a possible deal to buy the ETF business of Guggenheim Partners.Nomura, the Japanese bank, and Nikko Asset Management, have both benefited from the Bank of Japan’s ETF-buying programme, under which the government has pumped vast sums into the stock market as part of the Abenomics reform programme designed to stimulate economic growth.Deutsche Bank and Lyxor, the asset management arm of Société Générale, the French bank, have had less spectacular growth since the end of 2013. Their ETF operations are concentrated in Europe, where the market is less well established than in the US.

The fiercely competitive business squeezed profit margins, so Ross McLellan, an executive vice-president of State Street, oversaw a plan to target large deals for unauthorised charges, where they would be less likely to draw attention, according to the SEC. In January, State Street agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement and paid $32.3m to settle related criminal charges with the US Department of Justice. Mr McLellan, who was discharged by the bank in 2011, and Edward Pennings, another bank executive, are scheduled to go on trial next month for securities and wire fraud. The overcharging scheme’s first victim was a sovereign wealth fund in the Middle East. In 2010, the bank offered to rework its $6bn portfolio for “zero” commissions, saying it would be compensated by the fund’s counterparties, the SEC said. Instead, Mr McLellan suggested to two UK-based subordinates that the bank “should take one or two basis points of undisclosed mark-ups”, the SEC said. “[N]o one is going to [expletive] notice that . . . It’s a rounding error,” one State Street trader told a colleague on a recorded line, according to the SEC. The bank hid $2.7m or 9 basis points worth of secret mark-ups as “bid-offer spread” in customer documents, the SEC said. “Agreeing to a fee arrangement and then secretly tucking in hidden, unauthorised mark-ups is fraudulent mistreatment of customers,” said Paul Levenson, director of the SEC's Boston Regional Office that investigated the overcharges. Mr McLellan’s team also cheated an Irish government agency of $4.5m and defrauded a UK postal company of $3m on transition deal charges, the SEC said. In an unrelated episode of misconduct, State Street failed to make material disclosures involving its electronic trading platform for US Treasuries called GovEx. In an effort to attract companies that could provide liquidity for the platform, the bank allowed one early user — identified only as “Subscriber A” — a chance to reject any match to a quote that it had submitted. Between July and October of 2010, Subscriber A rejected 57 of 157 matches with a total value of $157m, the SEC said. The bank described the GovEx platform as “fair and transparent” in its marketing materials. On at least two occasions, the bank explicitly denied giving any subscriber special treatment. “No one on our feed should have Last Look. There is no Last Look functionality on GovEx,” the bank said. “We deeply regret that our clients were impacted and that a small number of our employees failed to meet our expectations,” said Anne McNally, a State Street spokeswoman. “The impacted clients were fully reimbursed and over the past several years we have taken significant steps to strengthen our controls for our transition management business.”Follow David J Lynch on Twitter: @davidjlynch
130;STT;State Street Corp;2017-09-07T17:14:24Z;State Street to pay $35m in SEC settlement over client charges, disclosures;;State Street, one of the largest asset managers in the US, will pay more than $35m to settle charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it fraudulently charged clients and omitted material information about how it operated its Treasury trading platform.The SEC said that company had generated more than $20m in “improper revenue” by overcharging customers. State Street used false trading statements, pre-trade estimates, and post-trade reports to “misrepresent its compensation” on transactions of bonds and other securities, the commission said.“Agreeing to a fee arrangement and then secretly tucking in hidden, unauthorised markups is fraudulent mistreatment of customers,” said Paul Levenson, a director with the SEC who investigated the overcharges.State Street, which earlier this year agreed to pay more than $64m to resolve fraud charges with the Department of Justice, said in a statement that it “deeply” regretted that its clients were overcharged.“The impacted clients were fully reimbursed and over the past several years we have taken significant steps to strengthen our controls for our transition management business, and more broadly to enhance our compliance program, culture and operating environment,” the company said.State Street, which runs one of the largest exchange-traded fund businesses under the SPDR brand, had more than $2.6tn in assets under management at the end of June.

He added that index tracking funds accounted for less than 5 per cent of daily trading volumes of global financial markets.“I don’t see the bubble,” Mr McNabb said in an FT interview. “The data belie the fears.”The ETF industry has attracted almost $2.8tn in new business since the start of 2008, coinciding with one of the longest bull runs in US stock market history. His comments come as regulators globally are examining the potential risks of the explosive growth in the low-cost ETF industry. Investors ploughed nearly $400bn into ETFs in the first seven months of 2017, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy.“I don’t think what is happening in ETFs is systemic,” said Mr McNabb, who is stepping down as Vanguard’s chief executive at the end of the year but will remain chairman. “The concerns are more specific and idiosyncratic.”Traditional active asset managers, hedge funds and high-frequency traders accounted for the bulk of trading, Mr McNabb said.The shift towards ETFs has been particularly powerful in the US, where assets stood at almost $2.8tn at the end of March, compared with the $16.9tn US mutual fund industry, according to the Investment Company Institute. A year earlier the numbers were $2.1tn and $15.7tn, respectively.Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street dominate the ETF industry accounting for just under 70 per cent of the global market, according to ETFGI. Vanguard’s ETF business recently hit a record $800bn.However, there are growing concerns that the popularity of ETFs is stoking problems. Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital, the $100bn US alternative investment manager, last month warned it was unclear if ETFs and index mutual funds would find buyers for their holdings in the event of a market crunch.“When the management of assets is on autopilot, as it is with ETFs, then investment trends can go to great excess,” he said.Steven Bregman, co-founder of New York-based investment advisory firm Horizon Kinetics, has described the shift toward passive investing as “the greatest bubble ever”.However, Mr McNabb flagged areas of concern, including the proliferation of esoteric ETF products, many of which trade thinly and lack liquidity, and those that contain leverage.“I am more worried about ETFs that you don’t know what they mean,” he said. “Leverage is one of those topics that average investors don’t understand the negatives [of].”Pennsylvania-based Vanguard has set industry records for new business inflows for five consecutive years and is growing at a faster rate than arch-rival BlackRock.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
133;STT;State Street Corp;2017-09-02T04:00:56Z;Big investors step up rebellion at company meetings;Eighteen out of 20 asset managers cast fewer votes in favour of management this year;The world’s biggest investors rebelled more at company meetings globally this year compared with last year, as asset managers came under mounting pressure to tackle businesses over high pay, board diversity and bad management.Eighteen out of 20 large investors, including BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, Norges Bank, which runs Norway’s oil fund, and Calpers, the US’s largest public pension fund, cast fewer votes in favour of management recommendations at annual meetings in the year to the end of June compared with the previous year, according to Proxy Insight, the data provider.Companies including GAM, the Swiss asset manager, AstraZeneca, the Anglo-Swiss drugmaker, Burberry, the fashion house, and Wells Fargo, the US bank, all suffered shareholder revolts this year.The rebellion by fund houses comes as regulators and politicians around the world increasingly scrutinise the relationship between companies and their shareholders. Fund houses have been criticised repeatedly for failing to hold companies to account on excessive executive pay, a lack of gender diversity and inaction on climate change.Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Standard Life Aberdeen, the UK’s largest listed fund house, said asset managers are more willing to take a stand against company management because of the growing emphasis on their role as “stewards of investor money”.“There are more questions being asked by more clients about how we vote. [AGM votes] are a client asset like any other and we as a fiduciary have a duty [to use them properly]. We don’t look to have row with companies, but if there is something we disagree with, we have to reflect this in our votes,” he said.“The focus on stewardship is only going to increase. It is a fundamental way in which fund managers do the right thing by their clients and by the financial markets as a whole.”However, the Proxy Insight data shows that despite growing resistance from asset managers, many investors voted with management at least 90 per cent of the time.David Pitt-Watson, a corporate governance expert who was formerly at London Business School, said asset managers are taking voting at annual meetings more seriously than 20 years ago, but they could do better.Some progress has been made, but asset managers are still failing to do a reasonably good job for shareholders like you and me“Some progress has been made, but asset managers are still failing to do a reasonably good job for shareholders like you and me. It is your and my money in our pension funds that have voted through [controversial measures such as] all these executive bonus pay packages that we all think are wrong,” he said.“Fund managers are not taking the job as stewards as seriously as they ought.”Cliff Weight, director of ShareSoc, the body representing individual shareholders, added that fund managers have allowed corporate governance scandals to happen under their watch, including Tesco’s accountancy problems, rather than voicing dissent at annual meetings.“It is the stewards who have the power [to hold companies to account at AGMs] and they have allowed these things to happen. The engagement process isn’t working. Asset managers have been too short term for too long in their approach,” he said.Investors are expected to come under greater pressure to hold companies to account in the coming years. Last week, the UK government released a package of corporate governance reforms aimed at improving standards at listed companies. This includes the world’s first public register of listed companies that have faced pay rebellions, as pressure mounts on asset managers to rein in executive pay.Mr Lee said Aberdeen, which merged with Standard Life last month, voted against or withheld votes on pay at around half of US companies in 2017. The Proxy Insight data showed Aberdeen voted against company management proposals more this year compared with last year.Schroders, the UK-listed fund house, PGGM, the Dutch investor, and State Street Global Advisors, the third-largest asset manager in the world, also supported fewer management proposals this year at annual meetings.Jessica Ground, global head of stewardship at Schroders, said asset managers typically invest in companies and management teams they believe in.“But that doesn’t mean it is a blank cheque, and we will continue to hold them to account on pay and shareholder rights, which is a crucial aspect of the investment process,” she said. Calstrs, the US public pension fund, and APG, the Dutch pension fund, were most likely to vote against company management, the data shows.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of Share Action, the investor rights group, said there was “significant” room for improvement in how asset managers dealt with companies, particularly around governance and environmental issues that could have long-term effects on share prices.“As an active manager you can like a company, want to invest in it, and still have a real beef with its board and management,” she added.
134;STT;State Street Corp;2017-09-01T06:45:38Z;Majority of asset managers to absorb external research costs;Big fund houses to pay for analysts’ work as sector prepares for European rule change;"The majority of large asset managers will stop charging investors for external research that is used to make investment decisions, when sweeping reforms of the European financial industry come into force in 2018.According to an FTfm analysis, more than 70 per cent of asset managers that have decided how to pay for investment research, including analyst notes from investment banks, plan to cover it from their own profit and loss accounts, rather than pass the costs on to investors.This includes several of the world’s biggest investors, such as Northern Trust Asset Management, the US fund house that oversees $1tn in assets, and NN Investment Partners, the Dutch fund house. JPMorgan Asset Management, Pimco and T Rowe Price, as well as Vanguard, have also opted to pay for it themselves.The new rules, which fall under the second iteration of Europe’s Mifid directive, are expected to radically transform how investment banks, brokers and asset managers interact.The directive forces asset managers to present investors with clear budgets for research, ending the opaque system of fund managers receiving research for free in return for placing trades with investment banks.Rather than deal with the complex rules, a rising number of fund houses will pay for the research themselves. A total of 24 asset and wealth managers have either publicly or privately told FTfm they will cover the cost of research, compared with eight that plan to charge investors.Chris Turnbull, co-founder of Electronic Research Interchange, a research platform, said asset managers that are absorbing the cost are happy to announce their plans.“The ones that are not going to absorb the costs are less prepared to make an announcement and make it public. And there is a whole group of people that is still assessing the situation,” he said.But he warned that fund houses would find it is becoming harder to charge clients, because investors are increasingly expecting asset managers to foot the bill.Wayne Bowers, head of Northern Trust AM’s international business, said the company does not use client money to pay for research and this practice will continue after Mifid II comes into force. “Any research we have is paid for from our own pocket,” he said.A handful of asset managers, including Schroders, Amundi and Deka, have elected to pass the cost of research on to clients. Invesco, the $858bn fund house, said its preferred method is to pass the cost on to clients, but a final decision has yet to be made.BNP Paribas Investment Partners has previously said it will charge clients, but a spokesman now says the company has yet to make a final decision.Amundi

136;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Fund managers challenged to confront lack of ethnic diversity;Black and minority ethnic people who are young and ambitious often lack role models;"Baroness Ruby McGregor-Smith, former chief executive of Mitie, the British outsourcing company, was born in India and moved to the UK when she was two years old. She was the first Asian student at her primary school in north-west London and, until recently, believed she had a good understanding of the challenges facing young people from minority backgrounds in the UK.That changed when the government asked her to carry out an independent review of the issues affecting black and minority ethnic (BME) groups in the workplace, the results of which were published in February.During her research, she interviewed a young male apprentice who was the only black person working at his company. He told her: “You have no clue. How do you think I feel when I walk into the office every day? I relate to nobody, and they don’t relate to me.”“For young people, [ethnic diversity in the workforce] really matters,” she says. “People need role models. If you look nothing like them and don’t have the same background, you don’t believe you will ever [advance]. Every single organisation has to ask itself what it should do to ensure it is more equal and fair.”Baroness McGregor-Smith firmly believes there is a strong business incentive for improving ethnic diversity in the workplace, and has urged fund managers to push companies to do more to improve the balance.Her review found the UK economy would be roughly £24bn a year bigger if employees from BME backgrounds progressed at work at the same pace as their white colleagues.At the end of 2015, the employment rate for ethnic minorities was 63 per cent, compared with an employment rate of 76 per cent for white workers.“Fund managers need to look closely at the make-up of the companies they are invested in. The investor community needs to look at this,” she says.“Everyone knows the case on diversity. We don’t need more reports showing the boost this brings to the economy. We just need to get on and do it. You can’t expect every board will [improve matters]. They have to be told to do it.”1,087

Committee / EYHer findings echoed a study carried out by Sir John Parker, chairman of Anglo American, the mining company, last year, which found that ethnic minorities are severely under-represented on UK boards.UK-citizen directors of colour represent 1.5 per cent of the total director population, despite people of colour representing approximately 14 per cent of the UK population.More than half of Britain’s largest companies included in the FTSE 100 index have all-white boards.The Parker review similarly found there were “clear business reasons for increasing ethnic diversity on UK boards”, and recommended that the government set the business community an aspirational target of eliminating all-white boards in the FTSE 100 by the end of 2020.Aspirational targets have proved successful in the past. Six years ago, the UK government called on FTSE 100 companies to reach 25 per cent female board member representation by 2015. Britain’s largest companies surpassed that milestone in 2015, and have since been set a new target of 33 per cent female board representation by 2020.Investors were influential in encouraging companies to achieve this target. In 2014 several large fund houses, including Hermes Investment Management, Aviva Investors and Legal & General Investment Management, vowed to vote against resolutions at FTSE 100 companies lacking a female board member.There is no sign that investors intend to apply the same strict voting guidelines to companies lacking ethnic diversity on their boards.FTfm asked 10 large asset management groups in Europe and the US whether they would vote against director nominations at all-white boards. The resounding feedback was that they view ethnicity as one of several metrics when assessing whether a board is adequately diverse, and that it is too early to set hard targets on this issue.Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asset Management, the Scottish fund house, says: “It is very early days on this issue. Boards are only beginning to feel that they have the language to even talk about the issue.“[Ethnic diversity on boards] is something we look at, but do not at present segregate out from a more general discussion on diversity.”Rakhi Kumar, head of corporate governance at State Street Global Advisors, the third-largest fund company globally, adds it is “very difficult” to screen boards for racial diversity, whereas the gender split is clear. As such, State Street asks companies to explain their approach to diversity, but has not set hard voting guidelines on ethnic diversity in boardrooms.Hermes EOS, which advises investors with more than €300bn in total assets on corporate governance issues, plans to engage with boards to encourage them to improve ethnic diversity, and will only consider applying a hard voting policy if these attempts fail.There are widespread concerns that investors are not pushing hard enough on this issue, in part because the asset management industry is largely white and therefore removed from the problem.Research commissioned by the Knight Foundation, a non-profit organisation, and conducted by a Harvard Business School professor in May, found minority-owned fund companies account for less than 1 per cent of industry assets in the US.A senior executive at one of Europe’s largest asset managers, who requested anonymity, says: “I do not yet see or hear the kind of passion behind ethnic diversity on boards from investors as we do with women or diversity of any other dimension.“Quite rightly, there is a lot of emphasis on boards having more women on them. But that is the only dimension of diversity that is being looked at.”While data on diversity within asset management are lacking, he says his experience of working in the industry for more than 30 years demonstrates that certain groups — in particular the black population — are heavily under-represented.At one fund house, he says a senior executive routinely confuses two male employees, who are of completely different builds, because they are the only black staff there.Another investment executive frequently finds he is the only black attendee at the UK’s largest pension fund conferences, which are attended by hundreds of delegates.When I moved to England, I was startled — there are virtually no black people in the CityThe executive says: “When I moved to England, I was startled — there are virtually no black people in the City. I have heard from a young black man who came into [an asset management] organisation, looked up at it, and said: ‘Is there a future for me here? I don’t see anyone who looks like me in the senior ranks’.“If you are young, ambitious and black, who is your role model?”Baroness McGregor-Smith has asked the government to compel fund managers with holdings in FTSE 100 companies to write to them and ask for their policies on diversity, and how they ensure that the representation of BME individuals is examined across the employee base.She believes the investor community will only put their weight behind this issue when it becomes mandatory.“I’ve been staggered by how few [investors] want to talk about this,” she says.“If an asset management company has no one of BME origin in it, why on earth would it ask the companies it invests in to improve BME? They are very removed from it.“I just don’t see how this debate changes when you are talking about a sea of individuals with no understanding of different ethnic origins. That is why we need legislation.”"
137;STT;State Street Corp;2017-07-21T04:38:27Z;State Street: corporate governance has grown up;$2.6tn fund manager defends shareholder rights and demands more women on boards;"It is a grey and drizzly Monday morning, but Rakhi Kumar is impervious to the bad weather and her jet lag when she arrives at our meeting in State Street’s London headquarters, an imposing 14-floor building in the Canary Wharf financial district.The head of corporate governance at Boston-based State Street Global Advisors, the third-largest fund manager globally, with $2.6tn of assets, energetically covers many of the biggest issues facing the shareholder community while drinking tea during the hour-long interview.Top of the 43-year-old’s list of concerns is the move by many of the world’s biggest technology companies, including Snap, Facebook and Alphabet, to adopt controversial voting structures that limit the power of their shareholders. The issue came to the fore in February when Snap became the first US company to issue shares at its initial public offering that gave investors no voting powers.Ms Kumar has been more outspoken than many of her rivals in condemning this practice, and has taken the unusual step of calling on the US regulator to intervene. The former accountant sees regulatory action as a last resort, having lobbied companies unsuccessfully for years to stop adopting inequitable voting structures.With or without help from the regulator, the Mumbai-born executive plans to continue campaigning against the practice. “For us as shareholders, we appoint directors to oversee companies. If we don’t have the ability to appoint directors and the company is not going in the right direction, then we don’t have any rights,” she says. “We have to keep talking about this issue. We can’t [stop] pushing back against dual share-class structures as they are not in our best interests.”Ms Kumar, who is in London as part of a whistle-stop tour of Europe to meet clients in seven countries, is upfront about the limits of State Street’s ability to police corporate behaviour at all of the 10,000 companies it has exposure to through its large range of index-tracking funds.“We have to look at the worst offenders,” says Ms Kumar, readily admitting it is not possible to rigorously evaluate each of these companies’ approach to society, taxes, supply chains, labour practices, board diversity, executive pay and the many other areas that are crucial to good corporate governance.Last year, State Street had more than 4,000 pay proposals to review globally. The company used a filter to identify the 1,000 proposals that were the most controversial, and voted against 300 of them. State Street automatically approved the 3,000 it did not assess.Born

Not disclosedMs Kumar is aware of criticisms levelled at large passive fund houses such as State Street, Vanguard and BlackRock over their role as corporate stewards and the suggestion that they have been soft on executive pay.But she says State Street is applying more pressure to a wider pool of companies on such issues. This year, for the first time, State Street will include quantum — the amount of money paid to chief executives — when screening for companies with potentially problematic pay structures. As a result, more companies will be on State Street’s radar and could lose its support at their annual meetings.State Street has also taken a tougher approach to companies that have failed to appoint women to their boards, vowing earlier this year to vote against company directors that do not commit to improving the gender balance in their boardrooms. When announcing this, the asset manager unveiled its “Fearless Girl” statue, a bronze sculpture by artist Kristen Visbal that stares down the iconic Wall Street bull in New York.The fund house has so far written to 240 large companies globally that have no female directors, and although many have not yet responded, 24 have agreed to appoint a “more diverse candidate” by 2018, according to Ms Kumar.“[Our push against all-male boards] has been a great success,” she says. “Some companies have proactively called us and asked us not to take action against them. We will keep voting against those that don’t [improve], and we hope other investors will join us.”Ms Kumar first developed an interest in how companies are run during her childhood in Mumbai, where she was surrounded by successful entrepreneurs. One set of Bangalore-based grandparents had established cinemas across India in the 1930s; the other side of her family ran restaurants selling north Indian food and sweets in the south of the country.Unlike many young women in India in the 1980s, she says she was free to make her own decisions about her future. “Growing up in India I was very lucky, as my parents gave us all the best opportunities. I never had the expectation that I had to get married, which is almost unheard of in India. I really could do what I wanted to do,” she says.Her career has been varied. She studied economics in Mumbai before qualifying as a chartered accountant and auditing large multinationals in India during the 1990s. She later moved to the US to study at the Yale School of Management, and was taken on as a summer intern at Booz Allen, the management consultancy.The collapse of Enron and the IT bubble bursting at the start of the millennium dashed any hopes of being taken on full time at the consultancy. Instead, she took a job as a part-time research assistant for a Yale professor focused on corporate governance that paid $15 an hour.In a strange twist of fate, she was hired by Moody’s one year later precisely because the credit rating agency wanted to strengthen its corporate governance analysis in the wake of Enron’s collapse. “I was considered an expert with one year’s experience, so I got the job,” she says. She has not looked back.Founded

Wholly owned by State Street CorporationOver the past 15 years, corporate governance has evolved to become a critical part of asset managers’ businesses and the teams focused on this area increasingly influence fund managers’ investment decisions. State Street is one of many large fund houses that has bulked up its corporate governance department in recent years, growing from three employees in 2014 to 11 today. Companies are also better prepared to respond to difficult questions put forward by their shareholders’ governance teams.Ms Kumar says: “Ten years ago, companies were not in the mode of being told by investors what to do. They were more in the mode of doing it, and then telling you what they did. I felt that the risks in investments from [ethical, social and governance factors] were not really appreciated and understood, and thought every investor should understand these risks and that this area would grow.“Now I get yelled at less by directors than in the past [when we give] an alternative viewpoint. And companies realise index managers are taking a more active role [in monitoring governance standards]. Absolutely, corporate governance has grown up.”"

Critics counter the metric is too blunt and has perverse consequences. It treats risky assets, such as subprime car loans, the same as safe holdings, such as cash parked with the Fed.Ms Yellen, the Fed chair, was asked by senators during testimony on Capitol Hill about the measure, which they said was negatively affecting custody banks and could lead to higher costs for customers. Ms Yellen suggested the Fed was considering whether to lower these levels for the biggest banks.“Perhaps it is too high relative to risk based capital requirements,” she said. “It is something where perhaps our regulations had an unintended consequence and we are looking at that carefully . . . It should not be what drives decision making in firms.”The supplementary leverage ratio and its enhanced version are new “catch all” measures that require banks to have enough loss-absorbing capital to cover their total leverage exposure. That makes them tougher than other standards because they prevent banks from assigning less capital to activities deemed to be lower risk. They also include exposure to assets banks hold off balance sheet. Custody banks, which hold a high proportion of low risk assets, are seen as being particularly hard hit.Executives at some large American banks are particularly unhappy about the “enhanced” version that is being adopted by Washington. US regulators are requiring the eight US banks that are considered to be “systemically important” — including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as well as the big custodians — to have additional cushions under the standard. Their capital must be worth at least 6 per cent of their total leverage exposure, double that of smaller banking groups.While the eSLR does not formally take effect until next year, the Fed tested bank balance sheets under the SLR in its recent stress test*. All banks tested would continue to meet the required standard in a simulated market meltdown, but the margin of safety for some banks — Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and State Street — came within a couple of percentage points of breaching required levels.The Trump administration has already warned the ratio could undermine market stability. In a paper on financial deregulation last month, the Treasury said it was “important to address unfavourable impacts these requirements may have on market liquidity and low-risk assets”. Under the Treasury’s mooted liberalisation, safe assets including central bank deposits would be excluded from the calculation.Ms Yellen’s response suggested the Fed was minded to reduce the level of the requirement, instead of how it is calculated. Particular relief could be targeted at custodians, she indicated. “We are in touch and aware of issues faced by the custody banks,” she said. “It is one of the reasons we are looking at the issue of the appropriate calibration of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio for those banks.”Before he left the Fed in April, Daniel Tarullo, the central bank’s former regulation chief, suggested regulators could create a sliding scale for the eSLR to ease the burden on custody banks. He said he opposed going down an alternative route that would strip out riskless assets such as ultra-safe central bank reserves from requirement. The Fed is considering ways of easing the burden of financial regulations as both the Trump administration and Congress seek ways of dialling back crisis-era reforms. The Fed has opened the door to change to the central bank’s stress tests, and Ms Yellen has suggested there may be ways of simplifying the Volcker rule, which prevents banks from gambling with their own customers’ money. Ms Yellen said a lot of the suggestions in the Treasury’s report on regulation were similar to measures the Fed was pursuing to better target the central bank’s regulations. However asked by Democratic senator Sherrod Brown whether some of the suggestions could go too far and increase the danger of a new financial crisis, Ms Yellen said certain of them could.* An earlier version of this article said the banks were tested against the eSLR. It has been amended.

It is on course to beat its annual record of $97bn, also registered in 2016.State Street Global Advisors, the ETF industry’s third-largest provider, and Charles Schwab, the US asset manager, have also experienced a marked pick-up in new business this year.Discontent with the high fees and poor performance of many traditional investment managers that try to beat the market has fuelled a shift by investors out of active funds and into low-cost index-tracking ETFs.Global investor inflows into ETFs have reached around $335bn so far in 2017, comfortably on track to beat 2016’s record of $390bn. Figures from Australia, which reports ETF data later than other countries, have not yet been included in the global tally of flows in 2017.“ETF adoption is growing markedly in Europe and Asia as well as the US. Innovations such as robo-advisers that use ETFs as portfolio building blocks will help to drive growth further,” said Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI.However the fast growth of the ETF market — which has drawn $1.7tn in new cash in fewer than five years — has heightened concerns that the shift into these passive funds is fuelling a price bubble in the US stock market. The S&P 500 index hit an all-time high in mid-June.A BlackRock spokesperson said ETFs were not to blame for the rise in stock markets. “The increase in investor demand for global equities is the fuel for rising markets and this is occurring across a wide variety of investment vehicles, not just ETFs,” she said.The surge of money into ETFs could soon come to an end, in the event of a market downturn. Equity ETFs that offer exposure to stock markets account for 80 per cent of assets in these passive vehicles.A record number of fund managers believe equity markets are expensive, according to the latest monthly survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. More than four-fifths of the survey’s respondents said the US stock market, which has risen 13 per cent since President Donald Trump’s election victory in November, was the most overvalued equity market.Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch, said conditions for equity markets were likely to be much more challenging over the next six months as a result of rising interest rates and changes in central banks’ policies. He said a polic8y shift by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank has increased the risk of a “big fall” in developed stock markets this autumn.
140;STT;State Street Corp;2017-06-28T04:04:17Z;US bank stress tests: 4 things to watch;Vital moment for investors hoping for big capital returns;The amount of cash big US banks distribute to shareholders is no longer a matter only for their boards. Since the 2008 financial meltdown, regulators have had a veto under the stress test regime which is designed to prevent another crisis. On Wednesday the Federal Reserve reveals which banks have got the thumbs up for planned capital returns for the year ahead. Here are the big questions investors want answered.How much cash will shareholders get their hands on?The results of the stress tests’ first round, published last week, confirmed that all 34 banks examined would have enough capital to absorb losses during a time of extreme financial difficulties without burdening the taxpayer. Moreover, according to Evercore ISI, for all but six of them the margin of safety above required capital levels was higher than in the previous year.The findings bode well for the level of dividends and share buybacks, determined by the more consequential second round. Several analysts predict a capital bonanza. The big six — Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo — should be able to distribute a net $78.9bn in total, estimate KBW analysts, a rise of about a third from a year ago.Still, investors face an anxious wait on Wednesday. The results of the first round last week do not guarantee the outcome of the second, in part because they did not incorporate individual banks’ capital return plans.Will Wells Fargo fail?In keeping with its post-crisis image as one of the country’s best run banks, Wells Fargo breezed through previous stress tests. But its reputation nosedived last year when the bank became embroiled in a huge scandal. Employees fraudulently set up hundreds of thousands of fake accounts for unsuspecting customers.The fallout has already cost the bank its status as the world’s most valuable and now Wall Street is worried it could put the kibosh on planned shareholder payouts.Although Wells Fargo did well on the first, quantitative part of the stress tests this year, in the second round the Fed can block capital return plans for “qualitative” reasons — how well the bank is governed and manages risks.To pass, Wells will need to convince the Fed that the sales scandal has been contained and that the subsequent steps it has taken — shaking up senior management, strengthening whistleblower protections, and so on — are adequate.A survey by Goldman Sachs analysts published this month found that more than 50 per cent of investors believe the bank will fail. Such an outcome would be a big blow for recently appointed chief executive Tim Sloan and suggest the bank still has deep-rooted problems.Who else could be tripped up by the ‘qualitative’ test?In previous years, some banks have scored highly in the first round of the Fed’s exercise only to come unstuck by the second part’s “qualitative” test.Citigroup failed three years ago because the regulator was concerned about the “overall reliability” of its “capital planning process”, putting pressure on chief executive Michael Corbat. The bank subsequently made a big compliance push and got the regulatory thumbs up in the past two years.The biggest losers more recently have been American offshoots of foreign banks: Spain’s Banco Santander has flunked the test for three consecutive years and a US operation of Deutsche Bank for two. They will be spared such embarrassment this time, however. The Fed has dropped the “qualitative” part of the test for smaller US lenders and several foreign groups, totalling 21 of the 34 banks.How big a constraint is the new capital standard?For the first time this year, the Fed is testing the biggest banks on a new measure of financial strength — the so-called supplementary leverage ratio (SLR).The measure is a blunt, catch-all metric devised as part of the global Basel III reforms to pick up on threats to banks not covered by the other four capital measures used in the stress tests.The calculation is regarded as tough because it includes off balance-sheet exposures and also prevents banks from assigning less capital to activities deemed to be lower risk. It is seen as particularly tough for custodians and some investment banks.In the first round of the stress test last week Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and State Street came within a couple of percentage points of breaching required SLR levels. That could limit the amount of capital they are able to distribute.Analysts believe they might need to take what is known as the Mulligan, after the golfing term for taking another swing. Banks have already submitted capital return plans to the Fed, but they can make more conservative payout plans if, based on the first-round results, they think regulators will reject them.
141;STT;State Street Corp;2017-06-26T04:01:33Z;Fed’s stress tests raise concern over financial safety standard;Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and State Street score low on one controversial metric;The Federal Reserve’s bank stress tests have intensified concerns about the impact of a tough new financial safety standard that the industry is fighting and the Trump administration has warned could undermine market stability.Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and State Street came within a couple of percentage points of breaching required levels in the test, which probes how bank balance sheets would cope during a market meltdown.The buffer above the minimum level permitted under the contentious new standard, known as the “supplementary leverage ratio” (SLR), is narrow enough to raise questions about how much cash they will be allowed to return to shareholders.“What the stress test results reveal is just how much of a constraint the SLR is for certain banks,” said Luigi De Ghenghi, a partner at the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell.The metric is designed to pick up on dangers that could be lurking in the financial system but are not caught by traditional measures of banks’ financial strength.It forces banks to include exposures to assets they hold off balance-sheet — activities blamed for contributing to the last crisis — and also prevents them from “risk-weighting”, a technique that typically leads to less onerous capital requirements.Bankers are critical of the ratio, which is seen as especially punitive for some custodians and investment banks with chunky derivative books.Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in a letter to shareholders this year that the metric should “at a minimum, be significantly modified and balanced to promote lending and other policy goals”.Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary, this month recommended a shake-up as part of wide-ranging financial deregulation.Investors will this week be told the size of dividends and share buybacks they can expect from US banks as the Fed publishes the results of the stress tests’ second round, known as the CCAR.Banks have already submitted capital return plans to the Fed, but they can make more conservative payout plans if, based on the first-round results, they think regulators will reject them.“It’s possible the closeness of the result in the SLR will motivate a change of distribution for some firms,” said Michael Alix, a PwC partner and former senior supervisor at the New York Fed.[The SLR metric should] at a minimum be significantly modified and balanced to promote lending and other policy goalsThe bank that came closest to breaching the SLR requirement in the stress test was Morgan Stanley, whose ratio drops as low as 3.8 per cent under the Fed’s “severely adverse” scenario.That is above the 3 per cent threshold, although if the ratio were to drop below 5 per cent regulators would apply restrictions to capital distributions and bonus payments.Goldman Sachs’ drops as low as 4.1 per cent in the Fed’s hypothetical economic meltdown and State Street’s as low as 4.2 per cent.Brian Kleinhanzl, analyst at KBW, said Goldman’s relatively low SLR score meant the bank may get the green light from the Fed only for lower capital returns than he had expected.Meanwhile, analysts at Evercore ISI led by Glenn Schorr said State Street’s stress test performance under the SLR, as well as the related tier 1 leverage ratio, was “too close for comfort”.Goldman, Morgan Stanley, State Street and JPMorgan declined to comment.The Treasury paper on deregulation this month said it was “important to address unfavourable impacts these requirements may have on market liquidity and low-risk assets”. Cash on deposit with the Fed would be excluded from the SLR under the mooted liberalisation.And last week, Jerome Powell, the Fed governor in charge of financial regulation, appeared to suggest the new standard could cause “perverse incentives” and “distortions in money markets and other safe asset markets”. He said the regulator was taking a “fresh look” at part of the requirements.Analysts said the stress test results boded well for the sector overall and they expected most banks to increase capital returns. “Most of the CCAR banks have enough post-stress capital capacity to payout the dollar amounts that we’ve been expecting,” said Evercore.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson and Sam Fleming in WashingtonAn earlier version of this article referred to Goldman Sachs research on the supplementary leverage ratio at JPMorgan Chase. Goldman subsequently corrected its report. The reference has been removed.

143;STT;State Street Corp;2017-06-19T12:24:51Z;Index funds are unsure of taking on policeman role;A less interventionist approach has created a tricky relationship with activists;When it comes to providing advice to the companies in which they invest, the large US index fund managers say they deliberately take a different tack than activist hedge funds.“We are not going to focus on salt water in the pot or breadsticks,” says a representative of one such tracker fund, who declined to be named. The allusion is to activists Starboard Value, who made precise culinary recommendations to Darden Restaurants on best how to boil spaghetti as part of a larger campaign to revamp the company. Now these index funds, whose fortunes and size have rocketed as Americans have flocked to simple investing, are having to confront how much they want to be in the kitchen.There has been a seminal rotation of trillions of investment dollars in recent years towards passive funds run by Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. These three managers often own collectively 15 to 20 per cent of a large company, making them the fulcrum in decisions about corporate priorities and the board of directors. As they have slowly acknowledged their sway, their less interventionist approach has created a tricky relationship with activist investors who previously served as the policeman in the boardroom.Corporate America over decades has built its investor relations machinery around the belief that its key constituents were a diffuse group of active management funds that would trade in and out of their shares. Companies created elaborate slides to showcase at Wall Street conferences as a way to appeal to these shareholders. But the passive funds for years faced indifference, in part because they tended to vote mechanically, doing whatever proxy advisers such as ISS recommended.Things started to change after the 2001-2 scandals at Enron and WorldCom, when pension funds began asking why index managers were not using their muscle to hold companies to account. Now the big passive fund providers appear to have fully embraced their role.Larry Fink, BlackRock chief executive, publishes an annual letter to other chief executives where he opines on how companies should maximise long-term value. BlackRock and Vanguard have assembled “engagement” and “stewardship” arms. These groups, numbering 20 to 30 people at each company, have hundreds of meetings per year with management teams and boards to discuss corporate governance best practices.Since the funds have to own shares in the largest companies, they function as permanent capital — “forever owners”, as Vanguard has put it. As such, they believe that they are genuine advocates for long-term value creation.“We believe companies that are governed well perform better over the long term. Our interest is to advocate for governance behaviour that is oriented toward long-term performance,” says Glenn Booraem of Vanguard.Importantly, the index funds say they are less interested in short-term measures, such as share buybacks. What concerns them are loftier matters such as the skills of board members, executive pay, and whether the company structure is friendly to shareholders: staggered boards and poison pills are anathema.“We are in new era of assertiveness,” says Jim Rossman, head of shareholder advisory at Lazard. “Index funds are less afraid to express a point of view in the areas they care about.” Last week, for example, BlackRock challenged ExxonMobil to improve its disclosures on climate change.For activists, the passive ascendancy is a mixed bag. Some complain that index funds are ill-equipped to be informed on the thousands of companies they own. Yet data shows that BlackRock has voted with activists a third of the time in recent years. In recent high-profile proxy fights at DuPont and Arconic, the votes of the big three index funds proved decisive.Similarly, a fight at mall operator Taubman Centers highlighted the index funds’ focus on governance. An agitating fund was favoured to upend the board, until Taubman, at the last minute, pledged to “refresh” its directors along with other governance changes. The voting detail has yet to be released but Taubman’s surprise win has been attributed to Vanguard and BlackRock support.“Hedge fund activists cannot succeed without the support of the passive funds,” says Peter Michelsen of CamberView, a governance consulting firm that works with companies.sujeet.indap@ft.com
144;STT;State Street Corp;2017-06-18T04:03:52Z;State Street asks SEC to block non-voting shares;Asset manager wants regulator to strengthen shareholder rights by changing IPO rules;State Street has urged the US financial regulator to block companies from adopting controversial voting structures used by Facebook, Alphabet and Snap over concerns that they concentrate power in the hands of founders and weaken shareholder rights.The world’s third-largest asset manager, which oversees $2.5tn of assets, attended an investor advisory committee meeting at the Securities and Exchange Commission in March, where it called on the watchdog to stop companies limiting the voting rights of shareholders.Rakhi Kumar, head of corporate governance at State Street Global Advisors, who attended the meeting, said the regulator needed to intervene as investor efforts to persuade companies to stop using inequitable voting structures have not been effective.“We have engaged on this for years. Our ability to have an impact is limited. We think it has to come from the regulator to stop the dual share-class issue,” she told FTfm.“When we don’t have the mechanism to elect or vote for directors, we don’t have a voice or the ability to influence.Companies may talk to us, but they may not listen to us“Companies may talk to us, [but they may] not listen to us.”Controversy over voting structures erupted in February when Snap, the technology group, angered investors by becoming the first US company to issue shares at its initial public offering that had no voting powers.More than a tenth of large US companies in the S&P 500 index offer shares with limited voting power, a practice condemned by investors who prefer a one share, one vote policy.Facebook has three types of shares. Class A carries one vote per share for external shareholders, Class B carries 10 votes per share for company insiders, and Class C, which was introduced last year, gives shareholders no say on how the company is run.60%Voting rights that Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, controlsMark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, controls 60 per cent of the voting rights.Alphabet similarly issued a new class of shares in 2015 with no voting rights, enabling Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, to control nearly 51 per cent of the company’s voting power between them.Ms Kumar wants the regulator to change the listing rules in the US to ensure IPOs do not hinder shareholder power. State Street has also encouraged the SEC to consider forcing companies to respond to decisions on important issues made by a majority of their external shareholders.“We have to keep talking about this issue. We can’t [stop] pushing back against dual share-class structures, as they are not in our best interests,” she said.Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, a non-profit organisation whose members oversee a combined $23bn of assets, has also urged the SEC to take action.He recommended that the regulator should encourage exchange providers to ban companies from issuing shares without voting rights, and to introduce “sunset provisions” that would force companies with these structures to phase them out.State Street goes further than many of its competitors, who are largely pessimistic that the SEC will be willing or able to enact change.Ricardo Duran, a spokesman for Calstrs, one of the largest US public pension funds, which is fiercely opposed to dual share-class voting structures, said: “Regulatory intervention is unlikely.”He added that although exchange listing rules could be changed, this “may be an uphill fight, since the exchanges are driven by attracting new listings, rather than screening them”.There should be a sunsetting provision that would move the company to a one share, one vote structure once it has been public for a period of timeBut he said any move by exchanges to pressure companies to phase out these voting arrangements would be welcomed. “These companies are usually founder led and give the excuse that they need the stability this voting structure affords them as they get on their feet. We argue that, where this structure exists, there should be a sunsetting provision that would move the company to a one share, one vote structure once the company has been public for a period of time,” he said.Dual-class voting structures are particularly problematic for asset managers with large passive investments, as they are forced to hold the shares of companies included in major indices run by S&P or FTSE Russell, regardless of their governance structures.A dozen of the largest US pension funds, which tend to have big passive holdings, sent a letter to Snap ahead of its IPO urging the company not to deny them a say in how it is run. Snap ignored these calls, and raised $3.4bn from new shareholders ahead of its market debut. Snap’s shares nearly doubled days after its market launch but on Friday traded at $17, the same as the IPO offer price.Calstrs, State Street and a number of large investors are simultaneously in talks with many of the world’s largest index providers about creating indices that would exclude companies offering limited voting rights to shareholders, potentially diverting money away from companies such as Snap.State Street has also asked its clients whether they would want to invest in a passive fund that excluded companies with dual share-class structures, and has so far received “mixed feedback”, according to Ms Kumar.“Snap might be the turning point as the first company to issue non-voting shares. I am hopeful [that these structures will be stamped out] because shareholders have stood up,” she said.

146;STT;State Street Corp;2017-05-24T16:08:05Z;ETF providers float idea of setting up their own market indices;Discussions remain internal but reflect frustration about fees paid to S&P and MSCI;Executives at some of the big providers of exchange traded funds have floated the idea of forming an industry “co-operative” to create stock market indices rivalling those from S&P, FTSE and MSCI as pressure to cut costs in the passive asset management industry intensifies.The concept has been mooted privately inside some large asset managers, which are increasingly frustrated at the costs of licensing indices such as the S&P 500 that ETFs track, say people with knowledge of the matter.A ferocious price war has driven down the fees that asset managers can charge for ETFs, meaning index licensing costs eat up more of their profit margin. The historic leaders in the industry, State Street’s SPDR range of ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares and Invesco’s PowerShares, face competition that includes Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Vanguard, among others.The fees index companies charge can vary significantly, but for the biggest asset managers it can add up to tens of millions of dollars a year. In 2016, S&P Dow Jones Indices’ revenues rose 7 per cent to $639m, MSCI’s index revenues climbed 9.8 per cent to $613.6m and FTSE Russell’s revenues increased 17 per cent to £409m.“If it’s a better outcome for investors, then everything is on the table,” said Lynn Blake, chief investment officer of State Street Global Advisors’ passive equities business. “There’s more pressure now than ever to consider something like self-indexing or other alternatives to keep costs lower while providing the same services to our clients . . . I do feel we are at a crossroads. The [investment management] business is not what it will look like in five years’ time. It’s all in flux.”State Street declined to say whether it was considering setting up an index provider, either by itself or with other players in the ETF industry.GSAM uses its own bespoke indices for its more complicated “smart beta” ETFs, a practice known as self-indexing. Steve Sachs, head of ETF capital markets at GSAM, says an independent, jointly-owned index provider “makes sense”.“The more competition there is in that area the better,” said Mr Sachs. “There’s always been grumbling in the asset management world about fees you have to pay. But the drumbeat has become a little louder.”BlackRock declined to comment on the idea. It said: “Index providers are important partners for us, and we look forward to continuing to innovate and grow with them.” Vanguard said that index costs “generally have increased” and that it “continually looks for ways to reduce costs for shareholders”, but added: “At the current time, we are satisfied with the construction methodologies, objectivity and credibility offered by independent index providers.”A co-operative, perhaps modelled on CDSIndexCo, which was set up by the big banks to create indices of credit default swaps and is now part of Markit, would be costly and face considerable obstacles, not least questions about whether asset managers acting in concert were breaching antitrust rules. Discussions have remained in-house.However, it would bring new competition to an industry where a bout of consolidation has resulted in just a handful of influential index providers controlling benchmarks tracked by trillions of dollars.

149;STT;State Street Corp;2017-05-04T03:00:07Z;Asset manager Ron O’Hanley warns of sector’s ‘easy growth’;SSgA chief predicts more mergers and welcomes back-office automation to help trim costs;For the investment industry, the post-crisis era has been both the best of times and the worst of times.Aggressive monetary policy easing by central banks has helped lift markets to new highs, buoying assets under management in the investment industry. Just in the US, the industry’s heft swelled to a new peak of $16.3tn in 2016.At the same time, the post-crisis era has been marked by a tectonic shift in favour of cheaper, passive products such as index-tracking mutual funds and exchange traded funds, as investors have increasingly eschewed more expensive active managers that on average have a shoddy record of beating their benchmarks.The result has been the toughest environment for the global asset management industry in memory, according to Ron O’Hanley, the chief executive of State Street Global Advisors.“There’s a lot of change under way, and more to come,” he tells the FT. “We now live permanently in an environment where clients are far more attuned to fees than before. And rightly so . . . We get paid by assets under management, so the tripling of the S&P 500 has done wonders for fee revenue. But at some point that goes away.”Mr O’Hanley has a good vantage point to comment on the industry’s trends. State Street’s asset management arm controls $2.4tn, including the world’s biggest ETF, the $229bn SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Before heading SSgA, he oversaw Fidelity’s $2.1tn asset management business, and before that he headed BNY Mellon Asset Management. He started his career at McKinsey, where he founded the consultancy’s investment management practice.The asset management industry has evolved radically over that period, and has suffered periodic scrapes and bruises from market calamities such as the 1987 Black Monday crash, the Russian default and the blow-up of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, the dotcom bubble bursting, and more recently the global financial crisis.A lot of the growth has been easy growth. The challenge is that clients weren’t being well-servedBut some things have largely remained constant. Rising economic growth, globalisation and a savings glut have buoyed an asset management industry that has enjoyed an unusual combination of high profit margins, low barriers to entry and consistent over-capacity.“The industry has had an extraordinary rise,” Mr O’Hanley says. But he admits: “A lot of the growth has been easy growth. The challenge is that clients weren’t being well-served.”The latest scorecard from Spiva, a semi-annual review of the industry’s performance by S&P, shows just how poorly investors have fared over time. About 92 per cent of US large-cap mutual funds have failed to match their benchmark over 15 years. While bond funds have not been eviscerated by the passive shift to the same degree, fixed-income fund managers also mostly fail to beat the market, the report noted.Many investment groups hope a brighter future is dawning, with rising interest rates and falling stock market correlations making it easier for active managers to beat their benchmarks.But many analysts say that even a performance improvement will only slow the passive investment trend, and predict that the inevitable result will be more mergers and acquisitions in the splintered asset management world.Industry insiders have long been sceptical that widespread consolidation can happen. The industry is infamous for the cultural clashes that can result from investment groups merging, margins are on average enviable compared with many other sectors, and there are fewer back-office costs that can be stripped out in a merger. But in the new investment reality not consolidating is a “luxury” a lot of companies cannot afford, SSgA’s head notes.Getting rid of humans is not the objective, but if that’s the result then so be itThere has already been a batch of big deals, most notably Janus Capital merging with Henderson, and Standard Life swooping for Aberdeen Asset Management. But there is probably more to come. “It has historically been hard to take two active shops and merge them together. But in this stage of decline that won’t hold. I suspect we’ll start to see more M&A,” Mr O’Hanley says.One potential glimmer of hope lies in the impact of technology, with many industry insiders predicting that advances in artificial intelligence, coupled with the rise of “big data”, can help trim costs by automating a lot of back-office functions and even enhance investing prowess. While Mr O’Hanley predicts humans will remain the bedrock of the investment industry, he says SSgA is “looking at it across the board”.“I don’t think I’ll be addressing a bunch of servers in our town halls. But there’s more and more ability to apply technology and areas like big data and machine learning,” he says. “Getting rid of humans is not the objective, but if that’s the result then so be it.”
150;STT;State Street Corp;2017-04-30T04:10:43Z;A surprising definition of board independence;BlackRock’s new lead independent director is a 17-year veteran, says Stephen Foley;BlackRock’s decision to appoint a 17-year board veteran as its new lead independent director has raised questions among some of its investors.The world’s largest asset manager, which has used its clout to push for corporate governance improvements at many of the companies in its portfolio, has tapped Murry Gerber for the important role, at a time when several large pension funds have started to worry about the effectiveness of such longstanding directors.To those of us steeped in British corporate governance norms, the idea of someone who has been on a board since 2000 qualifying to be lead independent director is surprising. The UK Corporate Governance Code assumes that directors lose their independence after nine years of service, on the theory that they become too defensive of the status quo or too close to management to effectively fulfil their oversight role after that. Most stand down before that point.That is not the presumption in the US, where BlackRock is listed. There is no equivalent US governance code, and the New York Stock Exchange’s rules on independence require only that a director has not recently worked for the company. It is not remotely surprising, then, that the average US board director has been in post for more than two years longer than a UK director and is five years older.The prevailing view in the US has been that independence is a state of mind. Which of course it is. Mr Gerber is a former chief executive of EQT Corporation, the natural-gas explorer, and has been reelected to BlackRock’s board in recent years with over 98 per cent shareholder support. He was chosen by the rest of the company’s independent directors for his judgment, leadership skills and knowledge of the company, according to its proxy statement.Since BlackRock is still run by its powerful founder, Larry Fink, who combines the chief executive and chairman roles, Mr Gerber’s ability to act as a counterweight to Mr Fink is a critical qualification for the role. Some investors will worry about his independence, given that the two men have worked side by side in the boardroom for so long. Others will fear that a director less well versed in the company’s history and business would not have the gravitas to challenge Mr Fink.This is the debate BlackRock must now have with its shareholders. Calpers, the Californian pension fund, sets a cut-off of 12 years, after which it deems directors to lose their independence, while another fund, Calstrs, has also started focusing on board longevity.“Choosing a lead director is more art than science,” says Anne Sheehan, head of corporate governance at Calstrs. “With such a long-term director, we need to know why they feel that would be the best person. We would want a little bit more information.”Rakhi Kumar, head of asset stewardship at State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), one of BlackRock’s top 10 shareholders, also said such an appointment would trigger questions, such as, “Does that person have integrity? Why was that individual chosen?” She declined to comment on Mr Gerber or BlackRock.SSgA has been particularly muscular among large institutional investors when it comes to making boards fresher and more diverse. In fact, it singles BlackRock out as a case study of how its engagement programme can bring about change.“We called on the company to enhance its public disclosure on the role of its lead independent director,” SSgA says in its newly released annual stewardship report. “In September 2016, the company published its ‘Lead Independent Director Guidelines’, which provide a more robust description of the role and responsibilities than previously disclosed.”If that sounds incredibly polite, there is steel behind SSgA’s engagement with BlackRock and hundreds of other portfolio companies. It has been screening corporate boards for those where the average tenure of directors is well above their national average, and threatening to vote against directors at those companies. In all, SSgA voted against 731 directors globally last year because of poor board refreshment practices.The average tenure of BlackRock’s directors is not above the norm, for the record, since it has brought on six new directors in five years to serve alongside long-timers such as Mr Gerber. There is also no particular reason to think that shareholders will object to his appointment.But the argument for standardising the rules on independence remains a powerful one, since it removes the need to have sensitive and subjective conversations, in which asking for a fresher board can be misconstrued as an attack on individuals and put companies on the defensive. Not all ultra-long tenured directors lose their independence, but US corporate governance would be better served if there were fewer.Stephen Foley is the FT’s US investment correspondent

154;STT;State Street Corp;2017-03-08T14:34:38Z;Goldman Sachs’ lessons from the ‘quant quake’;Nearly 10 years after its nadir, quantitative investing is again the hot trend in finance;It was a typical New York summer day, the kind where arriving at Goldman Sachs’ perfectly air-conditioned offices in downtown Manhattan was a blissful release from the humid weather outside. But for Gary Chropuvka it proved to be one of the worst days of his life.Mr Chropuvka worked at Goldman’s money management arm, specifically at Quantitative Investment Strategies, a division staffed by mathematicians, computer scientists and physicists. Even at Goldman, the QIS employees were considered intellectual superstars. Their prowess at decoding the signals of financial markets meant the unit managed $165bn at its peak — more than any hedge fund group.But on August 6 2007, everything unravelled. As soon as US markets started trading, the previously wildly successful automated investment algorithms coded by the QIS brainiacs went horribly awry, and losses mounted at a frightening pace.What became known as the “quant quake” subsided in a week and was largely contained within the computer-powered investment industry. It was soon overshadowed by the global financial crisis. But it scarred a generation of financial scientists on Wall Street. Even Renaissance Technologies, the legendary hedge fund co-founded by cold war codebreaker James Simons, suffered painful losses, and it nearly obliterated Goldman’s QIS.“All this worked academically, and for a long time it worked in practice, and then all of a sudden you have this horrible event,” Mr Chropuvka says. “It was the most humbling experience of our lives.”Nearly a decade later, quantitative investing is once again the hottest trend in finance. Computer-driven hedge funds have just notched up their eighth straight year of client inflows, doubling their assets from 2009 to $918bn, according to Hedge Fund Research. Even this understates the interest, as many traditional hedge funds and big mutual fund managers are all trying to blend more quantitative techniques with their traditional approaches.QIS is emblematic of the quant renaissance. In 2011 Goldman Sachs put its top computer wizard, Armen Avanessians, in charge of the division. He has helped turn round its fortunes. The arm’s assets under management reached a nadir of $38bn in 2012, but it now manages $91.8bn — still below the unit’s pre-crisis peak.“The first thing I did was to fly to our biggest clients and apologise,” he says. “All bad things involve crowding and leverage, and the quant crisis was no different. But the core idea that computers can do a lot of this better than humans was right . . . I feel that we’re just at the early stages of this quant revolution, and that gets me excited.”The explosive growth of algorithmic investing — whether high-frequency traders, next-generation exchange traded funds or artificial intelligence-powered hedge funds — has transformed the markets. Some analysts fear that another 2007-style meltdown would be more severe due to the proliferation of quant strategies.“It’s the biggest worry I have,” says Richard Bookstaber, a former risk manager at Morgan Stanley and Moore Capital, now an advisor to the University of California’s $100bn investment office. “What is going on now is not just the growth of quant hedge funds, like before the crisis. Now it’s system-wide across the investment world. In 2007 it was localised because no one else was pursuing these strategies. Now everyone is.”Roughly a dozen analysts and fund managers shuffle into an airy corner office at Goldman’s New York headquarters to hear the co-heads of research at QIS’s Equity Alpha Strategies team, Dennis Walsh and Takashi Suwabe, present some of their data crunching.Mr Walsh outlines how they can profit from even the most common of corporate events: quarterly earnings calls. Using an AI technique called “natural language processing”, Goldman’s algorithms can systematically look for verbal cues from analysts on the call that might indicate whether they were pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised at the results — and therefore upgrade their outlook in response.“There’s a tendency towards praise to keep in management’s good books, but only marginally. If 20 out of 30 analysts say ‘great quarter’ then it probably was,” Mr Walsh says. It may seem sketchy, but success for quants depends on detecting small but persistent signals that they can feed into trading algorithms.QIS has been radically restructured since its near-death experience in 2007, and focuses on three main areas. Its biggest part is the $35bn “tax-efficient strategies” unit which structures investment products for wealthy Goldman clients. But QIS executives say the main priorities are its $31bn “smart beta” business, which invests in specific market factors or characteristics, the $16bn Equity Alpha arm and a small but promising $3.2bn “alternative risk premia” business, where financial engineers try to deconstruct and cheaply replicate hedge fund returns.The future of the business will be powered by data. “The amount of data out there is awesome,” says Mr Chropuvka, one of two Goldman partners at QIS. “Figuring out the linkages between companies has become more complicated, and quants like using computers to help figure these things out. We have for decades played the breadth game, but with big data we can play the depth game. We can do it more comprehensively, and in real time.”Another signal explored by Goldman’s quantitative analysts is something they term “geographic momentum”, based on how companies in one corner of the planet can often offer clues to how others in the same region are performing.QIS has crunched the data of its 14,800 stocks across 1m locations, using “machine learning” to find and quantify hidden relationships and linkages that might often cross state, regional or even country borders, and sliced the world into 200 distinct “economic clusters” where companies tend to move in tandem. A French bank with a big loan book in eastern Europe might offer clues to how Polish contractors are doing, or Texan developers might indicate the health of Mexican cement sales.The investment industry’s enthusiasm for the potential of big data, superfast computers and AI is palpable — and not just among quant hedge funds. State Street, a $2.4tn asset manager, believes this is the “next evolutionary step” for the sector. BlackRock, the world’s biggest fund manager, has said it “represents a watershed moment in the history of investment management”.The enthusiasm mostly reflects a view of where markets and investing are heading. Aside from a few elite firms, even the industry’s more sophisticated players can struggle for consistent returns. HFR’s quant hedge fund index has been far less volatile than the broader industry universe, but gained only 1.7 per cent last year.Yin Luo, head of quantitative research at Wolfe Research, says the pre-crisis era was the “golden age” for the industry, when “almost everything worked, even if it wasn’t fancy”. Now, it is much harder, with many common signals and strategies copied into oblivion.Nor is hiring a lot of smart data scientists a silver bullet. BlackRock has poured money into its Scientific Active Equity division, but almost two-thirds of its quant funds underperformed their benchmarks last year, according to a presentation acquired by Bloomberg. Jeff Shen, the unit’s co-head, attributes the poor performance to the turbulent start to 2016. But it still highlights that quantitative investing can be tricky.The head of one big quant hedge fund compares the phenomenon to Kodak, the camera company that saw the rise of digital photography coming but was still unable to refocus the business, and eventually went bankrupt. “Even if you recognise something is changing, it’s not easy to revamp the business,” he says.Nonetheless, the quant revolution is transforming investment. The convoluted but broadly explicable financial markets of previous generations have evolved into an electronic jungle of unfathomable complexity.Understanding how markets function increasingly requires knowledge of a Greek-based alphabet soup of concepts and phenomena — such as alpha generation, smart beta, gamma scalping, delta hedging and option theta. Their speed has accelerated markedly, and the number of market anomalies, odd trading patterns and mysterious “flash crashes” have increased in tandem with the ascent of algorithms.Yet one of the biggest fears is that the money pouring into quantitative investing could be laying the seeds of a bigger re-run of the 2007 quant quake.The precise trigger for that quake might never be known, but analysts generally agree the pot was brought to a boil by too many big investors unknowingly making the same trades while juicing up their returns with leverage.When the early stages of the financial crisis began, one of the bigger players was likely to have been hit by subprime mortgage losses, forcing it to sell its more liquid but highly leveraged equity portfolio to satisfy investor withdrawals. Losses hammered participants with similar trades and triggered fresh rounds of liquidation.Goldman’s QIS division is sometimes fingered as one of the potential culprits in triggering the quant quake — specifically its once-imperious Global Alpha fund that was closed in 2011 — something its executives vehemently deny. QIS was simply one of the biggest victims because several of its funds had used “an unbelievable amount of leverage”, Mr Chropuvka says.The kind of leverage used in 2007 has largely been banished from the financial system. President Donald Trump’s planned regulatory rollback might shake things up, but much of the reduction is attributed to heightened caution after the crisis. Moreover, while billions of dollars have been poured into quantitative strategies in recent years, their variety has increased significantly.Indeed, the rise of big data could lead to a new golden era for the industry, Mr Shen says. “The world is more complex and diverse now. That makes it harder [to perform], but it makes crowding less of a risk.”QIS is a case in point. While its quants might have tapped into only a dozen or so signals in 2007, they now use more than 250 with much less leverage. That means the dangers of crowded strategies that proved so toxic nearly a decade ago should be reduced.While Mr Avanessians is “always paranoid that I’m missing something”, he says Goldman’s quants have learnt the lessons of 2007. “We now have a maniacal focus on what can go wrong, rather than what can go right.”Not everyone is convinced. Mr Bookstaber points out that while leverage is more limited, the swelling “smart beta” ETF industry is a way that another quant quake could hit the masses. With quants becoming more dominant, fears of another electronically generated market meltdown will persist.“We’re caught in a tug of war between Moore’s Law and Murphy’s Law,” says Andrew Lo, finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referring to Gordon Moore’s prediction that computing power would double nearly every year, and the adage that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. “Our technology has outgrown our ability to manage it, and the financial world is increasing in complexity and fragility.”This article has been amended to correct Mr Bookstaber’s affiliation. He still writes for the Treasury’s Office of Financial Research, but left his research principal position in 2015.One of the smallest but potentially most intriguing units at Goldman Sachs‘ Quantitative Investment Strategies is arguably its so-called “alternative risk premia” unit, where financial scientists attempt to reverse-engineer and then replicate the secret sauce of hedge funds.Over the years, quantitative analysts have discovered that quite a lot of the market-beating “alpha” returns produced by supposedly skilled fund managers can often be attributed to specific factors and market characteristics, such as momentum or cheap valuations. These factors are now often packaged into exchange traded funds as “smart beta”.But recently, quants say they have even been able to deconstruct and rebuild many of the “risk premia” components of sophisticated hedge fund strategies — such as arbitraging mergers and acquisitions, or placing bets on global bond and currency movements — and sell them at a fraction of the cost.In April 2012 Goldman Sachs transferred about 20 of its financial engineers from the investment bank’s securities side to QIS, where they set up an alternative risk premia division to decipher and duplicate an array of hedge fund products for institutional clients.So far it has been only a modest success — at the end of last year, the unit’s assets under management were $3.2bn. But Goldman executives have pinpointed it as one of its three main priorities, convinced that it can become a money-spinning factory for mass production of cheap hedge fund returns for its clients.Nonetheless, some quants — let alone many hedge fund managers — are sceptical, arguing that a lot of the supposed success of hedge fund replication is based mostly on “backtests”, running the models against historical data. And a lot of strategies that work when tested on backward-looking data can fizzle out when confronted with moving markets.
155;STT;State Street Corp;2017-02-05T05:00:23Z;The battle of the US corporate governance codes;Getting companies to accept higher standards is proving tricky, finds Stephen Foley;"US corporate governance codes are like London buses. You wait ages for one, and then two come along at once.It is barely six months since a coalition of asset managers and blue-chip companies including BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors, T Rowe Price, ValueAct and Vanguard launched Commonsense Principles of Corporate Governance. Yet, last week, along comes Corporate Governance Principles for US Listed Companies, signed by a coalition of asset managers and asset owners including BlackRock, SSgA, T Rowe Price, ValueAct and Vanguard.What is going on? There is broad consensus among investors that US boards are more entrenched and less attuned to shareholders than those in Europe, where countries such as the UK have had powerful codes of conduct since the 1990s. But getting companies to accept higher standards is proving tricky.The trouble is, investors disagree among themselves on many of the finer points of governance that have become settled best practice elsewhere. Given a large and heterogeneous shareholder base with diverse investment objectives and time horizons, directors feel free to ignore many of the entreaties they receive.This annoys the hell out of shareholders but, frankly, boards are pretty grumpy too about being confronted with so many competing governance demands.The near-simultaneous arrival of different codes is therefore unhelpful, and it shows how getting investors on the same page is difficult. Capital Group signed up to Commonsense but not Corporate Governance Principles; for Wellington Management, it was the other way round.The common denominator is low. “It is a fundamental right of shareholders to elect directors whom they believe are best suited to represent their interests and the long-term interests of the company,” begins Corporate Governance Principles. That is how Commonsense starts, too: “All directors must have high integrity and the appropriate competence to represent the interests of all shareholders in achieving the long-term success of their company.”Both codes demand a diverse mix of skills from directors, delegation of work to specifically qualified board committees, and processes to evaluate and refresh boards. The codes also agree that companies can choose to combine the roles of chairman and chief executive, but both explicitly say some members of their investor coalitions disagree.From there, things diverge. Signatories to Commonsense agreed a range of rules on non-executive and executive pay, including a demand for tough clawback provisions, which are barely touched on in Corporate Governance Principles. The latter comes out in favour of proxy access and demands time limits on dual-class share structures, where the previous coalition had fudged those issues.Missing in all this exhortation is any external enforcement mechanism. The 1992 Cadbury code in the UK, while ostensibly voluntary, had the backing of the London Stock Exchange, which insisted every company “comply or explain” why it would not.In the US, influence is much more diffuse. Stock exchanges compete for listings and have no interest in imposing burdens that might lose them business. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator, is happy with a variety of governance arrangements as long as there is transparency. And the laws of Delaware, where most US companies choose to incorporate, bless a whole range of practices that can be viewed as anti-shareholder.ISS and Glass Lewis, the proxy advisory services, are rare examples of bodies with teeth. They have ratcheted up pressure on poor governance practices, reflecting the impatience of the investors they survey each year before formulating their voting policies. They now advise against the re-election of directors at companies that defy shareholders’ wishes. But while proxy adviser recommendations influence many midsize investors, the largest institutions do not necessarily follow their lead. And companies are pushing back heavily against their influence, even to the extent of trying to get legislation passed to curb them.There is another aspect Commonsense and Corporate Governance Principles have in common: they both demand things of shareholders, too. Investors should be engaged and put real resources into deciding how to approach governance questions at individual companies, they say, rather than simply box-checking or outsourcing unthinkingly to the likes of ISS.While that may sound benign, the consequence is to undermine collective action and weaken proxy advisers instead of harnessing them as potent tools for improving governance.It may seem nice to have a choice of buses. It is just not clear that either will take anyone where they want to go.Stephen Foley is the FT’s US investment correspondent"
156;STT;State Street Corp;2017-01-29T17:26:19Z;State Street/JPMorgan: custodians of their own happiness;Business of keeping records and settling deals will thrive with tech innovation;"Hurricane Sandy flooded a securities vault of the New York-based Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation and ruined paper certificates representing trillions of dollars worth of securities in 2012.It did not matter. Custodian banks, such as State Street, have long embraced digitisation. Their boring business of keeping records and settling transactions will continue to thrive with technological innovation.In its earnings report on Wednesday, State Street announced that BlackRock would move $1tn of its custody assets to JPMorgan in 2018; a fifth of Blackrock’s assets under management and 3.5 per cent of the assets that State Street services. This could amount to lost revenue of about $180m, based on the average fee.Asset managers are key clients. But they are cutting fees and — consequently — costs to grow, which has put pressure on custodians’ margins. BlackRock cited a need to diversify its service providers to alleviate potential business risks.The secular outlook for the custodians is not bleak. JPMorgan research estimates that the custody revenue pool will grow 40 per cent to $54bn in the six years to 2020.State Street is the custodian for 60 per cent of all exchange traded fund assets, which have grown by 20 per cent annually in the past five years, according to ETFGI, the consultancy. State Street will continue to service Blackrock’s ETFs.Banks covet stable businesses that do not require much capital. Indeed, KBW estimates that State Street generated a return on tangible common equity of 18 per last year, compared with 13 per cent at JPMorgan.Fee pressures will not subside for now. Expect big banks to compete for these boring revenues as long as their returns stay disappointingly low.But State Street is a bet on the continued growth of ETFs and the ingenuity of financial technology to cheapen operating costs. These trends are unlikely to turn soggy.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
157;STT;State Street Corp;2017-01-28T16:16:45Z;BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street bulk up governance staff;BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street expand policing of companies they invest in;"BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have expanded their corporate governance teams significantly in response to growing pressure from policymakers and clients to demonstrate they are policing the companies they invest in.The move by the world’s three largest asset managers, which together control nearly $11tn of assets, will help address fears that investors are not doing enough to monitor controversial issues around executive pay and board diversity at the companies they invest in.New York-based BlackRock now has the largest corporate governance team of any global asset manager, after hiring 11 analysts for its stewardship division over the past three years, bringing total headcount to 31.Vanguard, the Pennsylvania-based fund company that has grown quickly on the back of its low-cost mantra, has nearly doubled the size of its corporate governance team over the same period to 20 employees.State Street, the US bank, has almost tripled the size of the governance team in its asset management division to 11. Both Vanguard and State Street said their governance teams will continue to grow this year.The focus on corporate governance comes as regulators and politicians around the world increasingly scrutinise the relationship between companies and their shareholders. Asset managers have previously been accused of routinely supporting company proposals in order to avoid damaging their relationships with senior executives.Theresa May, the British prime minister, launched a far-reaching consultation on reforming corporate governance in the UK last November in a bid to improve business behaviour. The government wants to strengthen shareholders’ power, but is also considering whether to force large investors to disclose their voting records at companies’ annual general meetings.The EU’s shareholder rights directive — a vast set of rules that is expected to come into force across Europe in 2019 — is similarly expected to strengthen shareholders’ rights, as well as to force large investors to reveal more information about how they engage with companies.Glenn Booraem, Vanguard’s head of corporate governance, said: “Vanguard continues to invest in the research and infrastructure that enable advocacy and voting across a global portfolio, and we expect to continue our focus on this important capability over the coming years.”Other large asset managers that have expanded their stewardship teams over the past three years include Fidelity International, which now has 12 governance analysts; Legal & General Investment Management, which has 10; Aberdeen Asset Management, which has 20; and US public pension funds Calpers and Calstrs, which have 29 and 12 respectively.Large pension funds and other institutional investors are simultaneously demanding more information from their external asset managers on their approach to corporate governance, putting pressure on fund houses to increase resources in this area.Rakhi Kumar, head of corporate governance at State Street Global Advisors, said client demand for information on the company’s approach to this issue had “gone up significantly”.The belief is that better governance analysis helps investors avoid companies that are on the brink of a costly scandal. This issue has come to the fore over the past two years after the exposure of serious governance failings at Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company, and Volkswagen, the German carmaker, which caused their share prices to fall dramatically.An investment director at a large US pension fund, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his scheme looked for careful governance analysis at the external asset managers it uses. “US asset managers are putting more firepower behind evaluating corporate governance, which is increasingly being viewed as a risk management issue. Companies with poor governance are higher risk,” he said."

159;STT;State Street Corp;2017-01-25T16:41:05Z;JPMorgan wins $1tn custody mandate from BlackRock;Wall Street group to overtake State Street as world’s No 2 custodian bank;JPMorgan Chase looks set to leapfrog State Street to become the world’s No 2 custody bank after picking up $1tn of new assets from BlackRock.The mandate, one of the largest in the industry’s history, is a blow to State Street, which currently looks after the assets, sending its shares lower on Wednesday.Jay Hooley, chief executive of State Street, said he was disappointed at BlackRock’s decision, but understood that it wanted to diversify its custodian banks after many years of growth. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, with more than $5tn in assets.“We have been joined at the hip with them through their successful journey of asset growth,” Mr Hooley told analysts on a conference call, adding that BlackRock’s fast-growing iShares exchange traded funds business would continue to use State Street’s services.BlackRock presented the shift as a simple matter of cost. “Today’s action is yet another example of BlackRock’s commitment to maximise the benefits of scale,” said Derek Stein, head of business operations and technology. “Many of BlackRock’s clients will experience cost savings through decreased operating expenses at the fund level.”State Street reported custody assets of $21.7tn on Wednesday, while JPMorgan said earlier this month that it looked after assets of $20.5tn. It will take up to two years to transfer the $1tn of BlackRock assets, the companies said.BNY Mellon continues to be market leader, although it does not break out a number for assets under custody specifically. Last week it said that its assets under custody and administration were $29.9tn.Custody banks’ services to asset owners and fund managers include the safekeeping and settlement of securities and other administration, and as such they are central to the plumbing of the financial system.Mr Hooley predicted the loss of BlackRock’s business would be a “one-off” and that the big custody banks would continue to win market share, as clients reduce the number of providers to cut costs.State Street countered the BlackRock news with a press release saying that Allianz Global Investors, another client, was expanding the services it buys from State Street, which include fund administration, custody, share class hedging and data services covering €450bn of Allianz GI assets.Nonetheless, the bank’s shares were down 4 per cent in mid-morning trading. “There are always some puts and takes, but I cannot remember the last one this big,” said Glenn Schorr, analyst at Evercore ISI.State Street reported net income of $557m for the fourth quarter, up 1.8 per cent on the previous year, on flat revenue of $2.5bn. Within that, fee revenue was down 1.5 per cent at $2bn.JPMorgan has been trying to expand its custody business — and eyeing State Street’s No 2 slot — to generate revenues that can be less volatile than retail and investment banking. At its last investor day, Daniel Pinto, head of JPMorgan’s commercial and investment bank, called custody “a very good, very stable earning business”.Analysts said the BlackRock transfer could have an outsized impact. “Investors will fear that this is a ‘statement win’ by JPMorgan, proving their capabilities are on par with the big trust banks and that they could be coming after this business in a bigger way,” said Glenn Schorr at Evercore.

162;STT;State Street Corp;2016-10-07T17:27:15Z;BlackRock: cheap tricks;Group cuts fees on flagship ETFs in arena where scale is king and price is key to scale;"Companies that justify price cuts with promises of “making it up in volume” usually send investors running for the hills. Not so BlackRock, which this week cut fees on 15 of its flagship exchange traded funds. In ETFs, scale is king — and price begets scale.For ETF market leaders BlackRock, State Street and privately owned Vanguard, competing for assets is not a zero-sum game. The overall pie is getting bigger as passive strategies pull in money at the expense of active managers. Price is key; providers have been cutting fees on exchange-traded products linked to popular benchmarks. Annual running costs on the cheapest S&P 500 tracker are now just 0.04 cents for every dollar invested.And total ETF assets under management, currently $3tn, should increase further in future years according to ETFGI, a consultancy. One reason is the US Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule, which imposes a legal obligation on financial advisers to act in their clients’ best interest. Most expect this to lead to fewer (commission-based) recommendations to invest in actively managed funds, and greater use of passive strategies. Morningstar estimates that $1tn of retirement assets could move to passive investments as a result of this change alone.In order to be first in line to capture these buy-and-hold inflows, BlackRock’s iShares unit is giving up less than $75m of annual fees (based on current AUM) compared to $3.4bn in total fee income last year. Its “Core” range of ultra low-cost ETFs, charging on average 10 basis points, accounts for a quarter of AUM. The idea is that holders of these instruments will pay higher prices to access liquidity in more esoteric asset classes. So overall, fees (and hence revenue) are higher at about 30 basis points.In the longer term, it is possible that those margins will drift downwards, or that growth in AUM may slow. But amid the turmoil of an industry in transition, BlackRock will at least have a plan — and the scale to execute it.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
163;STT;State Street Corp;2016-10-05T13:43:48Z;ETF price war escalates as BlackRock fires broadside at rivals;World’s largest fund manager cuts fees to attract more interest from US pension advisers;The cut-throat price war between exchange traded fund providers in the US escalated on Wednesday after BlackRock fired another broadside at rival managers by reducing fees across its core iShares ETF range.The world’s largest fund manager cut expense ratios on 15 US-listed iShares ETFs by up to 5 basis points, reducing annual fees to between 4 and 14bp from a previous range of 7 to 16bp.Fees have also been reduced on five of BlackRock’s index-tracking mutual funds to bring their prices in line with their sister iShares ETFs.Competition on pricing between ETF managers in the US has intensified. BlackRock, Vanguard, Charles Schwab and State Street Global Advisors have exchanged punch and counterpunch in an effort to win market share.Rivalry between ETFs that track the S&P 500, the main US stock market benchmark, is particularly ferocious. BlackRock has reduced the annual fee on its S&P 500 ETF to just 4bp. This latest reduction undercuts fees on the directly competing products offered by Vanguard and State Street, which runs the world’s largest S&P 500 ETF.BlackRock said it was cutting fees ahead of the introduction of US regulations designed to improve standards in the country’s pension industry.“A new era is dawning for advisers and long-term investors of all kinds. To meet this historic shift, we aim to set a new market convention for core investing and long-term investors,” said Mark Wiedman, global head of iShares.The US government plans to put an end to hidden fees and conflicts of interest in the pension market with the introduction of a fiduciary rule for retirement advisers.This will require financial professionals to put their clients’ interests before their own when selling retirement products, a reform the government believes could lead to savings of $17bn a year for workers and retirees.ETF managers are confident that retirement advisers’ demand for their products will increase once the regulations come into force in April next year, as fees for ETFs are lower than for actively managed mutual funds.Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI, a London-based consultancy, said: “The new US fiduciary rule is an important change as it will be more difficult for financial advisers to justify using actively managed funds that carry higher management fees.“The government’s plans also suggest that more savers will be encouraged to use low-cost robo-advisers whose portfolios are mainly constructed using ETFs.”Christopher Harris, a senior analyst with Wells Fargo Securities, said this latest round of fee cuts was the “most significant” to date as the reductions would reduce BlackRock’s earnings per share by around 1.3 per cent next year.But Mr Harris added that this was still “a better result” for BlackRock than seeing its iShares ETF business continue to lose market share to key competitors such as Vanguard.BlackRock’s latest fee cuts come amid a race to gather assets in the industry. Between January and August, BlackRock’s iShares ETF business in the US attracted $53.9bn in net new inflows, according to ETFGI.However, Vanguard has performed slightly better, gathering $55.9bn over the same period.Other ETF managers are struggling to keep up. State Street Global Advisors has seen ETF inflows recover to $16.6bn so far this year after a disappointing performance in 2015, when it had outflows of $39.7bn.Charles Schwab has experienced a modest increase in inflows so far this year, to $9.3bn, but PowerShares, the fourth-largest ETF manager by assets, is lagging behind its rivals after gathering just $2.9bn as of the end of August.

166;STT;State Street Corp;2016-09-18T09:11:38Z;Portfolio managers shun investing in own funds;Concerns about whether interests are properly aligned with those of their investors;Half of the 15,000 mutual funds in the US are run by portfolio managers who do not invest a single dollar of their own money in their products, raising concerns about whether fund managers’ interests are properly aligned with those of their investors.Many of the world’s largest asset managers, including Vanguard, State Street, Schroders, BlackRock and Aberdeen, are among the companies with the lowest levels of portfolio manager investment in their funds.Three out of four funds at Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, and at Schroders, Europe’s second-largest listed fund house, are run by managers who do not invest anything in their funds.Portfolio managers are not invested in two out of three funds at BlackRock, the world’s largest investment company, and at Aberdeen, the FTSE 250 fund company, according to figures compiled exclusively for FTfm by Morningstar, the data provider.Only one of State Street’s 33 US-domiciled funds has a portfolio manager who is invested in their own product.This raises concerns as large investors such as pension funds and institutional asset managers like to see fund managers invested in their own funds as it demonstrates they have skin in the game and will be personally affected by any downturn in a fund’s performance.Steve Deschenes, head of client analytics at Capital Group, the Los Angeles-based investment company, said the findings are a worry. “Of course you should invest in [your own] fund,” he said. Nearly 90 per cent of Capital Group’s mutual funds are run by managers that invest at least $1m in their own products.Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the asset management consultancy, said he expected manager investment levels to be higher. “Since the 2008 crisis, more asset managers have been revamping their incentive systems to encourage co-investing,” he said. “The rhetoric of the reported changes has been running ahead of the reality.”A number of smaller investment companies demonstrated much higher levels of skin in the game, including Dodge & Cox, Oakmark and Primecap Odyssey. One hundred per cent of these companies’ funds had portfolio managers invested in them.The data also showed that asset managers running funds with lower fees were more likely to invest in their own products, suggesting manager investment could lead to lower costs and better performance, according to Russel Kinnel, head of research at Morningstar.He said: “Fund managers are savvy investors, so they are less likely to invest in gimmicky, high-cost funds. I remember one firm telling us that they didn’t invest much [in their own funds] because they would rather invest in something cheaper.”According to Capital Group research published in 2014 looking at the performance of US mutual funds over 20 years, manager ownership and cost are the two characteristics most strongly correlated with improved returns.Fewer than one in seven funds have managers with more than $1m invested, the Morningstar figures showed, despite the fact that annual salaries for fund managers are frequently in the millions of dollars, according to Mr Kinnel.He added that it was surprising how many funds had zero levels of investment from their portfolio managers.“We would have guessed that at least more [fund managers would invest] in those middle ranges of $50,000.”In Europe, rules that came into effect earlier this year require mutual fund managers to receive part of their bonuses as units of the funds they run. Mr Kinnel believes this change will have a spillover effect and pressure US fund managers to increase investments in their funds.However, he said that similar rules were unlikely to be imposed in the US.Fund companies argue that there are some situations where managers cannot invest in their own funds. UK-based Schroders said only a third of its 16 US-based mutual funds are managed by US-based portfolio managers who can invest directly in the products.A spokesperson for BlackRock said: “Morningstar’s most recent stewardship report on BlackRock makes clear that approximately 67 per cent of our US mutual fund assets are in vehicles in which at least one of the managers has invested $1m or more, including unvested fund shares. Morningstar has stated that it does not expect portfolio managers to invest in every target date fund or every municipal bond fund that they manage.”T Rowe Price, which has no manager investment in 45 per cent of its funds, said personal investments “might not be practical” if a manager is not a US citizen or manages retirement-related funds of funds.A spokesperson for Vanguard, which has no managers invested in 77 per cent of its funds, added that cost was a more important metric for investors than skin in the game.

168;STT;State Street Corp;2016-08-01T11:15:08Z;ETF market takes a flyer with mass of niche products;$3tn sector lures investors with themes such as drones and obesity;"“Variety is the spice of life” goes the proverb, one that some exchange-traded fund providers are testing to breaking point.The ascendancy of ETFs is one of the most powerful trends in global markets, with the industry swelling to more than $3tn this year. To capitalise on the growth, providers are structuring increasingly esoteric, niche products for investors to bet on micro themes such as drones, video gaming, 3D printing and millennials.Morningstar, a data provider, has called this a “spaghetti cannon” approach, while Lee Kranefuss, the erstwhile founder of BlackRock’s iShares ETF business — the biggest player in the industry — likens it to the music industry churning out a dizzying array of disposable pop singles, hoping that one will be a hit.“The industry has fallen prey to its own success,” he told the FT. “But the barriers to success are high.”Another industry giant, Vanguard chairman and chief executive Bill McNabb, argues that the pace of new ETF introductions has got out of hand. “This is like the 1980s and mutual funds. Things did not end well for all those funds,” he told a conference earlier this year.Most money sits inside the biggest and longest-established vehicles that track the largest markets, such as State Street’s SPDR, which tracks the S&P 500. It was launched in 1993 and is now a $195bn behemoth. Of the nearly 2,000 ETFs, the top 100 account for 74 per cent of total assets, according to Morningstar.The advantages of size and incumbency are often insurmountable. So now that most major markets and sectors have one or two dominant ETFs, many smaller providers are rolling out an increasingly esoteric — some sceptics say faddish — batch of products aimed at giving investors exposure to progressively narrower themes.“There’s no more white space up on the board,” says Ben Johnson, head of ETF research at Morningstar. “All the valuable real estate has been occupied, so it’s now just flinging spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks.”Globally there have been on average about four ETF launches a day since the end of 2014, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, and more are on the runway. For example, just before the summer, Janus Capital rolled out four new thematic ETFs that target the organic food industry, the health and fitness industry, elderly care and even obesity.“As the world takes on the global obesity epidemic, opportunities are emerging for a broad set of companies across sectors to make a significant contribution to this global challenge. Investors can participate in the benefits these companies may realise as they join the global battle against obesity through The Obesity ETF,” Janus’s marketing documents say.For Mr Johnson, picking his favourite from the batch of new thematic ETFs is like “picking which child is your favourite”, but if forced he would choose Janus’s recent offerings. “They’re the oddest of an odd bunch,” he says.But there are many to choose from. Earlier this year, Global X — a New York provider that sold a stake in itself to JPMorgan Asset Management in April — rolled out an ETF that invests in “socially conscious companies”, after earlier launches of fitness, longevity, lithium battery and “Catholic values” ETFs. The last one follows the investment guidelines set out by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops.However, the Global X ETF that garnered the most attention — if not the most assets — was one that seeks to invest in companies that benefit from the “rising spending power and unique preferences” of American millennials, the generation born between 1980 and 2000.These thematic ETFs often boast witty stock tickers. PureFunds’ drone, cyber security and video gaming ETFs are called IFLY, HACK and GAMR respectively; Janus Capital’s obesity ETF is named SLIM (FAT was presumably too touchy); and Global X’s Conscious Companies ETF goes by KRMA. Memorable tickers can often provide a commercial boost by helping a new vehicle’s profile.There’s no more white space up on the board. All the valuable real estate has been occupied, so it’s now just flinging spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticksBut many new ETFs are destined for the scrapheap. Reggie Browne, head of ETF trading at Cantor Fitzgerald, says an ETF needs to have roughly more than $75m of assets to be viable, and many are well below this mark. For example, while PureFunds’ cyber security ETF has climbed to more than $700m — propelled by high-profile data hacks in recent years — Global X’s admittedly much younger millennial ETF is only at $3.2m.About 500 ETFs have been buried since the industry’s inception, according to Morningstar, a number likely to swell in coming years. “If they don’t attract assets they should leave the market,” Mr Browne says. “There needs to be a mechanism to collapse them.”Moreover, the more esoteric the theme, the less diversified the ETF. Almost 40 per cent of Janus Capital’s obesity ETF is invested in Fresenius Medical Care, a German company, and Denmark’s Novo Nordisk. Sometimes the investment remit may be so broad or vague as to render the vehicle almost pointless.But what worries Mr Kranefuss is a “small player doing something odd, and it just blows up”, and sours investors towards other ETFs. “It’s like creating ETFs that will appeal to people like a hot stock.”"
169;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;State Street to pay $530m over secret mark-ups;Custody bank is alleged to have overcharged clients in foreign exchange trades;"State Street, the Boston-based custody bank led by chief executive Jay Hooley, is paying $530m to settle allegations that it overcharged clients by adding secret mark-ups to foreign exchange trades.The settlements with the US Department of Justice and other regulators, and with plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit, are the culmination of more than seven years of controversy over pricing practices at the big US custody banks. State Street’s rival BNY Mellon settled similar allegations last year.“State Street misled custody clients about how it priced their trades and tucked its hidden mark-ups into a corner where they were unlikely to notice,” said Andrew Ceresney, director of the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission.The bank will pay $167.4m in penalties and disgorgement of profits to the SEC, $155m to the DoJ and $60m to the Department of Labor, which oversees pension funds, according to a statement from the three agencies. A further $147.6m will settle the class action suit.The bank reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday morning, but it said on Tuesday that it had already fully provisioned for the settlements, through increases to legal reserves in previous quarters.“Matters of this nature can drain both time and resources; so where possible and appropriate we feel it is in State Street’s and our clients’ best interests to pursue settlements,” said Mike Rogers, president and chief operating officer of State Street.At issue are the rates pension funds, mutual funds and other custody clients are charged when buying or selling securities in foreign currencies, or when interest or dividend income is repatriated.The DoJ alleged that State Street had told clients it was providing “best execution” prices on foreign exchange transactions and that, contrary to representations to certain clients, the bank did not price foreign exchange transactions at prevailing interbank market rates. Instead, the DoJ alleged, it executed transactions by applying a predetermined, uniform mark-up, increasing its profits.“State Street’s custody clients, many of whom were public pension funds, financial institutions and non-profit organisations, had a right to expect that it would execute transactions in an honest and forthright manner,” said US Attorney Carmen Ortiz. “Instead, it executed FX transactions in a manner that enabled it to reap substantial profits at the expense of its clients.”The bank — which did not admit the allegations — said that it has improved disclosure practices since the controversy emerged in 2009."
170;STT;State Street Corp;2016-07-17T09:01:23Z;‘Return expectations of financial assets have to come down’;State Street Global Advisors’ chief executive says savers must be realistic;Few people will ever be able to boast that they led three of the world’s largest asset management businesses during their career.But boasting is not Ron O’Hanley’s style.“I hope you don’t think that I can’t hold down a job,” says Mr O’Hanley, who was hired in 2015 to revive the fortunes of State Street Global Advisors, the $2.4tn investment arm of Boston-based bank State Street.The 59-year-old was previously chief executive of BNY Mellon’s asset management business and more recently was president of asset management for Fidelity Investments, a company where he was once seen as a possible successor to Ned Johnson before Fidelity appointed his daughter, Abigail Johnson, as chief executive in 2014.The most immediate challenge facing Mr O’Hanley at State Street is to reverse the $302bn of withdrawals from its asset management arm in 2015. And his purchase of GE Asset Management from General Electric earlier this year in a $485m cash deal was a first step in addressing that. “GE is very complementary to our existing business,” says the father of two.But the GE deal, which brought in $100bn of assets, was relatively small and prompted some analysts to question the merit of the acquisition.“We don’t need to do a transformational deal,” says Mr O’Hanley. “M&A is not itself a strategy. It is a way to implement a strategy.”Perhaps the thorniest problem that faces Mr O’Hanley is the slump in asset gathering at State Street’s exchange traded fund business, which has struggled in the face of price competition from rivals BlackRock and Vanguard.Those two groups have gathered net inflows of $282bn and $215bn respectively since January 2014, while State Street has added $25bn over the same period. Last year alone investors pulled $19bn from State Street’s ETFs, while both BlackRock’s iShares business and Vanguard attracted inflows of $139bn and $84bn respectively.As a result, State Street reshuffled the senior management of its ETF division earlier this year. Veteran Jim Ross moved to the role of chairman to make way for two new co-heads, Nick Good and Rory Tobin.Mr Good was promoted from his role as chief operating officer of the intermediary business group in North America. Mr Tobin, who previously led BlackRock’s ETF arm in Europe, moved up from head of European distribution.At the time of the reshuffle State Street said the changes were “not linked” to the 2015 outflows.“State Street’s early lead in ETFs was achieved through a focus on large institutions. We were slow to recognise how individuals and intermediaries would pivot to ETFs after the financial crisis, and we have been playing catch-up there,” says Mr O’Hanley, who unwinds by spending a couple of days sailing to “clear the mind”. (A great sailboat crew is like a good management team, he says.)State Street launched the first US-listed ETF in 1993. It remained the world’s largest ETF manager until 2003 when it was overtaken by iShares, then owned by Barclays Global Investors.In January 2015, it lost its second position in terms of ETF assets under management to Vanguard, which has cut fees repeatedly and established its reputation in the eyes of many investors as the leading low-cost provider.Mr O’Hanley insists that State Street’s ETFs remain “very appealing” to financial advisers who face a direct threat to their business from Vanguard.“You will not see us go [ and sell products] directly to retail investors. Our competitors can’t make that promise to advisers,” he says.State Street has also accelerated its development of products, particularly in the area of smart beta ETFs — a halfway house between active and passive management where State Street has decades of experience.Many others have also begun selling smart beta products, which have become the hottest area of competition among asset managers.“We roll our eyes a little at rivals that now claim to be smart beta providers when they were pushing actively managed products two years ago,” says Mr O’Hanley.Away from the trickier questions about the performance of the ETF arm, Mr O’Hanley has other concerns about how people will be able to pay for their retirement and what asset managers should be doing to help.In a strongly worded letter to US Congress earlier this year he urged both Republicans and Democrats to work together to guarantee access to workplace savings plans.“Policy changes can be made and the investment industry itself must do better,” he says, emphasising that the difficulties facing retirement savers are far greater than ever before.“The lower-for-longer interest rate environment is real. Return expectations for financial assets have to come down. People have to start saving earlier and to save more for their retirement,” he said.The difficulties facing savers have worsened as a result of the global structural shift from generous defined benefit pensions to defined contribution schemes.“Defined benefit pension funds with all their flaws helped to pool risk. Defined contribution schemes have transferred all the costs and risks to the individual, who rarely has the ability to manage their retirement savings,” he said.“Worst of all we are transferring risks onto people that they don’t even know they are taking on.”Other issues worry him too. “Experts suggest that many cancers are curable and that people will be living well beyond 100. We should of course be celebrating that but our pension systems are not designed for this.”Two days of sailing might not help Mr O’Hanley solve those problems in his mind but he says he is committed to helping the industry try to do so.Founded 1978Assets under management $2.3tnNumber of employees 3,000 globallyHeadquarters Boston, with offices in 18 countries worldwideOwnership Wholly owned by State Street Corporation, the US-listed bank

State Street’s ETF arm has only managed to pull in $30bn over the same period.Christos Costandinides, founder of BlueHarbor, a US-based investment consultancy, said the intense competition from BlackRock and Vanguard had put pressure on State Street to act.He added that the management changes should help State Street to compete better against its rivals, but that further challenges lay ahead.“Competition on costs among the industry’s top players is already fierce. The introduction of interactive technologies, such as robo-advisers, are only going to add to competitive pressures across the ETF industry,” he said.Mr Good has been promoted from his role as chief operating officer of the intermediary business group in North America. Mr Tobin moves up from head of European distribution. He previously led BlackRock’s ETF arm in Europe.Mr Good said that the management changes were “not linked” to the 2015 outflows but that there was “a lot of work to do” for State Street to catch up with its competitors.“Competition in the ETF industry has increased significantly since the financial crisis. State Street was slow to recognise that but we have increased our investment in the business significantly over the past two years, doubling our distribution staff in both the US and Europe,” he said.State Street has responded by accelerating product developments, and performance has shown signs of improvement. Its ETF business has attracted inflows of $9.3bn so far this year, making it the third-fastest growing manager so far in 2016.However, BlackRock and Vanguard, the ETF industry’s two largest providers, have continued to extend their lead, with inflows of $30.6bn and $23.8bn respectively in 2016, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy.State Street was the world’s largest ETF manager until 2003, when it was overtaken by iShares. In January last year, SSgA also lost its second spot in terms of assets under management to Vanguard, which has cut fees repeatedly and enhanced its reputation as a low-cost provider.
173;STT;State Street Corp;2016-05-03T20:05:31Z;New Federal Reserve push to limit fallout from bank failures;Central bank proposes pause in unwinding of derivatives contracts at foundering institutions;"The Federal Reserve is proposing new measures to prevent a chaotic bank collapse by asking institutions that trade with a failing lender to pause before demanding their money back. In an effort to prevent a re-run of Lehman Brothers’ collapse in 2008, the Fed unveiled a proposal for lenders to stop counterparties from immediately exercising certain contractual rights when a bank goes into bankruptcy. The move on Tuesday marks the US’s latest effort to end “too big to fail” lenders by finding ways to handle a bank collapse without jeopardising financial stability or requiring a taxpayer-funded bailout. The proposal would require the rewriting of contracts so that counterparties such as fund managers waive their right to terminate contracts, and thus claim payments, for a period of up to 48 hours when a bank enters bankruptcy.Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, said it would help manage the risks around a big bank’s collapse by allowing time to transfer certain contracts — notably derivatives, repo and securities lending transactions — from a failed institution to a solvent one. “When these contracts . . . unravel all at once at a failed, large banking organisation; an orderly resolution of the bank may become far more difficult, sparking asset fire sales that may consume many firms,” she said at a Fed public meeting to discuss the rule on Tuesday. The move would have implications for asset managers, hedge funds and insurance companies that do business regularly with banks through contracts known as qualified financial contracts, or QFCs.Don Hawthorne, a partner at law firm Axinn Veltrop & Harkrider, said that the proposal could be counter-productive. “Holding the show up” for 48 hours “may not seem a major burden for creditors, but in reality, your options change dramatically based on what happens in that period,” he said.“If institutional investors do not have that flexibility, when they see a bank that is not insolvent but looking vulnerable, they may start to terminate positions and move their business elsewhere — which will cause the very problems regulators are trying to remedy.”If institutional investors do not have that flexibility, when they see a bank that is not insolvent but looking vulnerable, they may start to terminate positions and move their business elsewhereLehman’s collapse triggered bedlam that tipped the world into recession as market players scrambled to figure out how the fallen bank’s financial exposures would be unwound. The requirement to alter contracts would apply to eight US banks tagged as institutions that have the potential to cause systemic disruption: Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo. The proposal would only suspend, not eliminate, some of their counterparties’ rights. Federal Reserve officials said they were not being asked to do business with big banks on terms they found unacceptable and could choose to transact elsewhere.The Fed’s proposal is largely consistent with a voluntary protocol introduced in 2014 by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a trade group."

Rather it runs continuously from early New Zealand time on a Monday to late New York time on a Friday, though some periods are much more actively-traded than others. To value assets over time, many investors and companies use snapshots of currencies prices, such as the WM index rates captured at 4pm in London.Last year, banks paid a total of $5.6bn to settle allegations that some of their traders sought to manipulate these benchmarks by working as a pack to execute trades at rates that were more favourable to them than to some clients. Scrutiny of these benchmarks has intensified, but even before many of those fines were paid, banks tightened up internal procedures significantly to remove the possibility that rates could be manipulated.State Street said that selling this index business “makes good strategic sense”.Thomson Reuters set up a fully separate and regulated subsidiary for benchmark services in 2014 “to prepare for the regulation of financial benchmarks, and provide an effective governance framework for the benchmarks it administers.”

181;STT;State Street Corp;2016-02-22T18:43:21Z;US bank lobbyists blast ‘excessive’ capital requirement rules;Fed’s proposals to build bigger buffer against losses could restrict credit flows;The top lobby groups for banks in the US have blasted proposals to make them build bigger buffers against losses, saying that the “excessive” requirements could restrict the flow of credit to the world’s biggest economy.The lobbyists were responding to proposals set out late last year by the US Federal Reserve, which were part of a global effort designed to end the problem of lenders whose size and influence renders them “too big to fail”.Debate continues to rage on whether policymakers have done enough to prevent a repeat of the taxpayer-funded bailouts which steadied the big banks after the financial crisis in 2008.According to the Fed’s proposed rules on banks’ “total loss absorbing capacity”, or TLAC, banks must operate with a minimum amount of equity and debt — equal to 18 per cent of risk-weighted assets — that can be written off when a bank gets into serious trouble.But in a response made jointly on Monday by the five biggest bank lobby groups, the banks said such a requirement — which would be become effective in January 2019 — would provide more than enough cover for losses arising from “any reasonably foreseeable severely adverse scenario”.In a 151-page letter, the groups urged the Fed to cut its minimum TLAC requirement to 14 per cent of RWAs, before adding on surcharges of up to 5 per cent for the biggest and most complex banks. The Fed’s proposals had been designed as an overlay to international standards agreed last September by the Basel-based Financial Stability Board, which called for TLAC ratios of at least 16 per cent for “globally systemically important banks”, or GSIBs.Reforms since the crisis mean that “the US has an extraordinarily resilient and resolvable set of large banks,” said Greg Baer, president of The Clearing House, which lobbies on behalf of the 24 biggest commercial lenders in the US. Going beyond FSB standards “is not achieving any goal of ending ‘too big to fail’ and is simply imposing greater costs on operations and ultimately, market liquidity,” he said.The co-ordinated attack by the lobby groups is a mark of the US banking industry’s frustrations with the Fed, which they say has become dominated by academics and economists who are unresponsive to arguments about the real-world effects of their rulemaking. The lobbyists argue that “gold-plating” capital standards for the biggest US banks is encouraging them to lay off activities to more lightly regulated non-banks such as hedge funds and online lenders, which might prove to be erratic sources of supply.According to the lobbyists’ calculations, the eight biggest US banks would have an aggregate TLAC shortfall of at least $363bn — about three times greater than the $120bn estimate by the Fed last October.$363bnEstimate of the aggregate ‘total loss absorbing capacity’ shortfall the eight biggest US banks would have, according to lobby groupsThe Clearing House was joined in its effort by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the American Bankers Association, the Financial Services Roundtable and the Financial Services Forum.The eight US banks designated as GSIBs are JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street and Wells Fargo.In a separate letter on Monday, the Institute of International Bankers applied pressure on the Fed to soften its TLAC proposal, saying that it would “impose excessive costs” on its members while leading to “competitive disparities and unfair treatment in international banking without commensurate benefits to resolvability or US financial stability”.The IIB represents non-US banks with about $5tn in assets in their US operations.

183;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
184;STT;State Street Corp;2016-02-14T09:02:32Z;Tumble in technology shares drags Invesco ETF down;Investors pulled just over $2bn from the PowerShares ETF known as QQQ in January;Big falls in the share prices of leading US technology companies since the beginning of the year have led to a difficult start to 2016 for the passive fund business of Invesco, the Atlanta-based asset manager.Invesco’s PowerShares business is the world’s fourth-largest ETF provider, with assets of $101bn, but the performance of its index-tracking arm is often overshadowed by its three larger rivals: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors.In January, investors pulled just over $2bn from the Invesco PowerShares ETF known as QQQ. It tracks an index of the 100 largest stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock market.The ETF is Invesco’s biggest fund and also one of the largest ETFs globally, with assets of $37.8bn, according to ETFGI, a consultancy. It is widely followed as a barometer of investor sentiment towards the technology sector.Concerns about high valuations and a deteriorating outlook for earnings have weighed on the share prices of tech companies including Alphabet, Google’s parent company, Apple, and Netflix.This has dragged the Nasdaq 100 index down almost 14 per cent since the start of 2016 and prompted some investors to pull money from the Invesco ETF.“Selling by a small, concentrated group of investors has been responsible for the withdrawals from QQQ,” said Dan Draper, global head of ETFs at Invesco PowerShares.Mr Draper added that outflows from QQQ had been offset by inflows into smart-beta products, a more sophisticated form of ETF. Invesco expects continued investor demand in this area.The decline in the Nasdaq index this year has encouraged some investors to raise their bets on a quick rebound for the technology sector.ProShares, a Maryland-based asset manager, has experienced inflows of $364m in January into its triple leveraged ETF. This delivers a multiple of three times the daily return of the Nasdaq 100 index.US regulators are considering whether to limit the amount of leverage asset managers can offer via ETFs. The higher volatility of these funds can magnify losses and US regulators have repeatedly warned these vehicles are not suitable for retail investors.
185;STT;State Street Corp;2016-02-08T12:16:54Z;Fund managers ready for ‘smart beta’ wars;Asset managers swoop for niche players as interest hots up;The swelling popularity of cheap, index-tracking funds has been a mounting concern for traditional asset managers. But many have decided to launch a fightback, betting that they can capture business in the more innovative edges of the passive investment world.The exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry is utterly dominated by three big players — State Street, BlackRock and Vanguard. Together they control about 80 per cent of the nearly $4tn passive investment world, a virtually unassailable perch in an industry where scale is the biggest advantage.Many of the biggest active fund management companies have therefore reluctantly conceded defeat in ETFs, but have resolved to do battle in a hot new niche called “smart beta” — passive investment with a twist. The battle lines have been drawn by a slew of acquisitions and fund launches over the past year, and analysts and industry insiders expect the initial skirmishes to escalate into a full-scale “smart beta war” in the coming years.“The greatest risk to a traditional asset manager today is to do nothing,” says Joe Sullivan, chief executive of Legg Mason, which has more than $670bn of assets under management but only $15m in four smart beta strategies launched on December 27. “We cannot light candles and pray for the status quo. The industry is changing.”Beta is the financial term for the return derived from the market, while “alpha” is what skilled investors can generate. ETFs and index-tracking mutual funds attempt to mimic gauges like the S&P 500 stock market index or the Barclays Aggregate bond index, handing investors the beta without the costs of an expensive human fund manager.But these indices have weaknesses. Bond indices, for example, are skewed towards big borrowers, while equity indices typically weight the biggest companies more heavily. So financial engineers have over the years devised what has gradually become known as “smart beta” or “active beta”.Smart beta funds take a basic passive investment strategy but tweak it to generate above-market returns, for example by weighting companies in a stock index completely equally, favouring cheaper stocks or those with momentum. They can even include several investment “factors” at once, such as systematically screening for cheap, dividend-paying stocks with little volatility.Old-school ETFs may still dominate investment flows but analysts expect second-generation smart beta funds to become increasingly popular. Indeed, “smart beta” was last year the single most searched-for term on Investopedia, the financial equivalent of the crowdsourced dictionary Wikipedia.Encouragingly for active asset managers who have had their lunch eaten by ETFs in recent years, the smart beta industry is far smaller and more splintered and therefore remains wide open. The total US ETF industry stands at about $1.7tn and smart beta products now account for well over a fifth of that — up from 14 per cent five years ago — after three straight years of $60bn plus inflows, according to Morningstar. And there are only 11 smart beta ETFs with assets of over $10bn.“It feels like the early days of the automobile, when there were a lot of smaller manufacturers,” says Marc Pinto, head of Moody’s asset manager ratings division.But the battle for smart beta bucks promises to be fierce. Giant money management companies including OppenheimerFunds, Legg Mason, Franklin Templeton and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are now all beginning to jostle with smaller but well-regarded firms such as Guggenheim, Research Affiliates, WisdomTree, Dimensional Fund Advisors and even hedge funds such as AQR, many of which have already established strong reputations as smart beta pioneers in the industry.To fight the smart beta wars, several of the traditional asset managers have swooped for smaller, innovative niche players rather than develop their own products from scratch. Last year, Oppenheimer bought VTL Associates and Legg Mason snapped up QS Investors, while Goldman Sachs Asset Management bought Westpeak Global Advisors in 2014.“It will be a war of attrition,” predicts Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. He points out that many of these next-generation ETFs still have to demonstrate a superior performance over time and eventually money will gravitate towards the “smarter beta” products. “This will only begin to really heat up in three to four years’ time when these new strategies have some track record,” he says.Early momentum could be vital for the newer entrants attempting to stake out a strong position in the industry but the paths taken vary. For example, Goldman Sachs has unusually opted to compete on price when it launched a suite of smart beta ETFs late last year.Thus far its biggest seller is its $569m emerging markets smart beta ETF. But the flagship ActiveBeta US Large Cap Equity ETF — which uses value, momentum, quality and low volatility factors, and periodically rebalances the four — costs just 9 basis points annually. Even State Street’s $182bn SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, often known as Spider, charges 9.45bp.Stephen Tu, analyst at Moody’s, expects that the real test will not just be cost but the successful development of what he dubs “smart beta 2.0”, or ETFs that pursue more advanced systematic strategies rather than simply weighting dividend-friendly or cheap stocks. “This is an industry in disruption,” he points out.

187;STT;State Street Corp;2016-01-30T08:15:23Z;Dominance of ‘Big Three’ forces wave of innovation;Large cash flows are also attracting new entrants;Three big problems confront asset managers looking to establish or expand their operations in the rapidly growing exchange traded fund industry: BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors.These behemoths together control more than two-thirds of the ETF industry’s global assets and in 2015 grabbed 55 per cent of the new cash allocated by investors to ETFs, according to ETFGI, a consultancy.But there was plenty for other managers to fight over given the ETF industry’s record inflows of $372bn last year.ETFGI data show that some of the notable beneficiaries of investors’ growing interest in ETFs include WisdomTree and Deutsche Asset Management, which both saw inflows to ETFs more than triple in 2015 compared with the previous year. Daiwa, the Japanese fund house, registered a sixfold increase in net inflows.Investors have ploughed around $1.5tn into ETFs over the past five years after growing dissatisfaction with the high fees and widespread underperformance of actively managed traditional mutual funds.The large cash flows are attracting new competitors. A record 43 managers launched ETFs for the first time in 2015, including high profile entities such as Goldman Sachs and John Hancock, the US arm of ManuLife, the Canada-based financial services provider.However, latest research from ETFGI shows that 276 managers globally now participate in the ETF industry, raising doubts about just how many can prosper in an increasingly competitive industry.“The barriers to entry into the ETF industry are low but the hurdles to achieve success are getting higher and higher,” says Lee Kranefuss, executive chairman of Source, the London-based ETF provider.Attempting to compete purely on costs is widely seen as a thankless task as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have already slashed fees on some of their most popular funds in a cut-throat price war.The competition on pricing is so intense that midsized managers are trying to find a niche by focusing on new ideas, such as smart beta ETFs, even though the largest providers are also trying to innovate.“It is far harder to create a hit in the ETF industry than in the music business,” says Mr Kranefuss.Sub-scale unprofitable funds abound across the ETF industry. ETFGI estimates that more than 6,100 ETFs are now available to investors globally, but around 70 per cent of those funds have less than $100m in assets, the minimum level generally regarded as necessary to break even. Just under 2,000 ETFs have less than $10m of assets, effectively making them uninvestable for many institutional managers.Mr Kranefuss points out that greater size generally brings important liquidity benefits, allowing investors to buy and sell more efficiently. “Investors need to know they can get out as well as into an ETF,” he adds.Christos Costandinides, founder of BlueHarbor, a US-based investment consultancy, says providers need to gain size quickly to counteract the ETF industry’s intense competitive pressures.While Mr Kranefuss and Mr Costandinides believe the industry is ripe for consolidation, there have been few mergers and acquisitions.Just last month, however, Legg Mason bought a stake in Precidian Investments, a New Jersey-based boutique that has developed an innovative active ETF structure.BMO Global Asset Management, the Canadian investment manager acquired the UK fund house F&C in 2014 using the deal as a launch pad to enter the European ETF market last year.Marc Knowles, a director at BMO Global Asset Management, says there is no point in launching “me-too products” to compete against the well-established ETFs of the big three providers.“Providers have to strive to be different. It is vital to have the right products in an increasingly crowded market place, to build ETFs that meet specific client needs,” he says.Striving to be different seems to have paid off for one provider. WisdomTree, the New York based manager, runs a pair of currency hedged European and Japanese equity ETFs that were two of the fastest growing products globally in 2015.Nizam Hamid, head of sales for WisdomTree Europe, says smaller and nimble players can compete effectively against the industry’s Goliaths. “Clients do want to see providers that offer something different and who can bring some extra value to their portfolios,” he says.Deutsche Asset Management is already thesecond-largest player in the European ETF market, according to ETFGI, but it too is looking to differentiate itself as it expands its US operations.“We will not attempt to compete on vanilla [traditional] index-trackers in the US. Our focus is on more sophisticated products,” says Reinhard Bellet, head of passive asset management at Deutsche Asset Management.He emphasises the importance of helping clients understand how to use these more sophisticated products in their portfolios.Providers, says Mr Bellet, must also be able to quickly read shifts in market conditions so as to better understand the needs of clients.

Farewell also to Irish domestic banks with global expansion plans. Innovation and research and development has become Ireland’s best bet at earning a place on the global financial services map.Citigroup, MasterCard and State Street are among the big names in US financial services to have picked Ireland for R&D projects that will help shape the future of their global businesses.At the same time, the Dublin start-up scene has many companies offering complex solutions to investment banks and hedge funds overseas, while other newcomers are working in cutting-edge fields such as blockchain and online payments.“Ireland definitely has a greater concentration of financial services and global technology companies than most other countries of a similar size,” says Sean Croston, head of IT at Irish brokerage Goodbody’s.Susan Dargan, head of State Street Global Services Offshore, says the country has been an obvious location for the funds administration group to develop projects for more than 20 years. Last month, it launched a new financial technology research centre at University College Cork and China’s Zhejiang University.Ms Dargan credits Ireland’s appeal to the scale of its international financial services sector and the “breadth of the technology sector”, which includes the European headquarters of internet powers such as Facebook, Ebay and Google.Many point to the country’s low-tax environment as an attraction for large corporations seeking a base in the EU. But Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate — the lowest in a developed English-speaking country — is “not a significant differentiator” for State Street, she says. State Street hopes the Cork project will bear fruit in areas such as assessing the development of virtual and crypto currencies. New insights into investor behaviour, and their willingness to use new technologies such as robo advisers offering wealth management with minimal human intervention, are also on their wish list.MasterCard has already rolled out an application from its Dublin fintech lab — a new mobile payment system that is being introduced in leisure and drinks venues around the world, including sports venues. The technology, known as Qkr!, allows customers to use smartphones to settle bills through an app to which the venue must also sign up. Venues include UK restaurant chains such as Carluccio’s, Wagamama and Ask Italian, alongside some US sports stadiums.Citi has rolled out systems developed in Dublin across the worldCiti has also rolled out systems developed in Dublin across the world. Its Innovation Lab, founded in 2009, now has 70 full-time employees working on projects for Citi’s corporate bank, which has no operational presence in Ireland.Emmett Kilduff, a former Morgan Stanley banker who founded a Dublin fintech firm in 2012, can relate to having an overwhelmingly international client base.Mr Kilduff’s Eagle Alpha trawls the internet for “data-driven actionable information”, which it sells to investor clients. If customers are tweeting product reviews, Eagle Alpha’s 20-strong team can analyse the implications for listed companies. They also comb other social media and online signals such as the frequency of Google searches.“There isn’t any other firm globally that provides asset managers with our three types of output — research, analytics and data,” says Mr Kilduff. “We are a tech company at heart.”A few miles down the road, Donal Gallagher’s Quaternion Risk Management has developed open source software for valuing complex derivatives which he says is the only one of its kind in the world. Mr Gallagher is a former executive at the defunct German-Irish Depfa bank who struck out into fintech in 2010. The firm also does consultingMr Gallagher had the idea for the company after being horrified by how poorly banks understood the risks they were taking on. Quaternion has grown from two founders to 25 people in Dublin and two in New York and Boston. So far, their clients are mainly in London and Germany but its founder sees potential for growth further afield. “We’re just at the start of a new five-year plan,” he says.Terry Clune, who developed Taxback.com into the world’s biggest sales tax refund processor, has similarly ambitious hopes for TransferMate, which he co-founded in 2010. He is attempting to raise €25m for the business, which aims to exploit a global network of licences and bank accounts allowing it to handle a range of foreign exchange transactions in a single day at fees Mr Clune says are less than half those charged by banks. He believes his new business can be bigger than Taxback.com, which has expanded to 23 countries with 875 employees.Ireland has pushed to secure a niche in the global financial services sector before. But back-office jobs, which Ireland worked so hard to win, are also moving to cheaper centres in eastern Europe and Asia. Ireland’s distressed banks were also forced to abandon international expansions after a series of devastating losses and bailouts.Even so, fintech’s legion of proponents insist their boom is here to stay.
189;STT;State Street Corp;2016-01-17T05:10:18Z;Hot exchange traded fund market leaves State Street cold;World’s third-largest asset manager was only top-20 ETF provider to register net outflows in 2015;The exchange traded fund industry enjoyed record-breaking growth in 2015, but it was a year to forget for the world’s third-largest asset manager, State Street Global Advisors.State Street was the only top-20 ranked ETF manager to register net outflows in 2015, raising more questions about its ability to compete against its faster-growing rivals BlackRock, Vanguard, WisdomTree and Charles Schwab.Investors pulled $19bn from State Street’s ETFs last year, while both BlackRock’s iShares business and Vanguard attracted inflows of $139bn and $84bn respectively, according to figures from ETFGI, the consultancy.Last year’s outflows marked another step back for State Street, which was the world’s largest ETF manager until 2003, when it was overtaken by iShares. In January last year, SSgA also lost its second spot in terms of assets under management to Vanguard, which has cut fees repeatedly and enhanced its reputation as a low-cost provider.A particular problem for the US fund house has been its flagship ETF, SPY. State Street launched the S&P 500 index tracker, which was the first US-domiciled ETF, in 1993 and it has long held the title of the world’s largest ETF.But with the S&P 500 index posting a decline of 0.7 per cent (excluding dividends) in 2015, investors withdrew $31bn from SPY last year. Similar ETFs offered by BlackRock and Vanguard notched up inflows.Jim Ross, global head of ETFs at State Street, says: “The impact of the outflows from SPY has been significant. The market environment was very different in 2015, with the fall in oil prices leading to a repositioning globally by investors, particularly those based in the Middle East, where SPY is widely used as a liquidity buffer.”The falls are a concern for analysts. “It is not a pretty picture. SPY is an easily replicable fund that is open to price competition from rivals such as Vanguard. SSgA has lost market share and its position is vulnerable,” says Brennan Hawken, an analyst at UBS, the bank, in New York.Christos Costandinides, founder of BlueHarbor, a US-based investment consultancy, adds that State Street is facing “a major strategic challenge” in how to compete with BlackRock and Vanguard.He says: “Compared with BlackRock, SSgA’s assets are more concentrated in a few products, making it more susceptible to larger asset swings as market conditions change.“Vanguard, meanwhile, has forcefully claimed the ‘low-fee’ space. This is a fight that is hard for State Street to win, given that Vanguard’s ownership structure permits it to operate at much lower margins.”State Street has belatedly reduced fees on some ETFs, including SPY, but observers say it has been too slow to respond to the pricing challenge of its rivals.Investor inflows and withdrawals from SPY are large and volatile so they tend to mask other developments in State Street’s ETF operations. Mr Ross, however, insists that SSgA is stepping up its efforts to counter competition.“We have made large investments in the US over the past two years within distribution, where we have come close to doubling our sales force that deals with financial intermediaries and retail clients. We have also built a team of fixed income specialists, which is aimed mainly at institutional clients but also provides support to our sales efforts for financial intermediaries.”Mr Ross says similar investments are planned in Europe after Rory Tobin, an ETF industry veteran and former BlackRock director, was hired in 2014 for a newly created role as head of European distribution.The US fund house has also accelerated product development, which has produced some early successes.The SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF, a collaboration with DoubleLine Capital, the $85bn Los Angeles-based fixed income specialist led by Jeff Gundlach, was the fastest-growing new ETF of 2015. It attracted inflows of $1.7bn.State Street launched the first US fossil-fuel free ETF in 2015 as well as several fixed income ETFs. These helped the fund company capture 37 per cent of total inflows into ETFs launched last year in the US.Mr Ross says: “Not every launch will be an immediate success but we have been encouraged by the early response to new products that we have brought out.”Mr Hawken welcomes the initiatives but questions whether they will be enough to deliver a meaningful improvement in the performance of the overall ETF business.Mr Costandinides adds: “State Street is a very strong brand. The challenge for them is how to redefine its DNA in order to effectively protect its position as a major ETF supermarket.”While State Street Global Advisors continues to lose assets from its exchange traded fund business, the ETF market has set another record for global asset gathering.According to ETFGI, the London-based consultancy, ETFs attracted net inflows of $372bn in 2015, a 10 per cent increase on the previous year.The figures show that BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, was the fastest-growing ETF provider for a second year running, with its iShares operations pulling in a record $139bn in 2015, up 36 per cent on 2014.At the same time, Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management’s global inflows tripled to $28.4bn, helped by a strong performance for its business in the US market, while Japanese fund houses Nomura, Nikko Asset Management and Daiwa all registered substantial increases in net inflows.State Street, the third-largest ETF manager by assets, was the only top-20 ranked provider by assets to register net outflows.Last year’s outflows marked another step back for State Street, which was the world’s largest ETF manager until 2003 when it was overtaken by iShares. In January last year, SSgA also lost its second spot in terms of assets under management to Vanguard, which has cut fees repeatedly and enhanced its reputation as a low-cost provider.

192;STT;State Street Corp;2015-11-15T02:21:16Z;Passive managers struggle to mirror indices;Managers of index trackers can drift from their performance goals;Most active fund managers do not beat their benchmarks: nine out of ten actively managed European equity funds failed to reach their performance goals over the last decade.In the US, around 80 per cent of large-cap equity managers fell short of their index targets over the same period.These statistics have helped fuel inflows into index-tracking funds, including exchange traded funds (ETFs). But are the investors who conclude “if you can’t beat the index, match it” overlooking key evidence?Research shows that the managers of index funds also drift from their own performance goals. When aiming to match a benchmark’s return, passive managers face an array of costs, including fund fees, bid-offer spreads on trades, commissions, taxes, foreign exchange costs and cash drag. There is also the problem of slippage, when the timing of an index change cannot be reproduced in real life.Recently, active managers have pointed out that two popular US junk bond ETFs have failed to track their indices.Muddying the picture, some ETFs outperform their stated benchmarks. Many Europe-domiciled trackers of equity indices like the S&P 500 and the Euro STOXX 50 have produced above-index returns, even after fund expenses are taken into account. This apparently anomalous result is due to a pessimistic view by index calculators on dividend withholding tax rates, while ETF managers retain more of equities’ income stream.“A common misconception is that if an ETF costs 30 basis points, you’re guaranteed to underperform the market by 30 basis points a year,” says Matthew Arnold, head of institutional ETF sales, Emea, at State Street Global Advisors.But beyond that, making general statements about the ability of a passive fund to track its index appears difficult.In Europe, regulators require ETF issuers to disclose in their prospectuses any factors likely to affect the ability of a fund to track its stated benchmark.Issuers must also publish information on the anticipated level of tracking error, the variability of a fund’s return with respect to its index, as well as disclosing the realised levels of tracking error and tracking difference in their funds’ annual reports.“We encourage investors to consider both metrics [tracking error and tracking difference] when evaluating an ETF,” BlackRock says.A positive performance divergence between fund and index may be viewed differently by different types of investor, says Eleanor Hope-Bell, UK head of State Street Global Advisors’ ETF arm.“A retail investor probably wouldn’t blink an eye at tracking error that works in his or her favour, whereas an institutional investor considers it as a potential cost,” says Ms Hope-Bell.For ETF managers, there is a trade-off in managing the shorter-term variability of a fund’s return and its long-term performance, explains Arnaud Llinas, head of ETFs and indexing at Lyxor Asset Management.“The primary objective of an ETF manager is to optimise tracking,” says Mr Llinas. “But the more you reduce tracking error, the more you increase tracking difference. For example, zero tracking error in a derivatives-based ETF comes at a cost in the form of extra tracking difference, since the counterparty has to be paid for the insurance it provides,” he explains.But do the broadly sub-index returns of many passive funds imply a new lease of life for active managers? Not necessarily, according to a new study from Morningstar.The results still make grim reading for active funds. Morningstar found that, across 12 fund categories, active funds’ success rate in beating their passive counterparts over 10 years was as low as 16.9 per cent and only exceeded 50 per cent in one category, mid-cap value stocks.Fund expenses proved a key factor in determining active funds’ chances of coming out ahead, the researchers concluded: the lower the fees, the better the odds.Ultimately, then, the tracking debate may be part of a larger one about fund costs. But here index funds and ETFs still have a significant edge over their active counterparts.
193;STT;State Street Corp;2015-10-30T21:38:59Z;US banks face $120bn shortfall under Federal Reserve plan;Proposed rules aim to halt systemic meltdown by tackling problem of ‘too big to fail’ lenders;Six of the biggest US banks would have to make up a $120bn shortfall in their long-term debt to boost the financial system’s resilience under a Federal Reserve proposal aimed at preventing another systemic meltdown.The proposal unveiled on Friday is part of a global regime and one of the final post-crisis steps designed to end the problem of lenders whose size and influence renders them “too big to fail”.Debate continues to rage on whether policymakers have done enough to prevent the taxpayer-funded bailouts from which the largest banks benefited during the financial crisis in 2008.The Fed’s proposed rules on banks’ “total loss absorbing capacity”, or TLAC, say banks must carry a minimum amount of capital and liabilities — equal to 18 per cent of risk-weighted assets — that can be written off when a bank gets into serious trouble.Janet Yellen, Fed chair, told an open meeting: “The proposal, combined with our other work to improve the resolvability of systemic banking firms, would substantially reduce the risk to taxpayers and the threat to financial stability stemming from the failure of these firms.”The proposal affects eight US institutions designated as globally systemically important banks, or GSIBs, but the Fed would not say which six had the combined $120bn shortfall.The eight banks are JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street and Wells Fargo.A senior Fed official said the banks “don’t need to go out and raise massive quantities of new debt”, because they could meet the standards in other ways by, for example, shifting debt from subsidiaries to parent companies or moving soon-to-mature debt to longer maturities.The Fed estimates that compliance with the proposal would increase each bank’s annual funding costs by between $680m and $1.5bn.The proposals are part of a global regime agreed on September 25 by the Financial Stability Board, a group of regulators appointed by the G20 countries and chaired by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.John Simonson, a partner at PwC and a former deputy director at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said: “We’ve already seen higher capital requirements generally, and additional buffers for GSIBs. This is another layer to protect the banking system from potential failures, so it is an important step.”“The proposal, combined with our other work to improve the resolvability of systemic banking firms, would substantially reduce the risk to taxpayers and the threat to financial stability stemming from the failure of these firmsIn the EU, divergent moves by countries to implement — and in some cases water down — the TLAC requirements have prompted the European Commission to start informal talks with national officials in an effort to co-ordinate the plans.During third-quarter earnings presentations, many US banks said they had made progress on meeting their anticipated TLAC requirements. Most cited a combination of reductions in risk-weighted assets, increases in retained earnings and additional debt issuance from holding companies.One outlier was Wells Fargo, which continues to increase its issuance needs by expanding its balance sheet. In recent months the San Francisco-based lender has announced the acquisition of about $50bn of assets, equivalent to a midsized bank.From July to September the eight GSIBs issued a total of $43bn of debt, roughly four-fifths of which came from their respective holding companies.But overall, TLAC issuance was at a “measured pace,” said Pri da Silva, an analyst at CreditSights, noting that the amount of debt issued was only slightly higher than the amount that came due during the period.“Although we expect issuances to outpace maturities through 2018, the pace may not pick up until there is clarity on US TLAC requirements and eligibility,” he said.In addition to requiring new debt issuance, the proposals could require some banks to reshape their holding companies to create a “clean” structure with fewer obligations to subsidiaries or market counterparties, said David Wright, a former Fed official who is now a managing director at Deloitte.“That requirement is an attempt to make sure that the firm can more cleanly go through a bankruptcy process in an orderly way,” he said.
194;STT;State Street Corp;2015-09-23T09:06:00Z;ECB drops Deutsche and SSgA from ABS buying programme;Amundi and ING retained to purchase asset-backed securities;The European Central Bank is removing two of the four asset managers it uses to buy asset-backed securities, in a shake-up of the bond purchase programme aimed at increasing the role of national central banks.The ECB began to buy asset-backed securities in November last year, as part of broad interventions designed to boost economic growth. It hired Amundi and Amundi Intermédiation, ING Investment Management (now NN Investment Partners), Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management International and State Street Global Advisors to assist with purchases.Deutsche and SSgA will not have their contracts with the central bank extended, according to people familiar with the matter. The proportion of purchases carried out by national central banks, including those of France and Belgium, will be extended.Deutsche declined to comment. State Street said: “The ECB has recognised our contribution to making the [asset-backed securities purchase programme] a success and we wish them all the best with the programme going forward. ECB will continue to be a key relationship for State Street more widely.”The ECB has previously stated that purchases will be implemented in a “uniform and decentralised manner by the eurosystem central banks” after an “initial phase”. The central bank declined to comment on whether the latest changes to its programme would increase or decrease total purchases.The process of securitisation involves taking assets, from mortgages to car loans, and bundling them into a special vehicle so they can be sold on to investors. Because asset-backed securities are a source of funding for banks, boosting the asset class is seen as a means of encouraging new lending across Europe.The adjustments to the ABS programme come almost a year after its launch, at a time when market participants remain disappointed at the low levels of ECB buying under the programme, and low levels of issuance.“Expectations when the programme was launched were higher,” said David Covey, head of European ABS strategy at Nomura. “Our expectation for ECB purchases was lower than most, but even that forecast proved to be far too optimistic.”Job cuts and moves show failure of revival attempts for packaged loansRead moreThe ECB had bought a total of just under €12bn of asset-backed securities as of mid-September. This compares with the €116bn of covered bonds it has bought through its third purchase programme for the assets, and €314bn of sovereign debt under its quantitative easing programme launched in March.The market for ABS was significantly larger before the financial crisis of 2008 left a reputational stain on the industry. It is dwarfed by the European markets for covered and sovereign bonds, and a lack of new issuance is one of the central reasons for the limitations on the ECB’s buying activity, according to Mr Covey.“The amount of issuance that’s come from the eurozone has been very disappointing,” he said. “There’s just not a lot to buy. Some investors are reluctant to sell to the ECB or anyone else since there’s not much paper around to replenish with.”The European ABS industry, which has lost several key players over recent months, is clinging to a new initiative in Brussels. The European Commission will announce new measures to help rejuvenate securitisation at the end of September.In June, the European Banking Authority recommended reducing capital charges on certain kinds of securitisation, which would make them more attractive for banks to hold on their balance sheets.
195;STT;State Street Corp;2015-08-30T18:44:08Z;Market tumult shows cracks in the armour;Participants urge more co-ordination of protections across asset classes;Wild trading on Wall Street has been testing structures put in place to protect investors at times of market stress — with mixed results.Unlike the ‘flash crash’ of 2010 — when stocks suddenly plummeted in an otherwise lacklustre session — investors during last Monday’s market mayhem were responding to concerns about a weakening economy in China, against a backdrop of falling oil prices and uncertainty about interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve.Even with those forces at play, the tumult that ensued has raised eyebrows and participants are calling for scrutiny of controls in the market.“We have had low volatility for so long . . . [that] when you have a period of extreme stress, some chinks in the armour get exposed,” said Andrew Brooks, head of US equity trading at T Rowe Price. “The idea is to learn from that and make the market better. The industry, broadly speaking, has to revisit some of the rules and guidelines in place.”Securities and Exchange Commission staff will analyse last Monday’s trading to determine whether a variety of the protections put in place need to be adjusted, a person familiar with the matter said.In a sign that some of the controls helped, there were no outages or failed trades. Still, the day’s events have focused attention on so-called Rule 48 and measures that halt trading in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs).When stock prices are poised for significant moves at the open, specialists on the NYSE floor have to telegraph indicative prices to the market and adhere to certain waiting times before opening trading in shares. Rule 48, which NYSE invoked on Monday, relieves them of those requirements. It is meant to ensure a faster and more orderly open, said NYSE, which argues that the move worked.Some market participants felt that it created uncertainty about where stocks would open, and had an impact on prices. What is more, a larger than average number of shares still took longer to open.“A market that doesn’t open on time is a market that isn’t functioning properly,” said Chris Concannon, chief executive of Bats Global Markets.Market participants had to grapple with nearly 1,300 suspensions of stocks and ETFs. Indeed, Monday’s sharp swings were the first test of so-called ‘limit up, limit down’ rules implemented after the Flash Crash.Most stocks and ETFs will hit trading limits if they fall 5 or 10 per cent, but that doubles at the open.“As an industry, we should consider whether tighter ‘limit up, limit down’ bands might have been a better guardrail at the open,” said Doug Cifu, chief executive of Virtu, one of the world’s largest high-speed traders.Providers of ETFs, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have also questioned the market controls.NYSE said ‘limit up, limit down’ provided important protections on Monday and that it would consider whether the current parameters for controls were appropriate.A combination of delays, suspensions and different rules across exchanges meant that interconnected instruments with moving parts — indexes, ETFs and individual stocks — were traded and halted at different times. That made it difficult for market-makers and investors to know the right price for assets and probably contributed to volatility, market participants said.In addition to activity in the cash market, e-mini S&P 500 futures contracts were halted at one stage early on Monday. The CME also sets limits on the contracts — trading continued, but declines were limited to 7 per cent.A market that doesn’t open on time is a market that isn’t functioning properly“When you are making markets on [the SPDR S&P 500 ETF], the number one input is the e-mini S&P future and the number two is the constituents,” said David Lauer, president of Kor Group, a market structure consultancy. “When, suddenly, futures offer no price input and some underlying stocks hit [limit up, limit down] and others are delayed on the open, you can imagine how hard it is for market-makers to make markets.”Prices of widely used ETFs, such as State Street’s SPDR, widened from the S&P 500 which they track, while less liquid products such as Guggenheim’s S&P Equal Weight ETF traded for only three minutes in the first hour of trading.This confusion rekindled calls for more co-ordination of rules across asset classes. “Why would you allow an ETF to trade when the constituents that make up the ETF have not opened?” said Mr Brooks.“We need to take a good look at situations where you can have that misalignment. It is not good for investor confidence and not good for what these products were designed to do.”
196;STT;State Street Corp;2015-08-28T15:47:19Z;ETF providers question US trading limit rules;Pricing problems linked to post-flash crash regulations;Providers of exchange traded funds reeling from the market turmoil this week are calling for a reassessment of stock market risk controls, which they say prevented accurate pricing of ETFs.The S&P 500 had a string of volatile trading days this week, with investors and analysts pointing to events in China as a driving force. On Monday several individual stocks took longer than usual to open even though the New York Stock Exchange invoked rule 48. This allows it to override delays imposed if a stock is likely to open at a price significantly different from where it stopped trading the previous day.Stocks repeatedly hit trading limits, where the price moved so dramatically in such a short period that trading was halted. ETF providers say this prevented people from being able to price ETFs adequately based on the underlying stocks, leading to significant divergences in the performance of the S&P 500 index and ETFs that purport to track it. Guggenheim’s S&P Equal Weight ETF traded for less than three minutes in the first hour after markets opened.“The wide dislocation at the open of US equity markets . . . had a ripple effect in the pricing and trading of ETFs,” said Melissa Garville at BlackRock, which runs the iShares group of ETFs.“We are concerned about the impact of this dislocation on our clients, and are working with a broad set of market participants to identify the causes of, and remedies for, the underlying market structure issues that may have caused these dislocations to occur.”There were 1,278 trading pauses on Monday related to volatile price movements, with almost 500 related to ETFs, which trade like shares, and 200 subsequent pauses on ETFs already affected.Market-wide rules that allow the trading of stocks and ETFs to be halted were introduced in reaction to the 2010 flash crash, where stock markets plunged and rebounded over the course of little more than 30 minutes.For most stocks the limit triggering a trading pause is a 5 or 10 per cent divergence from the average price of a security for the preceding five minutes, depending on the price of the stock. The limit doubles for the opening 15 minutes and closing 25 minutes.The big ETF providers, including BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street and Guggenheim, have called for a reassessment of the rules. Proposals are still being gathered but one area of consideration is the wider price move limit in the opening minutes.“If something dropped a lot in the first 15 minutes then it may take a long time to get it back to some sort of fair value after that, because of the reduced percentage bands,” said Joel Dickson, investment strategist at Vanguard.“It’s something we are really looking at and we have spoken with exchanges,” said Tim Coyne, head of equity ETFs at State Street.NYSE said it was assessing the situation to see if changes were required.Weekly outflows for US equity ETFs were $4.4bn to August 26, despite inflows of $5.4bn on Wednesday, according to data from EPFR Global.
197;STT;State Street Corp;2015-08-26T22:52:12Z;Funds scramble to assess computer glitch;Software problem at BNY Mellon may have led to inaccurate prices during recent market turmoil;Investment firms and regulators are scrambling to find out how many mutual funds and exchange traded funds may have reported inaccurate prices during the market turmoil of recent days, as a result of a computer glitch that affected one of the largest custodian banks.Bank of New York Mellon, whose computer systems are used to calculate the net asset values, or NAVs, of many funds, has been suffering problems since the start of the week because of a failed software upgrade by one of its suppliers.The resulting confusion could take many days to clear up, said people at several of the companies affected, and it was unclear whether investors may have ended up buying or selling funds at inaccurate prices during the high-volume trading of the past few days.One of the leading exchange-traded fund providers, Invesco PowerShares, warned on Wednesday that its family of funds may not be able to disseminate accurate price information as a result of problems at BNY Mellon. Trading is currently based on the prior day’s NAV, Invesco said.Other firms to have been affected include Prudential Financial, Federated Investors and Guggenheim Partners, said people familiar with the firms or public statements.One firm, First Trust Advisors, said it had published inaccurate NAV figures for its ETFs which it now knew to be off by more than 1 per cent.Some big fund complexes have not been affected, however, including Fidelity, which calculates its own NAVs, and State Street Global Advisors, which is owned by BNY Mellon’s rival custodian bank State Street and uses its services.Problems began on Monday as a result of a failed software upgrade by SunGard, which BNY Mellon uses as an outside supplier. The glitch was unrelated to the dramatic market moves of early Monday morning. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which was already monitoring markets for signs of trouble at ETFs, has been working with BNY Mellon and fund companies since the issue came to light.With SunGard out of action, BNY had to rely on alternative means of calculating NAVs, and is now going back and calculating the official figures. For the most simple ETFs and other funds, there are not likely to be major discrepancies, market players said, but in more complex funds, it is possible prices were inaccurate.It was not immediately clear how investors might be compensated if any traded on inaccurate information.BNY Mellon said the system was returning to normal. “The SunGard system became available, in a limited capacity, late in the day on Tuesday,” it said. “We are working with SunGard to resume normal processing as soon as possible.”

At the same time debt issuance has soared in recent years as companies and governments have taken advantage of years of low interest rates to sell debt.While some have launched new bond trading platforms, banks and asset managers have also been backing an industry utility called Neptune, an open source network based on standards from the FIX Trading Community, a London-based body.Trading has been hindered by a lack of industry standardisation and the project is an attempt to link trading venues with differing computer languages, or protocols, to share information between dealers and asset managers. Without it, asset managers have to receive details of inventory by email and can receive up to 30,000 a day.“The future view of Neptune is to look at areas where the industry can commoditise and standardise but our core focus is to get it live and get other asset classes on it,” said Sassan Danesh, partner at London-based Etrading.Other banks and asset managers behind the project include BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, Aviva Investors, Axa IM, Nordea Investment Management and Standard Life Investments.
199;STT;State Street Corp;2015-08-02T01:02:26Z;Twice as many female investors at pension funds as asset managers;Females occupy nearly a fifth of senior roles at large investors;Pension funds and other big institutional investors employ more than twice as many women in senior investment roles than asset management companies, reviving fears of an “old boys club” culture in the fund industry.Women occupy nearly a fifth (19 per cent) of senior investment roles at large investors such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and endowments, according to research by State Street, the financial services company.By contrast, women hold just 7 per cent of senior investment positions at asset management companies.A financial services recruiter, who asked to remain anonymous, said fund companies might be lagging behind other investment organisations in terms of gender diversity as “asset management can be a bit of an old boys’ network”.Mimmi Kheddache-Jendeby, senior analyst at State Street’s Center for Applied Research, added that fund companies tend to display “unproductive ideas about how women act, which lead [them] to prefer hiring men in these positions”.Men are stereotyped as taking more risks and having winner instincts and higher stress resistance, she said, whereas “female managers are stereotyped as less skilled”.She added that asset owners “are pushing for more diversity when they hire external managers [and so] they are also taking [gender diversity] into account within their own organisations”.State Street plans to use the findings — which were based on feedback from 864 investment professionals across 19 countries — to improve its own hiring and human resources policies. Nearly half (48 per cent) of its staff in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are women, but less than a fifth of senior employees in those regions are female.19%Percentage of women in senior roles at large investorsKaren Shackleton, an investment adviser to three pension funds and a former portfolio manager, said government pension funds and endowments are likely to have a more tolerant approach towards flexible working. “At asset managers that does not lend itself quite as easily,” she said.Ms Shackleton added that asset management companies “evolved from the days of the City, which was a very male-dominated space, whereas foundations and [pension funds] were not born out of that”.“I certainly think some asset management firms are quite challenging places to work as a woman and some firms are more enlightened than others. Culture is a difficult thing to change.”7%Percentage of women in senior roles at fund managersThe findings will intensify pressure on the fund industry to improve the gender balance of their investment teams.Earlier this year, FTfm published research showing the number of female portfolio managers in the US has fallen every year for the past six years, despite continued efforts to try and bring more women into frontline asset management.As a result of the low levels of women in senior investment roles, fund companies are losing out from a business perspective, said Ms Kheddache-Jendeby, who used to work as a portfolio manager at AP2, the Swedish state pension fund.She said: “The investment management industry tends to overlook the resource of diversity. The industry clearly has some way to go.”
200;STT;State Street Corp;2015-07-07T16:07:26Z;Global fund industry manages record $74tn;Assets under management soar, with profits matching $102bn historic 2007 peak;The global asset management industry grew to a record size last year as equity and bond values rose sharply, helped by hopes of economic recovery and central bank interventions in the markets.Assets under management increased to $74tn, the highest figure recorded by the Boston Consulting Group’s annual survey.Profits for asset managers also rose to $102bn, matching the historic peak in 2007.However, net revenue growth fell short of the rise in assets under management as pressure on fees squeezed prices and investors continued to shift traditional actively managed products to lower-cost tracker funds.“Professional asset management ranks among the world’s most profitable businesses, and it’s a growing one for managers that get it right,” BCG says in its 13th annual report on the industry.The growth in assets under management and profits comes at a time when some fund managers are starting to move into businesses traditionally dominated by banks, such as direct lending. That shift has attracted increased scrutiny, as global regulators are debating whether some of the largest industry players should be designated “systemically important financial institutions”.The BCG report found that much of the increase in the industry’s profit pool to $102bn was largely driven by fees on assets that grew along with rising global markets, rather than because managers were attracting new assets. Net new assets remained unchanged in 2014 compared with the previous year.The BCG report comes only a few weeks after McKinsey, another consultancy, warned that the industry’s cost base had shot up 44 per cent since 2007 and many managers were ill prepared for another economic downturnThe winner-take-all trend of recent years — in which the biggest mutual fund managers capture a large share of net new asset flows — accelerated in the US in 2014.The top 10 US managers, which included Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors, captured 68 per cent of all flows from players with positive flows in 2014 compared with 53 per cent in 2013.Many of these new assets came from investors seeking passive products such as exchange traded funds, products that are dominated by a few fund managers, such as Vanguard.BCG warned that asset managers face a challenging and uncertain environment, despite the record level of asset growth and profits, particularly regarding regulation and market liquidity.Asset managers face a challenging and uncertain environment, despite the record level of asset growth and profits, particularly regarding regulation and market liquidity, BCG warnsIn the US, it said that regulation is driving profound change with the US Securities and Exchange Commission announcing new reporting initiatives that will strengthen oversight of the industry.As a first step, the watchdog is collecting much more data, requiring mutual fund firms to provide more detailed information and to report with greater frequency about fund assets.The report also highlighted liquidity concerns about some investment products.In corporate debt, for example, fund management groups hold much more than the banks, a significant reversal of past trends. Post financial crisis regulation has made it much more expensive for banks to hold such assets, on their balance sheets and limited their ability to trade on their own accounts.The BCG report warned that asset managers may find it more difficult to liquidate their positions because banks will not be as willing to serve as market makers. As a result, asset managers must get better at pricing assets so that they do not become forced sellers.

202;STT;State Street Corp;2015-06-19T12:46:22Z;Greece worries cast a cloud over bond funds’ summer;US rates and a Chinese asset bubble also prompt managers to prepare for the worst;During the credit crisis of 2007-2008, the flagship loan funds of asset manager Eaton Vance were inundated with redemption requests from panicking clients. On occasions, up to 40 per cent of the funds’ investors wanted their money back at the same time — sums amounting to billions of dollars.Chris Remington, a fund manager with the group, had never seen anything like it and said he hoped it never happened again. But this summer fund groups are once more preparing for the worst, as the Greek debt crisis reaches a climax, worries about US interest rates increase and the Chinese asset bubble looks like it might burst.This week Aberdeen Asset Management — Europe’s biggest independent fund manager — admitted it had taken on $500m in credit lines to help meet redemptions in the event of a sell-off in the bond markets. Martin Gilbert, chief executive, said the decision had been taken in case reaction to a Greek exit from the euro, or a rise in US interest rates, “gets ugly”.Other fund groups have also set up new credit lines, or shored up existing facilities, in the past year as a precaution against short-term funding gaps that might arise if investors all try to sell up at once. After years of heavy inflows to corporate bonds, some fear a bubble in the market. Since the start of 2008 a record $22tn in investment grade and high yield bonds has been issued globally, according to Thomson Reuters.BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager, Vanguard, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Guggenheim Partners and Eaton Vance have all made borrowing agreements with the big banks in the past 18 months.State Street — one of the world’s biggest custodian banks, specialising in safeguarding financial assets — says it has noticed an uptick in demand for credit lines from fund managers generally.Concerns about meeting redemptions have grown as the summer slowdown approaches: a time when trading volumes are typically lower as people go on holiday. Already, investors warn of an alarming lack of liquidity, or ability to trade easily, in the corporate bond market. Even traditionally high-volume government bond markets, such as that for German Bunds, are suffering a liquidity drought, according to some investors.John Roe, head of multi-asset funds at Legal & General Investment Management, says: “The lower liquidity in the summer always causes more nervousness because, if an issue flares up, there is less depth in the markets to cope.“It is a particularly big issue for bonds because bond liquidity has never recovered from the financial crisis. The reason for that is that the banks are no longer there in the market. They no longer have inventories of bonds because of capital rules and regulatory requirements.”BlackRock doubled the size of its credit facility to $2.1bn in December, partly over fears that US rate rises might cause market volatility to spike, and trigger fund outflows. It also needed to increase the facility to reflect a rise in its assets under management, after investors with its troubled rival Pimco moved their money to BlackRock bond funds.Similarly, Eaton Vance doubled the borrowing limit on a credit line for three of its loan funds to $1.4bn last year, although it is likely to be adjusted to reflect a lower level of assets under management.Vanguard, the world’s biggest manager of mutual funds, even obtained a “committed line of credit” for the first time, to ensure its “liquidity process is robust”. This $2.89bn credit line covers all of Vanguard’s US, UK and Irish domiciled mutual funds and exchange traded funds. Previously, the group had relied on “informal credit lines” but never used them.Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Guggenheim Partners are among other large asset managers to extend their credit lines following increases to their assets under management.However, some investors are critical of the use of credit lines, arguing that a need for emergency borrowing facilities indicates that some bond funds have grown too large.Investors buying funds that hold corporate bonds risk losing a significant amount of capital if interest rates rise and will find it hard to sell out if market sentiment plunges, the City watchdog has warned.Continue readingAdrian Hull, fixed income specialist at UK group Kames Capital, which does not use credit lines, says: “If you need an extra gate of cash, there is a presupposition that your funds are too big for the liquidity in the market. We have a responsibility to investors not to manage a fund which is above and beyond the liquidity that the market allows.“The fund manager of an investment grade bond fund . . . should not be offering a buffer between that and reality. Clearly, there are some funds that are too big to implement their mandate in the way that they are meant to.”Some bond funds instead impose a charge on investors who want to sell up when liquidity is poor. This so-called “dilution levy” is designed to compensate the fund for the cost of selling in a falling market, protecting investors who stay put and deterring further panic sales.Other groups close their funds to redemptions when the amount of selling rises to a certain level, typically 20 per cent of the assets in the fund.But some managers remain confident they can weather any potential storms. “The market has been tested in 2008, 2011 and 2014 and we did not miss a redemption,” notes Eaton Vance’s Mr Remington.
203;STT;State Street Corp;2015-06-08T17:49:43Z;Smart beta offers promise as Chinese markets open up;Portfolios tilted towards value, yield and low volatility outerperform country’s indices;"Index heavyweight MSCI will announce on Tuesday whether it will open up its flagship emerging market benchmark to China’s $9tn onshore A-shares market, a decision that could usher in an avalanche of foreign money.But whatever MSCI’s immediate decision, the direction of travel is clear; the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets — two of the few worldwide to still be dominated by domestic investors — will become more international.Beijing is steadily opening the door to outsiders by granting foreign institutions ever larger quotas, while its Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect programme has opened another conduit for overseas money.Last week’s decision by Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, to include A shares in its flagship emerging markets exchange traded fund, may prove a watershed.But exactly how should one invest in a market as esoteric and seemingly unfathomable as that of A shares?In the rest of the world, it has long been noted that investors can, over the cycle, outperform markets by skewing their portfolios towards certain risk factors.Smaller companies, cheap “value” stocks and high-yielding equities all have a tendency to deliver outsized returns. Investors can also, more often than not, beat the index by favouring stocks that already exhibit strong upwards momentum or low volatility.These insights have spawned a new segment of the global investment industry — dubbed “smart beta” — one that Mark Makepeace, chief executive of FTSE Group, believes will ultimately come to account for 35 cents of every dollar invested worldwide.But do these factors apply in a market that is 90 per cent-owned by domestic retail investors, where turnover is so high the average holding period is just two months, and where investors see nothing odd in stocks surging in value simply because they have switched between market sectors and an entire market (step forward the Shenzhen Composite) trades on a multiple of 62.7 times earnings?In an age of ever-creeping global uniformity, the A-share market’s idiosyncrasy is clear from the fact that its movements are completely uncorrelated with those of global bourses and even, in essence, with those of other emerging markets (see chart).Nevertheless, research by State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-largest fund house, suggests many of the behavioural biases found elsewhere in the world are also present in Shanghai and Shenzhen.Strongest of all is the value effect, according to number crunching by Sunny Ng, head of SSGA’s Asia ex-Japan portfolio strategists, and colleagues George Hoguet and Christopher Cheung.Using data from the start of 2002 to the end of 2013, they found that the quintile of stocks with the lowest price-to-book ratio beat the wider A-shares market by 83 basis points a month (equivalent to more than 10 percentage points a year), almost double the 44bp found in the US market in a 2012 study by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, the creators of the Fama-French three-factor model of market behaviour.This trend for value Chinese stocks to generate outsize returns was found to be statistically significant, while the highest price-to-book stocks have underperformed the broader market, at least since 2010 (see chart).Yield, or the tendency for the highest dividend-paying stocks to outperform, also appears to work in the Chinese market. The highest-yielding fifth of stocks beat the MSCI China A market by 55bp a month between 2002 and 2013, the SSGA team found, another finding that was statistically significant.Likewise, the tendency for the least volatile stocks to outperform also appears to translate to China; the equities with the lowest volatility over the previous five years went on to outperform the market by 47bp a month, on average.Mr Ng confessed to being “surprised” by the finding, given that the “frenzied turnover” on the mainland market might be expected to “overwhelm” the volatility premia.The SSGA team concluded that two other widely observed phenomena — the tendency for small companies to outperform and for those stocks with the strongest upward momentum to continue rising for the following period — do not appear to work in China.However, in both cases, the team found a degree of outperformance, but concluded it was not statistically significant, with the momentum effect potentially undermined by the unusually high turnover.Nevertheless, Mr Ng concludes that factor-based investing “may be attractive” in mainland China, especially strategies tilted to yield and value.And, of course, if these strategies work now, it is logical to assume they will work better still as China continues to open up and, over time, the ownership of its domestic stock markets comes to look more like that in the rest of the world.Factory-based investing has made fortunes for some in China. As the country moves up the wage scale and conforms more to global norms, factor-based investing may be the way to go in future."

205;STT;State Street Corp;2015-05-03T01:42:02Z;UK equity markets fear the general election blues;UK equity markets fear correction cause by political uncertainty;Investors are being warned that UK asset prices are vulnerable to a market correction in the run-up to the general election on Thursday.The FTSE 100 index of leading shares hit a record in April but all 30 senior UK financial executives polled by State Street Global Advisors, the fund house, said they feared disappointing corporate earnings could cause an equity market downturn.Robin Geffen, founder and chief executive of Neptune, the £4.8bn investment manager, has warned repeatedly about the risks facing UK investors.Neptune has avoided UK equities in the run-up to the election and some other investors have followed its lead.“One simply cannot rule out the possibility that the outcome [of the election] will result in a shift to deeply market-unfriendly policies, and, potentially, a period of political instability to boot,” said Mr Geffen.UK-domiciled funds registered net outflows of just under £5.5bn in the first three months of 2015, according to the Investment Association, the trade body for UK asset managers.Retail investors pulled just under £1bn from UK equity funds in March, a monthly record, taking net withdrawals to just over £2bn in the first quarter.Niall O’Leary, head of portfolio institutions at State Street, said there was no doubt that the outcome of the election was “a concern” but added this was “not new news”.Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, has forecast that the FTSE 100 will end 2015 at 7,200 if there is a minority Labour government and at 7,400 under a minority Conservative administration.Analysts at Capital Economics have also warned that UK asset prices may jump “sharply” after the election.“Gilt yields and sterling could move sharply as there are major differences regarding the size of the fiscal squeeze that a Labour or Conservative-led government would implement, and hence the speed at which monetary policy would be tightened in the next parliament,” the consultancy said.While 100 per cent of UK respondents to the State Street survey said they fear disappointing corporate earnings may cause an imminent market downturn in the UK, only 12.5 per cent of French respondents were worried about this eventuality in France.Equally only 27 per cent of German respondents, 16 per cent of Swiss respondents and 14 per cent of Italian respondents were concerned about a market correction in their own markets.Dominic Wallington, chief investment officer and senior portfolio manager at RBC Global Asset Management, said: “In a nutshell, all the parties still see the corporate sector as the best way to recovery and while they might tinker, they are unlikely to try to fundamentally change the way the sector is run.”
206;STT;State Street Corp;2015-04-30T16:16:17Z;Healthy liquidity diet needed to survive future financial shocks;If US rates suddenly jump uprise, retail investors might flood out of bond funds;"What are the big risks to the stability of western financial markets today? This week I posed that question to powerful finance industry professionals at the Milken Institute global conference in Los Angeles.Grexit was mentioned. So was a slowdown in China, Middle East instability and the looming US interest rate rise (although, when asked when the Federal Reserve would start raising rates, more than half of the audience thought it would not happen until 2016).But there was another, more esoteric concern on almost everybody’s lips: liquidity mismatches deep in the bond markets. Seven long years after the 2008 crisis, reforms to the financial system have produced some success, in the sense that regulated banks have reduced their risks. But they have not just moved out of some of the crazier arenas, such as ultra-complex derivatives, in which they operated before 2008; they have left more mainstream areas, too. The inventories of US corporate bonds held by broker-dealer banks have plunged from $300bn in 2008 to $50bn, according to research from CQS.This is a classic unintended consequence. It has reduced the ability of banks to act as market makers, standing ready to buy or sell when investors want to trade, leaving it harder for others to do so. So while the stock of outstanding US high-grade corporate bond has risen since 2008, from $2,800bn to $5,000bn, the level of market turnover has tumbled to “at or close to the lowest levels on record”, Barclays says.What makes this pattern particularly pernicious — and worrying to those Milken guests — is that while banks have cut their inventories of bonds, asset managers have recently been gobbling them up on a formidable scale in a search for yields. It is estimated that in the past year more than 70 per cent of corporate credit was purchased by investors such as mutual funds, a dramatically higher figure than before.In theory, this could deliver benefits for the wider financial system; after all, if non-bank actors buy corporate credit, that diversifies risks. But the catch is that many asset managers rely on potentially flighty forms of funding. Mutual funds, for example, typically have to return investor funds on demand (in the jargon they operate with “daily liquidity”). And that creates liquidity mismatch: if US rates suddenly rise, retail investors might flood out of bond funds— since they fear the move will trigger sharp bond price falls — forcing those funds to sell. If that happens, those funds might discover the bonds are completely illiquid, or untradeable except at rock bottom prices, like those subprime assets back in 2008).Is there any way to mitigate this risk? Regulators show little willingness to roll back regulatory reforms. Nor are they keen to use public money to keep markets moving (although some central bank governors privately admit that, if a really big crisis were to hit, central banks could eventually be forced to make markets themselves).The key is to watch what the rest of the private sector might, or might not, do as banks retreat. There are plenty of actors still flush with liquidity: as Josh Harris, co-founder of Apollo Global Management, points out, private equity funds have big untapped resources and might buy bonds if the prices fell.There are also signs that entrepreneurs are moving in to fill the void. “Creative destruction as banks are forced to evolve opens up enormous opportunity [for others],” argues Bill Blain of Mint Partners, a small London broker. Most notably, new trading platforms are springing up to provide alternatives to the banks, including one run by Mint.Meanwhile, some banks are turning entrepreneurial. Last month State Street unveiled a service to enable its asset manager clients to assess their vulnerabilities and liquidity needs and help them withstand any future shock. The custodian bank knows asset managers face growing pressure from regulators to strengthen their buffers — and wants to jump into a new business niche.Although these entrepreneurial responses are encouraging, it is unclear whether they will be enough to avoid future jolts, given the sheer scale of the structural mismatches.Thankfully, nobody expects the test to come quite yet. And if a Fed rate rise is delayed until 2016 asset managers will have more time to prepare — and more entrepreneurs will jump in. Or so the hope goes. But, if nothing else, the pattern is a potent reminder that the problem of liquidity and maturity mismatches did not disappear with the 2008 crisis. Nor did the potential for some investors to keep ignoring them until it is too late.gillian.tett@ft.comLetter in response to this column:Bondmarkets: we’ve been here before, in 1994 / From George S Hatjoullis"
207;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Bond liquidity fears hit asset managers;State Street’s Hooley says cash is being hoarded because of stress tests;Fears over poor liquidity in the bond market are leading asset managers to hoard more cash than they need, according to the head of one of the largest US custodian banks.Jay Hooley, chief executive of State Street, said asset managers were under pressure from regulators to “ stress test” their portfolios against a bond market rout, and managers were building up excess deposits with the bank as a result.State Street’s excess deposits rose to $54bn in the first quarter, from $52bn in the final months of 2014, even though the bank tried to discourage their growth, including by introducing fees on some deposits.The bank earns little on such deposits, which have been dragging down its results as they have swelled over the past year.“The irony is that an asset manager’s excess liquidity ends up being our excess deposits,” Mr Hooley said.Regulatory demands for stress testing of bond funds is an “appropriate” response to the fears of a market crunch, should interest rate rises cause a rush out of the bond market, Mr Hooley said.But State Street — which itself also owns one of the world’s largest asset managers — is urging managers to minimise their cash holdings by optimising liquidity across different portfolios.“It is early days and the stress testing process is maturing,” Mr Hooley said. “The more sophisticated the process, the more refined the outcomes.”It is early days and the stress testing process is maturing. The more sophisticated the process, the more refined the outcomesWhile low interest rates continued to be a headwind, pushing down State Street’s net interest revenues by 1.3 per cent to $546m in the first quarter, a spike in foreign exchange market volatility helped the bank beat analysts’ earnings forecasts.It reported a 5.9 per cent rise in net income to $377m, on quarterly revenues of $2.6bn, up 4.8 per cent, but the bank left full-year guidance unchanged and its shares reversed three days of gains and were down 2.34 per cent at $76.36 by the close.A surge in the value of the US dollar against the euro, and the sudden end to Swiss central bank intervention to hold down the franc, boosted foreign exchange trading in the first part of the year.Mr Hooley said volatility was set to continue, albeit at a more modest level, because of “the divergence in interest rate expectations for the US relative to most other major economies and the actions taken by several central banks around the world to increase their quantitative easing.”
208;STT;State Street Corp;2015-04-12T01:23:41Z;Ronald O’Hanley set for ‘more difficult job’ at State Street Global Advisors;Incoming chief executive faces an ETF price war with rivals and low profitability at the fund house;Big challenges await Ronald O’Hanley as the incoming chief executive of State Street Global Advisors, the $2.45tn asset management arm of State Street.Mr O’Hanley, a former head of asset management at Fidelity Investments, is set to succeed Scott Powers, who is retiring later this year after leading SSgA since 2008.He will take over with SSgA facing tough competition from larger rivals (such as BlackRock and Vanguard) that have invested more aggressively in their exchange traded funds businesses, as well as from banks that are aiming to expand their asset management operations.Dick Bove, an analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets in New York, says Mr O’Hanley will face “a more difficult job” than his predecessors.“Every major bank operating in North America, including the Canadians and the Swiss, is charging into asset management and wealth management. Competitive pressures are far greater than before,” says Mr Bove.He notes that asset managers are being forced to change their pricing for large clients, which are demanding lower charges, so revenue streams are likely to be under more pressure.SSgA played a vital role in the early years of the ETF industry, launching the first such US vehicle in 1993. It was the world’s largest ETF manager until 2003 when it was overtaken by iShares, then owned by Barclays Global Investors.This January, SSgA surrendered its second-spot ranking (in terms of assets under management) to Vanguard, which has cut its fees repeatedly and enhanced its reputation as a low-cost provider among the retail investors and financial advisers who have been turning to ETFs in growing numbers.“SSgA was the first mover into ETFs, which provided a competitive advantage. But this position was easy for rivals to attack as its ETF range was straightforward to replicate and vulnerable to price competition,” says Brennan Hawken, an analyst at UBS in New York.SSgA’s ETF assets stood at $457.4bn at the end of March. But asset growth in recent years has been handicapped by substantial redemptions from the SPDR Gold Trust (at one time the world’s second-largest ETF) and the large fall in the gold price since its peak in 2011.The position of SSgA’s most famous product, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, as the world’s largest such fund was threatened by competing products from BlackRock and Vanguard.For several years, ETF providers on both sides of the Atlantic have been engaged in a price war, using fee cuts to win investor loyalty. SSgA has only joined this fight belatedly. Fee cuts for 41 listed US ETFs were announced in February following reductions in charges in its European range in 2014.BlackRock and Vanguard, which moved earlier to reduce fees, have attracted higher annual inflows into their ETF operations than SSgA since 2010.Observers say there are issues beyond ETF price competition for Mr O’Hanley to address.Luke Montgomery, an analyst at Bernstein Research, says: “Despite being a pioneer in the ETF business, historically SSgA has underinvested in its ETF platform.”Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI, a consultancy, says SSgA has fewer dedicated ETF staff outside the US than its main competitors.“If they had more dedicated people selling ETFs, then they would be able to compete more effectively,” says Ms Fuhr, emphasising that SSgA is a global provider, unlike some of the other US-based managers.“But the question [for Mr O’Hanley] is what is the right organisational structure, product strategy [and] staffing levels to maximise ETF sales in different regions,” says Ms Fuhr.Although its SPDR brand is recognised among ETF investors worldwide, Ms Fuhr says SSgA has lacked a focus in Asia, where its team is relatively small. It has also neglected to build a presence in Latin America, where there are numerous regulatory changes benefiting ETFs that it should be able to take advantage of.Mr Hawken says SSgA’s ETF operations have scale, but it needs to be more innovative.“A key challenge is to come up with more innovative products that are more resistant to fee compression,” he says, applauding the launch in February of an actively managed bond ETF that resulted from a new partnership between SSgA and Doubleline Capital, a US hedge fund manager. Mr O’Hanley has already said that developing more fixed income ETFs will be a priority.Another challenge will be to improve SSgA’s profitability. Mr Montgomery says this has been “lower and more volatile” than that of its peers even though profit margins for institutional indexing and ETFs can be among the highest in the asset management industry, approaching 70 per cent or more for large-scale providers.There is no simple explanation for SSgA’s low profitability as it is unclear how operating costs are allocated between State’s Street’s main custody business and the asset management operations, says Mr Montgomery.However, SSgA is among the few large fund companies that manage most of their client assets in index-based or cash strategies. Many of these index-based strategies are highly commoditised and easily replicated, which means competition on pricing is one of the few ways to distinguish itself from rivals.It is unclear whether SSgA’s massive scale in these strategies will be enough to offset these commodity pricing pressures and generate a competitive operating margin, says Mr Montgomery.Mr Bove echoes these comments, saying that SSgA should “strive for more scale” while aiming to reduce its operating costs, a challenge given that personnel costs are likely to rise.In 2011, Trian, the hedge fund house led by Nelson Peltz, published a white paper calling for a reorganisation and restructuring of State Street that included a sale of SSgA.Trian’s intervention pushed State Street into making substantial cost savings and staffing reductions with almost 2,900 jobs lost.Observers say it is unclear whether Trian’s objective was to force State Street to sell SSgA or simply to drive an improvement in profit margins and a re-rating of the Boston-based bank’s share price.Mr Bove says he believes that it is unlikely that the question of State Street selling SSgA will resurface as there are valuable synergies between its asset servicing and asset management operations.“The costs of running both [the asset servicing and asset management] businesses would rise in the event of the sale of SSgA so I think it is not a realistic option,” said Mr Bove.Mr Montgomery echoes this view. “Could another player do a better job of running SSgA? I’m not convinced,” he says.
209;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

211;STT;State Street Corp;2015-03-16T06:43:56Z;Passive funds’ rise heightens fear of shock to system;Trackers gain as investors ditch active managers;In the past two years, the growth of passive investment funds, which track the markets and charge cheap fees, has been one of the main stories in the world of asset management.Last year Vanguard, one of the world’s biggest providers of passive investments with $2tn in trackers and more than $450bn in global exchange traded funds, was the most popular mutual fund management group globally. It had more net inflows, a fifth of all new business, than more than 3,000 groups tracked by data provider Morningstar.There is no big secret to the group’s success. As Tim Buckley, chief investment officer of Vanguard, says: “We charge low fees and offer value for money. Active managers charge much higher fees and often still struggle to outperform our passive funds.”The US mutual group levies an average expense ratio on its funds in the US of 0.19 per cent and 0.23 per cent in Europe. That compares with a typical expense ratio on an actively managed fund of 0.75 per cent before trading costs.Yet, despite what seems a success story for Vanguard and other big passive providers such as BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors, which were also popular with investors and attracted big inflows last year, there are question marks over the systemic risks they might pose to the system.In short, as they track the markets, they create a herding or momentum effect, which can exaggerate rises or falls in the stocks, bonds or commodities that they track. If the entire market has to move in one direction because investors are trading passively, then the obvious problem is not knowing who is on the other side of the trade. Who will do the buying when the passive funds are selling and who will do the selling when the passive funds are buying?Vanguard and BlackRock alone have more than $7tn in assets under management, of which a large chunk is in passive products. This means that a vast amount of money is going one way in response to economic announcements, external shocks or political decisions that are considered important for investors.But passive investment may not yet big enough to create the systemic risks some might fear.In the US, where Vanguard launched the first index tracker in the 1970s, passive investment accounts for 30 per cent of the market. Active investment, where managers select stocks that they think will beat the market, accounts for 70 per cent. In Europe, the ratio is 90 per cent active management and only 10 per cent passive.Passive is likely to make more inroads into active management in the UK and continental Europe, but it is thought unlikely to steal much more than 30 per cent of market share in the US. Active managers are likely to dominate the investment universe, at least for the foreseeable future, say investors.Stephanie Flanders, chief market strategist for UK and Europe at JPMorgan Asset Management, says: “The move towards passive is entirely understandable as clients were not getting what they paid for with some active fund managers. Passive investment is likely to grow in Europe. Active managers have to make the case more rigorously for what they are charging.”But she thinks active management still offers the best option for many investors. JPMorgan Asset Management, an active house, was the third most popular mutual fund manager globally last year behind Vanguard and BlackRock — proof that clients are still prepared to pay extra for an active manager they think can provide alpha, or beat the market. Goldman Sachs Asset Management, another active manager, was the fourth most popular mutual fund manager.Active managers have to make the case rigorously for what they are chargingMichael Dobson, chief executive of Schroders, the active UK listed group, says: “Passive investment has a place, but we have shown that we can attract and retain clients on the basis of our strong products and strong performance.“You cannot beat the market every year, but if you can show that incrementally you can outperform, then clients will choose active managers. That means over a long period you need to produce better returns, which we have shown we can do.”Last year, Schroders won £24.8bn in new business and 78 per cent of its assets under management outperformed over three years. Other active European houses such as Henderson Global Investors had a good 2014, too.Schroders particularly has shown that an active management business can beat all competition with the right fund managers, executives, brand and distribution network. It has just declared record pre-tax profits for 2014.A strong case exists, therefore, for buying both passive and active investments. As long as active management continues to dominate, that should damp fears that passive managers might become a systemic risk.

It was also hit by the sudden departure of co-founder Bill Gross, who quit in September to take up a role at Janus Capital.Vanguard enjoyed $291bn in new business last year, a fifth of the industry’s net inflows, while Pimco suffered outflows of $175bn, by far the worst performance.Vanguard’s popularity and Pimco’s problems highlight the growing popularity of passive investment funds, which track an index and charge much lower fees than active investment funds.Vanguard has $2tn in tracker funds and $450bn in global exchange traded funds, making it one of the world’s biggest providers of these products. Pimco is an active manager, which aims to select investments that outperform the broader market.Other big providers of passive investments, BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors, also attracted billions of dollars in new business last year. BlackRock enjoyed $178bn in estimated net inflows, the second-best performer, and State Street attracted $42bn in new business, the fifth-best performer in terms of flows in the mutual fund market, which includes open-end funds, money market funds and ETFs.Tim Buckley, chief investment officer at Vanguard, said: “The success of our business is down to cutting our fees to the bone. Active fund managers find it difficult to compete with us because they charge high fees, which is why many underperform the market.”Other big active managers, Aberdeen Asset Management, Europe’s biggest independent investment group, and Fidelity saw big outflows. Aberdeen recorded the second-worst performance with outflows of $13.5bn, while Fidelity recorded the third-worst with outflows of $11.4bn.
213;STT;State Street Corp;2015-02-15T07:34:24Z;Cost cutting is behind pension insourcing trend;State Street finds most retirement schemes intend to increase in-house investment management;Insourcing has emerged as an important strategy for pension funds to reduce costs while maintaining a tight grip on risk and performance across their portfolios. In a recent State Street survey, four out of five pension funds said they intend to increase the proportion of their portfolio that is managed in-house.The savings achieved by insourcing can be substantial. Another study revealed that pension funds spent, on average, 46 basis points on external management compared with 8 basis points on internal investment capabilities. As well as cost benefits, pension funds also see insourcing as an opportunity to reduce agency risk through increased oversight. The principle is clear: if pension funds can get closer to the underlying assets, they have an opportunity to save money and get a better grip on risk and performance.Insourcing can deliver significant benefits, but most pension funds will want to use this strategy selectively. Many start by focusing on areas such as government bonds or domestic equities where they typically have extensive in-house expertise.However, pension funds’ investment portfolios are becoming increasingly complex and still need specialist support. State Street’s survey shows many pension funds are increasing their allocations to alternatives in a bid to deliver much-needed upside performance. Private equity is a priority, with 60 per cent of survey respondents saying they will increase existing allocations to this asset class. Other alternatives are also attracting more investment from pensions, including hedge funds, property and infrastructure.Funds need to be clear about where their in-house teams can add value. Most will need to retain a range of external partners to help them leverage more specialist investment strategies. Those that decide to bring some areas of asset management in-house need to plan carefully. Insourcing in today’s investment environment requires new skills and capabilities.46bpBasis points pension funds spend on external managementTalent is high on the agenda and in demand. To manage a broad range of assets in-house, pension funds will need to attract people with specialist skills. Those set on an ambitious insourcing path may need to increase headcount substantially.Insourcing demands operational expertise in areas such as risk and compliance management. Attracting talent will require pension funds to design competitive packages. For funds that set up different specialist teams, it is important to maintain consistency and transparency across employment contracts. Otherwise, a generous deal designed to attract new talent may be resented by existing employees.8bpBasis points pension funds spend on internal investment managementTechnology is another piece in the puzzle. As they insource, funds will need to build a coherent picture of risk and performance across multi-asset portfolios. This requires technology that can provide full-scale integrated risk analytics. This is difficult to achieve using traditional risk software, which is often engineered around a single asset class. It is another reason why insourcing is likely to require an overhaul of operating models and data infrastructures.As funds use a mix of in-house capability and external asset management of more specialist classes, they are looking for a new relationship with asset managers. Managers will have to be able to work as fully fledged investment partners: understanding funds’ investment goals intimately and delivering solutions tailored to their long-term objectives.As pension funds may also pursue a parallel outsourcing strategy and try to outsource critical operational functions, such as data management, to specialist partners.The ambition and degree of insourcing will be a strategic decision, more often than not resulting in a mix of internal capabilities and external partners. To make this strategy work, funds will require a new relationship with their external asset managers and smart operating solutions for their in-house plays.William Slattery is an executive vice-president of State Street Corporation and head of the Global Services business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa
214;STT;State Street Corp;2015-02-01T05:32:43Z;ETF price war continues to rage in Europe;Questions raised over how much further companies can go;ETF providers show no sign of calling a halt to the drawn-out battle over fees, with many continuing to cut prices across popular products in Europe to win over cost-conscious investors and to claw at the market share of larger rivals.Persuading providers to admit that the spate of fee cuts is driven by a desire to undercut their competitors is difficult, and there is a noticeable reluctance among the largest of them to associate fee cuts with a price war.Nevertheless, several of Europe’s biggest companies, including iShares, Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, State Street and Vanguard, continued to lower fees on some popular ETFs last year.Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, the provider of db X-trackers ETFs, fired the starting pistol in last year’s battle, when in February it lowered fees on its FTSE 100, Dax, Euro Stoxx 50 and MSCI USA funds to 9 basis points.Several months later, BlackRock’s iShares arm announced fee cuts on six of its ETFs, with total expense ratios on products reduced by between 5 and 28 basis points.Àmong the products were those offering exposure to the FTSE 100, S&P 500 and Euro Stoxx 50 indices.Hot on the heels of its rival, Vanguard unveiled fee reductions on four of its ETFs to between 7 and 25 basis points.State Street Global Advisors also unveiled fee cuts on two of its ETFs in December, following reductions earlier in the year averaging 20 per cent across 15 of its core equity and fixed income SPDR products.Tim Huver, ETF product manager at Vanguard, is among the cohort of industry executives reluctant to suggest fee cuts are being driven by industry competition.“For us, low cost is the result of our ownership structure. While many see it as a price war, it is really business as usual,” says Mr Huver.Simon Klein, head of exchange traded product distribution and institutional mandates Emea and Asia at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, is also unwilling to suggest ETF providers are waging a war over fees.He says a move by db X-trackers to lower charges across its core range of products last year was an attempt to broaden its reach.“The idea was to generate new clients and to talk to those that have historically been investing in institutional mandates or index funds,” he says. “We’ve not entered into a price war, but this is our pricing strategy to make these products more in line with some other institutional products.”While ETF providers may not be willing to admit competition is driving fee cuts, those watching closely believe a price war is very much alive.“It’s difficult to deny that there is a price war between ETF providers in Europe,” says Adam Laird, head of passive investments at Hargreaves Lansdown. “We’ve seen most major providers cutting prices on their core products and the cost for investors has fallen substantially.”Jose Garcia-Zarate, senior passive fund analyst at Morningstar, puts it simply: “It is a price war and providers are feeling the heat.“If one provider feels compelled to cut fees on core exposures, it’s because it is experiencing pressure from a competitor.”While Vanguard may view price cuts as business as usual, many ETF providers in Europe have been forced to lower fees following the arrival of the low-cost US giant.“What has driven price cuts [in Europe] is the entrance of Vanguard,” says Mr Garcia-Zarate.“Its arrival has been one of the key catalysts. It is offering bread-and-butter ETF propositions at low cost.”This battle among ETF providers is likely to continue, but some question how much lower fees can fall.Howie Li, co-head of Canvas at ETF Securities, acknowledges there may be a limit to the fee cuts — even from the largest providers.“We are already seeing 5 basis point products and no one, even though they have scale, can run an efficient business based on little or no margins,” says Mr Li.Investors, adds Mr Li, may want low-cost access to ETFs, but not at the expense of providers going out of business because fees are too low.Mr Li says: “Some ETF providers can afford to make fee cuts on their core products provided that they are able to attract investor flows through cross-selling other higher margin products in their stable.”Although ETF providers have so far dominated the price war in Europe, Mr Li hints that growing investor scrutiny around charges could lead to other entrants being dragged on to the battlefield.“Active managers in particular are facing fee pressures from clients,” says Mr Li.“If there is one common theme among investors, it is likely going to be that they are looking for cost-efficient solutions for their portfolios.”
215;STT;State Street Corp;2015-01-30T18:00:29Z;Democratising finance: How passive funds changed investing;Quicker and faster, ETFs have cut costs dramatically;"The process of bringing diversified, affordable investment products to the masses started with investment trusts, which first appeared in the UK in the 1860s and afforded “the investor of moderate means the same advantages as large capitalists”.Open-ended mutual funds followed in the 1920s, and were boosted in the 1990s by fund supermarkets which made them more popular by removing the initial charges for investing.By contrast, passive investing is a fairly recent arrival. It did not start until the 1970s, when academic research started to highlight the fact that most active fund managers do not achieve better returns after costs than the broader market.As a proportion of the UK fund management industry, passive investing is still fairly small. The Investment Association says index-tracking open-ended funds account for about 10 per cent of overall retail funds under management. According to ETFGI, a consultancy, exchange traded funds — which also track indices, but are traded on a regulated market just like equities — account for just 4.4 per cent of mutual fund assets in Europe despite explosive growth in recent years.But passives and especially ETFs are starting to have a bigger impact. Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management, which runs the dB x-trackers ETF brand, recently said it expects the European market for ETFs to grow by 15-20 per cent in 2015.A report by PwC went further, predicting that assets under management worldwide in ETFs would double by 2020, a growth rate significantly higher than for traditionally managed assets. It says all financial services companies should consider developing an ETF strategy.Some already have. Eyebrows were raised in 2009 when BlackRock, the giant US fund management group, bought the Barclays Global Investors ETF business from the UK bank.Reducing running costs has been passives’ most obvious contribution to the investment landscape.Although other factors, notably changes in how advisers and platforms are paid, have also contributed to a reduction in fees, passives group Vanguard is in no doubt that the trend towards index-tracking is forcing down costs.It says that during the five years to the end of 2013, equity funds in the lowest quartile by costs attracted 91 per cent of total fund flows, Vanguard says.According to ETFGI data, around $120bn of assets in Europe are housed in ETFs with total expense ratios of between 10 and 20 basis points (0.1-0.2 per cent). That compares to a typical TER on an actively managed fund of 75 basis points before trading costs. Over 20 ETFs available to retail investors in Europe have TERs of less than 10bp.Dan Attwood, head of proposition for retail index funds at Legal & General, says that advisers and discretionary managers moved assets into trackers after the retail distribution review, which made investment costs more transparent.This week’s quantitative easing announcement from the European Central Bank and the recent decision by the Swiss central bank to abandon the franc’s peg to the euro have thrown into relief the question of currency hedging when investing overseas.Continue readingThe credit crisis was also a big moment. Before then, ETFs were mainly the territory of active traders who held them for weeks or months, says Chris Stevenson, a vice-president at Barclays Stockbrokers. “But when the credit crisis came along, a lot of investors lost faith with [active] fund managers. They asked: I’m paying you to manage my investment, why didn’t you see all that coming?’“More recently we’ve seen investors using ETFs to buy and hold. That’s more mid- to long-term. They see value in their tracking capability and cheaper cost.”Justin Urquhart Stewart is head of corporate development at Seven Investment Management, which uses both active and passive funds in its discretionary portfolios. Passive vehicles are beginning to have an impact, he says, “and it can only go one way.”“It may not affect the larger funds too much, but if you’ve got less than £30m under management and you’re not getting the inflows you used to, then you start to lose the economies of scale. I think we could see a lot of consolidation among active funds.”The same is true in the institutional space, according to John Ralfe, who advises pension funds.“There is no doubt that we are moving from active to passive, but a lot of people are still wedded to active,” he says, pointing out that many traditional investment consultants “make money out of complexity”.Indexing saves time as well as money, he adds. “Instead of wasting time and energy discussing why the Japanese fund manager underperformed the Nikkei this quarter, trustees can concentrate on important things like asset allocation and the relationship with the sponsoring company.”Technology improves access for the masses

Closer look at how technology has transformed Africa and LatAmMr Attwood agrees. “Advisers have to do a lot less ongoing due diligence on an index fund than they would on an actively-managed fund, where a manager could leave or endure bouts of underperformance.”However, there are questions as to whether low costs and convenience alone can attract new customers to investing. Nick Hungerford, founder of Nutmeg, says that users of his online platform include more experienced investors, and fewer new ones, than he had expected.Lower running costs and simplicity, along with automation, have helped bring discretionary portfolio management within reach of investors with smaller amounts to invest. While traditional managers and private banks routinely demand £250,000 or more of investable assets, new start-ups have much lower thresholds.One is Nutmeg, which offers ETF-based managed portfolios with a minimum investment of £1,000. Another is Wealth Horizon, which offers online advice as well as portfolio management and constructs its portfolios from passive funds. Wealth Horizon has no minimum investment level.“ETFs are very transparent. They’re brilliant value and as an individual investor you can get amazing exposure to asset classes that would be very expensive through a unit trust. There’s even a forestry ETF,” says Mr Hungerford.The iShares Global Timber and Forestry ETF he refers to was launched in 2008; its charges are substantially higher than those of products that track mainstream indices, but lower than those of an actively managed timber fund.The most obvious example of this is in the commodity space. The pioneer was Gold Bullion Securities, an exchange-traded product devised by Graham Tuckwell, that tracks the price of physical gold. It was launched in Australia in 2003 and the UK in 2004.It was immediately imitated; most ETF providers now offer products tracking gold or other popular commodities. At one point during 2011, the SPDR Gold ETF had more under management than its equivalent US stock market product.ETF Securities, the company Mr Tuckwell founded, now offers over 300 exchange-traded products on assets that would once have been off limits to all but those wealthy enough to trade futures directly.“Every time there’s an asset class that we want to use but can’t get hold of, someone builds an ETF that covers it,” Mr Hungerford adds.Active managers acknowledge that the growth of passive is forcing the industry to change; there is greater willingness to depart radically from the benchmark in the pursuit of superior returns, even if doing so increases risk; and there is more focus on costs and value for money.But rapid growth brings its own problems. The proliferation of ETFs in particular has resulted in a great many subscale products, while the advent of short and leveraged ETFs has also caused concern. BlackRock’s Larry Fink told a conference in New York that leveraged ETFs — which magnify daily returns — “could blow up the entire industry”.Read more articles by FT Money’s columnistTerry Smith, an active fund manager (and FT Money columnist) has more fundamental concerns. “I suspect a great many people who buy an ETF think they are buying an index fund. They’re not.” ETFs, he says, are a “strange hybrid” of open- and closed-end vehicles where the price in the market and not the value of the assets determines what you are getting.ETF providers, many of whom are investment banks, can continue creating new units in a product even if there is not really enough liquidity in the underlying asset class to support it. In normal conditions this may not matter much, but in times of market stress it could cause huge problems. “We’ve seen small flashes of this, where there’s been a brief but large divergence between ETFs and the assets they track. One day you could see a big flash,” says Mr Smith.Tracking an index or asset class with limited underlying liquidity while providing two-way pricing to investors often requires some use of derivatives. These generate the index returns, while investors’ money is held in more liquid collateral such as government bonds or blue-chip shares.Critics say this is more akin to a structured product than an index tracker. It also introduces counterparty risk; the ETF’s returns depend on whomever stands behind the derivatives that generate them.However, such exotica remain at the margins of the index-tracking universe; the vast bulk of assets are invested in plain-vanilla products that track mainstream equity indices by owning the underlying shares in those indices; Mr Stevenson says that FTSE 100 trackers are by far the most popular products on the Barclays platform.Index-tracking products already account for a third of institutional assets under management, accord to L&G’s Mr Attwood. “We think that in retail, they could reach 20 per cent by 2020.”No one is more closely associated with the rise of passive investing, and with a determination to cut the costs, complexity and risks of investing, than John “Jack” Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, writes Stephen Foley in New York.The company does not yet distribute directly to investors in Europe, where it ranks seventh by ETF assets under management. But in the US it is a titan, bringing in more money in 2014 than any group in the industry’s history and taking assets past $3tn, two-thirds of which is in index funds and ETFs. The biggest mutual fund in the world is the $383bn Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund, which tracks US equities.Vanguard is unusual in several respects. Its headquarters is away from the noise of Wall Street, in rural Pennsylvania on a campus that reflects the 85-year-old Mr Bogle’s obsession with maritime history (the canteen is called the galley).It is also owned by its funds, so fees are charged at cost and are often lower than other managers can match. Vanguard is built on the insight that manager fees and the costs of churning the portfolio seriously dent fund performance.The academic literature has also become much clearer over Vanguard’s 40-year existence that active managers underperform the market, on average, after fees and trading costs.The gospel according to Bogle is the same now as it was in 1975. Even the successful active managers who do deliver might not be all that good for their investors, he says.“Inevitably, investors’ money comes in after the good years and it goes out after the bad years, so you may have a good record on paper, but investors may lose money. If you have a bird in the hand, why chase the two in the bush?”Smart beta, a hybrid form of active and passive investing, is one of the fastest growing areas in fund management and aims to combine the low costs of passive with the stock selection of active, writes David Oakley.Globally, smart beta funds have grown to $544bn in assets under management, a fivefold increase since the financial crisis in 2008, says data company Morningstar.Groups such as State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock in the US and Legal & General and Seven Investment Management in the UK have been at the forefront of developing smart beta products.Instead of tracking a standard index weighted by market capitalisation, stocks are selected on the basis of value, size, momentum, volatility or dividend yield.The expansion of the smart beta, sometimes known as “factor investing”, has been most dramatic in Europe, where it has risen from as little as €1.3bn in 2004 to €72.73bn, according to State Street Global Advisors and Morningstar.Institutions can develop their own bespoke products or use indices developed by mainstream providers — lMSCI says 42 new ETFs tracking its factor indices launched last year.Ana Harris, a portfolio strategist with State Street Global Advisors, says: “Advanced [smart] beta is the third way, which takes some of the benefits from active and some of the benefits from passive.”However, some insist that if you want active management, you should pay for it. Simon Evan-Cook, senior investment manager at Premier Asset Management, says: “Good active managers will get you the best returns and best value for money, even if their fees are higher.”"
216;STT;State Street Corp;2015-01-26T13:36:14Z;Smart beta gaining ground in battle for investment supremacy;Hybrid strategy combines active and passive management elements;The business model of active fund managers is under threat from a relatively new form of investing as customers increasingly demand lower fees and better value for their money.Smart beta, a hybrid form of active and passive management, is rapidly gaining market share, growing to $544bn in assets under management globally, a fivefold increase since the financial crisis in 2008, says data company Morningstar.US groups such as State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock and the UK’s Legal & General Investment Management and Seven Investment Management are some of the companies that have taken advantage of investor demand for the product.Although active and passive funds have a much larger share of the investor universe with assets under management that run into the trillions of dollars, their growth has been much slower in the past few years than smart beta.Smart beta strategies have, in particular, eaten into the market share of active managers, according to the data.The expansion of smart beta has been dramatic in Europe. It has risen from as little as €1.3bn in 2004 to €72.73bn, State Street Global Advisors says in a paper based on research from Morningstar.The paper highlights how the pace of growth of smart beta has accelerated sharply since 2008 as investors became disillusioned with active management and the high fees often associated with it, while at the same time realising that the market capitalisation weighting of an index, which passive funds typically track, might not offer the best returns.Justin Urquhart Stewart, who founded Seven Investment Management, said: “Every industry has its Tesco moment, when the old ways no longer work and competitors come and steal your business.“Asset management is having that moment today as more investors want funds that offer good returns but with cheaper and more competitive fees. Smart beta provides this.”Ana Harris, a portfolio strategist with State Street Global Advisors, said: “Advanced [smart] beta is the third way, which takes some of the benefits from active and some of the benefits from passive.”In short, smart beta is much cheaper than active management, while offering a bespoke or customised version of trackers or passive funds to get around the skew towards market cap, which can undermine performance.For example, Seven Investment Management use algorithms to devise smart beta funds that track stocks in an indices based on whether they are cheap or offer low volatility rather than on their size or market cap.However, some investors insist active managers are still the best option. Simon Evan-Cook, senior investment manager at Premier Asset Management, said: ”If you pick good active managers, you will get better returns and the best value for your money, even if their fees are higher. The very best active manager will over time outperform the market and passive strategies.”

218;STT;State Street Corp;2015-01-04T02:50:57Z;US equities rocket on back of record-breaking ETF year;Competition between BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard at new high;Competition between fund houses BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard reached new levels last year as record-breaking inflows into exchange traded funds helped power the US equity market to an all-time high in early December.With further gains predicted for the US equity market this year, the rivalry between the three largest providers in the ETF industry looks set to intensify.Helped by investors deserting traditional actively managed mutual funds in favour of low-cost index trackers, the US ETF industry gathered inflows of $193bn over the first 11 months of last year, according to consultancy ETFGI.But while both BlackRock and Vanguard registered significant new inflows, State Street has experienced only muted growth. Its ETF operations have been affected by continuing withdrawals from the SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold ETF.ETFs directly tracking the S&P 500, the most widely followed US equity benchmark, were the fastest-growing products for the three rivals in 2014.“S&P 500 ETFs are an incredibly competitive part of the ETF industry. It was the most important index trade of the year for many investors, with the S&P 500 outperforming the Russell 2000 [US smaller companies] and the [technology-focused] Nasdaq index,” says Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, a New York-based broker.Mark Wiedman, global head of BlackRock’s iShares unit, says cost increases for running S&P futures positions have encouraged investors to switch to ETFs.“Investors frequently do not pay attention to the ‘sticker’ prices for futures until it is pointed out that ETFs can provide the same exposure at a lower cost,” he says.State Street’s S&P 500 ETF, better known by its ticker SPY, has long held the title of the world’s largest ETF.However, BlackRock and Vanguard have used aggressive price cuts to mount a sustained assault on the dominant position of SPY, which contributed to almost half of the new money flowing into State Street’s ETF operations last year.These pricing tactics appear to be working.SPY registered net inflows of $7bn in the first 11 months of 2014, down 58 per cent on the $16.3bn gathered over the whole of 2013. But the directly competing US-listed ETFs offered by BlackRock and Vanguard (known as IVV and VOO) enjoyed far greater growth.Inflows for BlackRock’s IVV have risen 30 per cent to $9.8bn, while Vanguard’s VOO’s inflows have increased 55 per cent to $9bn.Ari Rajendra, an ETF strategist at Deutsche Bank in London, says that SPY’s performance in terms of net returns has been poorer in 2012, 2013 and 2014 than that of either IVV or VOO.“SPY’s underperformance over the past three years may have contributed to more investors using the rival products offered by BlackRock and Vanguard,” says Mr Rajendra.The combination of weaker oil prices and a stronger US dollar has traditionally been supportive for US equitiesBlackRock and Vanguard have employed the same pricing tactics in Europe to even greater effect.The European-listed version of BlackRock’s IVV has attracted inflows of $6bn this year, after the world’s largest fund manager cut fees on a “core” ETF range in 2014.Meanwhile, Vanguard gathered $5.9bn in the first 11 months of 2014 for the Ucits version of VOO following reductions in its charges.State Street has been relatively slow to respond to the escalating price war that has drawn in all of the largest ETF managers in Europe. It belatedly reduced fees across a range of its European-listed ETFs in September. However, just $61m in new money has arrived this year in the European-listed version of State Street’s S&P 500 ETF.As a result of these pressures, State Street is in imminent danger of losing its ranking as the world’s second-largest ETF manager by assets to Vanguard.S&P 500 ETFs look likely to remain a significant battleground in 2015.Deborah Fuhr, founding partner at ETFGI, says the improving outlook for the US economy combined with rising corporate earnings and dividends should encourage more flows into the largest and most-liquid ETFs that track the S&P 500 in 2015.Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officer for equities at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, says the combination of weaker oil prices and a stronger US dollar has traditionally been supportive for US equities.“The US bull market will continue right up to the presidential elections in 2016,” says Mr Rossi. He adds that falling oil prices and subdued inflation should also slow the pace and scale of any increases in US interest rates this year.——————————————-Vanguard v SSga: Low cost is a winning strategyRecord breaking inflows for Vanguard have brought it within a whisker of overtaking State Street Global Advisors as the world’s second-largest ETF manager behind BlackRock’s iShares unit.Vanguard’s progress is noteworthy. It was relatively slow to recognise the potential importance of ETFs, in contrast to SSgA, which launched the first US ETF in January 1993.Vanguard’s ETFs business has experienced strong growth since the financial crisis. Its consistent emphasis on keeping costs down has found an expanding audience among financial advisers and retail investors, who are increasingly aware of the impact of fees and charges on their long-term returns.The low-cost provider’s ETF business in Europe is also expanding rapidly where regulatory changes have accelerated the shift into ETFs.Vanguard manages ETF assets of $441bn compared with SSgA’s $458.8bn.
219;STT;State Street Corp;2014-10-31T18:25:27Z;Standardisation push divides opinion;Doubts over bond market reform proposals from BlackRock;For those seeking to address the corporate bond market’s faltering liquidity, reducing and streamlining the vast number of bonds outstanding is an obvious starting point. But a standardisation push could even widen the current market divide between traded and non-traded bonds.BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, was outspoken in a recent assessment of the state of the corporate bond market.In a public policy note issued in September, the firm argued that only a move away from the traditional bank-centred dealing model, together with a streamlining of the structure of new bond issues, would help to head off the market’s liquidity problems.The scale of those problems is currently masked by low interest rates, suppressed volatility and the positive impact of central banks’ quantitative easing policies, BlackRock argued.But “a less-friendly market environment will expose the underlying structure as broken, with the potential for even lower liquidity and sharp, discontinuous price deterioration,” the firm warned.A standardised corporate bond issue would have a minimum notional size, pay interest semi-annually and mature on one of four fixed quarterly redemption dates, BlackRock suggests.All bonds would have an in-built call option during their last 90 days, allowing corporate treasurers some flexibility in choosing when to refinance.Compared with the equity markets, the current lack of standardisation in corporate bonds is striking.While offering a single share class, five of the largest seven issuers in the Barclays US Corporate index each has more than 1,000 dollar-denominated bonds outstanding, says BlackRock, with only a small proportion of each issuer’s bonds – under 5 per cent by number – eligible for the index.Similar levels of concentration are evident in the secondary market for corporate debt.According to trading platform MarketAxess, in a 13-month period to July 2014 only 300 bonds out of 51,000 European investment-grade corporates traded more than 10 times a day on average. On a typical day, around 90 per cent of the bonds did not trade at all.“A stock that trades once a day is called extremely illiquid. A bond that trades once a day is abnormally liquid,” says Larry Tabb, founder and CEO of research firm the Tabb Group.The interests of asset managers in promoting secondary bond market liquidity are clear. These firms operate large funds investing in corporate debt, offering an implicit promise to retail investors that they can access their money immediately.But will the other major stakeholders in the corporate debt markets – corporations and their investment bank advisers – sign up to standardisation plans? Many market participants are sceptical.“What’s a great idea for reducing systemic risk and for investors may not be such a great idea for issuers and the bankers,” says Mr Tabb.“Treasurers tend to borrow money for a specific purpose and term. They may be reluctant to give up the flexibility to raise funding whenever they want. And it may be hard to convince treasurers that they should worry about the secondary market liquidity of their bonds in issue.”“A lot of people agree with BlackRock’s proposal to standardise bond issuance,” says Paul Reynolds, CEO of trading platform BondCube. “But only a few frequent, large issuers are really qualified to issue on a standard schedule.”“A standardised issue would be bigger, less complex and issued less frequently. This would cut into the margins of the underwriters,” notes Will Rhode, head of capital markets research at the Boston Consulting Group.“Standardisation may help a little, but it’s a band-aid compared to the faultlines in the market,” says Andy Hill, director in market practice and regulatory policy at the International Capital Markets Association, a body representing the interests of participants in the securities markets, including banks, investors and issuers.According to one asset manager, some bankers do not share investors’ concerns about faltering bond market liquidity in the first place.“A senior figure at a large bank broker-dealer recently asked me, ‘why do you care if corporate bonds gap down eight or nine points in a day?’,” Steven Meier, chief investment officer for global fixed income at State Street Global Advisers, recounts.“I replied, ‘I care, because my clients want to know if the bonds are going to gap down another eight or nine points tomorrow, and if they should head for the exits’,” he says.“The banker’s point was that in the past his firm used to put its capital at risk, helping the market to transition to higher yield levels over time,” Mr Meier elaborates.“Now the price discovery process is likely to take place much more suddenly. I worry that such sudden moves could precipitate wider market stress.”Any standardisation push in the corporate bond market could also lead to greater segmentation, the CIO of another asset management firm told the Financial Times, speaking on condition of anonymity.“We may end up with a core of standardised corporate bonds issued by regular borrowers such as banks and multinationals, while issues from the rest of the corporate sector come to resemble the private placement market,” says the CIO.Private placements are sales of corporate securities to a small number of private investors. Such bond issues are normally assumed to be illiquid by nature.“That would bring challenges of its own: investors will demand more of a yield premium for securities that are privately placed,” the CIO says.“The corporate bond market could become bifurcated. Privately placed bonds would also be ineligible for index inclusion.”According to one veteran manager of bond funds, such an outcome would be nothing new.“As interest rates go up, borrowers are going to approach asset managers directly,” predicts Dan Fuss, vice-chairman at Loomis Sayles.“Large institutions will become long-term bankers to corporations again, just as they were in the 50s, 60s and 70s.”And for those worried about current imbalances in the corporate bond markets, Mr Fuss has another, sobering message.“If you want to see a real liquidity problem in corporate bonds, take interest rates up a few percentage points. Dealers won’t be carrying any inventory. That’s exactly what happened in the 1970s.”

However, this position is also under threat from Vanguard, which has built up European ETF assets of $10.3bn and moved up to ninth spot.Vanguard’s European ETF operations have gathered net inflows of $5.6bn so far this year, substantially more than SSgA which has attracted $1.8bn.Mr Marinof, however, insisted that SSgA’s fee cuts were “neither too little nor too late” to effectively counter competition from Vanguard and other rivals.

Vanguard is set to overtake State Street as the second-largest exchange traded product provider globally in “a matter of months”, according to Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of consultancy ETFGI. Ms Fuhr suggests one factor that will help propel Vanguard ahead of State Street is the fact that it is “an asset manager, pure and simple”. Almost $50bn went into Vanguard’s ETFs in August, 23 per cent more than the same period last year, bringing its ETF assets to $414.9bn, while SSgA had $432.5bn.US DoJ to get tough on dodgy dealing

As I’m sure you can appreciate, we cannot comment on any additional details at this time. All discussions involving employees are confidential.”It added: “We have more than 120 sales and market risk traders engaged in foreign exchange trading globally and, consequently, one employee’s absence in no way impacts our ability to manage the foreign exchange requirements of our clients.”Simon Pepper, State Street’s head of foreign exchange trading in London, could not immediately be reached for comment. Mr Pepper has worked at State Street for 10 years, according to a register maintained by UK regulators. He previously worked for Barclays.About three dozen employees at 12 banks and the Bank of England have been suspended, placed on leave or fired as part of the global investigations by lenders and regulators into possible rate-rigging in the €5.3tn-a-day currency market, the largest financial market in the world.As yet, no regulator has brought any formal charge and no traders have been charged with wrongdoing.Revenues of the 10 largest investment banks across the US and Europe fell 5 per cent year on year in the six months to June, largely as a result of the 13 per cent drop in trading of bonds and other fixed income products, according to data published by Coalition.The slide in trading of major currencies was even more striking, with revenues down 35 per cent from the first half of 2013 – the biggest year-on-year decline since 2008.This is largely the result of ultra-loose monetary policies that have kept currencies trading in tight ranges. But the fall has been exacerbated by investigations into manipulation of the foreign exchange market, which have prompted many banks to suspend senior traders and accelerate a shift from voice to electronic trading.The news of Mr Pepper’s movements was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
223;STT;State Street Corp;2014-09-07T05:52:47Z;Gold ETFs struggle to shine as investors opt for risk;A return to large inflows is looking unlikely;Have gold exchange traded funds lost their lustre? The figures paint a bleak picture. Gold exchange-traded products, once hailed as the people’s central bank, have seen outflows of more than €30bn since the start of 2013.That movement is in contrast to the five years from 2008-12, when figures show an estimated €47bn flowed into gold ETFs, as investors searched for safe haven investments and performance was strong.However, with equity markets rallying, economies stabilising and the probable end of quantitative easing in the US, investors have turned their backs on gold ETFs. Detlef Glow, head of Europe, the Middle East and Asia research at data provider Lipper, says: “Gold ETFs have definitely lost their lustre compared with other financial assets.”Deborah Fuhr, founder of research firm ETFGI, agrees: “Investors have been looking to put their money into riskier investments, so gold is sitting on the sidelines.”In 2013, investors pulled €30.9bn from gold ETFs, then taking a further €1.16bn in the first half of 2014, according to Lipper estimates.As outflows have pushed the price of gold down, performance has been dismal. State Street Global Advisors’ SPDR GLD product, the world’s largest physically backed gold ETF, which holds stocks of the precious metal, returned 27 per cent in 2009. However, it returned -28.9 per cent last year.Although outflows continued in the first half of this year, albeit at a slower pace, there are signs that sales are now picking up.ETF Securities, a provider of exchange traded products, says its physical gold products saw their highest inflows in 17 months in the last week of July, with investors pouring $106.4m into the products.Dave Mazza, head of research for SPDR ETFs and SSgA funds, says that, while economies are growing and the US, Europe and even China seem more stable than they did a few years ago, investors have been spooked by the recent geopolitical problems.Nitesh Shah, research analyst ETF Securities, says tensions in Ukraine and clashes in the Middle East in July have driven up demand for gold.“After such a long stretch of equity market outperformance, many investors appear to be protecting themselves against rising geopolitical risk by adding perceived defensive assets such as gold to their portfolios,” he adds.However, others remain less impressed by the recent inflows. Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers, be­lieves gold is still struggling to attract the inflows that might have been expected, despite the recent turmoil globally.“Despite geopolitical tensions taking centre stage, there is little evidence of accelerated buying,” he says. Holdings in gold-backed funds in early August remain close to the lowest point of the year.While some ETF providers report an uptick in inflows, Mr Shah admits growth is expected to be slow, with gold unlikely to return to its 2011 peak in the near future.“That was a period when investors were not just holding [gold] as a diversification tool, but as an asset that countered the debasement of the US dollar,” he says. “You can see a very strong correlation between the gold price and real interest rates. And with real rates likely to rise, it is unlikely the price will be attractive to their tactical holders.”Instead, Mr Shah says demand is likely to come from investors who want to use the precious metal as a diversification tool.“Gold ETFs will continue to grow as investors seek to diversify their portfolios,” he says.“Gold will increase in value on the back of more people seeing it as an asset class, rather than as a tactical tool or using it to counteract how they think the world is going.”There is also the belief that many of the current investors in gold ETFs are looking at it from a longer perspective.“The majority of investors, even though we did see some selling pressure last year, have been quite sticky, especially if they were early investors,” says Mr Mazza.“They are less concerned about the price and more focused on it as a diversification strategy.”More could also be done to attract Asian investors, who still show a healthy appetite for gold, albeit in its physical form, according to Mr Shah. “Retail interest in gold will remain strong, especially in Asia,” he says.However, despite some promising signs, the outlook for gold-backed funds is muted.ETF consultant Feargal Dempsey says: “In the near to medium term, I would not expect huge inflows back into gold ETFs, unless there is a serious deterioration in economic and political situations.”He adds: “As we navigate into calmer waters, with economies beginning to recover and talk of interest rate rises, we are going to see the attractiveness of gold as a safe haven decline.”
224;STT;State Street Corp;2014-09-07T05:52:14Z;Geopolitical risk rising for ETF investors;Active managers have more freedom of manoeuvre;"Summer 2014 has seen multiple conflicts in the Middle East, while Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, continues to interfere in Ukraine. Geopolitical risk is increasing and investors need to assess their exposure and how to adapt their investment strategies in response.Alan Sippetts, investment director at Heartwood Investment Management, says: “Unlike capital market trends, where there are lots of historic data that can be used to predict behaviour, political risk can pop up and snowball rapidly, making it difficult to manage.”Actively managed funds have an advantage over passive ones as specific stocks or countries can be avoided.Ted Hood, chief executive of Source, says: “It is much easier for an active manager to produce an investment strategy adapted to geopolitical risk than for a passive investor.”Because an exchange traded fund tracks a specific index, it cannot determine the constituents of that index.The broader the index, the more difficult it is to avoid political risk. For example, in 2012, the Indian government said it would tax capital gains realised by foreigners, a move with serious implications for ETF investors.Mr Hood says: “Investors in a broad emerging market ETF could not stop having exposure to the Indian market unless the index provider decided to take that step. And the index providers do not usually react that rapidly to such issues.”The only realistic option available to investors was to decide whether to stay invested or sell their position. “Many of our clients decided to sell their emerging market ETFs, whereas an active manager could have simply reduced exposure to India and kept an overall emerging market position,” says Mr Hood.Since 2012, however, the range of ETF products has increased substantially, so investors can be more specific about how they allocate their assets, making it easier for them to avoid geopolitical hotspots.Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for the US intermediary business at State Street Global Advisors, says: “Investors can now decide to have a broad exposure or choose whether they want exposure to individual countries and regions or even an investment style.”Investors are making greater use of these more targeted products in emerging markets, adds Mr Arone. “There is an increasing realisation that investing in a broad emerging market index as a long term play on global economic growth is too simplistic.”Investors are also realising that emerging markets are heterogeneous rather than homogeneous.“In the ETF universe, we have seen investors become selective about emerging markets and try to determine where the risks are and where the growth is, then expressing those views by using the more granular ETFs,” says Mr Arone.An increase in geopolitical risk is not necessarily a threat to an investor’s portfolio; it can also be an opportunity. Political tensions tend to create highly emotive responses, which can result in markets over-reacting.While the newer range of ETFs make it easier for a passive investor to buy a country or region that has been unfairly penalised by the market, it remains more difficult to express a more refined response.Mr Hood says that entire markets can be oversold, allowing savvy active managers to pick up individual stocks that they know are undervalued.In these types of market environment, says Mr Hood, it is worth investors who usually prefer a passive route to consider appointing an active manager.He adds: “As an ETF provider, we say the statistics show that active management is unpredictable. However, in the market dislocations caused by political risk, active manager skills become more important and they may be able to deliver better returns than the passive market.”"
225;STT;State Street Corp;2014-09-07T05:50:39Z;MSCI removes Russia from the equation;More indices may decide to exclude the country;At the end of July, MSCI launched new composite indices that exclude Russia, including new versions of its all-country index and its emerging market index.As passive investors have become an increasingly powerful force in equity markets, this decision throws up a potential problem for the Russian’s equity markets ability to attract external capital.Sebastien Lieblich, global head of index management research at MSCI, says: “We launched these indices in July, after clients came to us with their concerns about the impact of sanctions imposed by the EU and US on Russian companies.”The decision will make it much easier for passive investors to avoid investing in the world’s largest country. It could also have serious implications for Russia’s equity markets.George Hoguet, global investment strategist in the Investment Solutions Group at State Street Global Advisors, says: “If clients seek to adopt indices that exclude Russia, this will restrict flows into Russia and potentially precipitate flows out.”Mr Lieblich adds: “Our clients were looking for investment tools that would enable them to avoid any exposure to Russian securities.”In the past, an index that allowed investors to bypass a particular market would have had little impact, as there were insufficient assets allocated to products that tracked these indices. But that is changing rapidly. According to BlackRock, cumulative asset inflows into equity ETP products were $248bn in 2013 and $171bn in 2012.More recently, investor interest in emerging markets passive products has increased. According to BlackRock’s latest exchange traded products report, August was the fifth month in a row of asset inflows into emerging market equities. Inflows this year to the end of August were $11.6bn.This contrasts with mutual fund flows in emerging markets, which were negative, with a total of $14.6bn being withdrawn, according to BlackRock.These trends mean the role of ETP investors is becoming increasingly im­portant in emerging markets and concerns of these investors have a greater ability to affect the performance of individual markets.MSCI says there is client demand for indices that avoid the Russian market. Mr Lieblich says: “Since the launch, we’ve seen a number of requests for the indices.”MSCI is not the only index provider to have considered how investors might react to the imposition of sanctions by the US and the EU. But other index providers have not gone as far as producing indices that specifically exclude Russia.David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones, says: “We decided that simply excluding all Russian companies from our indices was not the correct response to the imposition of sanctions, as they will not have a direct effect on investors unless the sanctioned companies try to raise capital.”Instead, S&P DJ decided to carry on monitoring the situation and if a company named under sanctions decides to raise capital, it would then remove that company from the index.Mr Blitzer says: “It is a very simple process for us to exclude Russia from a particular index, if the demand were to arise.”For ETF investors, however, it is one thing for an index provider to decide to exclude a particular country from an index, but that does not make it an investment option. That will only happen when the ETF providers decided to launch a product that tracks the new ex-Russia index.MSCI has not as yet seen interest from ETF providers.Mr Lieblich says: “We have continuing discussions about all our indices with ETF providers, but we have not yet received any new requests from ETF providers to license these indices.”Nor is there any appetite from ETF providers to change existing products.Mr Blitzer says: “Our ETF clients are reluctant to start excluding either individual companies or countries from existing indices, as the transaction costs involved would be punitive. They would rather monitor the situation.” There are also concerns that if existing indices started to exclude an entire country, then it would cause such a reaction in the Russian market that it could create even more uncertainty. “They would really rather not see further turmoil in the markets,” says Mr Blitzer.The decision by S&P Dow Jones not to follow MSCI’s lead and the lack of interest from ETF providers in providing products that track these new ex-Russia indices would indicate that investor interest is not widespread.However, it would be unwise to dismiss MSCI’s decision to issue ex-Russia indices.Mr Hoguet says: “Clearly, the posture of the index providers will influence capital flows into Russia.“In addition, the situation in Russia is far from stable. If it were to deteriorate, it is likely that capital would flow out of Russia and investor demand for products that exclude Russia would increase,” he adds.
226;STT;State Street Corp;2014-06-17T10:52:11Z;ETF managers push European reform agenda;Improvements sought for ETF trade reporting;BlackRock is leading renewed efforts by participants in the exchange traded funds market to harmonise and improve ETF trading rules across Europe.The world’s largest fund manager has written an open letter to the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) urging the regional regulator to create a level playing field for ETF trading across all European markets.Rachel Lord, head of iShares, BlackRock’s ETF arm, in Europe, said the letter was “a call to action for the entire ETF industry to engage on critically important regulation with Esma”.The regulator is currently seeking comments in a consultation process that runs until August 1 for rule changes proposed as part of the review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, known as Mifid II.The letter was co-signed by UBS, Source, Nomura, Barclays, Lombard Odier as well as two specialist ETF market makers, Jane Street and Susquehanna, along with Bats Chi-X Europe, one of Europe’s largest share trading exchanges.ETF providers are anxious to ensure that a single complete record of ETF trading, known as a “consolidated tape”, should be created so that investors better understand the true liquidity of the ETF market in Europe. Currently the majority of ETF trading in Europe is done via over-the-counter (OTC) transactions that go unrecorded. ETF providers argue this deters some institutional investors from participating in the market and they want harmonised reporting standards established for all ETF trades.State Street Global Advisors, Vanguard, Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management and HSBC have also expressed support for the proposals to strengthen the rapidly expanding European ETF market.Investors have poured record inflows into ETFs in Europe so far this year. Net inflows have reached $26.3bn by the end of May, already 34 per cent higher than the $19.6bn gathered over the whole of 2013, according to ETFGI, a consultancy.
227;STT;State Street Corp;2014-04-17T18:08:48Z;Concentrated portfolios ‘key to outperformance’;Funds with too many holdings tend to hug the benchmark;Investors choosing actively managed funds should invest in portfolios that consciously do not track a benchmark, or risk paying high fees for underperformance, according to new research.Brian Routledge and Anthony Forcione of State Street Global Advisors believe “high conviction” funds, which focus on a select group of stocks, tend to outperform the market over the long term, despite higher levels of volatility on the way.By comparison, portfolios investing in a high number of diversified stocks often dilute the impact of fund managers’ “best ideas”.Managers with large numbers of holdings are often criticised as “benchmark-huggers”, whose over-diversification results in a portfolio that broadly tracks the market but with higher costs and greater turnover than passive investments which do the same job.“Many fund managers are encouraged to be closet benchmark huggers by the way we buy and sell funds,” said Peter Sleep, senior portfolio manager at Seven Investment Management.“It suits the portfolio managers, as benchmark-hugging is a low risk strategy for their careers and suits the fund management groups, with quarterly earnings announcements and shareholders to keep happy.”He said academic research shows the best way to achieve long-term outperformance is to effectively “bet against the benchmark.”Ben Yearsley, head of investment research at Charles Stanley Direct, agreed. He generally prefers funds with a smaller number of holdings as such concentration suggests the managers “know their companies.”Nonetheless, he noted two highly successful fund managers over the years, Anthony Bolton at Fidelity and Giles Hargreave of Hargreave Hale, both had over 200 holdings in their portfolios.Robin McDonald, a member of the fund selection team at Schroders, said funds do not always have to have a limited number of stocks in order to attain a degree of concentration, noting that Invesco Perpetual’s outgoing manager Neil Woodford owns more than 100 stocks. But 80 per cent of the fund is invested in around 20 of them.Mr McDonald also highlighted the Findlay Park American fund, which has a large number of stocks but “looks nothing like the market”. It’s one of the few actively managed funds to beat the US market, returning 234 per cent over 10 years against the S&P 500’s 150 per cent, according to data from Lipper.Achieving consistent returns with only a small portfolio demands genuine skill. “The notion of a concentrated fund outperforming assumes that the people doing the stock picking are actually any good at it,” said Gary Potter, co-head of multi-manager at F & C Investments.

229;STT;State Street Corp;2014-04-09T17:19:34Z;Vanguard leads ETF race after first quarter;Pushes ahead of rivals BlackRock and State Street;Vanguard has established a clear lead over its arch rivals BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors in the race among exchange traded fund managers for investors’ cash in 2014.Vanguard’s ETF business gathered global net inflows of $14.7bn in the first three months of 2014, outpacing BlackRock’s iShares operations which attracted $8.6bn while SSgA’s suffered outflows of $17.4bn, according to ETFGI, a consultancy.However, overall investor appetite for ETFs was relatively weak in the first quarter, even as stock markets in the developed world continued to advance.Global inflows into ETFs (funds and products) dropped to $33bn in the first three months of 2014, down 55 per cent on the same period last year.However, Deborah Fuhr, founding partner at ETFGI, pointed out that inflows into equity-linked ETFs picked up pace in March, helped by the US stock market hitting a fresh peak and the FTSE All World index rallying to its highest level since the end of 2007.Victor Lin, an analyst at Credit Suisse, noted that some leveraged ETFs which multiply returns on the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 index, the benchmark for US small companies, saw a surge in flows in March, suggesting a change in investors’ appetite for risk.Concerns about whether rising defaults might lead to further problems in China’s financial sector weighed on sentiment towards ETFs linked to emerging markets which saw outflows of $16.5bn in the first quarter, compared with inflows of $4.4bn in the first three months of 2013.However, selling pressure has moderated recently. Mr Lin noted that inflows into emerging market ETFs turned positive in the last week of March, suggesting a turning point might have been reached.Tensions between Moscow and Ukraine did not deter some contrarians from seeking bargains in Russia. The Market Vectors Russia ETF pulled in $571m in March alone.In fixed income markets, the US central bank’s move to scale back its monthly bond buying programme led to outflows from Treasury benchmarked ETFs in March. Those outflows were offset by investors continuing to look for yield in short-term, high-yield corporate bond ETFs.Overall fixed income ETF inflows at $17.8bn for the first quarter remained strong, up 72.8 per cent on the same period last year.
230;STT;State Street Corp;2014-04-06T21:11:29Z;Bank of New York Mellon investors balk at board pay and expenses;;Shareholders in Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank, are voicing concern about expenses and executive pay ahead of its annual meeting on Tuesday.Two top-30 shareholders said they were disillusioned by a failure to keep expenses under control and meet targets on profitability since the company was formed in 2007 from the merger of Bank of New York – the oldest bank in the US created by one of America’s founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton – and Mellon Financial, an asset management firm.Gerald Hassell, who replaced Bob Kelly as chief executive after a boardroom clash in 2011, has a target of 10 per cent return on equity. But the bank has failed to meet its targets, and trailed rivals, such as State Street, in profitability, with margins several percentage points lower and persistently higher costs.“It has become of increasing concern to us,” said one large shareholder. “We’ve noticed it and it has continued and it is in contradiction to the objectives and plans by the CEO when he took over.“They are underperforming their close peers on cost and a larger set of financial peers. State Street has done much better on expenses.”Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA who has suggested the bank should be split up, added: “This is not a close call. In the case of BNY and their need to better optimise operations shareholders are almost unanimous.”Mr Mayo said he planned to attend Tuesday’s meeting, the first of the banks to hold this year’s shareholder gatherings, and try to persuade the board to conduct a study into the costs and benefits of selling its asset management division.He noted that a combination of State Street and BlackRock, the asset management group, would be about the same size as BNY Mellon but with twice the profits and 20 per cent fewer employees.One investor also expressed displeasure that Mr Hassell had been awarded nearly his full bonus payout in spite of lacklustre results. The chief executive earns about $13m a year.However, last year BNY Mellon recorded 97 per cent of the shareholder vote in support of the executive pay plan, up from 59 per cent a year earlier.Despite the investor dissatisfaction, there is not expected to be any large-scale rebellion, though Calpers, the large California pension fund, said it planned to vote in favour of efforts to force the bank to appoint an independent chairman.BNY Mellon said its total shareholder return of 39 per cent last year outperformed its peers, while “pre-tax income and core investment management and investment services fees grew nicely and our capital position has remained very strong”.It added: “We are committed to continuing this strong performance as we capitalise on investments we’ve made for the future, focus on expense control and operating leverage [increasing revenues faster than costs], and increase shareholder returns.”

233;STT;State Street Corp;2014-03-04T16:18:01Z;State Street set to begin trading futures for rival institutions;;State Street Corporation, the US financial services group, is poised to begin trading futures for rival institutional investors, in a move that may curb investment banks’ role as intermediaries in trading.The group’s trading arm, State Street Global Exchange, is set to trade listed derivatives on global exchanges as an agency broker in coming weeks. It is building up its trading desk and testing its systems.Its move puts it into competition with rivals such as BNY Mellon and underscores how traditional trading relationships in financial markets are shifting amid tougher regulation that is changing industry economics.Many banks are faced with more stringent rules about using their balance sheets to support derivatives trading, potentially limiting the services some investors will receive. In recent months many banks have also cut jobs in fixed-income trading amid falling revenues and stricter regulatory capital rules.At the same time many long-term investors and pension funds are facing greater pressure to demonstrate they are getting the best possible price for their trades, forcing them to consider alternative and outsourced trading services.State Street wants to use its custodian banking business to grab more operations traditionally taken on by investment banks, as it will be able to use collateral placed by other fund managers at the bank to fund more derivatives trades.Custodian banks act as intermediaries between investors and banks to clear derivatives. A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, ensuring the deal is completed in the event of a default.Charley Cooper, senior managing director, State Street Global Exchange, Trading & Clearing, said its move was dictated by customer demand.State Street wants to use its custodian banking business to grab more operations traditionally taken on by investment banks“You’re seen as a safer bet than the traditional sellside,” he said. “We are a substantially better credit risk. This way is an alternative to trading from the sell side, who also have a proprietary position.”State Street’s parent company has an ‘A+’ at Standard & Poor’s, giving it a higher rating with the agency than banks such as Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse. Financial institutions can use their high credit ratings to cut the cost of financing securities.Rivals such as BNY Mellon have also pushed into the market, hiring traders to deal in fixed income markets. Mr Cooper said the group would act as an agency broker, trading for clients and taking no proprietary risk on deals.The group’s decision to begin trading futures marks the group’s latest foray into the derivatives market infrastructure. In recent years it began a swaps clearing service to advantage of sweeping reform of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. However, Mr Cooper said there were no plans to begin trading swaps as yet.
234;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

236;STT;State Street Corp;2014-02-20T16:19:50Z;State Street launches online ETF platform in Europe;Initiative to attract more institutional investors in Europe;State Street has launched an online trading platform for exchange traded funds aimed at attracting large institutional investors to the ETF market in Europe.ETF providers and exchange operators have been ramping up their efforts to address inefficient trading which is widely seen as a hindrance to asset growth in Europe’s fragmented ETF market.In the latest of these initiatives, State Street Global Exchange has launched FundConnect. It enables large institutional clients known as authorised participants (APs) to trade multiple products via an electronic platform, rather than replying on faxes and phone calls.Alexis Marinof, head of SPDR ETF for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street, said the FundConnect platform would enhance the speed and efficiency with which APs could create and redeem ETF units.“Developments like FundConnect that help support liquidity providers across Europe will play an important role in enabling the ETF industry to grow,” said Mr Marinof.FundConnect was first launched in the US market in 2008. It has been adapted to deal with the increased complexities of the European ETF market, such as the challenge of dealing with multiple locations for trade settlement.One senior European ETF market maker said, “Other issuers such as iShares and Source already operate online ETF platforms but this will certainly making trading with State Street more user friendly and I will be an active user.”European listed ETFs (funds and products) made a positive start to 2014, with inflows of just over $5bn in January after a disappointing performance last year, when managers gathered $19.7bn over the whole of 2013, according to ETFGI, a consultancy that monitors industry trends.“We have seen good trading volumes since the start of the year, with the majority of interest coming from buyers,” said the market maker.
237;STT;State Street Corp;2014-02-10T00:46:01Z;Transition managers get ‘wake-up’ call;UK regulator warns service providers about governance standards;Transition managers have been issued with a “wake-up call” by the Financial Conduct Authority after the UK regulator last month fined State Street £22.9m for deliberately overcharging clients.In a review of the transition management sector published on Monday, the FCA said it was advising service providers to ensure that their controls, oversight and governance arrangements met the required standards in all areas.However, it stopped short of imposing new guidelines or rules on transition managers who help pension funds and other asset owners when repositioning investment portfolios.Clive Adamson, FCA director of supervision, said action would be taken if transition managers failed to operate at the highest possible standards on behalf of clients.“Transition management often flies below the radar but it does have ramifications for individual investors, the ultimate holders of assets,” said Mr Adamson.The FCA review cast light on to a previously opaque industry that transitioned assets worth more than £165bn annually over the past three years.Around 700 mandates were awarded each year between 2010-12 to 13 providers. The UK industry is highly concentrated, with the top five providers responsible for almost 80 per cent of the assets traded.The FCA said transition managers must take all reasonable steps to ensure the best possible result when executing orders for a client and to ensure that possible conflicts of interest were disclosed, recorded and managed.Ireland’s National Treasury Management Agency, one of six clients affected by overcharging, said last week that it had terminated a €650m equity mandate with State Street following the FCA’s action.The US financial group was rebuked by the FCA for acting with “complete disregard for its customers” by charging secret mark-ups to six clients, including the Kuwait Investment Authority and the Royal Mail and J Sainsbury pension funds.
238;STT;State Street Corp;2014-02-09T09:03:14Z;Is smart beta just ‘old wine in new bottles’?;Active managers face growing competition from advanced beta strategies;Active fund managers face growing competition from advanced or “smart” beta strategies, which are being more widely adopted by institutional investors.Two-thirds of institutional investors now view rules-based advanced beta strategies as a viable alternative to active managers, according to a survey of 300 institutional investors by Longitude Research on behalf of State Street Global Advisors.Four in 10 institutional investors already use advanced beta and a further quarter plan to do so. They are also much more likely to switch money into advanced beta from their active management budget than out of passive index allocations.“There is no question that institutional investors see advanced beta as a powerful evolution in asset allocation strategies and not as a fad,” says Lynn Blake, chief investment officer of global equity beta solutions at State Street.The low costs of running advanced beta mean active managers have to deliver considerable outperformance to offset their higher fees.“If you look at some of the advanced-beta funds and calculate the relative fee difference then you really need several hundred basis points [of outperformance] in active manager selection to overcome them,” says Austin Cooley, director of liquid strategies at the Fire and Police Pension Association of Colorado.Europe appears to be leading the way in adopting advanced beta even though the US has far more invested in traditional passive index funds.Almost a quarter of the survey’s European respondents had 20 per cent or more of equities in their portfolios allocated to advanced beta while just 4 per cent of North American investors made similar allocations.PGGM, the Dutch pension fund, has committed 40 per cent of its assets to advanced beta, while PKA, the Danish pension fund, and the Strathclyde pension fund in Scotland are also known to have made allocations.However, the blurring of the boundaries between active and passive management by advanced beta introduces new implementation and governance challenges, says Ms Blake, who oversees index portfolios with assets of more than $1.1tn.She also cautions that investors have to be prepared to ride out periods of underperformance by alternative beta, relative to traditional market capitalisation-weighted benchmarks.Mr Cooley agrees that advanced beta strategies, particularly those that are extracting cyclical premia, need suitably longer time periods for proper evaluation.Combinations of advanced beta strategies offer some control over the risks of underperformance or large drawdowns.“Strategies based on multiple factors help to build resilience and diversification into a portfolio. There are clear benefits to a multi-factor approach,” says Ms Blake.But she acknowledges this creates greater complexity in the investment process, which can be a challenge to explain to clients.Just 9 per cent of the survey’s respondents had adopted combinations of advanced beta strategies in their portfolios but almost two-thirds said they were considering this approach.Advanced beta is not without its critics.James Montier, a member of the asset allocation group at GMO, the $112bn US investment group, says that if advanced beta strategies are corrected for their exposure to “value” (low price to book) and smaller sized stocks, they exhibit no significant outperformance compared with conventional cap-weighted benchmarks.Adrian Banner, chief executive of Intech Investment Management, is a more severe critic, arguing that advanced beta strategies are merely “old wine in new bottles”.Mr Banner says the performance of some of the most widely used advanced beta strategies, such as low volatility and equal weighting, is driven mainly by the periodic rebalancing of these portfolios.He points out that some advanced beta portfolios can have high turnover and high trading costs associated with rebalancing that are not included in the published returns. Mr Banner is also critical of the idea that combinations of advanced beta strategies could make more robust portfolios.“It may be sensible to dynamically adjust exposures to different smart beta strategies over time, but this is probably no easier than determining when individual stock prices, or the market as a whole, are likely to rise or fall,” he says.
239;STT;State Street Corp;2014-01-31T16:04:12Z;State Street fined £23m for secret mark-ups charged to clients;;The UK market regulator has dealt a stinging rebuke to State Street by fining the US financial group £22.9m for acting with “complete disregard for its customers” by charging clients secret mark-ups on some transactions.The Financial Conduct Authority said that State Street “deliberately” overcharged six clients in the US group’s transition management business a total of $20m between June 2010 and September 2011.“The FCA views State Street UK’s failings to be at the most serious end of the spectrum,” said the regulator.It added that the US group “developed and executed a deliberate and targeted strategy to charge substantial mark-ups on certain transitions, in addition to the agreed management fee or commission, that were deliberately not agreed with clients or disclosed to them”.The six clients affected by the overcharging included Ireland’s National Treasury Management Agency, the Kuwait Investment Authority and the Royal Mail and Sainsbury pension funds. The NTMA said it was studying the FCA announcement and the other three groups declined to comment.State Street said: “We deeply regret this matter . . . We acknowledge these as historical problems and have undertaken extensive efforts to address both, including strengthening the controls, procedures and governance within our UK transition management business.”The US group said it had refunded the clients affected and dismissed the staff most closely involved in the overcharging. It was granted a 30 per cent discount for settling the case early, reducing its fine from a potential £32.7m.Tracey McDermott, the FCA’s director of enforcement and financial crime, said: “The findings we publish today are another example of a firm that has acted with complete disregard for the interests of its customers. State Street UK’s significant failings in culture and controls allowed deliberate overcharging to take place and to continue undetected. Their conduct has fallen far short of our expectations.”Ireland’s NTMA reported the matter to the City of London police, who are still investigating it, according to people familiar with the matter.NTMA is now considering whether to continue to use State Street as a passive manager for part of its portfolio, the people said. It is thought to have stopped using the company’s transition management services and changed its internal procedures to ensure there is greater transparency when there are big portfolio changes, the people said.The overcharging occurred on 3.5 per cent of transactions but accounted for a quarter of the total revenue by State Street’s transition management business in the 16-month period in question.The FCA said the wrongdoing only came to light “after a client notified staff that it had identified mark-ups on certain trades that had not been agreed”.“Those responsible then incorrectly claimed both to the client and later to State Street UK’s compliance department that the charging was an inadvertent error, and arranged for a substantial rebate to be paid on that false basis.“They deliberately failed to disclose the existence of further mark-ups on other trades conducted as part of the same transition.”Transition management is a service provided to big institutional investors, such as pension funds, to oversee the restructuring of a large portfolio of securities or the replacement of the asset manager.Graham Dixon of Inalytics, a consultancy, said the FCA’s findings were to be welcomed as they would provide greater impetus for transition managers to adopt higher standards. “But the fine for State Street is not indicative of an industry-wide problem,” he said.The FCA is next week expected to publish an overall review of transition management services. A person familiar with that review said it would recommend that some areas of the industry be tightened up, but found no other cases of secret mark-ups.Mr Dixon said there were areas where transition managers could make improvements, including greater transparency and disclosure, reporting of performance track records, better communication with clients and in standardising legal documents.One of the State Street staff dismissed over the issue – Edward Pennings – challenged his dismissal at an employment tribunal, which rejected his claim in December 2012.State Street is being separately sued by California, which alleges the bank improperly charged state pension funds for foreign exchange services, and several US authorities are also looking into the matter, the bank has said in regulatory findings.
240;STT;State Street Corp;2014-01-12T07:24:07Z;2013 ETF race for investors’ cash ends in photo finish;Less than $1bn of inflows separated the first and second place;BlackRock pipped its arch rival Vanguard to the winning post as the race between exchange traded fund providers for investors’ cash in 2013 culminated in a photo finish.Less than $1bn of inflows separated the first- and third-largest ETF providers by assets respectively, after a year in which Wall Street’s surge to an all-time high provided a significant boost to many US ETF managers.In comparison, growth for European-based ETF managers was disappointing as they lost market share to their US rivals.But uncertainty about possible changes to the US Federal Reserve’s bond-buying programme was reflected in choppy monthly ETF flows from May onwards and weighed heavily on investors’ appetite for fixed-income ETFs.ETFs linked to gold and emerging market equities, two of the main pillars of the industry’s growth in previous years, also suffered large outflows in 2013.As a result, global net inflows into exchange traded funds and products fell to $243.1bn last year, down 8.3 per cent from $265bn in 2012, according to ETFGI, a consultancy that monitors industry trends.Net global inflows to BlackRock’s range of iShares exchange traded funds and products dropped 30 per cent to just over $61bn in 2013.Meanwhile, Vanguard’s ETF business enjoyed its best ever year, gathering net inflows of $60.2bn, an increase of 12.5 per cent on 2012. Vanguard registered faster growth in the US and Canada than BlackRock. However, BlackRock posted a strong performance in Europe, which boosted its overall inflows.For State Street Global Advisors, the second-largest provider by assets, the distinction of managing the fastest-growing ETF globally in 2013, the SPDR 500 (which pulled in $16.3bn), was marred by outflows of more than $25bn from its main gold ETF, the SPDR Gold Trust. Globally, SSgA’s ETF operations attracted inflows of $18.3bn in 2013, down 52.6 per cent on the previous year.Hefty selling by gold investors also weighed heavily on ETF Securities. The London-based precious-metals specialist saw outflows of $4.9bn last year, compared with inflows of $2.9bn in 2012.However, the wooden spoon for 2013 went to Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management where net redemptions reached almost $6bn, compared with inflows of $1.4bn in 2012. DeAWM has introduced changes to its business model, shifting away from derivative-linked ETFs in an effort to respond to growing competition from US managers in Europe.Other providers that enjoyed a clear benefit from the rally in the US stock market included PowerShares, the fourth-largest provider globally. Its inflows more than doubled to $15.4bn, helped by strong interest in the PowerShares QQQ ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index.Deborah Fuhr, founding partner at ETFGI, said the US, which listed its first ETF just over 20 years ago, is often mistakenly described as “mature”. The spectacular increases in ETF flows for a host of mid-tier providers demonstrated its dynamism.Charles Schwab, the provider that has been most aggressive in pursuing competition on pricing against Vanguard and BlackRock, saw inflows more than double to $6.2bn from $2.8bn in 2012.Inflows for First Trust surged to $8.2bn from $1.2bn in the previous year. Its AlphaDEX-branded range reflected investors’ growing appetite for “smart-beta” solutions.Guggenheim Investments, which runs a series of equally weighted equity ETFs, saw inflows leap to $6.8bn from just $0.7bn in 2012. Guggenheim also offers a suite of target-date fixed income ETFs that have proved highly popular with investors.Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim, said the improving performance of the US economy should translate into greater confidence, making investors comfortable with more risk, and leading to a strong performance for US equities in the next few months.ProShares, which offers a toolkit of “alternative” ETFs, gathered inflows of $5.7bn, up from just $0.5bn in 2012. It also benefited from a revival of interest last year in leveraged and inverse ETFs, which multiply index returns.The performance of the US stock market this year is likely to have an important bearing on the performance of the ETF industry.Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, said the US stock market was facing headwinds from higher interest rates and 2013’s substantial increase in equity valuations, but argued the market should still make further gains in 2014.“US equities may not be as inexpensive as they were a year ago, but they remain more attractive than bonds and cash,” said Mr Koesterich. He added that international stocks appeared more reasonably priced than US equities and were worth attention.“We would also encourage investors with longer-term time horizons to consider emerging markets, despite their recent underperformance, as they too offer compelling value,” said Mr Koesterich.
241;STT;State Street Corp;2014-01-05T03:23:54Z;Pension funds beat actuarial targets;Rebounding equity markets have boosted performance over the past decade;Rebounding equity markets mean most UK pension funds are likely to have outperformed their actuarial assumptions over the past decade, according to State Street Investment Analytics.Separately, US pension funds sponsored by S&P 1500 companies saw their funding ratios surge to 95 per cent at the end of December, according to Mercer, the consultancy, up from 74 per cent in December 2012 and the highest year-end figure since 2007.State Street estimated that the average UK pension fund generated an investment return of 10 per cent in 2013. Charity funds, which typically have a greater exposure to “real” assets such as equities, thanks to their longer time horizons, will have done better still, returning 13 per cent.As a result, the typical pension fund will have returned around 10 per cent a year over the past five years and 8 per cent per annum during the past decade, “comfortably exceeding most actuaries’ assumptions for asset growth”, said Jeanette Patrizio, senior vice-president of SSIA.In 2012, the UK’s Financial Services Authority told pension providers to reduce their midpoint projection for long-term returns from 7 per cent to just 5 per cent, in line with the forecasts of most European and Asian funds.US funds are still factoring in long-term returns of 8 per cent a year. Many commentators believe this has allowed public plans in particular to sidestep painful reforms.However, Mercer found the collective deficit of US private sector S&P 1500 schemes has fallen to $103bn, from $557bn a year ago.The improvement was driven by a combination of strong equity returns and a rise in corporate bond yields, which allows schemes to discount their liabilities at a faster rate.Despite these factors being replicated in the UK, Mercer said the accounting deficits of FTSE 350 schemes actually rose from £72bn to £97bn (a funding ratio of 85 per cent) last year, due to an increase in long-term inflation expectations.

244;STT;State Street Corp;2013-12-06T13:10:22Z;Deutsche switches ETF tactics in Europe;Responding to competiton from US rivals;Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management has announced major changes to its exchange traded funds operations with a radical shift to its business model.As the largest provider of derivative-linked ETFs in Europe, DeAWM has vociferously argued that so-called “synthetic” products are a cheaper, more efficient option for investors than rival physical ETFs that buy the constituents of a benchmark index.However, investor appetite for synthetic ETFs has waned following fierce criticism of these funds by a number of regulators since 2011.Assets in synthetic ETFs have shrunk and their providers have lost market share in Europe to their US rivals, BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard, which have all seen growth.DeAWM recognises the shift and will convert 18 synthetic equity ETFs with assets of around €9.5bn to physical funds. Total assets in DeAWM’s European ETF range currently stand at €35.9bn, ranking it as the second-largest provider overall in Europe behind BlackRock.Reinhard Bellet, DeAWM’s head of passive asset management, said the change was being made in response to demand from clients who had shown a preference for physical ETFs when tracking mainstream equity indices such as the Dax and Euro Stoxx 50.“There is no doubt that the future is ‘physical’ for replicating mainstream equity indices,” said Mr Bellet.But he emphasised that DeAWM was not abandoning synthetic ETFs which it still regards as superior for investing in certain emerging equity markets, fixed income and other asset classes such as commodities.Fees will remain unchanged for the converted ETFs with one exception: the total expense ratio of the Euro Stoxx 50 ETF will rise to 9 basis points, compared with zero previously.Mr Bellet said DeAWM was prepared for further competition on fees in Europe, noting that “certain large US competitors with deep pockets” seemed intent on starting a US style price war. Both BlackRock and Vanguard have announced fee cuts to some European listed ETFs this year.DeAWM’s European operations have registered outflows of just under €4.5bn so far in 2013, due mainly to large sell orders for Dax ETFs by a small number of clients.
245;STT;State Street Corp;2013-12-01T05:52:12Z;State Street custodian bank delves into data mining;Banks seek profit from helping managers exploit investment data;With low interest rates crimping its net interest margins, State Street is the latest custodian bank to attempt to drive its sluggish revenues higher by moving into data mining.State Street’s idea is to profit from helping asset managers exploit investment data to gain an edge against competitors. This cannot be described as an original thought, however, as BNY Mellon and other rival banks are pursuing similar strategies.“It’s a logical move when you are a custodial bank and you are at the centre of the marketplace,” explains Brad Hintz, an analyst with the research group Sanford Bernstein.As things stand, the asset managers and pension funds who hire custodian banks are swamped by the onslaught of data coming their way as new regulations create changes across the investment industry and electronic trading jacks up the speed and volume of transactions taking place.“Our investors are getting overwhelmed by data …It has become fundamental to competitive positioning and creating a sustainable business that will grow in time,” said Jeff Conway, an executive vice-president overseeing State Street’s data and analytics division. “There’s more demand for finding ways to address it, then there is supply that’s creating business opportunities.”Custodian banks receive non-public, though arguably not material financial information, from their clients. Put together this data can become a source of information that has potential value. And statisticians and systems designers now build platforms that can discover understandable patterns in the large data sets using statistics, numerical linear algebra and optimisation.As a result, custodian banks now seize the chance to roll out systems which permit clients to sift through the wreckage of unfiltered gigabytes of information and pinpoint business and investment trends that might improve the way they do business.Suresh Kumar, chief information officer with BNY Mellon, sums the situation up this way: “The ease of access to data and the quality of that data are not that good …Anyone can collect a lot of data, but you have to realise what its significance is.”Albridge, a division of Pershing, which BNY Mellon owns, for example offers a range of programmes. One allows asset managers to monitor their relationships with the subadvisors they deal with. Another identifies trends in asset flows and transactions to pinpoint opportunities to profit. And a third analyses the profitability of products, advisers and clients.Analysts who cover custodian banks expect State Street’s foray into data mining to be costly, but no indication of its expense as well as its revenues will be released until first-quarter earnings come at the start of next year. A spokesman for BNY Mellon also declined to discuss the profitability of its programme.The push into data mining by State Street arrives as custodial banks’ business models face pressure because foreign exchange, cash management and securities lending are not the profit centres they were.Custodial banks boast more cash on deposit these days, but low interest rates hurt net interest margins, so they are making less money. State Street’s net interest margins, for example, fell to 1.33 per cent in the third quarter of this year, from 1.53 per cent in the same period last year. Rival BNY Mellon’s net interest margins also dropped to 1.16 per cent by the close of September from 1.2 per cent in the third quarter of 2012.As State Street and BNY Mellon wade into the data mining business, analysts continue to debate why these banks lack pricing power in their bread-and-butter custody businesses. Conspiracy theories abound.“Custodial banks are an oligopoly that doesn’t know how to use its pricing power,” concludes Mr Hintz. “Opec and the custodial banks need to organise a meeting so the banks learn how to run an oligopoly.”A more serious analysis also put forth by Mr Hintz is that custodians lack pricing power because the asset managers who they count as clients do as well. And it is no secret that asset managers want to keep custody fees low as they pass these costs on to their investors. “In the asset management business, barriers to entry are low, competition between firms is high, and the threat of cheaper substitutes (index funds, ETFs) is believed to have pressured pricing for many years,” wrote Mr Hintz in a report published last May.As custodian banks zero in on data mining as a profitable new business, questions are also being raised about their rights to own the data they exploit for commercial purposes. Whether they will be stopped in their tracks some day by lawyers remains up for debate. Who does the data belong to – the client or the bank? and how can it be used? “Right now the customers providing the data to the custodial banks give it to them for free. Will this continue?” asks Mr Hintz in a final question.
246;STT;State Street Corp;2013-11-27T09:58:04Z;Guest post: navigating Asia’s fragmented markets;;"By Paul Khoury of State StreetLarge asset managers from New York to New Delhi have for years sought ways to succeed in Asian markets. Now, the region is becoming pivotal in many asset managers’ plans for the future. A combination of more open markets and the emergence of a large and affluent middle class in the region is creating demand for the kind of sophisticated investment products that asset managers are keen to provide.The scope for growth in Asia is vast: 60 per cent of the world’s population and 30 per cent of the world’s GDP resides in Asia, yet at the moment the region accounts for only 13 per cent of global assets under management. Those figures suggest Asia could become the largest asset management region in the world. But achieving this vision will not be easy, as the job of growing AUM in Asia is arguably more complicated than in any other major region. A recent study by State Street, based on a survey of 200 senior asset management executives in key Asia Pacific markets, reveals how companies in the region are navigating these complex markets.The survey confirms that asset managers with interests in Asia are prioritising expansion across the region, especially into frontier markets. In fact, “penetrating new growth markets” is the most commonly cited strategic priority in the survey. Among the destinations for expansion most frequently mentioned are Malaysia (cited as a top target by 54 per cent) and Thailand (43 per cent).As veterans of the region know, enthusiasm for Asia’s vast markets needs to be balanced with a realistic assessment of their challenges. One of the potential pitfalls that companies face is trying to implement a one-size-fits-all strategy across the region. Asian markets are famously fragmented. Different levels of economic development, growth rates, cultures, tax regimes and product preferences create major complexity. Perhaps most challenging of all, according to our research, is the task of managing across very different regulatory regimes. Asset managers hoping to penetrate Asia must combine more targeted strategies with infrastructures and distribution systems that are scalable enough to meet the demands and regulatory requirements of hugely diverse economies.No wonder, then, that over half (51 per cent) of respondents in the survey named fragmentation as a serious or very serious challenge for their business. It is worth noting that among firms that operate in more than one country, the figure rises to 63 per cent, suggesting that those who have already expanded within Asia are realistic about the challenges. Indeed, many of the executives quoted in our new report acknowledge that one solution will not fit all markets as the dynamics are quite different.Regulations governing asset management and related financial structures differ vastly from country to country in Asia. There is currently no passport system for investment products (such as the one used in Europe) and national regulatory regimes have moved in different directions. While Hong Kong and Singapore, for example, are set up as cross-border centres oriented towards offshore markets, large emerging markets such as China, Indonesia and India are more internally focused and prohibit the distribution of offshore funds. Other emerging markets, such as Malaysia and Thailand, have yet to develop the institutional structures needed to distribute overseas funds, but they do allow them to be sold through wrapped products.What does this regulatory patchwork mean for firms trying to grow a regional business? State Street’s research suggests it creates major challenges and risks, while also restricting product innovation and adding to the administrative burden.

Momentum for its ETF business has been building rapidly with inflows of $2.5bn so far this year, making it the third fastest growing provider in Europe behind its longer established rivals iShares and State Street Global Advisors.“The growth of Vanguard’s European business reflects investors’ confidence in our range of funds,” said Mr Rampulla.The three largest US providers have won an unprecedented share of inflows in Europe this year, piling pressure on domestic European competitors to respond.Deborah Fuhr, founding partner at ETFGI, a consultancy, said charges for Vanguard’s ETFs were substantially cheaper than the average across Europe, even before the latest price cut.Vanguard’s asset-weighted total expense ratio averaged 12 bps at the end of October, compared with an average of 37 bps across other European ETF providers, according to ETFGI.“Lowering fees is a good thing for investors as it improves the performance of their ETF or mutual fund,” said Ms Fuhr.In September, BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, announced fee reductions on two ETFs aimed at “buy-and hold” investors. It also harmonised charges between its existing iShares range and the Credit Suisse ETFs business, which it acquired at the start of the year. Total expense ratios on 10 like-for-like products were harmonised with the lower TER applying in each case.Lyxor, the third-largest provider in Europe, announced f ee cuts for seven of its largest ETFs in October 2012 while also dismissing any suggestions that it might spark a European ETF price war.

But in spite of ramping up their investments in data technologies and platforms, less than a third currently gain any competitive advantage from their data and analytics capabilities, according to a survey of 400 asset managers and owners conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit on behalf of State Street.“The ability to aggregate, analyse and transform data has become key to institutional investors ability to compete,” said Jeff Conway, the head of State Street’s Global Exchange business.Data accuracy was cited as the top challenge in the survey. Institutional investors can draw on hundreds of external data sources and 42 per cent of those surveyed noted a lack of data integration facilities. A third also complained about high pricing and the lack of timeliness in external data.State Street’s research also showed that institutional investors divided into data leaders and laggards.Leaders felt their data capabilities helped them better manage risks across multi-asset portfolios and to keep pace with the evolving demand of regulators and compliance.Effective data management was also seen by leaders as essential to developing profitable investment strategies and acting on them in real time.Investors, said Mr Conway, that developed the right data tools and strategies would be rewarded with better insights, improved performance measurement and a deeper capacity to understand risk across their global activities.Three-quarters of all those surveyed said they planned to spend more on portfolio optimisation tools while 86 per cent cited order and execution management systems as their top priority.“Without the ability to deploy data to solve a problem, it is just noise,” warned Mr Conway.

251;STT;State Street Corp;2013-11-10T06:59:12Z;BlackRock asks where European ETF rivals are;Provider seeks remedy to sluggish growth in European ETF market;BlackRock – the world’s largest exchange traded funds provider – has called for greater competition within the European market to act as an antidote to sluggish growth.Mark Wiedman, global head of iShares, the ETF arm of BlackRock, says: “One player [BlackRock] cannot build the entire ETF market in Europe alone.”His comments follow another year of disappointing growth for Europe’s ETF industry. Net investor inflows into European-listed ETFs (funds and products) reached just $12.4bn by the end of October, less than half the $25.3bn gathered the same time last year, according to ETFGI, a consultancy.“We welcome other players offering choices and helping to grow the market. But it will be a long road,” says Mr Wiedman.BlackRock has built a commanding position in Europe, controlling almost half of the assets held in European-listed ETFs, up from just under a third at the end of 2010.But momentum in Europe is now building for State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard, which previously lacked a meaningful presence in the region.The three largest US providers have won an unprecedented share of cash inflows in 2013, piling pressure on domestic companies to respond.Inflows for BlackRock’s iShares European operations have risen by almost a third to $17.4bn so far this year.State Street Global Advisors, a long-time underperformer in Europe, has seen a dramatic improvement, with inflows so far up 63.2 per cent to $3.1bn.Jim Ross, global head of ETFs at SSgA, says State Street is stepping up its efforts to “find new friends”.SSgA has promised a “concentrated effort” to increase the appeal of its funds business to financial advisers on both sides of the Atlantic.Mr Ross says experience from the US shows that once financial advisers introduce ETFs into their portfolios, their usage usually broadens.“Advisers are getting smarter about what they are paying for and making sure they are getting value,” says Mr Ross.He adds that SSgA has “a lot more to offer” in educating clients about the benefits of ETFs. He admits the company “can do a better job to ensure that the SPDR brand, and what lies behind it, is better known”.SSgA’s comments are a tacit acknowledgment that iShares and Vanguard have both been more aggressive and effective in promoting their ETF brands, particularly among financial advisers.Nick Blake, head of UK retail at Vanguard, says the company’s low-cost message has struck a chord among financial advisers who have been re-evaluating the products and services they offer clients.In little more than a year since starting its European operations, Vanguard has already attracted inflows of almost $2.5bn.In contrast, a host of European-based companies including Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, Lyxor, the Nordic provider Xact, and BNP Paribas’ Easy ETF have all registered outflows of more than $1bn.The sell-off in the gold market this year has also contributed to more than $1bn of outflows for ETF Securities, ZKB and Swiss & Global.The current slow pace of growth for ETFs in Europe has caught the attention of European regulators who plan to examine why their adoption by retail investors has remained so low.At a conference last week, Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority, highlighted the contrast between Europe and the US, where ETF usage by retail investors is much higher.“We are interested to understand better why retail exposure to ETFs [in Europe] appears to be relatively low,” said Mr Maijoor.ETF adoption by retail investors is expected to improve if new rules banning commission payments to financial advisers for selling products are more widely adopted in Europe.The UK implemented new rules for advisers at the start of this year following the Retail Distribution Review. The Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany are also either considering or in the process of implementing similar changes.Mr Wiedman says the US example shows that greater ETF adoption usually follows the shift to a fee-based model for financial advisers.“Addressing retail is the next big frontier in the European ETF market. We will see much deeper penetration for ETFs, but it will take time,” he says.He remains confident that substantial growth lies ahead, predicting that European ETF assets can more than double from their current $413bn to more than $900bn by the end of 2017, offering rich pickings for the competitors that succeed.

254;STT;State Street Corp;2013-10-24T17:17:23Z;Fidelity fires broadside in ETF ‘price war’;New range of US sector-based ETFs launched;Fidelity Investments, the $1.9bn global financial services group, has waded into the “price war” among US exchange traded fund providers with the launch of a range of US sector ETFs that compete directly with offerings from State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard, the second and third largest ETF providers globally.Fidelity’s sector-based ETFs provide exposure to 10 broad categories in the US stock market and carry a total expense ratio of 12 basis points, undercutting rival funds offered by Vanguard that charge between 14 and 19 bps. SSgA’s Select Sector SPDRs have a TER of 18bp.The Select Sector SPDRs have become some of the most widely traded instruments on the US stock exchange with extremely tight trading spreads. With the US stock market reaching an all-time high this month, trading volumes and inflows for Select Sector SPDRs have risen strongly. So far this year, they have gathered $22.5bn in net new inflows, taking their total assets to $73.4bn.Fidelity was a pioneer in sector-based investing, launching its first actively managed sector mutual fund in 1981. It offers 44 actively managed sector mutual funds with $56bn in assets under management. The new suite of ETFs is intended to complement its sector mutual funds, ensuring investors have a choice of passive and actively managed products.“Since the financial crisis five years ago, investors and advisers have told us that they are looking for additional ways to diversify their portfolios and get exposure to specific industries outside of the typical cap-weighted or style specific options such as large or small-cap, or growth and value,” said Anthony Rochte, president of SelectCo, Fidelity’s dedicated sector investing division.Mr Rochte said the new ETFs would provide investors and advisers with building blocks that would help them find new ways of generating alpha through asset allocation and to better manage portfolio risks.The new ETFs will be available commission-free via Fidelity’s brokerage platforms provided a client has a minimum balance of $2,500. From 2014, the ETF will also be subject to a trading fee if held for less than 30 days.The launch on Thursday represents the second significant step in Fidelity’s efforts to build a presence in the rapidly growing ETF market.In March, Fidelity announced that it was teaming up with BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, in a strategic alliance aimed at boosting US retail investor interest in ETFs.
255;STT;State Street Corp;2013-09-29T05:15:49Z;State Street moves to woo advisers;New focus on advisers to drive growth;State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-largest asset manager, will make a “concentrated effort” to increase the appeal of its funds business to financial advisers.It has historically had little success with this client base in either the US or Europe.Michael Karpik, SSgA’s head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said investments were being made in “people, products and processes”.SSgA intends to hire around 10 staff to add to existing teams in Switzerland, Italy, Germany and the UK.It also wants to address gaps in its active fund range and is expanding its internal hedge fund operations to compliment its current offering.“SSgA may not be well known as an active manager but we are aiming to change that. We already have $120bn in actively managed strategies that broadly serve the institutional space and we intend to develop that further,” said Mr Karpik.SSgA is planning to shift the domicile of some of its exchange traded fund range from France to Ireland and some active mutual funds from France to Luxembourg to allow it to passport products across Europe more easily.State Street ranked as the 16th fastest growing mutual fund manager in Europe in the first half of 2013, with European sales of €2.3bn, according to Lipper, the data provider.SSgA recently appointed Alexis Marinof to lead its ETF operations in Europe. Mr Marinof ran SSgA’s Dubai office. Insiders say he is highly regarded for his success in working with wealthy Middle East clients.SSgA’s ETF business in Europe has pulled in inflows of $2.6bn in the first eight months of 2013, double the $1.3bn gathered over the same period last year, according to ETFGI, a consultancy.
256;STT;State Street Corp;2013-09-22T03:19:08Z;ETF ‘treasure map’ revealed;Institutional investor use of ETFs on the rise;Bank of America Merrill Lynch has emerged as the largest institutional user of exchange traded funds, with holdings of more than $50bn, according to a report that for the first time breaks down the ownership of ETFs.One of the curiosities of the rapidly growing $2.2tn ETF market is just how little is known about the institutions using these vehicles. Publicly available data on investor types, size and location, the products they use and how these have changed over time has remained a mystery.But ETFGI, a consultancy, has published findings that now reveal the largest institutional users of ETFs.Aside from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, ETFGI’s global ownership survey shows that about $166bn of ETF assets are held by Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, UBS, BMO, JPMorgan and Citi, which control massive positions due to their dual roles as market makers and investment advisers.Scott Ebner, global head of product development at State Street Global Advisors, said some of these institutions also have broad networks of financial advisers combine ETFs along with mutual funds, stocks and bonds to provide tailored investment solutions to their wealth management or individual clients.ETFGI’s report also identified John Paulson as the hedge fund manager with the largest exposure to ETFs, due to his vast holdings in SPDR Gold Shares. Tudor and Quantitative Investment Management, a Virginia-based computer-driven trader, are also revealed as having more than $1bn invested in ETFs.Harvard University is the largest endowment holder with $561m in ETFs, well ahead of the endowments of Stanford and Yale, which have ETF portfolios of $146m and $28m respectively.ETFGI was able to track down institutional investment managers that use ETFs from 74,000 reports filed to US regulators and held on the Thomson Reuters Ownership database.The analysis suggests that the number of institutional investors using ETFs and exchange traded products has almost doubled over the past seven years to nearly 3,400 by the end of 2012.Deborah Fuhr, founding partner at ETFGI, said many ETF providers have struggled to identify users of their products as investors are not required to provide their details at the point of sale, unlike buyers of mutual funds.“This is like finding a map to hidden treasure for ETF providers, banks and brokers, exchanges, index providers and others that sell and trade ETFs,” said Ms Fuhr.This article has been corrected since original publication to reflect the fact that Harvard University endowment holdings were $561m, not $561bn as originally stated.
257;STT;State Street Corp;2013-09-16T21:00:40Z;US: Rivals vie for custom in changing world of swaps;Reforms open up an industry dominated by big banks;The financial reforms triggered by the financial crisis are starting to make their presence felt in the $300tn privately negotiated US derivatives market.With the counterparty risk of swap transactions now being assumed by centralised clearing houses, the focus of the industry is on how the trading of swaps will develop.A number of firms are formalising new transaction venues known as swap execution facilities, and these “Sefs” will compete with established futures exchanges to enable trading between banks and institutional investors. The development is seen as opening up an industry long dominated by big global derivative banks to greater competition, resulting in lower trading costs for investors.The new swap trading era pits a host of players in open competition against each other, from the well-established interdealer brokers such as ICAP, to big platforms run by Bloomberg, Tradeweb and MarketAxess, to a number of new entrants such as State Street and Javelin.The leading derivative exchanges, namely CME Group and the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), and other vendors are seeking to entice users of over-the-counter (OTC) swaps towards futures contracts that are cheaper to clear centrally.As Wall Street has lobbied hard to water down financial reform, an undercurrent among players in the established swaps industry has been the fear that exchanges such as CME and ICE would emerge as the big winners from a wholesale evolution of OTC swaps from a telephone-based market to computers.“Either OTC swaps or swap futures could be the winner,” says Charley Cooper, head of exchange-traded derivatives at State Street Global Exchange, which has filed a Sef application, and also provides technology support for the Eris Exchange and its swap futures contract.“In our discussions with clients we heard a preference for OTC swaps and swap futures, so we are offering them both, so we can capitalise on the way it plays out,” says Mr Cooper.Goldman Sachs and other dealers are supporting the CME’s swap futures contract – which is also based on a Goldman patent – while the Eris swap contract has the support of Morgan Stanley.According to Richard Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill Partners, leading executives at the CME believe it is not yet clear how far the OTC market will shift towards futures, while the presence of dealers remains important.“The CME believes the dealers will continue to play a significant role in the trading and clearing of IRS [interest rate swaps], at least in the near term,” says Mr Repetto. “On a five-year forward view, CME believes it is still unclear how much of the OTC will stay cleared and remain OTC or convert to a futures-like product.”Chris Edmonds, president of ICE Clear Credit says their credit index futures contract, launched in May, was developed in response to demand from investors who may not generally participate in the OTC market. “This is a credit product that appeals to non-traditional players, looking to hedge macro credit risk.”Mr Edmonds says ICE is looking at launching a full suite of credit-related products that would complement existing OTC products in the future.As the world between dealers and investors converges, all prospective swap trading platforms will need to connect with a wide range of participants. For interdealer brokers, this means moving beyond talking to a limited number of banks. Existing platforms such as Bloomberg, TradeWeb and MarketAxess that already link banks with institutional investors are expected to hit the ground running once Sefs are fully operational.Many of the new trading venues will not only offer streaming prices that enable users to buy or sell a swap on a screen with the click of a computer mouse, they are also going to provide a request for quote (RFQ) service, whereby an investor can seek a price from a limited number of banks or other market makers.“The winners will be those platforms that listen to their customers and give them a choice of ways to transact,” says James Cawley, chief executive officer at Javelin Capital Markets, which has filed to become a Sef. “In a commoditised market place, it is the relationship that wins.”The use of RFQ is seen as helping banks to preserve their market share, but if more investors gravitate towards an anonymous electronic trading book, it is seen as shifting the market to an exchange model.Chris Ferreri, a managing director at ICAP North America says while it is too soon to tell whether the OTC market will move towards a futures-type model, the cost of trading is a key factor for users of derivatives. “If the cost to clear and margin a future is less than a swap, then it’s more of a challenge for clients to transact swaps and not futures,” he says.
258;STT;State Street Corp;2013-09-15T03:35:57Z;Investors demand more visible ‘alternatives’;Increasingly sophisticated investors are demanding improvements in their alternative assets;Investors’ demands for improvements in the transparency and liquidity of their “ alternative” investments are among the biggest challenges facing managers of hedge funds, private equity and property, a global survey shows.State Street, in collaboration with Preqin, a research group, polled 391 alternative fund managers and found that over half (52 per cent) reported investors’ appetite for greater transparency regarding risk and fund performance as the biggest driver of change, while a third (32 per cent) cited demand for liquidity.“The biggest changes in the alternatives industry are being driven by investors who are becoming increasingly sophisticated and demanding,” says George Sullivan, global head of State Street’s alternative solutions group.McKinsey, the consultancy, forecast last year that alternatives would account for 28 per cent of investors’ portfolios in the US and 15 per cent of European institutional investors’ assets by the end of 2013. Assets held in alternative assets stood at $5.1tn at the end of 2012, according to Towers Watson, the consultancy.Luba Nikulina, global head of private markets research at Towers Watson, says a number of alternative managers have strengthened information and reporting functions, because investors are showing a greater appetite for due diligence since the financial crisis.“Investors are doing much more analysis comparing the performance and risks of alternative managers’ strategies,” says Ms Nikulina, noting that it is not straightforward to compare the performance of a private equity investment with listed equity.She adds that it is not the case that investors uniformly want more liquidity from alternatives. She emphasises that many investors have become much more thoughtful about their budgets for illiquid strategies and how to best allocate that capital.“Investors with longer-term horizons, such as pension funds, are happy to lock up part of their capital in illiquid strategies,” says Ms Nikulina. She points out that some defined benefit schemes realised their expectations for de-risking were too optimistic, given the very low rates available on government bonds.Joseph McDonnell, head of Morgan Stanley’s alternative solutions group in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, says growing numbers of pension funds are recognising the importance of allocating to alternatives, both as a generator of returns and as a diversifier within their overall portfolio of bonds and equities.Pension funds need guidance to understand the construction of an alternatives portfolio and how it fits with their objectives, adds Mr McDonnell, rather than advice on which particular hedge fund manager or private equity company might be worth investing with.“The approach of pension funds to alternative portfolios can be very different. Corporates tend to make smaller allocations that have a large hedge fund component, while public sector schemes are more interested in a wide spectrum of illiquid investment opportunities.”The State Street survey also identifies fundraising as the most urgent challenge over the next five years, cited by 82 per cent of respondents, followed by performance generation (54 per cent). Almost a third (29 per cent) of respondents plan to offer new investment strategies in response to increasingly fierce levels of competition for investor capital.“High levels of competition for fundraising are spurring managers to try to distinguish themselves from their rivals,” says Mr Sullivan.Ms Nikulina says there has been a “flight to quality” following the financial crisis. But she also notes that a significant number of alternative managers are struggling to raise money, even if they offer improved terms and conditions.“This can make it difficult for them to retain and motivate their people. Fundraising can be a matter of life and death and so it is a real source of stress,” says Ms Nikulina.The survey shows merger and acquisition activity is expected to rise, with 10 per cent of alternative managers planning to acquire another business in the next five years, compared with 7 per cent who had already done so over the past five.Ms Nikulina says there has been some consolidation among fund of fund managers and also acquisitions among the larger private equity players that have expanded into infrastructure, credit and property to make their overall earnings less cyclical.
259;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
260;STT;State Street Corp;2013-09-06T18:36:33Z;Progress into mainstream;RDR expected to spur ETF adoption in the UK;US financial advisers are now as likely to allocate new money from their clients to exchange traded funds as traditional mutual funds, clear evidence of how ETFs are progressing into mainstream investment products used by retail investors.Almost three-quarters (73 per cent) of US advisers now use ETFs, compared to 46 per cent in 2007, according to a recent report by Cogent Research, a consultancy.“ETFs are popular as they help to lower costs,” says Meredith Rice, senior product director at Cogent. She highlights the shift among US advisers to a fee-based model, where they are paid based on the value of clients’ assets, as focusing attention on costs.Fran Kinniry, a principal with Vanguard, the world’s fourth largest fund manager, says there has been a change in the willingness of financial advisers to use ETFs.“ Fund fees have become the number one issue for financial advisers to consider because of the low returns that are expected from stocks and bonds in the next few years,” says Mr Kinniry.He adds that financial advisers in the US, UK, Canada and Australia are now working to a fiduciary standard as a result of regulatory reforms so they are required to invest clients’ money as carefully as their own.Mr Kinniry says this was a “significant secular change” and is likely to become a global phenomenon.Sweden has just announced that it will examine fund commissions and fees while the Netherlands is expected to ban “retrocession” payments (inducements) to advisers for asset management products from January 2014.Germany’s financial regulator is also considering its position on commission payments and a Europe-wide ban could follow the Mifid II review.Eleanor Hope-Bell, head of the State Street Global Advisors’ UK intermediaries business group, says Europe is heading in the same direction as the US but there are still fundamental differences in the engagement of financial advisers with ETFs on both sides of the Atlantic.“There are still a lot of hurdles to overcome before ETF usage among financial advisers in Europe reaches the same level as in the US. Building a unified retail investor base for ETFs will be much harder to achieve in Europe than in the US,” cautions Ms Hope-Bell.The UK was the first big market in Europe to introduce a ban on commission payments under the Retail Distribution Review which came into force at the start of 2013.Mark Johnson, head of UK sales at BlackRock’s iShares unit, says he expects RDR to be a “game changer”.“We are already seeing growing numbers of financial advisers in the UK using ETFs either in model portfolios or by outsourcing investment decisions to discretionary fund managers who use ETFs in their portfolios,” says Mr Johnson.That view is echoed by Ms Hope-Bell.“We are seeing financial advisers’ interest in ETFs growing via their increasing use of model portfolios and the trend for outsourcing of portfolio management to discretionary fund managers who build ETF-only portfolios or portfolios that mix ETFs and traditional actively managed mutual funds,” she says.UK investment managers that are pitching for financial advisers to outsource client funds to ETF-only portfolios include Evercore Pan-Asset Management, SCM Private, 7IM and WorldTrack.BlackRock recently launched a UK version of its iShares “connect” service, which links financial advisers to investment strategists that make use of ETFs in their portfolios. SCM Private, JM Finn, Quartet and Thurleigh Investment Managers have signed up in the initial phase of the UK “connect” rollout.In the US, iShares is tracking 110 ETF strategists with $64bn in ETF assets. This number is expected to grow further as a three-year record is required for inclusion and new entrants are continuing to join.Edward Allen, a portfolio manager at Thurleigh, the UK wealth manager which uses ETFs mainly for asset allocation purposes, says: “We are very focused on the cost of managing money. Spreads [dealing costs] on the largest ETFs have become vanishingly thin so they offer very efficient trading and it is possible to move substantial chunks of capital in and out of different asset classes with ease.”Ms Hope-Bell cautions that one possible unintended consequence of RDR may be the emergence of an “advice gap” if some retail investors do not have sufficient assets to justify paying a fee to a financial adviser.“This is potentially an important issue for high street banks and there is a great deal of work to do in raising the awareness of ETFs in this category,” she says.Mr Johnson notes that bank distribution models in continental Europe are already being transformed by ETFs. “We are seeing product structures in banks developing new investment solutions with ETF-only portfolios or using ETFs in blend with index-based products and active mutual funds,” he says.
261;STT;State Street Corp;2013-09-06T18:36:33Z;ETFs: time to call the plumbers?;ETFs are driving a revolution in financial markets;Exchange traded funds are driving a revolution in financial markets and the pace of change is accelerating.But as ETFs become increasingly popular, more questions are being asked about their risks.Critics cite a number of recent difficulties in trading ETFs as evidence that problems in the industry’s “plumbing” systems flare up in periods of market stress. They complain that the rapid growth of the ETF industry is concentrating risks and could threaten large scale market disruption.ETF managers vehemently dispute these claims. They say that the critics misunderstand how ETFs perform and the benefits they offer investors.Mark Wiedman, global head of iShares, the ETF arm of BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, says ETFs acquitted themselves “with flying colours” in the latest bout of market turmoil in late May and June.ETF activity tends to rise significantly when market volatility increases. Mr Wiedman says that fact has provided investors with greater confidence that ETFs are robust in periods of stress.He predicts that “ETFs will play a much bigger role in global capital markets as both institutional and retail investors become more comfortable with advantages offered by this new technology”.Global inflows into ETFs (funds and products) reached $148.5bn in the first seven months of the year, up 13.8 per cent compared with the same period in 2012, according to ETFGI, a consultancy.The strength of the overall inflows is notable as it has coincided with severe weakness in two previously vital drivers of the industry’s growth, gold and emerging markets ETFs, where investors have withdrawn more than $40bn so far this year.The US ETF market remains the primary generator of growth, responsible for almost 80 per cent of global inflows this year, helped by the S&P 500’s rally to an all-time high.Scott Ebner, global head of product development and research at State Street Global Advisors, says some observers describe the US ETF market as mature but it is still in a growth phase.Mr Wiedman echoes this, saying ETFs are becoming the preferred vehicle of choice for passive exposures for both US financial advisers and retail investors, outside 401k retirement plans.“But there is much more growth ahead. With $750bn invested by US retail investors in ETFs compared with their holdings of $10.2tn in US active mutual funds, ETFs still have a lot of catching-up to do,” he says.In the US, ETFs regularly trade more than $60bn on a daily basis, regularly accounting for a quarter of all US stock market activity by value.“ETFs are attractive to both long-term holders due to their low fees as well as active traders because of their tight spreads,” says Phil Mackintosh, global head of trading strategy at Credit Suisse.Critics argue that ETFs linked to less liquid underlying assets, such as high yield bonds, have not lived up to their expected standards when volatility rises.But industry participants reject this charge.“The costs of trading some ETFs may be higher in times of market stress. But ETF trading takes place in a highly competitive environment and the additional utility that ETFs offer via intraday trading is extremely valuable,” says Mr Ebner.Mr Wiedman adds that growing trading volumes in fixed income ETFs demonstrate that more investors want to transact in a public marketplace where prices are transparent rather than via opaque over-the-counter transactions.The industry’s rapid growth is leading to mounting competitive pressures, particularly in the US.Providers loathe the suggestion that they are fighting a “ price war” to secure market share, aware that their profit margins could suffer if they cut charges aggressively without a corresponding increase in asset growth.Most product launches, however, are competitively priced against established rivals, as demonstrated recently by Charles Schwab’s new smart beta range which undercut established rivals.In Europe, significant changes are also afoot.BlackRock, already the largest player in Europe, acquired Credit Suisse’s ETF operations earlier this year as part of a move to boost its presence in Switzerland. Warburg Pincus, the private equity group, has said it would like to acquire ETF businesses in Europe while Amundi, the French asset manager, has signalled its appetite to act in any consolidation wave.Vanguard has rapidly accumulated more than $1bn in assets just a year after launching its first European listed ETFs while SSgA’s European operations have picked up pace and new entrants such as First Trust are continuing to target the region.Deutsche Bank and Lyxor have revamped their business models to respond to these new competitive pressures.“We expect to see more managers from around the world wanting to enter the European ETF market to offer investors access to a wider range of expertise from within the asset management community,” says Matt Johnson, European head of distribution at ETF Securities, the London based provider.Asian ETF markets, while at a much earlier stage of development, are also developing rapidly, most clearly in China where the process of liberalising capital markets has led to a spate of new products being launched.But other Asian countries are also innovating, such as the Philippines which has just started accepting listing applications for ETFs.As the industry develops, it remains unclear just how many of the large existing array of sub-scale ETFs have a sustainable long-term future. A record number of products closed in the first half of the year, suggesting a growing realism among providers that not every launch will prosper.Mr Mackintosh at Credit Suisse notes that the majority of assets are in ETFs that have an expense ratio less than 30 basis points while trading is heavily concentrated in products with a bid-ask spread less than 3bp, underlining the cut-throat level of competition.With 4,883 exchange traded funds and products currently available, it might appear that the limits of innovation are being tested, as shown by the sceptical reaction that followed recent proposals for a Bitcoin ETF.However, as the strong demand this year for currency hedged Japanese equity ETFs has demonstrated, even relatively simple product innovations can generate significant inflows if they meet investors’ needs.Mr Wiedman at iShares points out that fixed income markets remain relatively untapped by ETFs.“Assets held in fixed income ETFs at just over $300bn make up just a small part of the $100tn invested in bond markets globally. But we expect to see much greater adoption as fixed income ETFs develop greater liquidity and bond-like analytics become more readily available,” he says.Another potentially rich seam for exploitation lies in advanced or smart beta strategies that offer a different balance of risks and returns than that attached to conventional market capitalisation products.Advanced beta strategies have been long used by sophisticated institutional investors but these mandates were frequently undisclosed. Although the smart beta term is sometimes misused, ETF flows have given such strategies much greater visibility.Another unexplored area lies with active ETFs. US regulators recently lifted a ban on the use of derivatives in new ETFs, a move which is expected to pave the way for new products
262;STT;State Street Corp;2013-09-06T18:36:33Z;Education key to Asia ETF growth, say providers;Locally domiciled ETFs offer tax advantages;The exchange traded fund market in Asia has been growing rapidly over the past decade. Industry participants, however, say there is much more to be done in terms of investor education if the market is to mature.The Asian ETF market as a whole has grown to some $150bn in size from just $35bn a decade ago, with currently about 550 products on offer, compared with 35 then, according to Jackie Choy, Hong Kong-based ETF strategist at Morningstar.That growth is limited to the bigger stock exchanges in the region, however, as Asian investors typically gravitate to products that have higher trading volumes. This is driven by the misbelief that the more heavily-traded ETFs have greater liquidity.This posts “a huge problem” for the smaller exchanges, says Marco Montanari, Hong Kong-based head of passive asset management for Asia Pacific at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management (DeAWM).The Philippines, which is in the midst of gearing up for the advent of its first batch of ETFs, may potentially bear the brunt of that liquidity misconception.“If investors in the Philippines have the same misconception of looking for the most traded ETFs, they will not buy in the Philippines . . . they will just look for ETFs listed in Hong Kong or somewhere else,” Mr Montanari says.Even for the bigger ETF markets, such as Japan, Hong Kong, China and South Korea, the lack of understanding among investors that the true liquidity of an ETF lies in its underlying investments has been responsible for drawing investors to Europe or US-listed ETFs.Mr Montanari takes the view that for the Asian ETF market to grow, investors would have to pile into locally domiciled products in the region, which are also more advantageous for investors themselves for tax and timezone reasons.Frank Henze, Hong Kong-based head of ETFs for Asia Pacific at State Street Global Advisors, agrees that a large amount of Asian money is parked in offshore vehicles.In Japan, for instance, a lot of investors are buying into US-domiciled products with underlying Japanese investments, he says.He also points out that the Asian ETF arena is multifaceted in terms of the pace of growth, product demand and regulatory landscape in different countries.While Hong Kong stands out with a focus on providing access to China, South Korea is unique in that it has a robust retail investor base with inverse and leveraged products being traded “very rapidly”.China and Japan, meanwhile, are domestically-oriented markets, where there is strong demand for products with local underlying investments, he says.For BlackRock’s iShares, South Korea is one of the markets that has shown the strongest growth in the preceding eight months, with “a lot of institutional usage” in its US-listed products, says Jane Leung, the company’s Hong Kong-based head of Asia Pacific, citing a $400m inflow from a single insurer.Ms Leung also believes that investor education is crucial for the growth of the industry in Asia, where the development of onshore products is still in a “very nascent” stage.“It does take time for liquidity to build,” she says, citing the flagship iShares FTSE A50 China Index ETF in Hong Kong as an example. That fund, which was launched in 2004, “didn’t start taking off until four to five years later in terms of liquidity and trading volume”.BlackRock is also patient about gaining steam with its recently launched dim sum bond ETF. The iShares RMB Bond Index ETF, which went public in Hong Kong in June, is the first offshore renminbi bond ETF in Asia. The launch generated much talk in the industry amid concerns over the low liquidity of the offshore renminbi bond market.Ms Leung says the trading volume of the product has been low so far but that is “expected” as the fund is targeting retail assets. “We’re going through a lot of education with the public in terms of how this product works. We expect it will take time to build both the liquidity and education for this fund.”In Asia, about 80 per cent of ETF assets are sourced from institutional investors, with the rest from the retail public, industry participants estimate.DeAWM’s Mr Montanari believes it will take at least five to 10 years before ETFs gain traction among retail investors in Asia. While making “huge efforts” in educating investors, he believes it is “too soon” to target Asian retail assets right now.Vanguard, one of the US’s biggest ETF providers, is nonetheless upbeat about its end goal of penetrating the Asian retail market with its low-cost strategy. It listed its first product in Hong Kong in May, the Vanguard FTSE Asia ex-Japan Index ETF.“We haven’t been here that long, but we expect that history will prove us right: people will be more and more fee-sensitive . . . it tends to happen when the market gets more mature,” says Shelly Painter, Vanguard’s Hong Kong-based regional managing director, pointing to the company’s success in attracting retail inflows in the US. It considers Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore as core retail markets, while China and Taiwan offer more opportunities in the institutional space, she says. “The industry is so new in China, you’ll probably see a quick shift to ETFs from mutual funds.”
263;STT;State Street Corp;2013-09-06T18:36:33Z;Battle lines drawn over ‘leaky pipes’;Critics focus on ‘plumbing’ problems in ETF industry;"Plumbing problems, broken pipes and blockages – it would be easy to think the exchange traded fund sector had become the sewer of the financial markets if critics of ETFs were to be believed.Indeed, proponents of the ETF structure, which was once perceived as simple and transparent, believe the market is under a sustained attack from traditional asset managers.ETFs’ cheerleaders believe long-established fund houses have looked on rather enviously as global ETF assets have risen to almost $2.2tn since the first ETF was launched in 1993, and are ever ready to go on the offensive.The latest assault started in early summer when a spate of redemptions caused disruptions in the “plumbing” of several ETFs, which in turn caused many ETFs to tumble below the value of their underlying assets.Emerging-markets funds were among the worst affected as investors took fright that the end of Federal Reserve monetary easing would lead to outflows from developing countries.The upshot was that on one day at the end of June Citigroup stopped accepting orders to redeem underlying assets from ETF issuers after one trading desk reached its allocated risk limits. State Street also stopped accepting cash redemption orders for municipal bond products from dealers.Tim Coyne, global head of ETF capital markets at State Street, told the FT at the time that his company had contacted participants “to say we were not going to do any cash redemptions today” though redemptions “in kind” were still taking place. Jim Ross, State Street’s global head of ETFs, later wrote to investors: “In recent weeks, articles questioning the performance of ETFs during periods of increased market volatility have painted an inaccurate picture. This underscores the continued need for ongoing education to ensure investors and industry observers understand how ETFs are structured, traded and regulated.” The tumble in asset prices had, however, exposed cracks in the pipework.Terry Smith, chief executive of Fundsmith and an ardent critic of ETFs, told FTfm: “It is not just the plumbing that is at fault. These products are misunderstood and very probably mis-sold.” You cannot make an underlying illiquid asset liquid by putting it in a wrapper and simply calling it an ETF, he says.Siu Kee Chan, an investment manager at ING Investment Management, adds that the “plumbing issues” should mark “the start of a move back to basics” for ETFs. But are the problems overblown? “Yes,” according to Alan Miller, chief investment officer of SCM Private, an investment manager that builds portfolios using ETFs. “What other investment industry offers thousands of different products and yet none have gone bust, or even had to suspend its operations? Considering the amazing diversity of underlying assets offered, it is quite an accolade that investors have always been protected,” he says.He believes some providers of traditional mutual funds are exploiting the situation. “Most commentators have failed to consider what would have happened if this situation was mirrored within a mutual fund with the same size and proportionate outflows – would it have met redemptions by the next day? Would the fund have been suspended?”Patrick Dunne, head of global markets and investments for iShares, the world’s largest provider of ETFs, adds: “At times of extreme market stress, any financial instrument can be affected by structural inefficiencies in the capital markets. However, ETFs continue to perform as they are designed to do, allowing investors to move quickly and efficiently in and out of investment exposures.”Michael John Lytle, chief development officer at Source, the London based ETF provider, agrees: “The suggestion that there are fundamental problems with the plumbing of the ETF industry is totally inaccurate.”ETF providers feel aggrieved, but it is safe to assume the fund structure is no longer as simple as it was once claimed. The Bank of England had previously warned that the risks associated with swap-based ETFs, for example, were not being made clear to investors and that ETFs are “characterised by increasing complexity, opacity and interconnectedness”.A perhaps more measured Peter Sleep, senior portfolio manager at 7IM, offers some final thoughts: “ETFs are not simple but I think they are as reasonably safe, or at least as safe, as the underlying assets. ETFs are like a glass bottles; they can contain water or they can contain nitroglycerine.“They are as safe as the contents. If you buy junk bonds you should not expect something that is safer than junk bonds. You get what it says on the tin,” adds Mr Sleep, who sounds as if he has the makings of being a good plumber.This is an extended version of a piece in FTfm on September 2"
264;STT;State Street Corp;2013-09-06T18:36:33Z;Performance will replace price as weapon of choice;ETF ‘price war’ heading for stalemate;"The fee war effectively started by Vanguard has drawn in iShares and State Street, but rather than escalating, it now appears headed for a stalemate.“The race to the bottom will ultimately reach some sort of bottom, and in terms of the plain vanilla cap-weighted beta space, it’s very near the bottom,” says Ben Johnson, director of passive fund research at Morningstar.In the US, where price competition has been fiercest, exchange traded funds’ asset-weighted total expense ratios averaged 0.27 per cent at the end of July, down 6 basis points from three years earlier but just 1 basis point lower than a year earlier, according to data from ETF consultancy ETFGI.Vanguard has harnessed the discount trend as much as anyone, garnering industry-leading first half inflows of $28.8bn and ranking a close second last year to market share leader iShares, despite having fewer than a quarter as many ETFs listed.The company has historically kept fees low through its non-profit mutual ownership structure, unique in the ETF industry. Last year, however, it went on the pricing offensive by switching 22 of its index funds to lower-cost benchmarks from FTSE Group and the University of Chicago’s Center for Research on Security Prices(CRSP), a largely unknown provider.Aside from passing on savings from its growing asset base and improved index tracking, Vanguard’s fee-cutting knife drawer is now all but empty, says Daniel Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors newsletter.“It’s clear that whatever they’re paying CRSP is almost next to nothing, if not nothing, because in essence they’re putting CRSP on the map,” says Mr Wiener, who is also chairman and chief executive of advisory firm Adviser Investment Management. “It’s pretty hard to cut your costs below nothing.”He says Vanguard will never abandon its licensing contracts with Russell Indexes and S&P Dow Jones Indices because of their formidable brand recognition.Long a fee war holdout, iShares responded to Vanguard’s ETF market share ascent with the launch of a buy-and-hold “core” ETF series, including some funds that undercut corresponding Vanguard ETFs on price. State Street Global Advisors, the second-biggest provider, has also been shaving fees strategically. In July, it undercut three iShares broad market ETFs on price by switching its ETFs’ benchmark indices, while simultaneously launching a small-cap ETF also drastically underpricing an iShares ETF tracking the same index.More extensive cuts, however, seem unlikely in part because both iShares and SSgA lack Vanguard’s non-profit structure.Moreover, the financial advisers that flocked to ETFs initially for their low expense ratios are beginning to recognise that ETF costs also take the form of bid-ask spreads and tracking error, says Dave Mazza, head of ETF investment strategy at SSgA.“Now that investors, and particularly advisers, have been using ETFs for some time, and there has been compression on the expense ratio side, what they’re saying is . . . the overall total cost of ownership for my client may be worse even though the headline [expense ratio] number looks better,” he says.Rather than discounts, increasingly ETF providers are touting fuller service offerings, be it through adviser outreach, educational campaigns or user-friendly websites. “The resounding chorus has been there’s a need for greater education, and that doesn’t come at zero cost,” says Deborah Fuhr, managing partner at ETFGI. “ETFs are already very cost-efficient, and if you’re going to pay for education and other things, you need to leave some margin in there for marketing and other sales support.”Eating costs is certainly within the realm of possibility. Mutual fund managers have been subsidising money market funds for years amid rock bottom interest rates. Charles Schwab, one of the bigger money fund backstoppers, is by all accounts also bankrolling its low cost ETF suite, having pared its average overall TER to an low of 7.2 basis points.Schwab is a special case, however, because those drastic discounts can be offset by other means, such as the brokerage volume the ETF traffic helps generate, says Marie Chandoha, president and chief executive at Charles Schwab Investment Management. “We are part of a large organisation that makes money in a number of ways; not every company can say that,” Ms Chandoha says. “As a result, we are able to take risks, make bets, try new things and make trade-offs to benefit our clients and our bottom line.”Still, Schwab’s synergies, no less than iShares’ economies, have their limits, and once they are reached, the fee war will end, though the performance war will rage on. “It’s an evolving industry, and that’s usually where it evolves to: price gets standardised,” says Richard Keary, principal of the consulting firm Global ETF Advisors. “Then it’s about quality and performance, which probably is where it should be.”"
265;STT;State Street Corp;2013-08-25T05:27:42Z;Big three hog US ETF market;Smaller rivals face battle for share of inflows;BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard control the market for exchange traded funds (ETF) in the US to such an extent that rivals face large hurdles if they want to gain ground in passive investing, research from the fundtracker Morningstar suggests.The powerful troika has hoovered up the bulk of the country’s ETF business in the past five years. And, together, the three fund houses hold a little more than 80 per cent of ETF assets held in the US – an estimated $1.26tn, making it a daunting task for competitors to enter this profitable area.Indeed, their monopoly seems all the more daunting at a time when fund houses that specialise in active management face difficulty persuading investors looking for lower-cost options that their high-fee funds are worth it.Greggory Warren, a senior stock analyst with Morningstar, last week said that passive funds have now become the default option for US investors looking to get exposure to equities. “Advisers say let’s do ETFs and index trackers because they are lower cost and allow us to get out of an investment quickly.”So far this year, about $175.8bn has flooded into ETFs and index trackers in the US, offering exposure to equities, more than three times the $57.1bn that made its way into actively managed equity funds, according to Morningstar Direct.Through its iShares division, BlackRock now controls close to 40 per cent of the market with $603bn in assets. State Street, through SSgA, holds $364.4bn (24 per cent) and Vanguard runs $294.2bn (19 per cent).The trio’s closest competitor is Invesco which controls 5 per cent of the ETF market in the US or $74.4bn through PowerShares.
266;STT;State Street Corp;2013-08-06T17:05:57Z;ETFs rebound in July as investors return;ETF inflows reach $44.1bn in vigorous recovery;The exchange traded funds industry rebounded strongly in July as investors pushed the US stock market to an all-time high.ETFs (funds and products) gathered global net inflows of $44.1bn last month, marking a vigorous recovery from June when concerns about the outlook for US monetary policy prompted investors to withdraw $4bn.Deborah Fuhr, managing partner at ETFGI, a consultancy that monitors industry trends, said that dovish comments from the Fed and the positive performance of the US equity market encouraged investors to put their money back to work via ETFs.US listed ETFs linked to equity markets in North America attracted $32.1bn last month, accounting for the largest share of global inflows.Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, said that US investors were showing a “very strong preference” for domestic equities, helped by recent evidence of the recovery strengthening in the housing market and the broader economy.Investors, said Mr Koesterich, were rethinking the view that the Federal Reserve would start to aggressively withdraw monetary support for the economy while recent economic data and second quarter corporate earnings reports had both been “good enough” to push the stock market higher.With valuations still looking “very reasonable”, particularly for stock markets outside of the US, equities could be expected to make further gains, said Mr Koesterich.So far this year, the ETF industry has gathered global net inflows of $148.5bn, up 13.8 per cent on the same period in 2012.Vanguard, the third-largest provider by assets, retained its lead in this year’s race for investors’ cash with inflows of $36.2bn, up 8.5 per cent on the same period in 2012.BlackRock is running in second place with global inflows of $32.5bn, an increase of 3.2 per cent.Meanwhile State Street Global Advisors, the second largest ETF provider by assets, has seen inflows fall 26.7 per cent to $11.8bn amid hefty withdrawals from the world’s largest gold ETF, the SPDR Gold Trust.
267;STT;State Street Corp;2013-08-06T17:05:35Z;High yield ETFs survive ‘stress test’;Products are “robust” says Citi analyst;Exchange traded funds linked to the US high yield corporate bond market have passed an important “stress test” that should strengthen investors’ confidence in these instruments, according to analysts at Citi.ETFs have become key trading vehicles in the US high yield market, but some observers have questioned their viability – mainly due to the relative illiquidity of their underlying holdings.Such doubts were put to the test earlier this year as uncertainty about the outlook for US monetary policy led to increased volatility in trading conditions.High yield ETFs went into a tailspin following Ben Bernanke’s testimony to Congress on May 22. Although Mr Bernanke clearly tried to reassure Congress about the benefits of easy monetary policy and gave no hint that the US central bank was preparing to slow its bond buying programme, investors in high yield ETFs headed for the exit.Large withdrawals were made from the two largest products, known as HYG (the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF) and JNK (the SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond ETF, which is managed by State Street Global Advisors).Investors pulled some $1.4bn from HYG and $1.3bn from JNK between May 22 and June 24.But Scott Chronert, an analyst at Citi, said that both HYG and JNK “operated as expected” during the turmoil in providing liquid, representative exposure to the asset class.“Our conclusion is that these ETFs [HYG and JNK] have proven themselves to be robust products capable of withstanding stressful markets,” said Mr Chronert.He emphasised that increased volatility for HYG and JNK should not have come as a “material surprise” given the upward shift in underlying rates that followed Mr Bernanke’s testimony.And due to the “inherent difficulty” in replicating their underlying indices, high yield ETFs were to be expected to trade with higher tracking errors than equity ETFs, according to Mr Chronert.Although trading activity in high yield ETFs increased in late May and June, trading activity levels for the underlying bonds remained fairly steady.Mr Chronert said many of the underlying bonds struggled to find a buyer in the turbulent market conditions and so prices for some of the constituents of HYG and JNK had become “a bit stale”.This was reflected in trading spreads, which also became significantly more volatile. Both HYG and JNK traded at significant premiums and discounts to their net asset value (at times exceeding 100 basis points in both direction).Before the outbreak of volatility in late May, both traded at a premium within a relatively stable range between zero and 50bp.But “the feared ‘vicious cycle’ of forced selling never materialised”, said Mr Chronert, adding that arbitrage activity by authorised participants (institutional investors) was a likely explanation for the volatility of both HYG and JNK.In June, BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager and owner of iShares, doubled the size of HYG’s redemption basket so that investors received more than 110 high yield bonds, instead of 60 previously, when they redeemed (sold) a unit of the ETF.“This represents an attempt to discourage further redemptions by providing a larger (and therefore more difficult to liquidate) basket of bonds,” said Mr Chronert.But a senior ETF market maker said that although it might require more time and effort to execute a longer list of bonds, “we don’t believe it materially affects the ability to sell the redemption basket”.BlackRock said the change was introduced to ensure the tracking error between HYG and its underlying index remained low.“Baskets have to increase as redemptions grow in order to keep the tracking profile in line with the index, which is the fund’s main objective,” said Steve Laipply, an iShares investment strategist.SSgA did not make any changes to redemption basket for JNK over the same period.Brian Kinney, global head of indexed fixed income at SSgA, said managers had to strike a balance to ensure that authorised participants could create and redeem ETF units efficiently while also making sure that creation and redemption baskets were representative of the risks of the underlying index.Investors returned to high yield ETFs once concerns about possible changes to US monetary policy receded with inflows of $2.8bn in July, compared with withdrawals of $1.6bn in June, according to ETFGI.In July, HYG gathered new inflows of $1.3bn while JNK attracted $134m, suggesting that these ETFs were increasingly being viewed as a “risk on/risk off” play in credit markets, said Mr Chronert.

269;STT;State Street Corp;2013-07-02T20:53:11Z;US custody banks face ratings downgrade;;Moody’s has placed the credit ratings of the three biggest US custody banks on review for a downgrade in a move that illustrates the continued pressure of record low interest rates on the businesses of some of the largest financial institutions.Bank of New York Mellon, Northern Trust and State Street would most likely see their ratings trimmed by one notch, Moody’s said in a statement on Tuesday.Historic low interest rates in the US have wreaked havoc on the business models of custody banks – which rely on eking out small amounts of money by managing and protecting trillions of dollars worth of securities on behalf of their customers.“Moody’s will focus on the long-term profitability challenges facing these very highly rated banks,” the rating agency said. “As interest rates rise, the banks’ earnings pressures will recede. However, the demonstrated vulnerability of their business models to protracted low interest rates constitutes a concentration risk.”BNYMellon is currently rated Aa3 – three notches below triple A, the highest credit rating available. State Street and Northern Trust are rated four notches below at A1.Moody’s also warned that the custody banks, which have big portfolios of bonds and other securities, could be hit by new rules governing the amount of regulatory capital they have to hold. Under proposed Basel III regulations banks will have to include interest rate-related securities losses in their capital calculations.“The declining value of fixed-rate securities in a rising rate environment, realised or as part of a stress test, would reduce regulatory capital,” Moody’s said. “This could influence the banks to alter their investment policies and result in an increase to their risk profiles.”The trust banks have already been trimming millions of dollars of expenses in recent years to offset the record low interest rates. Some have also been exploring new lines of business, including collateral transformation, to boost profits.While rising rates may affect banks which have built up very large securities portfolios, they could also provide a boost to the industry’s profit margins on other services.A 100 basis point increase in interest rates could lead to a $575m increase in annual pre-tax income at BNYMellon, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse. State Street could get a $165m boost in pre-tax income and Northern Trust a $110m increase.
270;STT;State Street Corp;2013-06-23T03:30:36Z;After two decades ETFs come of age;Popular fund tipped for further growth;Two decades after their debut, exchange traded funds (ETFs) now account for $1.5tn of assets in the US, with no sign of abating.The category’s swift success now begs two questions. First, what does this mean for mutual funds? And second, what’s next? If recent industry reports are any indication, the answer to both is simple: a lot.ETFs, which are mostly index-tracking products that trade on an exchange, first hit the market in 1993 with State Street Global Advisors’ “ Spider” ETF.The breakthrough fund – which tracks the S&P 500 and is named for its ticker code (SPDR) – was launched with little fanfare, but investors quickly warmed to its low fees, transparency and tax-efficient structure.Within five years, Spider netted $4bn in assets and quickly became the template for a budding industry. Today, both retail and institutional investors look to ETFs for exposure to equities, fixed income, commodities, currencies and a range of alternative strategies. With nearly $140bn in assets as of April 30, SPDR is still one of the largest ETFs in the world, though State Street now trails BlackRock in overall ETF assets, with Vanguard not far behind.“Over the years, the ETF really became a product that was embraced by all different types of investors,” says Jim Ross, a managing director at State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) who is often seen as a pioneer of the ETF industry. “Like any other emerging business, some [companies] have succeeded, and some have not.”The ETF industry is one dominated by giants. With 280, 117 and 65 products respectively, BlackRock, SSgA and Vanguard now control more than 80 per cent of the market.Collectively, ETFs are only a fraction (10.3 per cent) of the size of the US mutual fund market – which currently stands at $13.6tn in assets – but growth has been significant. At the end of 2012, there were 1,194 US ETFs with $1,337bn in assets.This is more than double the $531bn held in ETFs at the end of 2008 and more than eight times what they were worth in 2003, according to data from the Investment Company Institute.John Cadigan, a managing director at Arrow Funds who held high-level sales roles at Direxion and Rydex, both early entrants to the specialised ETF market, says the ETFs rapid ascent is a testament to investor perceptiveness.In the volatile years following the financial crisis, investors sought strategies that were fluid to market changes, he says.A surge of press coverage about ETFs and their proper use forced those investors to be “more astute,” Mr Cadigan adds, further propelling the industry’s momentum.Not every fund survived. In the mid-2000s, XShares Advisors liquidated its entire HealthShares family after failing to gather significant assets. Likewise, Guggenheim, PowerShares and BlackRock have all closed ETFs in recent months, prompting analysts to publish “deathwatch” lists monitoring ETF closings.Companies like Direxion and Van Eck Global, on the other hand, have managed to distinguish their brands with speciality exposures like commodities, leveraged indices and specific countries.For asset managers, the sea change led to something of a binge in product development, with sponsors splicing indices into razor-thin segments. Likewise, new ideas for low-cost, highly efficient ETFs continue to crop up, with Schwab and Vanguard leading the race.Meanwhile, having conquered indices, companies are now looking for new ways to use the ETF space to rake in returns. In the past seven months, Fidelity, T Rowe Price and Franklin Templeton have all won regulatory approval for actively managed ETFs.Of the 952 ETFs that are currently in registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, about 40 are actively managed, according to data from SEI and McKinsey.The new products have also helped spawn an industry of ETF strategists that build active models using passive ETFs as building blocks.“In the end, we are taking a beta product and producing alpha through asset allocation and ETF selection,” says Jon Maier, an ETF strategist at Merrill Lynch who oversees 20 of the firm’s ETF model portfolios.As ETFs continue to etch out a space next to mutual funds – and with investors showing no signs of fatigue – the rise of actively managed funds bodes well for the ETF industry, insiders say. But State Street’s Mr Ross is quick to note that is not to say mutual funds and ETFs cannot coexist.“I don’t see [ETFs overtaking mutual funds] in the near future,” he says.“Both have served investors in different ways, and both will continue to grow.”
271;STT;State Street Corp;2013-06-21T17:00:27Z;ETF providers reject ‘stress’ reports;Price discovery function intact in times of market stress;BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors have rejected reports that recent asset market volatility caused “stress” in their exchange traded funds operations.ETFs have seen significant outflows during June with investors pulling money from funds linked to emerging markets.BlackRock’s iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, known as EEM, had its busiest trading session of the year on Thursday. During Thursday’s session, the market price of EEM also moved to a large discount to the net asset value of its underlying index.ETFs are designed to track closely their underlying NAV so the 6.5 per cent discount which opened up was unusual.But Leland Clemons, head of capital markets for iShares in Europe, said EEM had “performed efficiently as a vehicle for real-time price discovery” during Thursday’s session.Mr Clemons pointed out that several emerging markets were already closed during European and US trading hours which meant that the NAV estimate for EEM calculated at the close of trading on Wednesday was “stale”.Arbitrageurs use prices from US futures and currency markets to calculate more timely NAV estimates for ETFs during the hours when local trading in emerging markets is closed.One senior ETF trader said that a more realistic estimate of EEM’s discount on Thursday was around 1 per cent.Mr Clemons pointed out that ETFs in other asset classes had also move to large discounts to their underlying net asset value in previous times of market stress.A notable example was the behaviour of Japanese ETFs in US and European trading hours during the tsunami and resulting nuclear crisis which affected Japan in 2011.ETFs tracking credit markets also moved to large discounts during the financial crisis when some of their underlying holdings became illiquid.“Risks have to be priced in by ETF market participants,” said Mr Clemons.He argued that investors in EEM had an advantage in knowing the accurate value of their holdings over those investors that had bought locally listed securities in emerging markets and which had to wait until trading in those regions restarted on Friday.A trading volume of $5.7bn was registered for EEM on Thursday with 151m units of the ETF changing hands, according to preliminary data from ETFGI, a consultancy that monitors industry trends. ETF trades can take several days to settle so final values for Thursday’s trading could be even higher. However, net investor outflows from EEM were relatively modest at just $34m.The direct rival to EEM, the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF, known as VWO, also saw heavy trading on Thursday with trades worth just over $3bn and around 79m units changing hands.Also during Thursday’s session, State Street stopped accepting cash redemption orders for municipal bond ETFs from dealers.The $3.7tn US municipal bond market is notoriously illiquid with many bonds trading infrequently or rarely which makes intra-day valuations difficult, particularly in times of increased market volatilityEleanor Hope-Bell, head of SSgA’s UK intermediaries business group, said the standard procedure for the creation and redemptions of ETF units was an “in-kind” transaction.This involves swapping an agreed basket of securities that match the underlying index for an ETF unit or the opposite during a redemption transaction.Ms Hope-Bell said SSgA usually allowed ETF units to be traded for cash (rather than in-kind) but this facility was at the discretion of the portfolio manager.SSgA had decided on Thursday to remove that cash trading facility to protect existing investors in its muni bond ETF range but in-kind creations and redemptions were unaffected, said Ms Hope-Bell.“ETFs have been very helpful in providing liquidity and aiding price discovery in the muni bond market,” she added.Citi issued a statement on Friday after it stopped accepting orders to redeem underlying assets from ETF issuers after one trading desk reached its allocated limits on Thursday.The bank said it employed self-imposed capital limits on its trading desks generally and the fact that it had reached its limit on the ETF desk on Thursday was “not related to any specific ETF or ETF issuer”.“We have a strong commitment to our ETF business, and are currently re-evaluating our limits to make sure that we are best serving all ETF market participants and supporting the continued growth and development of ETF markets,” said Citi.
272;STT;State Street Corp;2013-06-20T23:21:52Z;Bond market sell-off causes stress in $2tn ETF industry;;A wave of selling caused many exchange traded funds to tumble below the value of their underlying assets as a bond market sell-off caused stress in the $2tn ETF industry.ETFs track baskets of underlying assets, such as emerging-market stocks or municipal bonds, but discounts widened sharply on Thursday as dealers struggled to keep up with the sell orders.Emerging-markets ETFs were among the worst affected, as investors took fright that the end of Federal Reserve monetary easing would lead to outflows from developing countries.For example, the share price of the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF fell to a 2.6 per cent discount to the underlying asset value.The selling also caused disruptions in the plumbing behind several ETFs. Citigroup stopped accepting orders to redeem underlying assets from ETF issuers, after one trading desk reached its allocated risk limits.One Citi trader emailed other market participants to say: “We are unable to take any more redemptions today . . . a very rare occurrence due to capital requirements we are maxed out on the amount of collateral we have out.”A person familiar with the situation said it was a temporary suspension affecting only some clients, caused by the significant amount of sell orders. Citi declined to comment.State Street said it would stop accepting cash redemption orders for municipal bond products from dealers.Tim Coyne, global head of ETF capital markets at State Street, said his company had contacted participants “to say we were not going to do any cash redemptions today”. But he added that redemptions “in kind” were still taking place.Market participants described the heavy volumes and losses on Thursday as a rare occurrence and said that it could translate into further selling on Friday or early next week.“The losses for ETFs today were far beyond what the most sophisticated financial risk models could have predicated for worst-case scenarios,” said Bryce James, president of Smart Portfolio, which provides ETF asset allocation models.He added: “The falls violated risk tolerance levels for many investors and if they were leveraged at all they are likely facing capital calls.”ETFs have been a boom product in recent years. They are bought and sold as an equity but can hold a variety of assets that are less liquid than exchange traded stocks.The heavy selling across global markets triggered the disruption in products that track less liquid assets such as municipals or securities in markets that are closed during parts of the US trading day.An earlier version of this article overstated the discount figure of the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF by referencing a net asset value that had not been updated. This figure has since been corrected.
273;STT;State Street Corp;2013-06-16T03:14:29Z;Large spike in ‘smart beta’ investments;Index-based investing becoming more sophisticated;Interest in “advanced” or “smart beta” investment strategies is accelerating, with growing numbers of investors adopting alternative weighting schemes in equity and fixed income portfolios.Inflows into advanced beta funds reached $15bn in the first three months of 2013, up 45.3 per cent on the same period a year ago. This was the strongest quarterly inflow for three years, according to an analysis by State Street Global Advisors of Morningstar data.Total inflows into advanced beta funds over the past three years was $81.6bn. Most of the growth is being generated via exchange traded funds, which have attracted inflows of $66.2bn over the past three years.As a result, global assets held in advanced beta strategies grew to $142bn at the end of the first quarter, up from just $58bn at the end of 2010. The number of advanced beta funds available has also expanded dramatically to 457 at the end of March, from around 55 at the start of 2006.However, data from ETFs and mutual funds underestimate demand.“Interest in advanced beta via ETFs represents just the tip of the iceberg. There are significantly more assets held by sophisticated institutional investors in separately managed accounts,” said Niall O’Leary, head of portfolio strategy for Emea at State Street Global Advisors.SSgA alone manages assets of $47.3bn in alternative weightings and low-volatility equity strategies.“Index-based investing is becoming much more sophisticated,” said Scott Stark, director of Russell Indexes Europe. He says discussions with institutional investors and pension funds over the past year have been dominated by questions about advanced beta.“The depth of conversations with clients about advanced beta has shifted dramatically. More and more are asking how best to incorporate advanced beta strategies into their portfolios,” added Mr Stark.

Trustees go where the mainstream, well-established players are,” said Barry Jones at KPMG.But, he added, the big three should not get too complacent, as the mid-tier companies, such as F&C, Schroders and State Street Global Advisors, are all beefing up their LDI teams.However, John Ralfe, an independent consultant, believes LDI is the wrong approach for pension funds and sponsor companies, which need straightforward, cost-effective strategies to reduce risk for members and investors.“LDI is an excuse for taking micro decisions and racking up cost and complexity,” he said.Asset managers failing to gain a big enough part of the LDI market in the UK are likely to tap into other countries, such as the US and the Netherlands, added Mr Jones.

Inflows into Japan equity-linked ETFs at $23.1bn so far in 2013 are already substantially higher than the full-year inflows for 2012 ($10.6bn) and 2011 ($9.9bn).But inflows into fixed income ETFs have slowed amid concerns about bond price bubbles forming and growing uncertainty over the future pace of the US Federal Reserve’s bond-buying programme. Fixed income ETF inflows have dropped to $19.5bn so far this year, compared with $33.7bn in the same period last year.Commodity-linked ETFs have suffered large outflows of just under $24bn so far this year, compared with inflows of $3.8bn in the first five months of 2012. The redemptions have been concentrated in gold exchange traded products, with investors withdrawing a further $6bn from bullion ETPs in May alone. This follows a sharp price correction in the market in April.In the 2013 race among providers for investors’ cash, BlackRock and Vanguard continued to extend their lead over the chasing pack.BlackRock’s iShares business has attracted inflows of $30.9bn so far this year, up 65 per cent on the $18.7bn accumulated by the same time in 2012.Vanguard, the third-largest ETF provider globally, has gathered inflows of $28.8bn, up 17.6 per cent on the same period last year.But big outflows from the world’s largest gold ETF, known as GLD, have weighed on State Street Global Advisors, the world second-largest ETF provider. SSgA has registered outflows of $3.7bn so far in 2013, compared with inflows of $6.6bn by this time last year.Deborah Fuhr, managing partner at ETFGI, noted that Daiwa and WisdomTree, two midsized managers, were among the top four ETF providers by inflows in May because of the strength of buying interest in their Japan equity products.So far in 2013, WisdomTree has gathered $10.5bn, more than double its entire 2012 inflows, while Daiwa’s ETF business has attracted $4.5bn, more than three times its inflows for the whole of last year.
277;STT;State Street Corp;2013-05-20T17:42:13Z;Biotech surge powers ETF inflows;Fears that biotech rally is being fuelled by speculative buying;Investor inflows into exchange traded funds tracking the biotechnology sector have surged as the share prices of biotech companies make a record breaking start to 2013.The eight ETFs listed in the US that directly track the biotech sector have pulled in inflows of $545.7m so far this year, up 42.9 per cent on new cash gathered over the whole of 2012, according ETFGI, a consultancy that monitors ETF industry trends.The scale of inflows has prompted concerns that the sector’s rally is being fuelled by speculative buying. However, there have been notable differences in both the performances of the ETFs in this sector and their success in attracting inflows.The largest vehicle in the sector, the iShares Nasdaq biotechnology fund, known by its ticker IBB, has registered inflows of $311.5m so far this year, already surpassing the $287.8m it gathered over the whole of 2012.IBB has risen 32.6 per cent this year, outperforming the second largest fund in the sector, State Street’s SPDR S&P biotech ETF, known as XBI, which is up 25.2 per cent. XBI has attracted $40.8m in new inflows in 2013, up from $24.9m over the whole of last year.The best performing ETF in the sector is the Market Vectors biotechnology ETF, known as BBH, which is up 36.4 per cent. BBH has taken in $60.9m so far this year, already more than double the $28.2m gathered in 2012.BBH is a relatively concentrated portfolio of 26 constituents so it assigns higher weightings towards larger biotechnology companies than the more diversified iShares IBB ETF which has 119 holdings. So far this year, larger companies in the biotech sector have outperformed midsized and smaller players, contributing to the outperformance by BBH.However, not every ETF in the sector has managed to attract positive inflows. The PowerShares biotechnology & genome ETF, known as PBE, has registered net withdrawals of $2.6m even though the share price of this fund is up 30.2 per cent.
278;STT;State Street Corp;2013-05-12T03:47:48Z;UK probe over transition fees welcomed;The FCA is investigating allegations of overcharging for services;Investors have welcomed the probe into allegations that investment banks and asset service providers have been overcharging for their “ transition management” services – services that are used during big shifts in investment portfolios.The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority is in the process of visiting a number of transition management providers, having cited concerns over unclear fee structures and poor documentation.Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, said that the NAPF was “concerned” by the allegations.“A high level of transparency on fees and charging is absolutely essential if trustees are to secure the best deal and deliver value for scheme members.“Transition management is a complicated process that pension funds need to be able to have confidence in. We are concerned by these developments and will be watching the outcomes closely,” said Ms Segars.The FCA is investigating allegations that State Street overcharged Ireland’s National Pensions Reserve Fund (the state pension fund), the Royal Mail Pension Fund, J Sainsbury, the UK retailer, and the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) for its transition management services.“The days where you could make disclosures that were legally complete but totally incomprehensible are long over,” said Guy Sears, a director of the Investment Management Association, a trade body.State Street has said that it has repaid all clients following an internal investigation that led to the bank self-reporting to the UK regulator in September 2011 and dismissing two executives, Ross McLellan and Edward Pennings.Mr Pennings appealed against his dismissal at an employment tribunal, which threw out his claims in December 2012.The tribunal papers show that State Street made a profit of $3m on bond trades conducted on behalf of the Royal Mail Pension Fund, even though the bank had agreed to transition a £1.3bn portfolio for RMPF for a flat fee of £227,500.Paul Housego, the judge at the tribunal, said that while Mr Pennings had asserted his behaviour was proper, he found “great difficulty in distinguishing it from embezzlement”.Graham Dixon of Inalytics, a consultancy, said it would help pension funds enormously if transition managers were to release their performance track record data as this would allow clients to conduct proper due diligence and select the right transition manager for the right assignment. This performance track record data are not usually made available to clients.“Transition managers should also explain how they expect to earn their money and to fully disclose their revenues on an itemised basis to reassure their clients that they are being charged appropriately,” said Mr Dixon.

Forty-seven per cent of endowments and almost a quarter of corporate and public pension funds with more than $5bn in assets are using ETFs.Greenwich’s findings chime with a recent analysis by BlackRock that examined data submitted to US regulators by 15 of the world’s largest asset managers. It found that their ETF ownership had on average increased by more than 30 per cent a year over the three years to the end of September 2012.Mark Wiedman, global head of iShares, the ETF arm of BlackRock, says growing numbers of institutional investors are choosing ETFs as an alternative instrument to derivatives and individual securities as well as actively managed mutual funds.“Sometimes ETFs can be a superior option to derivatives or individual securities,” says Mr Wiedman, pointing to recent discussions between iShares and a US pension fund that is in the process of converting a $1.5bn fixed income portfolio into ETFs to improve its liquidity and operational efficiency.Fidelity, an active management house, has seen the largest growth in its use of ETFs.Bill Ebsworth, chief investment officer of Fidelity Investments’ Strategic Advisers division, says ETFs have worked well within Fidelity’s “personalised portfolios”, which aim to maximise after-tax returns to US investors.Fidelity started to offer personalised portfolios about three years ago and now has around $22.9bn in assets in these accounts, with $2.8bn held in ETFs.“ETFs can be very tax efficient. With some ETFs, only the underlying dividend is liable for tax while dividends in the US still receive preferential tax treatment.”Eleanor Hope-Bell, head of the State Street Global Advisors’ UK intermediaries business group, says SSgA has seen a spike in the use of ETFs by both asset managers and hedge funds.“This increased use has been primarily driven by fund managers using ETFs for interim beta [tactical positions] and cash equitisation [putting money to work quickly].”Education, says Ms Hope-Bell, had also played a big role in helping managers embrace ETFs as a “sharper tool” to manage their portfolios more efficiently.Asset managers’ attitude towards ETFs, adds Ms Hope-Bell, is changing as they have become much more confident about trading these instruments and using them in multi-asset portfolios.“There has been a significant shift in that ETFs are no longer regarded just as tactical instruments and we are starting to see them used as core long-term holdings.”Her comments are echoed by Andrew McCollum, a consultant at Greenwich.“The role of ETFs within institutional portfolios is changing. Although ETFs first entered institutional portfolios mainly as tactical tools, many institutions indicate that they now regularly use ETFs as tools for gaining long-term exposures and implementing investment strategies,” says Mr McCollum.Rajiv Silgardo, co-chief executive of BMO Global Asset Management, says pension funds, hedge funds and endowments are still learning about the variety of ways they could put ETFs to work within their portfolios.“We are definitely seeing a deeper engagement among institutional investors, accompanied by a thirst for knowledge. There is a clear awareness among investors of a need to know more about ETFs.”Many institutional investors initially employed ETFs for cash equitisation or for transitions, adds Mr Silgardo, but they now use them for more strategic purposes, such as entering new asset classes or geographies.“There is ample room for further growth and we expect to see growing interest in many of the new ETFs that depart from plain vanilla market cap weighted indices. These instruments can help institutional investors to further diversify their portfolios in a liquid and transparent fashion,” says Mr Silgardo.Mr Ebsworth says data from Lipper suggests investors could lose up to 49 per cent of their returns to taxes over a 10-year period, so there was a growing interest among those approaching retirement in tax loss harvesting [minimising liabilities by using any losses on capital as an offset against income].He adds that intraday trading of ETFs helped the fund company to realise any potential tax losses more efficiently. “If there is a 2 per cent loss on an ETF, then it is possible to sell that position to realise the tax loss and to reinvest the money in a comparable asset.”
280;STT;State Street Corp;2013-04-25T16:32:11Z;World’s first EM inflation-linked ETF launched;Passive exposure to a rapidly growing asset class;State Street Global Advisors has launched the world’s first exchange traded fund that provides exposure to inflation-linked debt in emerging markets, a rapidly growing asset class that is attracting interest from international investors.The SPDR Barclays EM Inflation-Linked Local Bond Ucits ETF has been listed on the Deutsche Börse, with a further listing on the London Stock Exchange expected shortly.Scott Ebner, global head of product development for SSgA, said the new ETF would provide a simple solution for investors keen to access a previously difficult segment of the fixed income market.“Investors are increasingly looking for ways to diversify their emerging markets exposure beyond traditional equity allocations and are cognisant of prospective inflationary pressures,” said Mr Ebner.SSgA surveyed 128 pension professionals and asset managers across Europe in March and found that three-quarters expected global inflation to rise over the next three years. Nearly 70 per cent said that inflationary pressures would be higher in emerging markets than in the developed world.Fewer than a fifth (19 per cent) of those surveyed by SSgA said that it was easy to access EM inflation-linked bonds. However, almost half (47 per cent) said that they planned to increase their exposure to emerging market debt over the next three years.The market for EM inflation-linked debt has grown strongly over the past 10 years. The outstanding total of debt is at almost $600bn, providing sufficient size, depth and liquidity for an index-based investment approach.The new ETF tracks the Barclays EM inflation-linked 20% capped index, which includes inflation-linked sovereign bonds issued by Brazil, Mexico, Chile, South Africa, Poland, Turkey, Israel, Korea and Thailand.Brazil has historically been the largest issuer of EM inflation-linked debt but the Barclays index limits the exposure of any one country to a maximum of 20 per cent.The new ETF is physically backed, so it will buy the underlying constituents of the index. However, it is expected to hold only a subset of the securities included in the index as it may be difficult to purchase all of the constituents. It may also use derivatives to manage the portfolio efficiently.Commerzbank and Jane Street Capital have been appointed as market makers. Jane Street also provided seed capital for the new ETF, which was launched with assets of $15m.SSgA’s ETF business in Europe has been gathering momentum this year with inflows of almost $1.3bn in the first three months of 2013. This is more than double the $602m gathered in the same period last year, according to ETFGI, a consultancy that monitors industry trends.
281;STT;State Street Corp;2013-04-25T15:34:50Z;An ETF for EM inflation-linked bonds;;"Money managers seeking access to EM domestic debt have a new option from Thursday with the launch of what is claimed to be the world’s first exchange traded fund for emerging market inflation-linked bonds.It comes from SPDR ETFs, part of State Street Global Advisors, with the title of SPDR Barclays EM Inflation-Linked Local Bond UCITS ETF. It is a physically-backed ETF – meaning it will buy real bonds rather than using derivatives as proxies – and will aim to track the Barclays EM Inflation-Linked 20% Capped Index, which includes inflation-linked local currency sovereign bonds issued by Brazil, Mexico, Chile, South Africa, Poland, Turkey, Israel, South Korea and Thailand.What’s the appeal? Kevin Anderson, State Street’s chief investment officer for fixed income and currencies, says the market for EM inflation linked debt has grown dramatically over the past decade – State Street reckons there are $600bn-worth of EM local currency inflation-linked sovereign bonds out there, about the same amount as in EM hard currency sovereign bonds – but that many institutional investors lack the process and trading coverage to access such instruments easily.He says State Street asked its clients about their intentions and found that about half of them already had exposure to EM bonds, making up to about 10 per cent of their portfolios, and expected that to increase.“The ideal bond investment for many clients would have the right combination of safety, liquidity and yield,” says Anderson. “In developed market sovereign bonds there is a dearth of yield.”EM debt certainly provides yield these days, but what about safety and liquidity? Anderson says there are two countries other than the nine in the index that issue suitable bonds – Argentina and Colombia – but they were excluded.“Transparency is very important and we don’t believe we are getting robust and transparent numbers [on inflation, for example] from Argentina,” he says. “And international investors see Colombia as very prohibitive to access as a foreign investor.”Of the markets that are included, though, there is a pretty broad range in terms of liquidity. Brazilian inflation-linked bonds are about 60 per cent of the global total, while Thailand has just one bond. Anderson says this is addressed by capping (as the Barclays index does) each country at 20 per cent of the total – so Brazil and Mexico, for example, will both be at maximum allocation. Smaller issues will also be capped in accordance with market capitalisation, says Anderson, “so we are not forced to take an undue weight” of a less liquid issue.What the fund won’t do is avoid the big pitfalls of EM investment, such as Brazil’s 6 per cent tax on foreign investments in fixed income, for example. Because the fund will aim to invest as much as possible in the assets as weighted in the Barclays index, investor funds will be sent as they arrive for investment in Brazilian and all other bonds.“Once the assets are purchased, we would strive to get the right balance between gaining accurate exposure and getting the transaction cost right,” Anderson says. “That’s part of the underlying skill.” It may also mean using derivatives to ensure liquidity, while trying to avoid any difference in return between derivatives and the assets themselves.So why wouldn’t investors buy the assets themselves instead of going through an ETF? Active investors may scoff but it comes back to a lack of process. Eleanor Hope-Bell, head of UK intermediary sales for State Street, says that of 128 pension funds and asset managers surveyed, 40 found it hard to access EM inflation-linked bonds.At present, she says, 16 per cent of those surveyed are investing directly in the fund’s underlying assets. The rest, though, “don’t have the expertise or time to really understand this market and to have that diversification and ongoing management”.For them, then, State Street’s EDF may be the answer.Related reading:

282;STT;State Street Corp;2013-04-23T03:13:19Z;Guest post: Brics summit right on co-operation, wrong on state-run companies;;"By George Hoguet, Global Investment Strategist, State Street Global AdvisorsThe achievements of the recent Brics summit deserve another look.Global investors should welcome the proposed $100bn Contingent Reserve Arrangement and the planned Development Bank backed last month by the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The Brics shareholders have yet to work out the details of these institutions, but the political resolve is clearly in place.Given the increasing frequency and magnitude of global financial crises since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the addition of another fund that major countries can rapidly mobilise in times of crisis is welcome. And a new development bank that promotes much-needed infrastructure investment is timely and can increase global aggregate supply. This is a positive development for global consumers and investors.There is certainly ample precedent for regional monetary and development assistance associations. The Chiang Mai Initiative (an arrangement totalling $240bn in swap lines among the Asean 10 plus China, Japan and South Korea) and regional development banks such as the African Development Bank highlight the importance of local governance and practice.In the world of policy advice — as in labour, product and capital markets — competition is desirable and tends to lead to more efficient, if occasionally less stable, outcomes. Given difficult-to-model trade-offs between growth and fiscal adjustment, the next hapless country (after Cyprus) to face default may now have another source of funds other than the EU-led Troika.The Brics are not a coherent economic grouping and their differences are larger than their similarities. To begin with, each nation represents a different world religion, implying that their citizens’ view of the natural order of the world profoundly differs. Furthermore security relations between India and China and between Russia and China are uneasy.The Brics currently represent roughly 20 per cent of global nominal GDP, and their share is rapidly increasing. China alone is larger than the four other Brics combined, and will dominate any newly-created financial institutions. For example, proposed contributions to the currency reserve fund are: China $41bn; Brazil, Russia, India $18bn each; and South Africa $5bn. Governance is obviously key. Reportedly the vote of China and one of the other large shareholders will be enough to authorize the disbursement of funds.We should not presume that China-imposed conditionality on recipient countries in times of crisis need be harmful for global investors (and quite possibly could be positive) but at least one aspect of the proposed contingency fund and bank is troubling.The Brics Durban Summit Declaration explicitly states, “We acknowledge the important role that State Owned Companies (SOCs) play in the economy and encourage our SOCs to explore ways of co-operation, exchange of information and best practices.”At a time when Mexico, after more than 75 years, is in the process of opening up its hydrocarbon sector to foreign investment, the majority shareholders of Gazprom (which sells at a robust 2.7 times earnings), Petrobras, ONGC and South African Airways appear predisposed to maintain and possibly increase the role of the state in the economy. On balance, this mind-set is less favourable for global investors.Since the global financial crisis, financial fragmentation has increased. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, cross-border capital flows have declined 60 per cent from their 2007 peak.The establishment of the Brics currency fund reflects understandable frustration at the slow pace of quota realignment in the Bretton Woods institutions, and in particular the failure of the US Congress to top up the US quota.A $100bn fund is small by global standards. The Brics, however, control roughly $4.8tn in international reserves, not including their sovereign wealth fund holdings. If the Brics were to contribute 10 per cent of their reserves to a contingency fund the resulting corpus would total $480bn versus $780bn in resources at the IMF. And the Beijing model, based so far on an undervalued exchange rate, subsidies and financial repression, would further
rival neo-classical economics.This development model in the long run is unlikely to lead to optimal global resource allocation and robust investment returns.The Brics currency reserve fund and development bank are further evidence of a rapidly evolving post-crisis international monetary order. New institutions, national “champions”, China’s gradual capital account liberalisation, expanding internet finance, and a possible enhanced role for the SDR are all features of this emergent phenomenon. The new Brics institutions are mixed news for global investors. Market participants should monitor them, and particularly China’s foreign policy priorities, closely.George Hoguet is Global Investment Strategist at State Street Global AdvisorsRelated reading

283;STT;State Street Corp;2013-04-09T19:02:09Z;L&G fires in tracker fund price battle;Reflects growing interest in passive investment strategies;Legal & General Investments has cut charges on a number of its index funds by up to a quarter as part of an effort to respond to growing interest among UK financial advisers in passive investment strategies.“Interest in passive investing in the UK has steadily grown over the last two decades and 2013 could be a watershed moment,” said Simon Pistell, managing director, Legal & General Investments.Mr Pistell said the UK’s Retail Distribution Review (RDR) which ended commission payments to financial advisers at the start of this year had increased the pressure on IFAs to reduce portfolio costs and offer better value to their clients.“It is a priority for us to expand the reach of our index funds among financial advisers this year,” said Mr Pistell, who also promised that L&G would be launching more new products.Legal & General manages £243bn in index assets, making it one of the largest providers of index-tracking funds in the UK.L&G’s index funds which provide exposure to UK, European, Japanese and Pacific equity markets along with index funds linked to the UK gilts and sovereign bond markets have had their annual management charges reduced from 20 basis points to 15bp.A further four regional index funds providing exposure to emerging market equities, EM bonds, international equities and the 100 largest global companies have have had their annual management charges reduced from 30 basis points to 25bp.The reductions in charges by Legal & General suggest that index fund managers have recognised the need to respond to the growing competitive threat posed by providers of exchange traded funds.In December, State Street Global Advisors reduced fees on five of its UK index funds with assets of over £550m as part of its preparations for RDR.Large ETF providers such as iShares and Vanguard have been stepping up their efforts to reach out to financial advisers to persuade them of the appeal of their products ahead of the implementation of RDR.However, index funds are generally regarded as being slightly cheaper than ETFs.The iShares FTSE 100 ETF carries a total expense ratio of 40bp, making it more expensive than the Legal & General’s flagship UK equity index fund which tracks the FTSE All-Share as well as its FTSE 100 tracker which both now have a management charge of just 15bp.Peter Sleep, a senior portfolio manager at 7IM, who uses both ETFs and index trackers has pointed out that ETF managers in Europe have kept their charges too high, in contrast to the US where providers are fighting a cut-throat price war to win market share.Mr Sleep says that buy-and-hold investors should consider index funds ahead of ETFs if they do not need to trade intra-day. Charges on index funds do vary widely between providers but the market is becoming more competitive as more managers bring out products, adds Mr Sleep.In October, Lyxor announced fee cuts for seven of its largest ETFs while also dismissing any suggestions that it might spark a price war among ETF providers in Europe.While other ETF managers chose not to respond to Lyxor’s initiative, investors must wait to see if they react to this resurgence in price competition from providers of traditional index funds such as Legal & General.
284;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
285;STT;State Street Corp;2013-04-04T16:52:32Z;Blackstone in ETF alliance with State Street;Launching first actively managed senior loan ETF;Blackstone is teaming up with State Street Global Advisors to launch the first actively-managed senior loan exchange traded fund in an alliance that provides further evidence of alternative investment managers’ growing interest in the ETF market.The ETF, which will be known by its ticker SRLN, has been developed by GSO Capital Partners, the credit arm of Blackstone, and SSgA, the world’s second largest ETF manager.SRLN is designed with the aim of outperforming two senior loan benchmarks: the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Leveraged Loan index and the S&P/LSTA US Leveraged Loan 100 index.Typically 30 to 35 per cent of loans fall out of the benchmark indices in any given year so Blackstone and SSgA argue that the ability to anticipate changes in the market through an active strategy is potentially advantageous.“Given the high turnover of senior loans and the critical importance of credit selection, we believe an active strategy provides a key advantage to investors who want access to this corner of the market,” said James Ross, global head of SPDR exchange traded funds at SSgA.The new ETF carries an annual expense ratio of 90 basis points compared with traditional actively managed senior loan mutual funds, which typically charge between 111bp and 178bp.Leverage loan mutual funds have seen inflows rise strongly this year with greater inflows in the first 10 weeks of 2013 than the whole of 2012, according to Lipper data. Investor interest has risen as loans have floating interest rates and so should provide some protection from future increases in policy interest rates.
286;STT;State Street Corp;2013-03-31T04:14:47Z;To hedge or not to hedge;Foreign currency investment exposure should be tailored to the individual investor;To hedge or not to hedge foreign currency investment exposure? That is a question posed repeatedly by investors, and answered by their advisers and investment managers. Some will advise to hedge fully. Some will advise to hedge partially with a currency overlay. Some will advise that investors embrace the naked foreign exposure in full, enjoy it as much as possible and eventually profit from it. A central recurring phrase heard throughout the discussions that formed the research for this article was “it all depends”.No two answers will be the same, unless the investors have identical investment objectives and strategy. Solutions should always be tailored to the needs and wants of the individual investor, however large or small. Ugo Lancioni, a currency portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, sums it up neatly. Every investor has a different location, a different risk/return profile and different views.A broad industry rule of thumb is that it would be more common to see a foreign currency equity portfolio left at least partly unhedged, while a fixed income portfolio would be expected to be largely hedged.Colin Crownover, head of currency management at State Street Global Advisors, says there is something wrong with accepting unhedged foreign currency risk from a portfolio of foreign currency bonds. At a time of virtually zero returns, that would constitute an almost pure currency portfolio rather than a bond portfolio. “Why would you invest in an asset offering zero return and lots of volatility?” he asks.“It doesn’t make sense. Unless you are taking a view on currency return, unhedged foreign currency assets don’t belong in your portfolio,” he adds, citing in support an International Monetary Fund paper on the subject published in 2010 (Currency Hedging for International Portfolios, by Jochen M. Schmittmann.)Then again, some investors might find that an attractive investment proposition. “If you choose the right currency, it can provide you with great alpha opportunities,” says Julian Le Beron, head of developed markets at Rogge Global Partners. “The costs of hedging and rolling over those hedges could reduce your potential profits.”For John Normand, head of foreign exchange strategy at JPMorgan, the issue is a no-brainer. “You should hedge if you think the currency in question is going down, any loss would be large relative to the value of the asset and the cost of hedging is low,” he recommends.He lists four principal reasons why investors might not hedge.One, they might not know the risk exists. Two, they know it exists but think it is trivial. Three, they perceive that it costs too much. Four, they think that any fall in the value of the currency will eventually be reversed.Amid the arguments and counter-arguments, Alex McKenna, head of systematic funds at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, reports clear investor demand for currency-hedged share classes. He echoes the sentiment that the decision on which route to take boils down to whether the investor is happy to take currency exposure.“For some it would be a positive step to do so,” he says. “A euro-based investor buying in to the US might currently want to take the dollar exposure, and Middle East investors have a certain appetite for it, but overall we find that most people prefer to buy our currency-hedged share classes rather than add foreign currency exposure to the equity exposure.” UK investors, he adds, will tend to prefer sterling-hedged share classes.The convergence of interest rates in the principal global economies has a part to play, he goes on to explain.As foreign currency forward contracts are in essence the expression through the exchange rate of expected interest rate differentials over the contract period, when differentials are in effect non-existent, hedging is easier to explain and looks less expensive. That combination could just tip the balance for the undecided.In the end, it is clear, everything depends on the investors’ understanding and tolerance of foreign currency risk. There is no single right answer to the question of whether to hedge or not to hedge.Consideration of the question does, however, prompt the posing of at least one other. If an investor has zero tolerance of foreign-currency risk, should that investor even be considering investing in a foreign-currency asset?
287;STT;State Street Corp;2013-03-31T04:14:46Z;Euro still needs stronger fundamentals;The single currency is deemed to be overvalued, but will survive the crises;When monetary historians look back at the effect of the Cyprus crisis on the euro, all they will be able to see is some volatility and a brief drop against the dollar.It will probably be reduced to a footnote compared with the strong narratives, both within the eurozone and in other developed nations, that are expected to affect the single currency in the months ahead. As for all the drama that unfolded in Nicosia last month, investors now take developments in the eurozone with a pinch of salt.“This is a bit of noise, but I think we will travel through this. The markets have already normalised. The big problem is the market validation for fundamental growth,” says Bill Street, head of investment for State Street Global Advisors.The market feels the crisis is largely under control after Mario Draghi’s commitment to avoid what investors call a “tail risk”– the sinking of the euro. “It’s not a bad environment to be taking risk premium embedded in risky assets,” says Mr Street.Despite the uncertainty over the fallout from the Cyprus crisis on investors, the political stalemate in Italy and upcoming German elections, the impact on the euro is expected to be limited to just heightened volatility.Scott Thiel, deputy chief investment officer of fixed income at BlackRock, adds: “Before Cyprus, the Italian election had introduced some volatility. But in many respects, the process of recovery in the eurozone is continuing.“The fundamentals are ones where investors are growing more comfortable with eurozone risk. I don’t think the investor view on the healing process has changed.”The euro is supported by money still flowing into Europe, including in peripheral countries, where investors believe the “tail risks are [still] priced out to a large extent”. The question is for how long can the euro withstand downward pressures?The single currency, managers say, is still perceived as largely overvalued despite having weakened quite considerably since a five-month high at $1.3648 early February. The single currency traded at $1.2855 just after the Cyprus bailout.Latest growth figures were disappointing across the eurozone bloc, including Germany, but the European Central Bank has said it expects growth to make a comeback in the second half of the year.“What we need in the eurozone to justify the strength of the currency is the validation of fundamental and growth projections for peripheral and core Europe,” says Mr Street.“In the next few months, the market could get impatient quickly if we don’t see supportive data in fundamentals. For the euro, you’ll probably have a flight to quality.”Andreas König, a senior portfolio manager, foreign exchange, at Pioneer Investments, says a real move lower in the eurozone is dependent on the strengthening of the dollar, the main reserve currency.“Things support the dollar, including tensions coming back in the euro, surprisingly good data from the US and the revolution with shale gas energy,” he says.“As soon as data improves further in the US, the rate cycle will also change. I think we’re not quite there, but we’re not far.”Another significant driver for the euro is the threatening global currency war. A lot of economies are using their currencies as policy levers to devalue and gain a competitive advantage, and the question is whether the ECB will resort to similar devices.Officials in the eurozone have expressed concerns about the strength of the currency, and said they desire to depreciate the euro to stimulate exports.Although not a policy objective for the ECB, Mr Draghi said earlier this year that the euro’s appreciation was a downside risk for inflation, a key policy target.James Wood-Collins, chief executive of Record Currency Management, says: “There is a strong motivation for all developed markets to depreciate. Most of the economies need to find growth somewhere.“However, the dollar, the euro, the yen and the sterling cannot go down at the same time. We see within the eurozone greater divide and also more room to manoeuvre to achieve that.”With the euro still looking overvalued and the threat of country bailouts barely moving the currency, eyes are looking towards Frankfurt for a response to the eurozone’s economic woes.

This will mean greater transparency, increased efficiencies in trading and greater competitiveness in pricing.This forecast comes from Jim Cochrane, who started his professional life flying US military intelligence aircraft and is now director of analytics at New York-based Investment Technology Group.TCA will assist clients beyond the requirements of regulatory compliance. Their attention will turn away from the question of whether they have benefited from the best execution available and towards implementation shortfall and process improvement, he adds.TCA has been the topic of much discussion in recent years, not least because of the launch of a series of legal actions against custodian banks by US pension funds.In the vanguard was Edmund G Brown Jr, attorney-general of California at the time. In 2009, he alleged that State Street had made excessive profits from FX transactions arising from the day-to-day servicing needs of assets belonging to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System. State Street says it is vigorously defending the litigation.Virginia and Florida filed similar suits against Bank of New York Mellon. Virginia and BNYM settled out of court on undisclosed terms in November 2012 after a judge had earlier dismissed their claim while leaving the door open for the state to refile. Virginia and BNYM subsequently renewed their relationship for another five years, the bank insisting that areas of dispute should be resolved through commercial negotiations rather than through litigation of baseless claims. “We will continue to defend ourselves where appropriate,” BNYM said.These actions traced their roots to 2003, when Calpers, the world’s largest pension fund, appointed currency risk specialist Record Currency Management to analyse foreign exchange transactions. A later paper by Record, FX Transaction Costs – Plugging the Leakage in Returns, said the extent to which custodian banks profited from foreign exchange activity seemed excessive to most, especially when they failed to provide proper disclosure of actual profits. The substance of the paper remains relevant today, roughly 21 months since it was first published, says James Wood-Collins, chief executive of Record.A year or two later something seems to have changed for the better in terms of custodian behaviour in pricing foreign exchange transactions, if anecdotal evidence can be relied upon. Mr Cochrane, for example, describes custodians as “having come inside the daily rate”, whereas previously they operated some distance outside it.This could, it must be said, owe as much to market forces as to legal actions. Torben Kaaber, chief executive of Saxo Capital Markets UK, observes that there has always been a premium associated with institutional FX trading and that continues to be the case.However, whereas a decade ago there were very few platforms available to handle institutional requirements and going through a prime broker was a Hobson’s choice, now high speed and highly sophisticated platforms are available in the market and offer a more cost-effective solution. “As a result, we see outsourcing of trading requirements – particularly in the FX space – very much as the direction of travel,” he says.The markets have moved strongly to execute online, using single-dealer platforms, multi-dealer platforms and aggregators, adds Mr Wood-Collins. As these platforms represent an increasing share of the total market they are creating a rich data set of online prices, he says. This, in turn, highlights poor practice. It very quickly becomes clear who is charging more than they ought.Custodians have, without exception, responded to the challenges they face, offering more models for execution. They are offering clients the option of, for example, accepting the market price at the time of trading or a predetermined spread over a predetermined benchmark, Mr Wood-Collins states. Toby Cole, managing director in the FX business at RBS Markets, says that a spread of one basis point is not unrealistic, depending on the currency involved and the volume of the trade.The heightened focus on price has also been driven by the prevailing economic conditions of recent years. Investors who may have been accustomed to annual returns around or in excess of double digits will find, suggests Mr Cole, that cutting a few basis points off their foreign exchange transaction costs can improve their Sharpe ratio significantly.——————————————-Tips for investorsITG’s Jim Cochrane lists a number of ways investors can ensure the institutions with which they are executing FX transactions deliver the best deal.● Ask for a time stamp● If the custodian refuses one, cap the rate; insist on nothing beyond the high and low of the day● Instruct the custodian to stay within a certain spread above the market rate at the time of the trade"
289;STT;State Street Corp;2013-03-24T03:10:10Z;BlackRock hopes job cuts will aid agility;Observers believe changes will help develop retail side;BlackRock’s now well-documented culling of staff is not revolutionary in the finance industry, but it does show the group’s seriousness about growing its retail business, sources say.The group is letting go some 300 workers, or less than 3 per cent of its 10,500-person global workforce, in a follow-up to BlackRock’s leadership restructuring late last year.The US fund house is not the only fund manager cutting jobs. State Street announced in January that it would cut 630 jobs across its business, including State Street Global Advisors. Legg Mason’s decision to fold the Legg Mason Capital Management division into its ClearBridge Investments unit is also expected to result in some lay-offs, as reported in January.BlackRock is shifting responsibilities and roles to different locations and areas of the business, leading to what president Rob Kapito calls a change in the mix of employees in the business.“These moves will give high potential employees greater responsibility and additional career opportunities, and will make us a more agile organisation better positioned to respond to changing client and market needs,” Mr Kapito said in a memo to staff last Monday.BlackRock said jobs will be cut across all parts of the organisation and be largely proportional to the group’s geography and business lines.The fund house will continue to hire and will probably have a larger headcount by the end of the year, states Mr Kapito’s memo.This is the second mass lay-off in less than two years at BlackRock. It cut its workforce by 3.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011.That action was a cost-cutting initiative designed to streamline operations and make the group more competitive in the marketplace, its annual report said.Industry observers say BlackRock is taking a Jack Welch approach to driving corporate growth in an asset management industry that has seen slowing revenue gains.The former chairman and CEO of General Electric was known for reducing headcounts and increasing pressure and competition among staff.“Every organisation is going through this process of identifying the bottom decile of employees,” says George Wilbanks, partner at Wilbanks Partners. However, the approaches to identifying and eliminating poor performers vary. Some asset managers, including Vanguard and AllianceBernstein, have faced legal challenges to forced ranking systems made famous at General Electric.Jeffrey Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, says: “This [BlackRock] is simply an organisation that is doing well and they want to continue to do better, and they want to make sure that growth does not cover over areas of weakness or mediocrity.”BlackRock executives have identified the retail channel as a significant growth opportunity and an underpenetrated market for the group. It has reorganised the retail management infrastructure and replaced investment teams that have underperformed.Retail represents only 12 per cent of BlackRock’s assets under management, but 34 per cent of its base fee revenue. And while its iShares ETF business dominates market share globally, its mutual fund business represents less than 2 per cent of the market.How the cuts will affect the group’s newly integrated retail salesforce is unclear. Executives claim it is the largest in the industry, with nearly 275 staff.It comprises both legacy BlackRock fund wholesalers and the iShares distribution force that was brought together in a bid to align the exchange traded fund unit with BlackRock’s other retail products.Wholesalers are now charged with selling across the group’s product line-up and are compensated for the success of the mutual fund and ETF business.In a presentation at the 2013 Credit Suisse Financial Services Forum in February, Mr Kapito noted that the company’s new sales approach requires some personnel changes.“It has required me to upgrade the salesforce because they have to be able to face the client and talk about their portfolio, not a product,” he said.Mr Kapito’s memo to staff last week may be a shot across the bow to get employees on board with this new integrated infrastructure and sales approach or face the consequences, says Todd Westby, CEO of T Hayes Consulting.Neil Bathon, founder of the Fuse Research Network, says: “It seems that managers are finally realising that the net effect of allowing poor-performing employees to stick around goes way beyond the shortfall in assets.”Firms are increasingly using data and tools to examine relative productivity and effectiveness of their sales and marketing efforts and make changes where they are needed, he adds.This story first appeared in Ignites, a Financial Times news service
290;STT;State Street Corp;2013-03-13T23:18:39Z;ETF wars: beefed-up alliance;;What happens when a big manufacturer joins forces with a big distributor? BlackRock (the largest provider of exchange traded funds via iShares) and Fidelity Investments (the largest online brokerage by assets) aim to find out. The two titans of asset management have teamed up on ETFs in a strategic alliance that involves expanding an existing deal by doubling the number of iShares ETFs that can be traded commission-free on Fidelity’s platform. Fidelity, which specialises in old-school, actively managed mutual funds, also plans to sell managed portfolios and investment strategies using iShares’ passively managed ETFs.The fast-growing market for exchange-traded products, now with $2tn of assets, is dominated by its three largest providers. iShares with a 39 per cent share globally, State Street with 17 per cent and Vanguard with 13 per cent, according to ETFGI. Competition has been heating up. Vanguard has been reducing its ETF fees as assets grow. Charles Schwab, a smaller player, has aggressively slashed prices to lure assets and BlackRock has also cut fees on some of its funds. (State Street has so far stayed out of the price fight.) Ranked by the average asset weighted expense ratio across all of their ETFs, Schwab’s now are the cheapest, according to Morningstar, followed by Vanguard, then State Street and then iShares.With their beefed up alliance, BlackRock, which has strong institutional distribution, gets a direct avenue to retail investors. For Fidelity, the partnership represents a way to develop an ETF presence without having to compete with highly entrenched players in plain-vanilla, passively managed ETFs where fees are shrinking, in particular. Fidelity can now concentrate on actively managed and other ETFs where it can use its expertise and presumably charge more money.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
291;STT;State Street Corp;2013-03-05T20:22:08Z;Investors ready for high-yield sell-off;;Bets against the largest exchange traded funds investing in junk bonds have risen to their highest in five years, the latest sign investors are preparing for a sell-off in high-yield debt.Short interest on junk bond ETFs run by BlackRock and State Street has grown rapidly in recent weeks and touched its highest levels since October 2007.The growing number of “short” positions show that investors are now buying protection against a reversal in high-yield debt, while shifting money into other assets such as stocks and loans.ETFs allow investors to speculate on the securities without actually owning them. They have become popular among large institutional investors and other mutual funds that are not allowed to bet against their own holdings.“ETFs are one way in which a large pool of investors can access liquidity in high-yield markets,” said Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. “That’s what those investors are doing, and by shorting them, their view is clear: it will be harder to get strong returns on high-yield from here.”Investors’ growing pessimism on junk bonds has been stoked by the huge appetite for the securities, combined with record issuance of lower quality debt.During 2012 and early 2013, a strong rally on junk bonds pushed yields on the securities to record lows. Large fund managers, including BlackRock, Pimco and a host of so-called “macro” hedge funds, have warned that valuations on some of the bonds were “extreme”.Now, many of the big funds are looking to get out, fearing that junk bond prices are set to fall. If the economy deteriorates, the rising probability of default could cause spreads to widen. If the economy improves, yields would rise for all manner of fixed income securities.Worries over a potential sell off in high-yield is no longer just in the retail market. It has hit institutional investors.As investors have turned more cautious, average yields on junk debt have rebounded since touching an all-time low of 5.61 per cent in late January. Spreads on high-yield credit default swaps, which insure against corporate defaults and are used to hedge risk, touched their highest level this year at 455 basis points last week.On Monday, about 8 per cent of shares in BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond Fund were on loan to short sellers, while almost 9 per cent of all shares in State Street’s SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond Fund were on loan, according to Markit and Bloomberg data.Analysts said those levels of shorts also point to large bond investors’ inability to unload sizeable positions in high-yield securities, which were accumulated during last year’s rally.“Shorting a high-yield ETF is sometimes the only way some institutional accounts can protect their long-only positions,” said Adrian Miller, director of fixed income strategy at GMP Securities. “Worries over a potential sell off in high-yield is no longer just in the retail market. It has hit institutional investors.”Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock in New York
292;STT;State Street Corp;2013-03-05T18:36:27Z;BlackRock and Vanguard renew ETF rivalry;Investor inflows rise after first two months of 2013;BlackRock has established an early narrow lead over Vanguard in the race among providers of exchange traded funds for investors’ cash.BlackRock’s iShares business gathered inflows of $18.7bn in January and February, an increase of 14 per cent on the same period a year ago while Vanguard has seen inflows jump 41.9 per cent to $16.6bn, according to ETFGI, a consultancy that analyses ETF industry trends.State Street Global Advisors, meanwhile, the third largest player globally by assets, has made a faltering start to the year with net outflows of $5.8bn in January and February, mainly due to investors pulling money out of the world’s largest gold ETF, the SPDR Gold Trust.PowerShares, the fourth largest player globally by assets, has also made a slow start to 2013 with inflows down 68.6 per cent to $1.6bn, in contrast to its smaller rival WisdomTree, which has seen inflows more than double to $5.2bn so far this year.Charles Schwab, the US financial services company, which recently announced that it had passed the $10bn mark for ETF assets, has also made a strong start to 2013 with inflows up 58.8 per cent to $1.3bn.Global inflows into ETFs (funds and products) now total $49.1bn, just 2 per cent behind the fast start that the ETF industry made in the first two months of last year when it pulled in $50.1bn.Deborah Fuhr, founding partner at ETFGI, said the data were further evidence for the widely anticipated “ great rotation” between equities and bonds.Inflows into equity ETFs were up 59.7 per cent to $46bn in the first two months of January and February while inflows into fixed income ETFs were down 79.7 per cent to just $2.8bn.Within fixed income, investment grade and high yield ETFs saw inflows drop sharply, by 74 per cent and 85 per cent respectively. Investors also pulled money out of sovereign bond ETFs and money market ETFs but at a slower rate than in the same period last year.With the US equity market moving last month to within striking distance of a record high, ETFs linked to stock markets in North America saw inflows increase by a third to $20.4bn.There were also encouraging signs of an improvement in risk appetite for equity investors in Europe with inflows into ETFs linked to European equities reaching $2.5bn so far this year, compared with just $170m in the first two months of 2012.
293;STT;State Street Corp;2013-03-04T18:37:10Z;State Street defiance goes only so far;;State Street’s management is plotting acquisitions – even after shareholder angst about the execution of previous deals – and vowing not to settle customer lawsuits over currency transactions.However, the defiance only goes so far. Jay Hooley, chief executive of the custody bank, is emphasising cost-cutting, job losses and organic growth, all in the pursuit of improved margins, during an investor meeting and an interview with the Financial Times last week.One of State Street’s shareholders is Trian Partners, the activist investment vehicle for Nelson Peltz, Edward Garden and Peter May, and they have pressured the bank to improve profitability, expressing concern that acquisitions have burdened the company with too large a cost base.Amid widespread discontent, four of the largest shareholders last year agitated for management change and Edward Resch, chief financial officer, announced his retirement shortly afterwards.State Street is in its third round of restructuring in two years, with a big technology project under way to shift to the use of what it calls a “private cloud”, and 2,900 job cuts, or about a 10th of its workforce.Mr Hooley says it was a “natural opportunity” to acquire custody businesses from European banks to follow his 2009 acquisition of a securities servicing business from Intesa Sanpaolo, the Italian bank.But he added that Europeans remained too fearful of a fresh crisis to lose such a funding source. “If you are a bank, particularly a European bank, it trumps what you could get from selling the asset, so until you see sustained stability . . . you are unlikely to see banks sell,” Mr Hooley says.The bank is fighting a downturn in some of its businesses related to market activity, such as securities lending and foreign exchange trading, that he expects to recover. “Re-risking, it is happening, we see it, the question is will there be follow through?”Securities lending, where investors such as pension funds lend out their holdings to hedge funds, is at half the level it was at the peak of the market. “It’s likely that you’ll see a little more leverage in the system”, he says. “If we are at half of where we were before, could we get half of that back? That doesn’t seem unreasonable.”In foreign exchange, he says there are similar cyclical factors affecting revenues, but also some structural factors. State Street and its peers face suits from several states on behalf of pension funds that believe they were unfairly charged for currency transactions.“The trust banks haven’t been perfect over the course of time,” says Mr Hooley, and the lawsuits have caused clients to look at the way they trade currencies.However, the chief executive says that he has no intention of settling any of the foreign exchange litigation grinding through the courts.“The dispute largely revolves around disclosure,” says Mr Hooley, and “we felt good about the transparency and disclosure back in 2009 when all this came about”.“For us its principle and precedent, we don’t think we did anything wrong, and so we need to defend ourselves.”
294;STT;State Street Corp;2013-02-24T04:16:17Z;Sharia funds offer responsible investing;Hasan Al Jabri, chief executive of Saudi Arabia’s Sedco, says Islamic financial products represent opportunities;"Despite myriad column inches, and the urgings of governments from east to west, the Islamic fund industry remains something of a pygmy.The markets for Islamic banking, insurance and sukuk bonds have all seen solid growth in recent years, but the sharia-compliant fund industry remains tiny, with Ernst & Young estimating it at $58bn, as of 2010, a fraction of the $300bn sukuk sector.The sharia fund market, which is heavily skewed towards equities, was not helped by its emergence coinciding with the global financial crisis, damaging confidence at an inopportune time.However, to Hasan Al Jabri, chief executive of Saudi Arabia’s Sedco Capital, the resultant “chronic” lack of high-quality sharia-compliant products represents both a challenge and an opportunity.“Islamic investors have traditionally found it difficult to access the same investment opportunities as non-Islamic investors. The growth of sharia-compliant investment has been stunted by a reputation for a lack of diversity, poor performance and high fees,” says Mr Al Jabri, who also cites the lack of “credibility” of houses that sell both sharia and non-sharia products and a view in some quarters that sharia funds are a relatively unimportant niche.“For some of the western banks it’s not really meaningful, it’s not worth the attention. When we grow to $5bn, it’s very meaningful for us,” he says.Since May 2012, Sedco Capital has “addressed these challenges head on”, building what is believed to be the largest sharia-compliant fund platform in Luxembourg. Its five vehicles, covering passive US equities, fundamental US equities, global dividend stocks, emerging market equities and global real estate investment trusts, hold $900m of assets.Although this number is small in the great scheme of things, Mr Al Jabri points out that Sedco’s sharia-compliant US Equities Passive fund, with assets of $360m, dwarfs the $20m held by the iShares MSCI USA Islamic exchange traded fund, and has lower fees, 40 basis points against 50bp.“I’m not aware of any single entity that has the range of sharia products we do. Certainly in Luxembourg we are the largest platform and the most diverse,” says Mr Al Jabri.Jeddah-based Sedco is currently launching two more vehicles with one, the Global Market Sentiment fund, designed to switch between equities and Islamic time deposits, or murabaha, as the manager sees fit.“We are very excited about it,” says Mr Al Jabri. “It’s a tactical fund. The economic cycles have become shorter, the markets move very fast. We see a bull market then a bear market then a bull market, it’s happening every two to three months.“Therefore we need a tactical component because we cannot short equities in sharia-compliant funds. It will look at the fundamentals of the market. Where the market is unduly pessimistic, we go into the market. When it’s too optimistic, we put it in murabaha. We are telling the manager, when it doesn’t make sense, have the courage to pull the money out.”The Market Sentiment fund is being launched alongside a fixed income equivalent, and each vehicle has been seeded with $150m from Sedco’s wealth management clients.The plan is to launch around eight to 10 funds during 2013, raising assets on the Luxembourg platform to $1.6bn. Asia-Pacific and emerging market equity funds are on the drawing board, alongside a US real estate fund and private equity funds covering the US and Brazil.All the funds are outsourced to external managers with, for instance, State Street Global Advisors managing the US Equities Passive fund and Credit Suisse contracted to run the two latest offerings.Sedco has a series of Saudi feeder funds to channel money from its home market into the Luxembourg platform, but Mr Al Jabri says the bulk of the money is coming from elsewhere, a trend he expects to become more pronounced, even though Sedco is targeting only “sophisticated” investors.“Several private banks have approached us. They want to do their due diligence and then they will start very actively marketing it to their own private clients,” says Mr Al Jabri, who says Sedco has also had “preliminary discussions” with non-Muslim investors.Indeed, Mr Al Jabri believes sharia investment could find favour with a growing number of western investors.“We don’t do alcohol, arms, the financial industry [because of leverage], pork,” he says. “We feel strongly about responsible investing. I deserve to make money only when I’m creating value for the economy, I’m helping to create the jobs. This is a very important factor for us and is something that the world really needs.”This approach is perhaps more noticeable in Sedco’s private equity operations, where it already has some non-Muslim investors.The company started investing in both property and private equity in the 1970s, when it was formed as the family office of Sheikh Salem Bin Mahfouz, the founder of Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial Bank.However, restrictions on interest payments and debt mandated by a sharia-compliant approach means Sedco cannot participate in leveraged or management buyouts, although it is happy to invest in indebted companies as long as their debt is no more than a third of their market capitalisation.This approach forces Sedco to concentrate on targeting growth companies via venture capital, something a number of established private equity groups are happy to accommodate by setting up parallel sharia-compliant funds alongside their mainstream offerings.“The portfolio will be 20-30 per cent different [from the mainstream fund],” says Mr Al Jabri, who says this approach has benefited investors in both private and public equity markets.“We were out of financial institutions and insurance companies because their leverage was too high. That has helped our performance in the past few years, although it can work against us. In 2012 we missed out on opportunities.“Excessive leverage can drive companies into difficulties. I think that’s the main difference; when markets go down they are the most drastically affected.”——————————————-Curriculum vitaeHasan Al JabriBorn

295;STT;State Street Corp;2013-02-15T19:27:29Z;Talk of dwindling ETF providers disputed;Industry observers challenge forecasts of consolidation;The belief that radical change is likely in the European exchange traded funds market on the back of BlackRock’s recent acquisition of Credit Suisse’s ETF business has been disputed by industry commentators.According to Hector McNeil, co-chief executive of Boost, a new provider of leveraged and inverse exchange traded products, many of the investment banks that have ETF operations will exit the market because of increased regulation and revenue pressures.He predicts large-scale consolidation in both the number of providers and products.Mr McNeil argues that BlackRock’s recent purchase is just the start of a consolidation process that is likely to lead to a 30 per cent reduction in the number of ETF providers in Europe as large asset managers take out smaller competing players.However, State Street Global Advisors, the world’s second-largest ETF manager, has indicated it sees organic growth, not acquisitions, as its preferred strategy in Europe, while Vanguard, the number three player globally, has not historically pursued takeovers to build scale.Industry observers also say ETF operations remain profitable for bank-owned issuers. In addition to management fees, ETF transactions provide valuable flows for banks’ trading desks as well as opportunities to use ETF holdings in securities lending operations.But with trading spread across multiple countries and exchanges, the fragmented nature of Europe’s ETF market has led to a proliferation of subscale products. More than 1,200 exchange traded products in Europe have assets of less than $50m, compared with around 700 in the US.Providers in Europe, however, remain reluctant to shrink product ranges. Just 66 exchange traded products were delisted in Europe last year, compared with 100 in the US.Michael John Lytle, a director at Source, says that large institutional investors can only deal with a small number of providers in Europe without running into size constraints on their trades.This helps to create a self-reinforcing circle for managers of larger ETFs as their products are able to absorb big inflows without triggering concerns about concentration risks from their investors.Last year, the three fastest-growing providers (iShares, Source and ETF Securities) were able to grab almost 80 per cent of new European inflows, illustrating the challenge that smaller providers face in trying to build products of scale that can attract institutional investors.Investment inflows also show mixed fortunes for bank providers of ETFs.Commerzbank and BNP Paribas’ ETF operations have suffered two years of net outflows in 2011 and 2012, a trend that continued in January.But UBS appears to have benefited from Credit Suisse’s exit. It has become the second-largest provider behind BlackRock of “physical” ETFs that buy the constituents of an underlying index, rather than using derivatives to track a benchmark.Clemens Reuter, head of UBS exchange traded funds, says investors are showing a preference for physical ETFs and want a provider that has established a strong record in managing these vehicles efficiently.“We are committed to ETFs, which are a fundamentally important business for UBS,” says Mr Reuter, pointing out that UBS completed the largest ETF listings on record in both London and Italy last year.Deutsche Bank and Société Générale also started to offer physical ETFs alongside derivative linked “synthetic products” last year to compete more effectively with BlackRock.Both also moved their ETF operations (db-X trackers and Lyxor) from their investment banking arms into their asset management businesses.These moves prompted talk that the parent banks might consider exiting their ETF operations as part of a retreat from non-core operations.But executives at db-X trackers and Lyxor insist their moves under the asset management umbrella will strengthen their abilities to provide a broader range of products.Arnaud Llinas, head of Lyxor’s ETF and index business, says the closer relationship between Lyxor’s ETF and indexing operations will help it become more nimble in reacting to market trends and developing products that meet clients’ needs.Mr Llinas emphasises that innovation is at the heart of Lyxor’s strategy as it aims to become a “more global actor” in the ETF industry. He anticipates developments in both dividend and volatility linked products and is seeing strong interest in risk-balanced strategies.Lyxor also recently set up an asset management unit for the UK with a dedicated institutional sales force. Mr Llinas says he is determined that Lyxor should build “a serious presence” in the UK as part of his ambitions to recapture the ranking as number-two ETF provider in Europe from Deutsche Bank.Another industry analyst says Mr McNeil’s predictions are unlikely because of the strong growth prospects for ETFs in Europe.“The reality is that the number of providers in Europe is rising,” says Deborah Fuhr, founding partner at ETFGI, a consultancy that analyses ETF trends. Ms Fuhr pointed to the example of First Trust, the US asset manager, which last week announced plans to launch its first ETFs in Europe in the first quarter of the year.Ms Fuhr said ETFGI has fielded enquiries from asset managers in the US, Asia and Latin America seeking advice about the possibility of setting up in Europe.

297;STT;State Street Corp;2013-02-10T06:25:43Z;State Street battles two US lawsuits;Group denies retaining an ‘exorbitant share’ of revenues;State Street is fighting two separate US lawsuits over claims it retained an “exorbitant share” of securities lending revenues, allegedly causing investors to suffer “massive losses” amounting to “hundreds of millions of dollars”.The Boston-based group is facing two separate suits from the Retirees of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company Health Care Trust and the Glass Dimensions Inc Profit Sharing Plan and Trust.Last week FTfm revealed that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is being sued in the US over allegations it systematically “looted” securities lending revenues from investors in some of its iShares exchange traded funds. BlackRock is contesting the allegations.The Goodyear and Glass Dimensions suits, both filed in the Massachusetts District Court, allege that State Street Corporation, State Street Global Advisors and State Street Bank & Trust Company breached their fiduciary duty in relation to a collective trust.The Glass Dimensions filing claims that State Street took an “unreasonably large” 50 per cent share of the net income generated from lending securities owned by the trust, amounting to “fiduciary self-dealing and enrichment in violation of the defendants’ fiduciary obligations”.“The 50 per cent received by defendants far exceeds industry standards,” the filing argues.The Goodyear suit was filed in January, while the Glass Dimensions action was originally filed in 2010 and has since been subject to a series of legal skirmishes.The latter is a real David and Goliath battle. State Street has $2.1tn of assets under management and $23.4tn under custody and administration. The Glass Dimensions trust has a portfolio of $77,000.Nevertheless, the filing claims that, in aggregate, the pension plans invested in the collective trust suffered “massive losses …hundreds of millions of dollars of retirement savings” as a result of the breaches of fiduciary duties.State Street said in a statement that “we believe these cases are without merit and continue to vigorously defend ourselves against these allegations”.One court document filed by State Street said a 50 per cent fee was “not uncommon” in the industry and was comparable with fees negotiated with non-affiliated lending agents.The suits represent a widening of an investor backlash against some institutions’ securities lending activities. Wells Fargo is fighting a class-action lawsuit involving around 100 institutional investors initially filed by The City of Farmington Hills Employees Retirement System in the Minnesota District Court, and a separate action from the Nebraska Public Power District Employees Retirement Plan.The class action alleges the bank caused losses for investors by failing to ensure that collateral funds received in exchange for lent securities were invested in safe, liquid, short-term investments. The Nebraska suit claims the securities lending programme invested in two “risky” structured vehicles, Cheyne Finance and Stanfield Victoria Finance, both of which later collapsed.Wells Fargo said it “strongly denied the allegations”, adding “we strongly believe that the investments made on behalf of clients in the securities lending programme were in accordance with investment guidelines and were prudent and suitable at the time of purchase”.New guidelines from the European Securities and Markets Authority, which come into force next week, will require asset managers to return all securities lending revenues, net of costs, to investors.
298;STT;State Street Corp;2013-02-10T06:21:33Z;BlackRock ‘too big’, bemoan its rivals;More vigorous competition is required in Europe;BlackRock’s leading position in Europe’s rapidly growing exchange traded funds market has prompted some observers to ask if its iShares ETF business has become too big.BlackRock strengthened its position further by acquiring the ETF arm of Credit Suisse in January even though it already commanded a formidable presence in Europe.If regulators agree to the deal, iShares will control 42.7 per cent of European ETF market assets, triggering concerns that effective competition is being stifled.“But who will pick a fight with them?” asks one ex-iShares executive.Regulators will not comment on deals under review so it is unclear if they will analyse the implications for the ETF market or the larger Ucits fund universe.The combined iShares and CS ETF platforms will account for around 2.3 per cent of the assets of European Ucits, a level thought unlikely to trigger competition concerns among regulators.But Shiv Taneja, managing director at Cerulli Associates, a fund consultancy, says iShares’ expansion “definitely stifles competition”.“It gives iShares purchasing power and scale, but longer term it is not good,” says Mr Taneja, adding that investors do not want an industry where one player has a majority share and the rest are just minor players.BlackRock declined to comment.Fund managers that build portfolios from ETFs and index funds have mixed views on the significance of the deal.ETFs from iShares make up more than half of the trackers used by Evercore Pan-Asset Management. But Christopher Aldous, Pan’s chief executive, says Credit Suisse’s exit is “not a good development” as it reduces competition and choice.“We need to have more competition in the European ETF market to ensure that average costs falls to around 20 basis points from their current range of 30bp to 40bp,” says Mr Aldous.Bruno Poulin, chief executive of French ETF boutique Ossiam, agrees: “Price competition is good if you have enough players to compete, but when there is one player that is too big with very strong pricing power, ultimately it is not in clients’ best interests.”Anthony Christodoulou, founder of WorldTrack, an advisory boutique, takes a different view.He argues that concerns about the dominance of any single provider are irrelevant because low barriers to entry mean new competitors will enter if costs are held too high by established players.WorldTrack now regularly uses five or six different providers and up to 20 ETFs to ensure diversification in any one of its portfolios.“Competition has helped to reduce expenses across our ETF portfolios and also to diversify our counterparty risks to ETF providers that employ derivatives or run securities lending programmes,” says Mr Christodoulou.He says the effects of competition are also evident in improvements in trading costs because bid and ask spreads have narrowed as trading liquidity has risen.Mr Christodoulou says ETF providers have one aim: to increase assets so that they can reduce fees for investors and improve margins for themselves.He points to the US, where charges for S&P 500 ETFs have declined to less than 10 basis points even as the largest providers have increased their market share.In the US market, BlackRock’s operations account for a comparable share (41.4 per cent) to Europe but it faces much stiffer competition from established rivals such as State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard.SSgA accounts for almost a quarter (23.6 per cent) of US ETF assets but has only a 1.1 per cent controlling share in Europe.Market participants have privately expressed surprise that SSgA did not bid more aggressively to buy the Credit Suisse business.Speaking recently in London, Michael Karpik, head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said SSgA’s ETF business would grow organically, suggesting that acquisitions are not part of its strategy to accelerate the development of its European operations.Meanwhile, Vanguard, which has an 18.1 per cent market share in the US, is only starting to ramp up its European ETF operations.The current competition for iShares in Europe is fragmented. The number-two player, db-X trackers, the ETF arm of Deutsche Bank, has a market share of 13.7 per cent while Lyxor, the third-largest, accounts for 10.6 per centPeter Sleep, portfolio manager at Seven Investment Management, says that “ETF pricing competition [in Europe] seems to have died somewhat”.He notes that the investment banks that issue derivative-linked “synthetic” ETFs were winning market share before 2011 by offering cheaper products.But that dynamic was interrupted by a spate of criticisms of synthetic ETFs by regulators in 2011 and a hailstorm of negative media coverage.Even though European regulators backed away from imposing any restrictions on their products, synthetic providers have struggled to recover momentum since then.Deutsche Bank and Lyxor, the two largest synthetic providers, have even started to issue “physical” ETFs in an effort to rebuild assets.The uncertainty created by regulators’ criticisms of synthetic products encouraged investors to switch to physical ETFs. The main beneficiary of the switch was iShares. It has gathered almost two-thirds (64.1 per cent) of the new inflows into European ETFs over the past two years.BlackRock expects European ETF assets to double over the next three years to around $700bn. Just maintaining its current market share would take iShares’ assets close to $300bn from $140bn at the end of 2012.But even this might prove conservative if it can continue to attract the lion’s share of new inflows.Mr Sleep says iShares looks likely to enjoy strong inflows in Europe in future years and “very little” price competition.“Great for [BlackRock] shareholders, not so great for consumers,” he adds.Additional reporting by Madison Marriage

300;STT;State Street Corp;2013-02-01T20:00:15Z;Bulls charge ahead as stocks lift off;;"Bullishness is back. Exuberance is the new cool. World equity markets have had one of the best starts to the year in the past two decades. The US S&P 500 saw the biggest January rise since 1997, and hit a fresh five-year high of 1,511 by lunchtime on Friday in New York after upbeat US employment data. The FTSE 100 had its best January since 1989, when Donna Summer had a UK chart hit with This time I know it’s for real.The equity rally has put bears on the defensive. But the contest between optimists and pessimists is not over; questions remain over how much further stock indices can rise, whether the rally is simply the result of central bank action, or whether January’s surge has set a classic bear trap for infatuated investors.The bull case for equities rests, first, on diminished risks of economic disaster. The eurozone has not broken up, the US economy has not fallen over its fiscal “cliff” and China’s economy has not crash landed. Last year’s rally was driven by “worries disappearing, rather than positive news”, says Robert Farago, head of asset allocation at Schroders private bank. “This year, risks are more balanced.” Richard Lacaille, chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, says: “We are not forecasting large equity returns, but large enough to justify the volatility risks we see in 2013.”Second, is a more positive global outlook. News this week of an unexpected contraction in the US economy in the fourth quarter of 2012 was shrugged off as a blip. While political uncertainty deterred investment in 2012, the opposite could be the case this year. “We believe that in 2013, companies are going to put their capital to work. This effect is not really discounted in the market,” says William Davies, head of global equities at Threadneedle.With the US fourth-quarter earnings season nearing halfway, S&P 500 profit growth is running at 2.6 per cent year-on-year and has been rising since the start of the season in mid-January. “We are hearing a more confident tone from chief executives, particularly on China and emerging market growth,” says John Butters, analyst at FactSet.Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, concedes stocks may have got ahead of themselves after a strong start, but “underlying fundamentals look good for corporate profits. We see accelerating growth later this year.”The third argument of bulls is that 2013 will see a “great rotation” from recession-proof bonds into riskier equities. Equity funds-tracked EPFR, the funds research company, drew $18.7bn inflows in the final week of January – and over the month saw inflows almost three times greater than into bond funds, data showed on Friday.“From an investor perspective, we know that interest rates at current low levels are not sustainable. That means bond prices are far too high,” says Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive at Hermes Fund Managers. “With shares you are buying access to entities which follow economic growth, pay dividends and are backed by strong balance sheets. Do you really want to lend instead to governments at current levels of debt, or buy corporate bonds, the market for which has already run some way?”Plenty of investors, however, still see reasons for bearish concern. One is the sense of “here we go again”. Optimism has surged in January in previous years – only to decline after a few months. “The equity market is not a great predictor of macroeconomic activity,” says Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. The S&P 500 is in rarefied territory; in 2000 and 2007 it remained only briefly above 1,500.“You have to be careful here – the history of holding a full bag in equities above 1,500 has not been pretty,” says William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Markets.Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, says the January rally has already propelled the S&P to his year-end target of 1,500. While he thinks a move to 1,525 is likely, he is cautious. “We need to see valuation expansion to justify a higher market. The bear case is that the economy is not as strong as we thought.”Another fear is that share prices – like the world’s advanced economies – remain over-reliant on low official interest rates and “quantitative easing”. With expanding central bank balance sheets, and equity markets shrinking because companies are buying back debt, “those are the sort of conditions in which you get equity price inflation”, says Paul Marson, chief investment officer at Lombard Odier. “It is central bank liquidity that is driving the market. It can only last so long. I’m not convinced of the link between asset price inflation and economic growth.”Moreover, the “great rotation” may not live up to its billing. Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist at Citigroup, is bullish longer term on equities, but sees scant evidence yet of retail investors flocking back.“There will be a great rotation, it’s too early at the moment,” says Mr Levkovich. “Buy stocks on weakness, don’t chase strength.”Many institutional investors will be constrained in the amount of additional risk they can take into their portfolios, adds Mr Lacaille at State Street. “Yes, there will be a great rotation, but it may not be so great.”"
301;STT;State Street Corp;2013-02-01T19:19:15Z;Looking for life beyond Pimco;Active ETFs in the US have received plenty of attention, but the wider impact has been muted;The environment for developing a US market for active exchange traded funds may be as open as ever but whether that will drive sponsors and investors to the product remains to be seen.Pimco’s much-anticipated launch of the ETF version of its huge Total Return fund in March 2012 brought star power to active ETFs in the form of bond guru Bill Gross. Assets into the ETF surged on the back of strong performance, making it the best-selling new ETF in the US in 2012.That success has not been lost on other fund giants. In the past year, Federated, Legg Mason, T Rowe Price, AllianceBernstein and Franklin Templeton all received permission from the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch active ETFs. Fidelity Investments applied for such permission in December.But for all the notice Pimco Total Return ETF brought to the active ETF market last year, assets in such products remain a scant portion of the overall ETF market. About $11.2bn of the $1.9tn in global exchange traded product assets were held in active ETF strategies at the end of 2012, according to BlackRock’s ETP Landscape research. While active ETFs raised $6.3bn in assets, they represented 2.4 per cent of total ETP inflows.“Active ETPs have gotten a lot of attention. It’s an enormous opportunity and something that we’re going to be watching very closely. But to date flows and assets in the full blown active space have been de minimis,” says Dodd Kittsley, global head of ETP research at BlackRock.Furthermore, the vast majority of blue-chip active mutual fund players have yet to dive into the ETF market with products.While Pimco proved that an active ETF headed by a star manager could successfully perform relative to a similar mutual fund and gather significant assets, the impact on the industry as a whole is less profound, sources note.“Everyone looked at [Total Return ETF] launch last year as an important catalyst to get growth going in the active ETF space. It certainly did that for itself, but the question is how much did it actually do for other strategies?” says Bill Belden, managing director and head of product development and management at Guggenheim Investments.Apart from Pimco, observers point to several factors that will determine the extent of active ETF growth in the months ahead.Product development is one such factor. The number of active products on the market is fewer than 100 globally.Yet a number of firms launched their first active products last year, including State Street Global Advisors and Northern Trust’s FlexShares ETF unit. In addition, Columbia Management filed plans to quadruple its active ETF line-up with 17 new funds.SSgA is beginning to see some traction in its active asset allocation funds launched in April, particularly among warehouse broker-dealers, says Kevin Quigg, global head of ETF strategy and consulting at the firm. As sponsors continue their education efforts and advisers become comfortable with the ETF structure, they will be more apt to explore elements of the market, such as non-traditional index and active products.“The active space will be a slower burn, but it will burn all the same,” he adds.Regulation plays a heavy hand in active ETF product development. For nearly three years the SEC had placed a moratorium on approving new regulatory relief applications for firms that wanted to use derivatives in their active ETFs.That moratorium was lifted in December, giving managers greater flexibility in how they structure new active ETFs, but significant regulatory hurdles remain. For example, it can take six to 12 months for active ETFs to be reviewed by the SEC’s trading and markets division after it has been approved by the division of investment management. The length of that process is now the most significant regulatory issue for active ETF sponsors, says John McGuire, partner at Bingham.Transparency is also a big hurdle for active mutual fund managers. In the US, active and passive ETFs need to disclose portfolio holdings daily, unlike periodic and delayed disclosure in mutual funds. While fixed income ETF strategies are less affected by portfolio disclosure, stock picking portfolio managers may be hesitant to reveal their bets daily, several sources note.Regardless of the growth rate, sponsors say they believe in a future for active management in ETFs.“We think it has a very bright future. I don’t know if we think it’s a holy grail for investment management, but I do think there are very selective and big opportunities for active management to get traction,” Guggenheim Investments’ Mr Belden says.
302;STT;State Street Corp;2013-02-01T19:17:47Z;Credit Suisse deal may be first of many;A new wave of takeovers could be on the cards;"Just when you thought BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, could not get any bigger, it did.The announcement last month that it is to acquire the exchange traded funds (ETF) arm of Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s second-largest bank, will see the US fund giant add a further $18bn of fund assets to an already impressive $3.67tn.But while the US investment house’s asset pile grows ever larger, the Credit Suisse deal is said to mark the beginnings of a decline in the number of participants in the ETF market – particularly in Europe – and a spike in mergers and acquisitions.Hector McNeil, a former managing partner at ETF Securities, the fourth-largest provider in Europe, who is now co-chief executive at start-up Boost ETP, says he expects to see a 30 per cent drop in the number of ETF providers in Europe, with bank-owned houses constituting the largest chunk of those exits.The likes of BlackRock and State Street, he says, will subsume the medium-sized issuers, “taking out the competition and increasing their market share considerably”.“It was inevitable that there would be consolidation in the ETF market, both in terms of the number of providers and the number of products. We have been forecasting that for some time,” Mr McNeil says.In a market where all players look to provide investors with broadly similar outcomes – namely the efficient tracking of market indices – it is natural for assets to congregate around a relatively small number of large companies, says Reinhard Bellet, head of passive asset management at Deutsche Bank’s asset and wealth management division.But he thinks it is too simplistic to suggest that the Credit Suisse deal will be the trigger for a flurry of M&A.“One transaction does not represent a game-changer for the market. There has been M&A activity in the ETF market in the past and there will no doubt be more activity in the future,” he says.The worry, however, is if BlackRock’s purchase does signal the start of further consolidation then an already concentrated market will become ever more compressed.Money held in all ETF products globally surpassed the $2tn mark last month, but almost 70 per cent of those assets are run by only three companies: iShares, BlackRock’s ETF arm that it acquired from Barclays in 2009, State Street, and Vanguard.In Europe the picture is only slightly less skewed and, despite the presence of 46 providers, the top three companies by assets – iShares, Deutsche, and Lyxor, the Société Générale-owned ETF house – control just more than 60 per cent of the market (before the BlackRock purchase of Credit Suisse’s largely European business).Apart from wiping out the continent’s fifth-largest provider, this deal increased the US company’s share of assets to just less than 43 per cent, according to figures from ETFGI, the consultancy.Unsurprisingly, iShares is comfortable with those numbers. Joe Linhares, head of iShares for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, says: “In any industry that is evolving it is not unusual to see some consolidation leading to greater efficiencies for investors. Without it, fragmentation can become an issue.”This is what we see in the European ETF industry, he says, where there are “more than 40 providers and thousands of product listings, of which too many are based on the same benchmark”.Gordon Rose, ETF analyst at Morningstar, the data provider, agrees. As ETFs charge very low costs, he says, “size is all that matters”. But he, too, does not think the Credit Suisse acquisition will have a drastic impact on this market.“iShares was already by far the largest provider in Europe; it just became a little bigger. Market consolidation will be good for investors to some degree, as we have too many ETFs tracking the same indices.”He adds, however, that if the market became too concentrated, or what he calls a “quasi-monopoly”, it would not be beneficial for investors either.Deborah Fuhr, founding partner of ETFGI, points out the Credit Suisse deal means that three-quarters of “physical” ETF assets in Europe would now be controlled by iShares.Physical ETFs, which invest in the underlying constituents of an index, were strongly favoured by investors in 2012, accounting for 88 per cent of inflows, while “synthetic” ETFs that use derivatives have declined in popularity, following criticisms of these instruments by regulators.She says adding Credit Suisse’s physical ETF assets to that of iShares would give the BlackRock-owned provider a 74.6 per cent share of the physical ETF market in Europe, based on year-end data.Mr Linhares says in response: “While competition is healthy and validates the ETF category, we think scale matters to clients as they want to know the firm is committed to the business.”"
303;STT;State Street Corp;2013-01-29T14:57:56Z;First US ETF celebrates 20th birthday;SPY has grown into a $125bn giant;The first US listed exchange traded funds marked its 20th birthday on Tuesday having developed into a $125bn giant and becoming one of the world’s most widely traded securities over the last two decades.The SPDR S&P 500 ETF, known as SPY, which is managed by State Street Global Advisors, has spearheaded the development of the ETF industry worldwide over the past 20 years.It has become the most actively traded security in the US with an average daily trading volume of 140m shares.SPY also generates a huge volume of turnover in derivatives markets with 585.7m contracts in 2012, around 16 per cent of US equity options volume last year.Speaking in London, Michael Karpik, head of EMEA for SSgA, said the launch of SPY in 1993 required a “leap of faith” by State Street as non-one had previously tried to build an physically backed vehicle that could trade in real-time as close to fair value as possible in multiple market conditions.The launch of SPY, said Mr Karpik, provided access to the entire US equity market in a single trade with no minimum purchase size so it was rapidly adopted by market makers and bank trading desks to help them hedge against risks and volatility and also by institutional investors when they wanted to put money to work or for broad stock market exposure.“SPY may initially have been conceived to solve a fairly narrow issue but over time its multitude of uses helped broaden the range of users to include investors of all types and investment needs,” said Mr Karpik.To coincide with SPY’s 20th birthday which is being marked at the opening and closing bell ringing ceremonies on the New York Stock Exchange, SSgA released a survey of European institutional investors which asked them about their current and future usage of ETFs.SSgA surveyed 260 European corporate pension plans and 41 UK active fund managers and discovered that 39 per cent had no holdings of ETFs at all while a further third (32 per cent) held less than 10 per cent of their portfolios in ETFs.However, almost half (47) per cent of the European corporate pension plans said they planned to increase their allocations to ETFs over the next five years while 42 per cent of the UK active fund managers indicated that they would increase their ETF usage in future.“This underlines the huge potential for ETF growth in Europe,” said Eleanor Hope-Bell, head of the SSgA’s UK intermediaries business group where she is responsible for sales and distribution.
304;STT;State Street Corp;2013-01-24T17:03:15Z;ETF assets pass $2tn milestone;Racing start in January builds on strength from 2012;The exchange traded funds industry has made a strong start to 2013 with global assets pushing past the $2tn mark, a record, according to BlackRock.Assets held in ETFs (funds and products) hit $2.01tn on January 18, building on the strong momentum the ETF industry saw during 2012.Dodd Kittsley, global head of ETP research at BlackRock, said reaching the $2tn mark was a historic milestone that reflected the expanding worldwide investor base for ETFs and their deepening penetration into all asset classes.“More investors are discovering that ETFs can play important roles in their portfolios in any type of market conditions. We saw this clearly in 2012 when the ETF industry was able to gather inflows of $265.3bn in spite of last year’s challenging market conditions which were dominated by ‘risk-on, risk-off’ trading patterns.”History shows that January is a month in which ETFs usually register outflows and so ETF managers are asking themselves if the industry’s growth is moving up a gear.Strategies that combine both ETFs and alternatives in a “barbell” approach to investing are continuing to grow in popularity, according to Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager.Speaking last week at BlackRock’s fourth-quarter results presentation, Mr Fink pointed to changes in asset allocation by institutional investors as evidence for changes in attitudes towards risk.Noting that there were risks embedded in sovereign bonds because of their very low yields, Mr Fink said he expected to see investors shifting into equities becoming one of the major themes of 2013. As evidence, he cited the case of a large fixed income investor who recently shifted $6.5bn into equities, mainly index based products.But he also emphasised that current fund flows suggested that investors had not yet embarked on a full scale re-engagement with equities and were instead reorientating their risk exposures on a tactical basis.With the S&P 500 index trading around a five-year high, some of the largest ETFs that provide broad exposure to the US stock market have been attracting strong inflows.The world’s largest ETF, the SPDR S&P 500, managed by State Street Global Advisors and known as SPY, which celebrates its 20th birthday next week, gathered net inflows of $15.8bn in 2012.Rival ETFs that track the S&P 500 from iShares and Vanguard, known as IVV and VOO, attracted inflows of $5.2bn and $3.8bn respectively last year.Some of the inflows into ETFs this month may be as a result of US investors putting money back to work in the stock market after booking profits on positions at the end of 2012 because of uncertainties about tax rates.Mr Kittsley said that clarity on US dividend tax liabilities had reinvigorated inflows into dividend focused equity ETFs which have already gathered around $1bn in January after registering net withdrawals in December, the first monthly outflows for this sector for two years.
305;STT;State Street Corp;2013-01-19T00:03:17Z;State Street announces new round of cuts;;State Street announced a new round of cost cuts, its third in two years, as the custody bank reported higher earnings boosted by rising stock markets.The Boston-based bank has been under pressure to cut costs from the activist investor group Trian. The elimination of 630 jobs or another 2 per cent of the workforce will bring the total number of cuts to almost 2,900.The cuts come as State Street said that improved markets lifted earnings from asset servicing, investment management and foreign-exchange trading in the fourth quarter. The group reported net income of $468m, up from $371m a year ago, on revenues of $2.45bn.Assets under custody and administration rose 4 per cent on the year before, to $24.4tn, while a 13 per cent rise in assets under management to $2.1tn owing to last year’s market rally produced a big jump in investment management fees, up 29 per cent.However, Joseph “Jay” Hooley, chief executive, echoed comments from BlackRock this week that clients were shifting back into stocks, but were not yet fully embracing risk-taking. “While equity markets improved in the fourth quarter, our clients remained cautious for most of the quarter given the uncertainty surrounding the global economic environment and the US fiscal cliff,” he said.Earnings per share rose from 76 cents to $1, boosted by $480m of share buybacks during the fourth quarter, and State Street said that it would spend a further $400m this quarter.Shares in the group closed almost 6 per cent higher New York, at $53.36, their highest level since late 2009.
306;STT;State Street Corp;2013-01-18T23:36:11Z;Wall Street posts third week of gains;;US equity markets recorded the third consecutive weekly gain this year, as investors reacted to a barrage of earnings results from large banks and industrial bellwethers.The benchmark S&P 500 index, reversed earlier losses and closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,485.98 on Friday. The index set a new five-year high and gained 0.9 per cent over the week.“With CBOE Vix index so low, there is little reason to panic and there is lots of opportunity for short-term traders. For long-term investors, we advise to hedge your bets past March, as those contracts look very cheap,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives at Schwab Center for Financial Research.In earnings news, Morgan Stanley shares rallied 7.9 per cent to $22.38, taking its weekly gain to 11 per cent, after the investment bank swung to profit in the fourth quarter, earning $481m in net income. Revenues jumped 23 per cent as the company improved its trading and investment business, while cost cuts helped its bottom line.Rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, which reported results earlier in the week, also saw its shares rise, gaining 5.3 per cent to $144.45 over the week.State Street shares rallied after the custodian bank’s fourth-quarter earnings beat Wall Street’s expectations. The bank reported net income of $468m thanks to improved equity markets and an aggressive cost-cutting programme. The stock gained 5.9 per cent to $53.36 on Friday and was trading 5.5 per cent higher on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 13,649.70 and gained 1.2 per cent on the week.The Dow Jones Transportation index, seen as a barometer of the US economy’s future performance, has set a new record high, outperforming broader indices. Its 7.3 per cent gain year to date is nearly double that of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broader S&P 500.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was fractionally lower at 3,134.71 on Friday but still added 0.3 per cent over the past five days.The technology sector was the only sector with losses on Friday, but it was telecoms that performed most poorly over the week.Apple shares were shunned on Friday, falling 0.5 per cent to $500 and losing 3.9 per cent over the week. The iPhone maker, which reports quarterly results next week, has lost nearly a third of its market value since peaking in September last year.GE shares rose 3.5 per cent to $22.04 as the industrial bellwether reported a strong rise in earnings, beating analysts’ expectations. The company said that demand from China and other resource-rich countries was growing, and sounded optimistic about the outlook. The stock gained 4.3 per cent since Monday.Shares of Intel, which reported results after the closing bell on Thursday, fell sharply after the world’s largest chipmaker reported a 15 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profits. The company continues to suffer from the downturn in its core PC market as consumers and businesses turn to tablets and smartphones as well as to more efficient cloud computing technologies. The stock’s 6.3 per cent decline to $21.25 on Friday reversed the weekly upward march into a 3.7 per cent fall.Analysts at Nomura maintained a “reduce” rating for the stock, saying that the company’s 2013 outlook seemed too high.“This forecast is predicated on higher GDP growth. While this might turn out to be true, we would expect trends to continue to favour greater tablet uptake in China, Brazil and India,” the broker wrote in a research note.“Intel looks expensive in our view compared to other large-cap PC companies. The stock trades at 12 times 2013 earnings and 17 times of free cash flow, compared to an average of seven and 10 times, respectively, for Dell, HP, IBM, and Microsoft.”Research In Motion was another clear winner this week, gaining 6.2 per cent to $15.84 on Friday and adding 16.8 per cent over the week. The latest version of its BlackBerry smartphone is set to be revealed at end of the month.Early this week, Dell was the centre of attention, after it emerged that private equity groups were in talks to take the PC maker private. Shares were trading in a narrow range on Friday but added 18.2 per cent to $12.86 over the week.

308;STT;State Street Corp;2013-01-03T18:44:34Z;US ETFs enjoy record breaking 2012;Investor inflows surge to new annual high;Record levels of new cash poured into US listed exchange traded funds and products last year as BlackRock regained the title of fastest growing ETF manager from its rival Vanguard for the first time since 2009.US listed ETFs (funds and products) gathered net inflows of $187.2bn in 2012, up 58.1 per cent on last year’s inflows of $118.4bn, and surpassing the previous all-time high for annual inflows of $176bn set in 2008, according to ETFGI, the consultancy.Deborah Fuhr, managing partner at ETFGI, said the record US inflows demonstrated that exchange traded funds and products were increasingly being embraced by investors as instruments that could help them make both strategic and tactical adjustments to the political and economic uncertainties influencing global financial markets.BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, emerged as the winner of the 2012 race for ETF investors’ cash with inflows into its US iShares operations reaching $59bn, more than double the $28.3bn gathered in 2011.State Street Global Advisors, the second largest US and global ETF manager, saw net new inflows rise 46.7 per cent to $30.3bn, helped by strong investor interest in GLD, its physically backed gold ETF which is the largest in the world.Vanguard, which won the 2010 and 2011 contest among US ETF managers, also enjoyed a strong performance with inflows up 49.2 per cent to $53.4bn.At the start of October last year, Vanguard announced that it would drop MSCI indices in 2013 in favour of benchmarks from FTSE and CRSP for index funds and ETFs with assets of $537bn in order to save costs.This decision appears to have had some influence on this year’s race among ETF providers.Vanguard’s largest ETF, known as VWO which tracks the MSCI emerging markets index, saw net outflows of $0.9bn in the fourth quarter of 2012.Meanwhile, the directly competing iShares ETF, known as EEM, took in $8.9bn over the same period.Inflows into VWO had been running well ahead of EEM in the first nine months of 2012. But the shift following Vanguard’s announcement of the index switch left them in a virtual dead heat over the year as a whole with inflows of $10.6bn and $10.5bn respectively.Some pundits have questioned if Vanguard has made a tactical error in announcing that it plans to switch index providers.However, Vanguard insists that the vast majority of investors have reacted positively to its plans which it views as vital to ensure further downward pressure on costs.The 18 Vanguard ETFs (including VWO) aftected by the index switch pullled in $3.9bn in the fourth quarter, more than a third of group inflows in that period.
309;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
310;STT;State Street Corp;2012-12-16T03:19:28Z;Uncertain future for custodians;As profits fall analysts see a faulty business model;"The way custodian banks operate requires a complete overhaul, as falling revenues and dismal market conditions wreck the business models of State Street, Bank of New York Mellon and other big players, industry analysts argue.Consultants monitoring the behaviour of custodian banks claim that slashing costs is not enough to revive the industry’s growth. And moves by banks to ditch unprofitable clients smack of desperation, they claim.“Custodians have a big problem,” said one industry watcher. “They entered the bear market with a business model built for the bull market.”Put simply, the difficulty is that three of custodian banks’ main businesses – foreign exchange, cash management and securities lending – are not the profit centres they were.To make matters more toxic, the squeezing of margins also coincides with the lodging of lawsuits and a regulatory investigation.Here in the UK, regulators with the Financial Services Authority are investigating allegations that State Street overcharged Ireland’s state pension fund and big UK corporate pension funds, including those of the Royal Mail and J Sainsbury, by billing them for fees not included in their contracts.In the US, meanwhile, State Street is being sued by California, which alleges the bank improperly charged its state pension funds for foreign exchange services. And just last month, BNY Mellon settled a lawsuit filed by the state of Virginia’s pension fund over the same issue.The lawsuits have triggered a wave of negative headlines. At the same time, custodian banks face a business situation so dire that some now “close the door” on unpromising clients in a bid to protect their bottom lines.“Banks are actually saying we don’t think you’re a profitable client for us. We want you to pay us more, or we will terminate our contract,” said Ben Gunnee, a principal at Mercer Investment Consulting.“It’s a very difficult market. Custodial banks are not growing their asset bases, and their returns from their cash management businesses, their securities lending business and foreign exchange are diminishing.”A quick look at their recent balance sheets showcases their problems. Custodial banks boast more cash on deposit these days, but low interest rates hurt net interest margins, so they are making less money. In the first quarter of 2008, for example, BNY Mellon’s net interest margin was 2.14 per cent while State Street’s was 2.20 per cent, according to statistics from Global Custodian, the industry publication. By last quarter, those margins had fallen to 1.25 per cent for BNY Mellon and 1.53 per cent for State Street.Poor volatility in the currency markets and shrinking fees hurt custodians’ earnings from foreign exchange, meanwhile.Revenue from lending securities is also dropping as broker-dealers and their hedge-fund clients are putting on fewer short positions; higher capital and liquidity ratios are also reducing the supply of stocks and increasing the cost of leverage.Hani Kablawi, BNY Mellon’s head of asset servicing for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said that BNY Mellon and its rivals were changing their pricing, outsourcing, cutting costs further and consolidating businesses to stave off the effects of the downturn. State Street could not be reached for comment.Before the financial crisis kicked off, in the fourth quarter of 2007, State Street reported $256m in revenues from its securities lending business while BNY Mellon saw $164m in the same period. By the third quarter of this year, State Street’s revenue take from that group had dropped to $91m while BNY Mellon’s fell to $37m, according to Global Custodian.The negative headlines sparked by the lawsuits have given pension funds the upper hand when negotiating fees with custodian banks in some cases.This shift in power comes in handy for investors. It remains difficult, for institutional investors to “vote with their feet” and defect to another custodian bank as the market is small and the task cumbersome. Calpers, the Californian pension fund, for example, kept State Street on as its custodian back in 2010 despite lodging a lawsuit against it over its fees on foreign-exchange trades a few months earlier. The Virginia state pension fund, meanwhile, also opted to keep BNY Mellon on as its custodian bank following its round of litigation.“Whether you like a custody bank or not, you have no choice but to use one,” noted James Economides, director with Amaces, a consulting service specialising in custodial management. “And there are only a handful of them. So, we tend to advise our clients to negotiate rather than leave one behind.”State Street also faces pressure from investors who have grown frustrated with its stagnant stock price and its poor attempts to cut costs. Earlier this year, four out of 10 of the bank’s largest shareholders told the Financial Times that they were seeking to oust either chief executive Joseph Hooley or chief financial officer Edward Resch who later resigned. And activist investor Nelson Peltz’s company Trian, which holds a 2 per cent stake in State Street, is still calling for more cost savings from the company and reduced executive pay packages.Industry analysts forecast that the big custodian banks willl see sluggish growth for the next two to three years despite a new push to slash costs. “The investment story has not advanced much in the last quarter, the operating environment remains challenging, and we continue to expect sluggish growth over the next two to three years,” Brad Hintz, a BernsteinResearch banking analyst, concludes in a recent note.The imminent arrival of Solvency II and Basel III regulations also rachets up pressure on custodian banks’ margins as costly new reporting and capital requirements will be introduced, industry analysts agreed."
311;STT;State Street Corp;2012-12-09T18:19:54Z;Fidelity makes its move into active ETFs;Filing comes on heels of swaps moratorium’s end;Fidelity has filed to launch actively managed exchange traded funds, a year after filing for a passive ETF range.In a Friday regulatory notice, the fund manager said it expects the suite’s initial ETF to invest in corporate bonds, while subsequent rollouts may also invest in fixed income as well as equities and employ fund of fund or master-feeder fund structures.The filing appears to be the first for an active ETF following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s policy shift last week lifting its nearly three-year-long moratorium on consideration of active ETFs employing derivatives. Fidelity does not specify whether its proposed ETFs would use derivatives, but does pledge that if derivatives were employed, the ETFs would abide by the conditions the SEC set – namely, that the ETF boards periodically review the deriviatives use and advisers’ approach to managing the resulting risk and that the disclosure of derivatives use abides by SEC and staff guidance.Fidelity already runs one ETF, the $177.2m Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index Tracking Stock Fund, launched in 2003, and it sought SEC permission in December 2011 to introduce index based ETFs. Little is known about the progress of those funds, though Fidelity has since created a Denver-based division headed by former State Street Global Advisors senior managing director Anthony Rochte that is thought to house nascent ETF operations.Actively managed stock mutual funds were the hallmark of Fidelity’s rise in the 1980s and 1990s to become the largest US mutual fund manager. But Fidelity has had to surrender its crown to passive fund powerhouse Vanguard which has profited from the tectonic shift to index investing.
312;STT;State Street Corp;2012-12-05T18:23:57Z;ETF investors see fiscal cliff solution;US inflows rise strongly in November;Inflows into US-listed exchange traded funds rose strongly in November as the approaching fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax increases failed to deter investors from committing new money to ETFs.“With the outcomes of the US elections and super storm Sandy known and a growing sense that a solution to the looming fiscal cliff will be negotiated, investors put $20.6bn into US-listed exchange traded funds and products in November,” said Deborah Fuhr, managing partner at ETFGI, the consultancy.Equity-linked ETFs captured just just under half of the US inflows last month but there were some notable shifts in bond ETFs flows, according to ETFGI.High yield fixed income ETF flows turned negative while investment grade corporate bond flows dropped sharply, reflecting growing concerns that a bubble could be developing after strong returns from both these sectors in 2012.Dodd Kittsley, global head of ETP research at BlackRock, said that although there had been some withdrawals from high yield corporate bond ETFs in November, these were very modest compared with the strong inflows of $11bn seen in the US during the first 10 months of the year.Mr Kittsley also pointed out that November’s outflows from corporate bond high yield ETFs were counterbalanced by inflows into other high yielding assets, such as bank loans and emerging market debt, suggesting investors were switching into sectors where there was less perceived risk.In the 2012 race among US exchange traded providers for investor’s cash, Vanguard retained pole position after attracting higher inflows in November than its larger rival iShares, the world’s biggest ETF manager.Vanguard remains on-track to win the title of fastest growing US exchange traded provider for a third year in succession after gathering net inflows of $53.3bn between January and November, an increase of 48.6 per cent on the same period in 2011, according to ETFGI.BlackRock’s US iShares operations have seen inflows more than double to $48.1bn from $21.3bn while State Street Global Advisors, the world’s second largest ETF manager, has also seen its US inflows double to $24.1bn from $11.2bn.Invesco PowerShares has seen inflows surge to $6.6bn from $2.7bn while a range of smaller US providers including Pimco, Guggenheim, Alps and FlexShares have all seen inflows more than double so far this year.In total, US listed ETFs (funds and products) have gathered net inflows $159.1bn between January and November, an increase of 55.4 per cent on the same period a year ago.The US market remains the main engine of growth for the ETF industry globally with worldwide inflows into exchange traded funds and products reaching $223.2bn, up 44.7 per cent.Helped by its large presence in the European and Canadian ETF markets, BlackRock has retained its lead in the global race among providers for investors’ cash worldwide inflows for its iShares business of $65.8bn between January and November, an increase of 50.2 per cent.Vanguard’s worldwide inflows have reached just over $54bn, only slightly higher than its US flows as its international ETF operations remain relatively small.Global assets held in exchange trade funds and products continue to set new records, reaching $1.89tn at the end of November, up 23.8 per cent this year, according to ETFGI.
313;STT;State Street Corp;2012-11-25T03:55:55Z;Investor voting varies widely;TUC survey finds little opposition to bank pay resolutions;Institutional investors continue to take hugely different stances on issues such as executive pay, according to a survey on voting at annual general meetings.Analysis by the UK’s Trades Union Congress of a series of “controversial” remuneration proposals found that State Street Global Advisors backed 96 per cent of them, Hermes Equity Ownership Services supported management on 91 per cent of occasions and Fidelity International did so 84 per cent of the time. However Pirc, a voting advisory group, backed only 8 per cent of resolutions, Kames Capital 9 per cent and CCLA 12 per cent.“When it comes to voting and engagement, it makes a huge difference who you invest with. Clients should engage with their fund manager to ensure they are happy with the approach taken,” said Brendan Barber, TUC general secretary.The polarisation of opinion between fund managers appeared to sharpen on remuneration resolutions. Janet Williamson, TUC senior policy officer for corporate governance, said there had been a sharper divide this year in voting behaviour than in previous surveys, and pointed to “a disconnect between the views expressed by fund managers and those whose money is being invested, especially on pay”.Despite rising government and public scrutiny of bankers’ pay, only a minority of the 26 respondents opposed the five main UK-listed banks’ pay resolutions. Four-fifths backed the Royal Bank of Scotland’s remuneration proposals and 60 per cent approved HSBC’s pay plans.“The fact that the two remuneration reports that drew the most support were those of banks, shows [investor] concern about bonuses and company performance do not necessarily translate into action,” said Mr Barber.However, the survey showed more disclosure on overall voting positions this year with the majority of respondents publicly disclosing at least some of the their voting history. Nineteen respondents disclosed full voting records, up from 13 last year.
314;STT;State Street Corp;2012-11-22T19:38:17Z;State Street in probe over pension fees;;UK regulators are investigating allegations that State Street overcharged Ireland’s state pension fund and several big UK corporate pension funds, including those of the Royal Mail and J Sainsbury, billing them for fees not included in their contracts, according to people familiar with the matter.Ireland’s national debt agency said on Thursday that it had notified Irish police that the big US custodian bank had reaped €3.2m in improper fees and trading profits from the national pension fund, which was selling €4.7bn in assets to generate cash to invest in the country’s banks.“What happened here was fraudulent in nature and totally unacceptable,” John Corrigan, chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency, told an Irish parliamentary committee.State Street said it had reimbursed the Irish debt agency and several other clients. People familiar with the matter said they included the Royal Mail and Sainsbury pension funds. The bank also sacked three staff linked to the transactions and reported the matter to the UK Financial Services Authority in September 2011.“In a limited number of instances, we charged commissions on transition management mandates that were not consistent with our contractual agreements,” State Street said in a statement.“The actions of these former employees and their interaction with a limited number of clients do not reflect the high standards of conduct, communications and transparency that State Street expects. We took swift and appropriate disciplinary actions in response to this conduct.”Mr Corrigan said the debt agency was awaiting the outcome of the FSA investigation before deciding whether to press for additional compensation. He said a separate state contract for the management of €900m pension fund assets with State Street was also under review.The FSA, Sainsbury and the Royal Mail all declined to comment.The overcharging allegations are centred in State Street’s “transition management” unit, which helps large pension funds sell assets. The bank sometimes charges a management fee and sometimes commission.In Ireland’s case, the pension fund had agreed to pay a fixed fee of €698,000, according to a report by the debt agency. But the bank then applied commissions of €2.6m and also became involved with the trade as a participant, earning a further €600,000 in profits.The debt agency said it only became aware of the improper commissions in late 2011 when it read media reports about similar problems faced by other State Street clients in the UK.State Street is being sued by California, which alleges the bank improperly charged state pension funds for foreign exchange services, and several US authorities are also looking into the matter, the bank has said in regulatory findings.
315;STT;State Street Corp;2012-11-18T04:22:23Z;Deutsche and Lyxor switch tactics;Synthetic providers launch physical ETFs to revive fortunes;Two of the largest players in Europe’s exchange traded funds market are radically changing their business models in an effort to revive their flagging performance.Both Deutsche Bank and Lyxor Asset Management, the second- and third-largest ETF managers in Europe, are launching “physical” ETFs that buy the constituents of an underlying index, – a departure from their existing range of “synthetic” ETFs that use derivatives to track a benchmark.Deutsche Bank’s ETF business, db X-trackers, will on Monday launch six physical ETFs tracking the Dax, Nikkei 225, S&P 500, FTSE 100, Euro Stoxx 50 and Euro Stoxx 50 ex-financials indices with listings in London, Frankfurt and Milan.These new funds will run in parallel with Deutsche’s synthetic ETFs that track the same indices. They will also carry the same expense ratios with the exception of the Euro Stoxx 50 ETF, where the physical version will cost 15 basis points a year, compared with zero for the synthetic version.Lyxor is to convert four fixed income bond ETFs (from its EuroMTS macro weighted triple-A government bond index series) from synthetic to physical replication in December.A third provider, Credit Suisse, has also shifted most of its ETF range from synthetic to physical.Synthetic ETF providers have long argued that their products are cheaper and more efficient than physical ETFs, but Deutsche and Lyxor explain the shift as a response to client demand.“Some clients have shown a preference for direct [physical] replication and we aim to meet that demand,” said Thorsten Michalik, global head of db X-trackers.“Lyxor is diversifying its offering to include physically replicated ETFs to fully address investors’ needs,” said Alain Dubois, chairman of Lyxor.However, both providers have struggled to attract inflows over the past two years, following sharp criticisms of synthetic ETFs by a number of regulators who objected to their complexity and lack of transparency.Investors have pulled a net $200m from db X-trackers so far this year after withdrawing $334m during 2011, according to ETFGI, a consultancy that analyses ETF industry trends. Lyxor has gathered inflows of $319m so far in 2012, staging a small recovery after a weak 2011 when it registered outflows of $9.6bn.Deborah Fuhr, managing partner at ETFGI, said it would be presumptuous to assume synthetic ETFs were heading for extinction.“Investors understand that certain asset classes and exposures are only available in synthetic ETF format,” said Ms Fuhr.But she also noted that ETF providers in Europe are being forced to adapt their business models in response to investors’ strong preference for physical ETFs, which have attracted net inflows of $17.6bn so far this year, compared with $1.8bn for synthetic products. Physical products now account for 62.9 per cent of the European market.Deutsche Bank, Société Générale, the parent of Lyxor, and Credit Suisse have all moved their ETF operations from their investment banking arms into their asset management businesses, reflecting the pressure on banks to retreat from non-core operations.The Credit Suisse ETF business is reported to be for sale with iShares, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard identified as potential suitors.
316;STT;State Street Corp;2012-11-11T05:52:59Z;Appetite rises for alternative indices;Aim to limit costs but boost returns is driving interest;An increasing number of investors are moving away from traditional market capitalisation-based indices to alternative strategies, known as smart beta, in search of better returns and lower costs amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic climate.State Street Global Advisors has seen a sharp rise in assets under management, in what it describes as advanced beta – a term that reflects a rejection of market cap-based equity indices, and bond indices that grant the highest weightings to companies and countries with the highest debt levels – to more innovative, alternative methods of index construction.SSGA saw its assets in advanced beta strategies rise by 53 per cent to $22.3bn in 2011. BlackRock has also seen a more modest rise.“The search for alternative indices is on. The appeal is lower costs and getting market exposure to specific themes such as gold or forestry,” says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, a consultancy.Richard Hannam, head of global equity beta solutions for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at SSgA, also believes cost is driving the shift. “Large pension funds in Europe, the UK, the US and Australia are doing this as the costs in moving from active to passive in the portfolio are attractive to them,” he adds.Industry-wide figures are hard to track down, but Mr Rajan estimates that about $5tn is now invested in smart beta via a panoply of exchange traded funds, fundamental indices and bespoke indices.Index providers are also experiencing rising demand for alternative or fundamental approaches in which stocks are weighted by metrics such as book value, dividends and sales, or minimum variance where portfolios are designed to reduce volatility.To some, a passive investment in smart beta is seen as replicating some of the over- and underweightings a more expensive traditional active manager might choose to make.At MSCI, Dimitris Melas, global head of new product research, says pension funds and endowment funds are “starting to recognise alpha [excess returns] comes from systemic risk and return [factors]. They realise they can tap into this in a simpler way without paying active management fees.” Calpers, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest US public pension fund, some Nordic pension funds and APG of the Netherlands have already taken this route, he adds.The appetite for customised or bespoke indices is on the rise, with some investors asking for a specific bias such as value-weighted or equal-weighted strategies, he says. MSCI has been producing alternative equity indices since 2006. Last year it added risk-weighted indices, tilted to stocks perceived to have lower risk, to its range.ETFs, with $1.8tn of managed assets, make up part of the alternative passive universe but pension funds are exercising caution, mainly choosing physically backed ETFs rather than more complex synthetic ones, says Mr Rajan. They are also concerned about the short-term nature of themed ETFs.Smart beta bond strategies are also increasingly popular. California-based Research Affiliates has developed fundamental indices for US investment-grade bonds, high-yield corporate bonds, and emerging market ones.On the equity front, State Street’s Mr Hannam says the next step in alternative beta strategies is to construct more indices combining several strategies rather than “the single-factor tilts that we have mostly seen so far”, because they will offer more upside.Alternative indices, whether combined or not, are “better than owning cap-weighted indices”, he argues. Historic backtesting of smart beta indices such as value weighted and small cap tend to show an outperformance over traditional market cap indices.Research Affiliates says its fundamental index approach has generated added value of 2-4 percentage points a year over cap weighted-indices for large stocks in developed markets, based on long-term simulations. For less efficient areas, such as emerging equities, the opportunity to add value is greater.But some index providers and asset managers say alternative indices do not beat market cap indices all the time, and the heightened concentration risk that can ensue when people pile into such indices can affect their efficiency.“These alternative strategies are not a magic bullet,” Mr Melas says.He emphasises the importance of backtesting live indices rather than simulated ones to gain a realistic perspective of historic returns. Selecting the right strategy to suit conditions is also important.“ Minimum volatility strategies tend to perform better in times of crisis because they emphasise stocks that are less volatile than the market and more resilient in times of downturn. They may not rise the best [in other environments] but will not fall as sharply either,” he adds.But there is agreement on the advantage of lower costs that such strategies offer compared with active management charges. There is also a consensus that the nascent alternatives strategies business is set to grow over the next few years, although the cap weighted approach to equities and debt in issuance method of weighting bonds are likely to remain dominant.However, although the rise of alternative beta may be seen as a challenge to active managers, it could also create opportunities for active managers, offering them a shot at redemption.“Asset managers have a chance to identify neglected stocks outside the indices that have been ignored,” Mr Rajan adds.

318;STT;State Street Corp;2012-11-06T16:55:19Z;BlackRock gains after ETF price cuts;Vanguard move wins less enthusiasm from investors;The most recent initiatives by BlackRock and Vanguard to win an advantage in the price war among exchange traded fund providers have met sharply differing reactions from investors.BlackRock has seen a positive reaction to its decision last month to cut fees on some of its US-listed iShares ETFs, while Vanguard’s move to cut costs for investors by switching the index provider on some of its largest ETFs has been met with less enthusiasm.Data from ETF Industry Association show that IVV, the iShares core S&P 500 ETF, grabbed the award for best selling US ETF in October with inflows of just over $2bn following BlackRock’s decision to cut the fees on this product.The positive inflows for IVV stand in marked contrast to the performance of its direct rival, SPY, which also tracks the S&P 500 index and is managed by State Street Global Advisors.SPY, which is the world’s largest ETF, registered net outflows of $7.2bn in October, the largest withdrawals of any US listed ETF last month.A third direct competitor, Vanguard’s VOO, which also tracks the S&P 500 index, attracted inflows of $227m.Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, dismissed talk of a “price war” among US ETF providers as a myth last month, just days after the world’s largest fund manager cut fees on six of its largest ETFs and launched four low cost ETFs as part of a new “core” range aimed at buy and hold investors.But BlackRock has also seen a positive reaction to a reduction in the fees for AGG, the iShares fixed income ETF that tracks the Barclays US aggregate bond index, to 8 basis points, undercutting its direct rival, Vanguard’s BND, which costs 10bp.In October, AGG attracted relatively modest inflows of $224m while Vanguard’s BND registered net outflows of $152m.State Street’s LAG which also tracks the same Barclays bond index attracted zero inflows while Charles Schwab, which cut fees on its entire ETF range in September, saw its ETF in this category, known as SCHZ, take in $21m. SCHZ is the cheapest of this group with a 5bp total expense ratio.Vanguard’s announcement at the start of October that it plans to drop MSCI as index provider to some of its largest index funds also appears to have sparked some negative sentiment among investors.The index switch will take place next year but the news seems to have had an immediate impact on VWO, Vanguard’s largest ETF which tracks the MSCI emerging markets index.Inflows into VWO completely stalled last month. It gathered a paltry $1m in net new inflows in October, a substantial decline compared with the first nine months of the year when it was gathering more than $1.2bn on average each month.VWO’s previous success in attracting inflows was one of the key factors behind Vanguard’s success in winning the title of fastest growing US ETF provider in 2010 and 2011 ahead of its larger rival iShares.In the round of fee cuts announced last month, BlackRock opted against reducing charges on EEM, even though this ETF has lost significant market share to Vanguard’s VWO.But EEM attracted inflows of $1.3bn in October, even though its management fee remains significantly more expensive than VWO.BlackRock also launched a new low cost emerging markets ETF, known as IEMG, as part of the “core range”. This tracks the MSCI emerging markets investables index, a broader benchmark that includes smaller companies. IEMG attracted inflows of $83m in October, making it the fastest growing of the four new ETFs that iShares debuted last month.The positive reaction to iShares new products combined with strong inflows into its ETFs linked to China, Brazil, emerging markets debt and gold helped to boost net new inflows for iShares to $7.7bn in October, more than double the $3.3bn which Vanguard gathered across its ETF range.That performance appears to have swung the balance further in favour of iShares in this year’s race for investors’ cash among ETF providers.So far this year, net new inflows into iShares have risen by a third to $61.2bn while Vanguard has gathered $46.2bn in new inflows, a rise of 51.2 per cent on the same period in 2011, according to ETFGI, the consultancy.

320;STT;State Street Corp;2012-10-24T17:21:12Z;Credit Suisse ETF sale could raise $150m;BlackRock seen as most likely to pursue a bid;The sale of Credit Suisse’s exchange traded funds business could raise around $150m for the Swiss bank, according to Citi.Credit Suisse put its ETF business, which has $17bn in assets, up for sale earlier this year, drawing interest from BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors, the world’s two largest ETF providers.The sale process has been shrouded in secrecy with potential buyers required to sign confidentiality agreements ahead of the deadline for bids which expired around two weeks ago. A third unnamed buyer is also thought to have tabled an offer.Bill Katz, an analyst at Citi, said the sale of Credit Suisse’s ETF operations would provide another example of asset managers picking up business lines “on the cheap” from banks which are being forced to sell assets to strengthen their capital positions.Mr Katz said BlackRock was the most likely to pursue a bid as it could squeeze more cost savings from Credit Suisse’s ETF business which has struggled for momentum this year with no inflows in the first nine months of 2012 – a marked contrast to last year when it attracted $2.1bn over the same period.Although Credit Suisse has struggled to attract ETF inflows this year, Mr Katz said a deal with BlackRock could “kick-start” growth and further strengthen the position of iShares as the largest player in the European ETF market.As the world’s largest fund manager, BlackRock also has a history of buying smaller asset management operations, notably deals for the Claymore ETF business in Canada and Swiss Re’s private equity fund of funds business which were completed this year.However, it was “unlikely” that SSgA would buy Credit Suisse’s ETF operations, according to Mr Katz who said: “State Street has been trying to signal to investors that at this juncture, it is more focused on returning capital [to investors] than making acquisitions”.State Street’s management would face “additional pressure if it were to make another acquisition”, said Mr Katz, following a mixed reaction from investors to the news earlier this year that the custody bank was buying a hedge fund administration business from Goldman Sachs.
321;STT;State Street Corp;2012-10-21T03:56:06Z;Disaster hedging strategies abound as tail-risk fears rise;As the US fiscal cliff looms, strategists are mulling options;If disaster strikes, it is likely to hit New York first. Or at least that is the smug theory of the London-based strategists now warning that apocalyptic scenarios may arise when the so-called US fiscal cliff arrives in January.As fears about tail risks in Europe diminish in the wake of the European Central Bank’s promise to save the euro and a raft of eurozone stability measures, worries about infighting in the two houses of Congress linger.For the third month in a row, fund managers have said that the potential inability of the US Congress to agree on a deal to address the fiscal cliff – the $600bn of scheduled government spending cuts and tax rises – is their worst fear. And more than a third of fund managers are more concerned about this issue than they are about the eurozone debt crisis, according to a Bank of America/Merrill Lynch survey of the opinions of more than 200 managers released last week.The persistence of fears about a black swan-style shock hitting the markets raises the question yet again of how best to hedge portfolios for a tail-risk event.A fresh study on the topic, Solutions for Managing Tail Risk, by State Street Global Advisors examines the merits of four possible strategies.One simple, but expensive approach would be buying put options that offer a guarantee against any downside risk if stock prices slump below a set level.But the effectiveness of this strategy is damningly weak, the study’s author, Ric Thomas, head of absolute return strategies at SSGA, concludes.Try an alternative approach of buying the market and at the same time purchasing one-year forward puts – redeemable when markets drop 10 per cent from their initial level – and one finds that the strategy outperforms only in years that the market falls 10 per cent plus the cost of the put option. It underperforms in every other year.Investors can pare back the high costs of puts by selling call options at the same time. But doing so reduces their upside when markets rally, so the method only holds appeal for cautious investors.“[This] put-spread collar methodology has gained some attention among investors,” notes the study. “These investors favour a narrower return distribution for a volatile asset class and are willing to reduce their upside for greater predictability.”Buying or shorting equity futures contracts in response to a market move is also coming into favour for those who do not want to pay for put options.Here, trading strategies can also move beyond the equity markets to include currencies, commodities and fixed income.When markets plummet over longer time periods, these strategies can produce strong returns. The Barclay CTA index, the benchmark performance meter for commodity trading adviser funds, which often make such trades, rose 14 per cent in 2008 while the MSCI World equity index plunged 40 per cent.A third popular hedge is to move towards low volatility weightings in portfolios and away from market capitalisation weightings. This allows investors to remain fully exposed to equities.But one drawback is that long-only low volatility portfolios will exhibit higher tracking error in relation to standard cap-weighted benchmarks.A last option is simply to increase exposure to less volatile asset classes and diversify into inflation-protected government bonds and commodities.This might involve allocating, say, 40 per cent to equity futures contracts and 70 per cent to fixed income, a combination funded by the leverage available from futures positions.“Scaling up lower volatility asset classes such that their total risk contribution equals the risk contribution from the equity allocation can create an equity-like substitute with the potential for less volatility and less drawdown risk,” says the SSGA research.Some markets are more exposed to tail risk than others. A recent Economist Intelligence Unit report, Managing investments in volatile markets: How institutional investors are guarding against tail risk events, suggests that strategists think currency markets are more exposed than debt and equities to Armageddon-style market meltdowns.“Governments are trying to protect their own equity markets, so the stock downside will be more controlled,” says Vineer Bhansali, managing director and portfolio manager at Pimco. “If all countries are working for themselves, the shock will come in the inter-country space.”Close to three-quarters of the 300 or so investors from Europe and the US who took part in the EIU report think a tail-risk event is likely or highly likely in the coming months. Some 79 per cent are currently sacrificing some upside potential in exchange for tail risk protection.But the adoption of tail risk protection strategies is patchy. Since the start of the financial crisis some approaches, such as managed volatility equity strategies, managed futures and CTA allocations, have seen an increase in usage. Two other strategies – diversifying across traditional asset classes and funds of hedge funds – have seen their popularity fall as questions arise over their effectiveness, according to the EIU study.“Survey respondents rated diversification as the most effective strategy, but they are clearly still sceptical,” the study’s authors conclude.“Investors are still trying to decide which method is best. But there is also a question of whether the tools that are currently available to investors are adequate.”
322;STT;State Street Corp;2012-10-19T22:53:28Z;ETF providers eye Credit Suisse business;;The world’s two largest providers of exchange traded funds, BlackRock’s iShares and State Street Global Advisors, are racing to buy Credit Suisse’s ETF business with assets of $17bn.The deadline for bids was two weeks ago and a third unnamed buyer is thought to have tabled an offer.The move comes as Credit Suisse and other global banks are under pressure to boost their capital levels and retreat from non-core operations.Credit Suisse is the fifth-largest ETF manager in Europe with a market share of 4.9 per cent, according to consultancy ETFGI. However, it has struggled for momentum this year with no inflows in the first nine months of 2012 – a marked contrast to last year when it attracted $2.1bn over the same period.Buying Credit Suisse’s ETF operations would make strategic sense for State Street, which has lacked a meaningful presence in the European market even though it is the second-largest ETF player globally.Buying Credit Suisse’s ETF business would immediately bring scale to State Street’s European operations but its management has faced criticism from investors for overpaying for acquisitions, most recently the $550m purchase of Goldman Sachs’ hedge fund administration business in July.BlackRock, which is already the largest player in Europe by some distance with assets of $126.4bn and a market share of 36.2 per cent, could face a challenge on competition grounds if it tries to buy Credit Suisse’s ETF business.Although BlackRock has no pressing need to bolster its position in Europe, industry observers note that it acquired the Claymore ETF business in Canada from Guggenheim this year, consolidating iShares’ position as the number-one player in the Canadian market.Consolidation has been frequently predicted in the European ETF market, which remains highly fragmented with trading taking place across multiple exchanges and in different countries. This makes the cost of running ETF operations much higher than in the US where there is a single/homogeneous market.ETF providers with links to investment banks such as Credit Suisse have seen their businesses struggle after global regulators last year sharply criticised their derivative-based products as potential sources of instability in global financial markets.Although ETF providers have been able to dispel many of the worries of regulators, investors have shown less enthusiasm for derivative-based products amid concerns about their complexity and possible counterparty risks.The possible sale of Credit Suisse’s ETF business is further evidence that investment banks in Europe are reconsidering the role of ETFs in their overall operations.Both Deutsche Bank and Société Générale have shifted their ETF operations from the investment banking side of their overall businesses into reformed asset management arms this year.
323;STT;State Street Corp;2012-10-18T15:23:36Z;ETF industry launches new education website;Launch reflects growing investor interest in ETFs;Exchange traded fund providers have teamed together to launch a new education website, www.understandETFs.org, to enhance investors’ understanding of ETFs.The website contains educational resources including a question and answer section designed to help investors understand the basics of ETF investing. It also contains links to additional ETF resources.The website was devised by the ETF committee of the Investment Company Institute, the US fund association.Jim Ross, ICI ETF committee chairman and global head of SPDR ETFs, said: “Business models and competition aside, this new website educates investors using the ETF industry’s collective thinking. We hope that investors, advisers and other market participants find it a useful tool.”Ben Fulton, managing director of global ETFs for Invesco PowerShares, said the website would help raise awareness of the construction of ETFs and their potential uses in investors’ portfolios.“Today’s investors are looking for new ways to build better portfolios and they are increasingly turning to ETFs,” said Michael Sapir, chief executive officer of ProShare Advisors.Mr Sapir said all ETF managers had an interest in ensuring that investors had the knowledge they needed to invest in ETFs with confidence to achieve their financial goals.Adam Phillips, chief operating officer for Market Vector’s ETFs at Van Eck, said that providers had collectively agreed answers to the basic questions about ETFs that investors should ask.“As we all use this common language, it will hopefully make it easier for investors to understand ETFs and related investing decisions,” said Mr Phillips.Fourteen ETF companies participated in setting up the website: AdvisorShares, Charles Schwab, Columbia Management, db-X ETFs, First Trust Portfolios, FlexShares, Guggenheim Investments, Invesco PowerShares, iShares, Pimco, ProShares, State Street Global Advisors, Market Vectors and Vanguard.
324;STT;State Street Corp;2012-10-16T21:54:46Z;State Street acquisition hopes dashed;;Joseph “Jay” Hooley, chief executive of State Street, said that the bank would be “very cautious” as it considers future acquisitions and that hopes to pick up custody businesses in Europe had been dashed by a lack of willing sellers.For European banks “the value of that stable deposit base probably overrides making a short term benefit from a quick sale”. Mr Hooley said that the depressed level of State Street stock gives the bank “a higher hurdle rate” as it considers buying businesses versus repurchasing its own shares.His comments came as State Street completed the $550m acquisition of Goldman Sachs’ hedge fund administration business, a deal which some shareholders had criticised as expensive.Reporting third-quarter earnings, the Boston-based custody bank said that revenues remained under pressure even as stock markets rallied, with global investors remaining cautious of committing new capital to equities and foreign exchange.Revenues from currency trading dropped 44 per cent from a year ago to $115m. Overall operating revenues were down 2.7 per cent to $2.35bn in the third quarter.Mr Hooley blamed the eurozone crisis, the low interest rate environment and subdued trading activity. ”This quarter was a reflection of the environment we’re in. I think we did a good job of managing expenses.”He is under pressure to show that a cost-saving plan will deliver better profitability, as large investors have begun to agitate for an injection of new blood at the senior management level. It is a year since the activist investor group Trian, which owns 2.05 per cent of the bank, published a white paper calling for an aggressive reorganisation and restructuring.State Street is engaged in a programme of job cuts and a reorganisation of its technology infrastructure that it said was on track to produce $100m in cost savings this year. Operating expenses in the quarter were down 4 per cent, more than the drop in revenues.Net income rose from $543m in the same period a year ago to $654m. However, this included a one-off benefit of $362m related to claims from the bankruptcy proceedings of Lehman Brothers, the failed investment bank. On an operating basis, net income dropped 1 per cent from a year ago to $473m.Earnings per share of 99 cents were slightly ahead of the consensus of analyst projections of 96 cents. State Street shares closed up 4.7 per cent to $43.53 in New York.State Street’s capital position remains one of the strongest of the US banks. It said that adjusted for expected changes to rules on the amount of capital it must hold, its tier one ratio was 11.3 per cent, up from 11 per cent in September.
325;STT;State Street Corp;2012-10-15T18:03:07Z;Investor frustration grows at State Street;Slow pace of progress antagonises activists;At a bank like State Street, which has a collection of good businesses, plenty of capital and a shareholder roster packed with names of asset managers that share its Boston heritage, dissent does not build quickly.However, the share price, at a little over $41, is in the same place that it started in 2009. Boston institution Fidelity, the group’s fifth-largest shareholder, cut its holdings by a quarter earlier this year, to $700m.It is also exactly a year since Trian, the activist investor group run by Nelson Peltz and Edward Garden, published a white paper detailing its ideas for improvements at the custody bank. Fidelity and Trian declined to comment.The activists proposed a mix of cost cutting, capital returns and restructuring focused on margins. In essence, costs at the bank had grown faster than revenues since 2006, and the Trian plan was to reverse that process, to focus on profitability rather than growth.With other actions, including a possible spin-out of State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-largest investment manager judged by assets, Trian proposed a modest target for the bank’s share price of $99.After the plan was published Joseph “Jay” Hooley, State Street’s chief executive, met his top 10 shareholders and told them that he agreed with 70 per cent of what Trian had said, according to people who attended the meetings.He saw no need for a spin-out, but a plan to save $600m by 2015, through an extensive programme of restructuring and improvements to the group’s technological infrastructure, was promised.The lender, one of the most highly capitalised US banks, also said in March after it passed the Federal Reserve stress tests that it would repurchase $1.8bn of shares over the following year.Yet frustration is building among shareholders at the slow pace of progress so far, antagonised by what they see as other persistent faults in the way the bank uses its capital and presents its financial information.A Trian criticism, that the group overpays for acquisitions, was not helped when State Street announced the $550m purchase of Goldman Sachs’ hedge fund administration business in July, at their second-quarter earnings. “They overpaid and communicated terribly, even though the deal does make sense strategically,” says one large investor.He also points to a writedown on holdings of Greek government debt, announced at the same time, but taken as a non-operating expense, as another persistent annoyance. “Investor frustration with the way State Street announce their numbers is incredibly high.”There is a recognition that the group faces slow growth in several of its fee-based businesses, as hedge fund use of leverage remains low and currency trading volatility remains subdued. Like all banks, low interest rates also limit the profits available from lending activities.Yet that only goes so far. “As shareholders we don’t just want management to wait around. They are paid to deal with the circumstances now,” says one.Indeed, a frequent comment is that executives “pay themselves too much”. Mr Hooley earned $16.2m last year, up 25 per cent on 2010. One top 20 investor says he voted in favour of Mr Hooley’s pay this year and remained supportive of the cost-cutting programme, “but he is on the watchlist”.While discontent has started to be voiced to a board that says it is supportive of Mr Hooley, who was made chief operating officer in 2008 and promoted to the top job two years later, others are prepared to give him more time for the cost-cutting plan to work. Instead Edward Resch, chief financial officer since 2002, appears to be a lightning rod for criticism.“It would benefit from new blood, it doesn’t have to be the chief executive,” says one investor. Another says Mr Hooley missed an opportunity to replace Mr Resch when he became chief executive.The five top 20 investors who spoke to the Financial Times on condition of anonymity all said that State Street stock, which is valued at about nine times expected earnings, was cheap. “The stock could be up a ton, it just requires some gumption on the part of management,” says one.
326;STT;State Street Corp;2012-10-15T18:03:07Z;State Street investors seek new blood at top;;Four of the 10 largest shareholders at State Street are agitating for the removal of the custody bank’s chief executive or chief financial officer amid growing frustration at its stagnant share price and the pace of cost-cutting.Some of the investors told the Financial Times that they had communicated their discontent to the board, directly and indirectly, and that they wished to see either Joseph “Jay” Hooley, chief executive, or Edward Resch, chief financial officer, replaced with “new blood”.“There is nobody in that business who is bigger than the brand name. Somebody has to be responsible,” said one of the four top 10 shareholders who spoke on the condition of anonymity along with the other three. The four represent a 10th of State Street’s equity.The increased pressure on State Street, which is due to report third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, comes a year on from the publication of a white paper calling for aggressive cost-cutting and restructuring by the activist investor group Trian, which owns 2.05 per cent of the Boston based bank.State Street is one of the world’s largest custody banks, a trusted role at the heart of the financial system, with over $22tn in assets under custody and administration, and $1.9tn under management in its investment advisory arm. Last year the group had revenues of $9.5bn, and has a market capitalisation of almost $20bn.State Street defended its performance on Monday saying that “despite the challenging operating environment we are confident of the resilience of our business model and proud of our track record”.Two non-executive directors also expressed confidence in the executive team. Gregory Summe said that he is “very much supportive of State Street’s programme and the direction they are headed is the right one”. Both declined to discuss any conversations with investors.Before the financial crisis shares in State Street traded above $80 per share, but collapsed to less than a quarter of that price in early 2009. At $41.4 per on Monday its shares are up 2.3 per cent for the year so far.The group is in the early stages of implementing a cost-cutting plan designed to improve profitability but margins have not moved upwards this year as the group has struggled to grow revenues.“Just cut your bonus pool to get to the target,” said one longstanding shareholder who, while prepared to give Mr Hooley “one more chance”, said that Mr Resch’s “credibility is quite low”.Much of the criticism centres on the way the group, one of the best-capitalised US banks, relayed the future impact of new regulations to its balance sheet.In July State Street surprised investors when it said that its tier one capital ratio would be 9.8 per cent under new rules, lower than expected. The number was then revised up to 11 per cent in September.
327;STT;State Street Corp;2012-10-05T17:23:02Z;State Street wins September ETF race;S&P500 ETF grabs a quarter of global inflows;The world’s largest exchange traded fund, the SPDR S&P500 ETF, known as SPY, grabbed almost a quarter of global ETF inflows in September as investors’ appetite for US equities strengthened following the US Federal Reserve’s announcement of a third round of quantitative easing last month.SPY, which is managed by State Street Global Advisors, the world’s second largest ETF provider, grabbed inflows of $10.5bn last month out of total global net inflows of $45.4bn, pushing its assets to a record $120.6bn in late September, according to ETFGI, the consultancy.SSgA also saw large inflows into GLD, the world’s largest gold ETF, which took in $1.8bn last month.Gold ETFs have seen flows increase strongly since September’s announcement of fresh asset purchasing measures by central banks in the US, Europe and Japan. iShares’ IAU gold ETF attracted inflows of $662m last month.The strong performance of SPDR’s ETFs helped SSgA steal the spotlight from iShares and Vanguard which have dominated the race among ETF providers for investors cash so far this year.SSgA’s ETFs saw inflows of $16.2bn in September while BlackRock’s iShares business gathered just under $15bn and Vanguard attracted just over $5bn in ETFs inflows.The improved performance for iShares in September has helped it regain the lead from low-cost rival Vanguard in this year’s race among ETF providers for investors’ cash.So far this year, iShares has gathered inflows of $50.2bn, up 52.2 per cent on same period in 2011 while Vanguard’s ETF inflows have increased 53.1 per cent to $42.8bn.SSgA’s flows have surged 317 per cent to $29.2bn so far in 2012. This rise reflects the fact that inflows into SPY were relatively small ($700m) by this time last year while GLD saw outflows in the first nine months of 2011.The September total of $45.4bn in global net inflows for ETFs (funds and products) was a huge jump from $11.4bn in August.Inflows into ETFs linked to US small and mid cap equity indices also pointed to a recovery in investors’ risk appetite.The iShares Russell 2000 ETF known as IWM gathered $2.8bn while the iShares S&P mid-cap 400 ETF known as IJH attracted inflows of $1.3bn last month.Total global inflows into ETFs for the first nine months of the year have reached $188.1bn, up 47.8 per cent on the same period in 2011.PowerShares, the fourth largest US ETF provider, is also enjoying a strong performance with inflows reaching $7.9bn so far this year while ETF Securities has benefited from renewed interest in gold following the Fed’s announcement of QE3 with its inflows reaching $2.4bn.However, other European players are struggling. Commerzbank has seen outflows of $1.1bn so far this year while BNP Paribas’ EasyETF operations have registered withdrawals of $735m.
328;STT;State Street Corp;2012-09-30T04:23:01Z;Schwab poses costly challenge to ETF rivals;Deep pockets needed to match Schwab’s fee reductions;Charles Schwab’s decision on Friday to reduce management fees across its entire range of exchange traded funds presents a significant headache for the largest US ETF providers, which would all lose significant revenues if they decided to match its reduced charges.Schwab, the financial services company, is currently the 12th largest US ETF provider with $7.2bn in ETF assets under management, according to the ETF Industry Association.But it surprised industry observers last week with a bold move that deliberately undercut the fees charged by all of its US competitors, marking an escalation in the price war between ETF providers.Schwab’s press release clearly highlighted how its new charges compare with directly competing products from Vanguard and State Street while making no mention of BlackRock which is expected to announce its own ETF fee cuts in the fourth quarter.The reduced fees on its ETF range means Schwab will give up around $3.7m (annualised) in management charges on its current asset base with the company hoping to recoup any loss of revenues with higher investor inflows.The move by Schwab is the most direct response yet by an ETF provider to the competitive pressures being exerted in the US market by Vanguard, the third largest provider globally. As Vanguard has no shareholders, it is able to use its structure as a mutual fund company to reduce charges as the assets of its funds grow. But to match the Schwab price cuts would reduce management fees for Vanguard by between $63m, if it reduced charges on only directly competing products, and $102m, if it reduced charges on all overlapping products.State Street Global Advisors, the world’s second largest ETF provider, would also face a hefty bill if it decided to compete with Schwab’s new charges. SSgA would forego around $96m in management fees on its SPDR ETF range if it were to match Schwab’s fee cuts.The impact on SSgA is limited by the fact that the price differential between its largest ETF, SPY which tracks the S&P 500 index, is relatively small compared with the competing Schwab ETF. SPY charges 9bp while Schwab has reduced fees on SCHX (which tracks the Dow Jones US Total Stock Market Index) from 6bp to 4bp.BlackRock, the world’s largest ETF provider, has already said that it will reduce fees on some of its US listed ETFs in the fourth quarter. However it would face a hefty bill of around $358m if it reduced charges on directly competing products, and $745m, if it reduced charges on all overlapping products to match the new prices announced by Schwab.Much will depend on where BlackRock decides to concentrate its firepower. ETFs that provide broad exposure to emerging markets have been one of the areas of greatest competition between BlackRock and Vanguard. To match Schwab’s charges on its broad emerging markets ETF would require Vanguard to forgo revenues of $29m but it would cost BlackRock around $194m in management fees (assuming assets did not increase from their current levels).So BlackRock might decide it is more worthwhile to reduce fees on products other than its emerging markets ETF, known as EEM, as it then would have to forgo “only” $164m in management fees to match Schwab’s prices on directly competing products.

330;STT;State Street Corp;2012-09-26T23:02:12Z;Rich US investors embrace risk;;Wealthy Americans have started to abandon the caution that has led them to hoard cash and bonds since the financial crisis, according to a new survey to be released on Thursday by Merrill Lynch Wealth Management.Only 30 per cent of respondents described themselves as conservative investors, down from half in 2010, suggesting that a trickle of stock market inflows this year could be the sign of a larger shift in investor attitudes.The most dramatic change was among 18 to 35-year-olds, where less than a quarter said they were conservative, from more than half in 2010. The findings contradict warnings by prominent commentators such as Bill Gross of Pimco and David Rosenberg of Gluskin Sheff that the traditional “cult” of equity investing for wealthy Americans may be over.John Thiel, head of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, said respondents had become more optimistic about their own financial situation, with about two-thirds expecting it to be better or the same next year. “Its an abrupt shift from 2010 when it was quite the opposite,” he said.Between 2008 and 2011 US stock mutual funds and exchange traded funds experienced new outflows of $44.5bn, according to Lipper, a research group. Taxable bond funds, meanwhile attracted $857bn of new money during the period.While inflows to bond funds have continued in 2012, with $225bn of new money committed, stock funds have attracted $32bn as equities have rallied.Mr Thiel said clients of the bank were starting to take more risk, moving away from cash into longer-dated securities, corporate and high-yield bonds, while dividend-paying stocks remain popular.The conclusions from other surveys remain mixed, however.State Street said on Wednesday that the North American component of its Investor Confidence Index, which aims to track buying and selling patterns of institutional investors such as pension funds, fell in September to 81.1, the lowest reading since at least the start of 2011. A reading of 100 indicates a neutral attitude to risk, and the last time the survey was above that level was July 2011.A weekly survey by the American Association of Individual Investors, meanwhile, is in line with its long-term averages, with one-third bearish on the market for the next six months, while 38 per cent describe themselves as bullish.In a finding that may also suggest shifting political priorities, Merrill Lynch found that the main worry of the wealthy is rising healthcare costs: more than three quarters of 1,000 respondents picked it as their top concern, up from about half in 2010.Mr Thiel said: “It’s really only the last three or four years that its been the number one concern. Before that it was always taxes.”
331;STT;State Street Corp;2012-09-21T09:53:36Z;Desire for diversity spreads to ETF investors;ETF investors are becoming more adventurous;Once the domain of broad-based index strategies, the exchange traded fund market is increasingly inclusive of alternative asset classes like currencies and commodities as well as hedge fund-like strategies.As retail investor and adviser demand for alternatives is expected to grow, ETF sponsors say the product wrapper is well suited to meet those needs.Jeremy Schwartz, director of research at WisdomTree, says: “The alternative category is one where some of the benefits [of ETFs] are magnified. Alternatives are some of the highest fee exposure products you can get …and if your goal is to try and own a strategy that replicates the market in the best way …and in the most cost effective way, ETFs are a way to do that.”ETF sponsors also see alternatives as an opportunity to stand out or diversify their line-ups as many of the broad-based index categories become saturated and commoditised.In fact, much of the alternative ETF space is dominated by smaller players rather than the big three of iShares, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard.ETFs have a history of providing retail investor access to alternative asset classes. The industry’s second-largest product is the SPDR Gold Shares, which along with several other products, provides investors a share of physical gold bars sitting in storage.Energy and agricultural commodities, real estate and currency funds have also proliferated as investors look for non-correlating asset classes. But only in recent years have ETF sponsors looked to wrap alternative strategies, from managed futures to long/short strategies and multi-strategy hedge fund replication funds.While some firms have stuck to index-based products, alternatives have also been at the centre of the growing active ETF space.The motivation behind the desire for alternative-strategy ETFs is the same as that driving investors into other retail alternative products: the search for yield, diversification and low volatility.Adam Patti, chief executive of IndexIQ, which manages three hedge-fund replication ETFs says: “It’s all about having upside capture and downside protection.”He says post-crisis investors are realising the traditional stock-bond allocation is insufficient, so are looking at new products that can provide those features.Others point to the backlash over leveraged and inverse ETFs – and the derivatives they use to execute those strategies – driving investors and advisers to other types of alternative ETFs. Leveraged and inverse ETFs were the subject of an investor alert issued in 2009 by US regulators. The concern centred on some investors’ misunderstanding of the products as trading tools, not long-term investments.Noah Hamman, chief executive of active ETF specialist AdvisorShares, says: “Having a product that gives you that alternative strategy but without those other things, that’s very appealing to advisers.”He says his firm is seeing particular interest among wirehouse advisers, which have pulled back from the leveraged and inverse ETF space. And that interest is driving product development efforts for new alternative ETFs at the firm.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
333;STT;State Street Corp;2012-09-09T03:27:20Z;BlackRock hit by Vanguard price pressure;ETF fee cuts seen as possible response;Ferocious price competition by Vanguard is helping its exchange traded funds business attract more cash this year on a global basis than BlackRock, putting pressure on the world’s largest ETF manager to fight back with fee cuts.Global investor inflows into Vanguard ETFs have reached $37.8bn so far this year, overtaking its total of $36bn for the whole of 2011, according to ETFGI, the research consultancy. BlackRock’s iShares business has gathered $35.3bn in the first eight months. Last year it took in $53.7bn.Vanguard won the race for new inflows among ETF providers in the US market in 2010 and 2011 and has now established a lead for the first time in the battle for investors’ cash on a global basis.Luke Montgomery, analyst at Bernstein, said the most effective way for BlackRock to counter competition from Vanguard would be to introduce targeted price cuts. He said any fee reductions would have to strike a balance between maintaining profits and attracting a broader user base.Expectations that BlackRock will act have risen since its chief executive Larry Fink said in July that the company had “a plan” to address competition in the US ETF market.For ETFs where BlackRock and Vanguard are in direct competition, Bernstein found Vanguard grabbed 71 per cent of new investor inflows between July 2009 and July 2012 while BlackRock only attracted 21 per cent.“BlackRock has lost market share in nearly every product for which Vanguard offers a close substitute,” said Mr Montgomery.Mr Montgomery said it was difficult to judge how much of the reduction in BlackRock’s lead was due to direct competition with Vanguard and how much to faster growth in ETF sales to retail investors.Vanguard’s low-cost message has resonated strongly with retail investors while BlackRock has a stronger presence among institutional users.Competition between two emerging markets ETFs accounts for most of the shift. Vanguard’s VWO attracted $40bn in new inflows between July 2009 and July 2012 while BlackRock’s EEM saw net outflows of $1bn.Vanguard has gradually reduced VWO fees from 30 basis points when it was launched in 2005 to 20bp, while EEM charges 67bp.Vanguard has also helped spark a price war among passive equity managers in the UK. Along with State Street Global Advisors, the group is seeking to gain scale in the institutional market by undercutting both BlackRock and Legal & General Investment Management.In one instance this year LGIM offered 4bp for a large equities mandate and SSGA offered 2bp.The gulf in fees currently being offered is confirmed by investment consultants.Jo Holden, head of local government pension scheme investment at Mercer, said on a recent passive equities search she had seen “some huge differences in the fees that have been offered by some well rated passive managers”.Chris Ford, European head of investment at Towers Watson, believes the fee war is symptomatic of over capacity in the fund management sector.“It is fair to say that the growth in assets that some have had means there is probably some room for cost reductions.”
334;STT;State Street Corp;2012-09-07T17:45:26Z;Survival of the most creative is the watchword;Intense competition is driving the industry to offer new products;Charles Darwin’s theory that only the fittest of the species will survive an ever-changing environment could be an appropriate one to describe the fate of today’s exchange traded fund (ETF) providers.In an industry that continues to rapidly evolve – one which has seen several US players scale back their ETF operations in recent weeks– providers are constantly adapting their product ranges as the competition for client assets intensifies.Gone are the days when ETF providers could survive alone on the plain vanilla products that initially kick-started their growth, and as a result of greater innovation today’s investors have a wide range of ETF strategies at their disposal.Low volatility ETFs are among the most recent arrivals, with the likes of Invesco PowerShares, Russell Investments and iShares all offering low or minimum volatility products.“Investors are dealing with the challenge of how to put their money to work effectively [and] we’ve seen specific demand for new and diversified sources of income for navigating today’s markets,” says Patrick Dunne, head of iShares’ global markets and investments group.“ Innovations within the fixed income and minimum volatility ETF space have proved particularly popular with investors.”Smart beta ETFs – those based on alternative indices and which apply different weighting methods to stocks – have also crept into the fold.Ossiam, the ETF subsidiary of Natixis Global Asset Management, is one of the firms leading in this area, and has a range of products based on two smart beta strategies: equal weight and minimum variance.Lyxor, db X-trackers, PowerShares and Pimco have also added smart beta products to their line-ups.“Much of the innovation has been making the ETF market look more like the overall asset management business,” says Scott Ebner, global head of ETF product development at State Street Global Advisors.Product providers also recognise wider opportunities thanks to the increased popularity of the ETF format, says Ted Hood, chief executive of Source.“For the last 20 years we have heavily associated the ETF industry with passive content. A number of people have valued the ETF format, which is relevant to investment content other than passive [content].”Greater innovation, adds Mr Hood, could lead to ETFs becoming so diverse, that they will no longer be thought about as a distinct product line. “In 10 years’ time …people will not talk about ETFs as a distinct asset class. Instead, it will be about investment content and whether this can be accessed in an ETF format.”As part of the industry’s continued evolution, ambitions to launch active ETFs have also begun to gain more momentum, although activity remains strongest in the US where a slew of providers, including iShares, State Street and PowerShares, have filed with the SEC to roll out active products.Among the most successful active launches in the US, have been Pimco’s Total Return ETF– which reached $2bn in assets in July – and its Enhanced Short Maturity ETF.In Europe, providers have also started to dip their toes into the active ETF waters, with Man Group and Source launching an active ETF last year, while Deutsche Bank and SCM Private teamed up to launch an actively managed multi-asset ETF in February.Swiss & Global Asset Management also launched the first actively managed equity ETFs in Europe in June. The move away from passive approaches in the ETF industry has led to excitement in some quarters, with a survey by McKinsey in 2011 predicting that active ETFs would help “initiate a new growth curve” for the entire asset management industry.However, others have put a dampener on this optimism. A separate study by Edhec Risk Institute from March this year shows that actively managed ETFs were not an important development to the respondents – only 11 per cent said that ETFs should shift from passive to active.Lack of investor demand is not the only challenge for providers of active ETFs.There are several questions active asset managers must ask themselves before rolling out their strategy using the ETF wrapper, notably how to compete with the low cost offerings from passive providers.SSgA’s Mr Ebner adds: “In order to launch an actively managed ETF, you still require the transparency needed for an ETF to operate effectively.”
335;STT;State Street Corp;2012-09-05T18:12:54Z;Protect the virtue of exchange traded funds;People are no longer clear about how they are investing;They are among the biggest and most useful innovations for the retail investor since the advent of mutual funds. But it is time for those investors to look a little more closely at exchange traded funds.The industry itself is reconsidering. As the Financial Times reported this week, after a race to get on board the ETF bandwagon, a quarter of the funds listed in the US have failed to attract enough cash to be viable. The shakeout of the $1.7tn industry, which is still pulling billions away from traditional mutual funds, is solidly under way.Retail investors have faith in ETFs, and in many ways they are right. They are flexible instruments that allow them to invest in indices such as the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100 more cheaply than alternatives. Instead of the complexities of trading in stocks and bonds, or the expense of actively-managed funds, they can track the market efficiently.Yet the funds also appeal to institutions and professionals and are used for other purposes – to short the market, or to hedge and trade in opaque ways. Most of the time, the two groups can coexist happily, but the potential for trouble is growing along with the industry.So far, there hasn’t been a disaster. No fund has collapsed, or been pushed so far from the value of its underlying index that retail investors have lost heavily. Yet it is no longer clear that everyone knows exactly how they are investing their money, and the risks they run.It would be a tragedy if an ETF scandal or failure tainted the reputation of the whole industry, for the funds offer individuals benefits that used to be available only to institutions. They can invest in a variety of global markets – equities, bonds and commodities – cheaply and move money easily.“ETFs democratise investing – retail investors come together with the biggest and smartest institutions in one product, and are treated fairly and the same,” says Joseph Linhares, who runs BlackRock’s iShares business, one of the big three ETF providers, in Europe.It is cheaper to pay a fee of one-third of a per cent to a passive ETF than to invest in expensive actively-managed funds, many of which underperform the same indices anyway. ETFs cost less than passive mutual funds and, unlike mutual funds, investors can buy or sell shares in the trading day.This is a mixed blessing – the “temptation effect” could encourage investors to trade in and out of ETFs constantly, reducing their long-term investment returns. One study by Vanguard found that 62 per cent of its retail ETF investors tend to “buy and hold” compared with 84 per cent of mutual fund investors. Yet even that ratio does not suggest a huge amount of day-trading.The big question is whether individuals and institutions really are treated in the same way by ETFs – and treat them equally in return. Given the way the industry has developed over the past two decades, that is questionable.From plain ETFs such as State Street’s huge SPDR US fund, which follows the Standard & Poor’s 500 and has $107bn in assets, the sector has produced a myriad of funds – 4,600 at the last count. Small ones track esoteric indices and industries, using various baskets of securities.Central banks and regulators are most worried by the rise of synthetic ETFs, constructed by banks using derivatives rather than physical securities. About 45 per cent of the European market is synthetic and the Bank of England has warned that their complexity and opacity poses a systemic risk.The big three ETF managers – BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard – want to protect their franchises by drawing a line between “physical” ETFs and newfangled derivatives, some of which are leveraged. They would like more transparency and clearer labels.But even plain ETFs have pitfalls for retail investors. For one thing, US institutions and retail investors are not actually treated equally – ETFs in the US only trade blocks of securities with approved institutions, while retail investors only obtain shares through brokers.In this two-tier market, retail investors tend to buy and hold ETFs while traders and market-makers move in and out of funds rapidly for many different reasons. ETFs, for example, have become the primary vehicle for institutions to short markets: it is easier to trade in one index fund than to borrow many different securities.That need not be a problem for retail investors itself – indeed, it can be an advantage. A lot of trading in an ETF tends to narrow the spreads at which its shares are offered and thus lower the ultimate costs for individuals. Market-makers also tend to seize on gaps that open up between the value of an ETF and its underlying index, and eliminate them through arbitrage.But things do not always work in favour of the ordinary investor. Moody’s cited one case earlier this year in which the value of one bond ETF was heavily reduced by one investor trading a single $780m block of shares. “For the most part, anything that brings liquidity is a good thing, but we care about extreme events,” says Neal Epstein, a senior credit officer at the agency.That single incident led Moody’s to warn asset managers about the “irregular use” of ETFs. In a crisis, many more could pile on top of each other, leading to sharper price changes in ETFs than in the markets they are designed to track. Bogan Associates, a research firm, has even suggested that an ETF could fail, leaving its investors stranded, if it is too heavily shorted.The irony is that ETFs generally have a good record and have so far been friends to retail investors. It is important for their virtues not to be sacrificed to the other uses traders find for them.
336;STT;State Street Corp;2012-09-03T14:26:23Z;Russell flop sparks fear of ETF malaise;;In early 2010, Russell Investments, the fund manager and compiler of market indices, hired two stars of the exchange-traded fund industry who had pioneered the cheap index tracking products at the iShares franchise.Following the likes of BlackRock and State Street, Russell was betting that investors would seek nimble strategies to trade in and out of markets after the financial crisis. Barely two years later, Russell has announced the closure of its passive funds business.Russell’s brief and unsuccessful foray into ETFs is emblematic of a wider dynamic at play in the industry. While total assets continue to surge – up 13 per cent this year to $1.7tn globally – profitability is falling as sponsors compete on price.Many are now asking whether Russell’s move is the start of a wave of closures: “The Russell announcement could be a watershed,” says Ron Rowland, founder of Invest with an Edge, an ETF industry-tracking website.“There are a number of small ETF sponsors who are taking losses on unpopular funds. If a big company like Russell with deep pockets has been forced to throw in the towel, those sponsors will have to ask how long they can cling on.”Some are already closing down. A total of 71 exchange-traded products (ETPs) have announced closures in the US this year. That is 13 more than the previous record year for closures, 2008.ETPs include funds, which invest directly in the constituents of the index they track, as well as notes, which promise to match the return of the index.The closures, while significant, are only a fraction of the 1,500 ETPs listed in the US. Most of the managers of these products appear determined to soldier on. For the backers of these funds, which include asset managers or investment banks such as Fidelity and Goldman Sachs, losses on one or two small funds are nothing more than a rounding error.“Large asset managers who offer ETFs often don’t break out the costs separately,” says one executive at a fund manager. “Even if they do, they are often willing to bear losses if ETFs mean clients are attracted to their other products.”Optimists argue that it is worth persevering with lossmaking funds because the difficulties facing the sector are temporary, driven principally by the low trading volumes and volatility that have buffeted securities markets this year.In relative terms, the sector still appears to be in good health. US exchange traded funds and notes attracted $77bn in net inflows in the first half of 2012, compared with outflows of $63bn from mutual funds.“ETFs closures are a reflection of the trading and investment environment. We’re seeing financial firms reduce headcount and rationalise products,” says Deborah Fuhr, a partner at ETFGI, a research company.“But if the market comes back, ETFs will come back even stronger and see even greater net inflows than they are already.”A more likely outcome than mass closures might be a pruning of unsuccessful funds and changes in the type of funds that are launched, say analysts.Equity ETFs, which passively track indices by investing funds in the constituent stocks, have long been the mainstay of the industry. But they are falling out of favour with fund sponsors.The reason is falling profitability. Because passive funds are easy to set up, many new entrants have done so, all hoping to copy the success of State Street’s SPY fund, which tracks the S&P 500 and has $100bn in assets.In Europe about 40 different ETFs track the Euro Stoxx 50 index. The result is ferocious competition on price.Some companies are looking to diversify into fixed income and commodity funds, which have seen much stronger asset inflows than equity funds this year. Some are launching funds on Asian exchanges in an effort to attract new investors.Others are turning to actively managed ETFs, which are less easily copied by rivals and can command higher fees.“Investors in active funds are looking for outperformance, which means management fees are much less important,” says Michael John Lytle, managing director at London-based Source, which offers products in partnership with fund managers Pimco, Man Group and Legal & General.Some active funds have been phenomenally successful. Pimco’s Total Return ETF, an exchange-traded version of the bond investor’s flagship mutual fund, has attracted $2.5bn in assets since opening in April.But strip out Pimco’s funds and the average US-listed actively managed ETF has just $76m in assets, according to XTF, a data provider.Despite the success of some active funds, across the sector further closures and consolidation seem necessary before the fat margins can return.

Meanwhile, Scottrade’s FocusShares unit has announced it is liquidating its ETF family at the end of the month.Both launched the funds only last year.Russell runs 26 ETFs with $309.1m in assets as of midyear, while FocusShares’ 15 ETFs had roughly $100m in assets as of July 31. Russell’s funds track Russell indices but filter for factors such as volatility; its Russell 1000 Low Volatility, with $72.2m in assets, is the biggest. FocusShares ETFs track broad equity and sector specific Morningstar indices.Russell attributes its review to a new emphasis on its core business of “delivering multi-asset solutions to institutional investors, financial advisers and individuals globally”. It did not mention potential outcomes or a timetable for conclusions. FocusShares acknowledges its funds’ “inability…to attract significant market interest” as well “prospects for growth in the funds’ assets in the foreseeable future”.The reality is that the US market’s top fund managers have dominated market share and asset growth. In the first half of this year, Vanguard, iShares and State Street Global Advisors, the industry’s three biggest managers, have garnered 77.6 per cent of net cash flows into US ETFs, or $56.1bn, according to ETF Industry Association data. Russell’s ETFs have taken in $38m and FocusShares’ added $13m in the same period."

339;STT;State Street Corp;2012-08-03T17:15:18Z;US ETF inflows rise by a third in July;Renewed appetite for equity ETFs;The US exchange traded funds industry continued to build momentum in July with new inflows up by a third on the previous month as investors displayed a renewed appetite for equity-linked ETFs.Net new inflows into US ETFs (funds and products) reached $17.1bn in July, up 33.1 per cent on June, according to the ETF Industry Association.The jump in inflows brings the total for the first seven months of 2012 to $93bn, a rise of 30.7 per cent on the same period last year.In the race among providers for investors’ cash, Vanguard extended its lead. It had gathered $33.8bn in new inflows by the end of July, up 52 per cent on the same seven month period a year ago.BlackRock’s iShares business, the world’s largest ETF provider, continued to hold on to second place with year-to-date inflows of just over $20bn, up 44.3 per cent on the same period in 2011.The world’s second largest ETF provider, State Street Global Advisors, is also enjoying a strong performance with inflows of $14.6bn, up 155 per cent on the same period a year ago.The big three providers, iShares, SSgA and Vanguard, appear to be tightening their grip on the US market. Between them, they have won almost three-quarters of total new inflows so far this year, compared with 58.8 per cent in the same period in 2011.But other providers beyond the big-three have also enjoyed strong inflows.InvescoPowerShares, the fourth largest US provider, has seen inflows almost double to nearly $6.4bn in 2012.Meanwhile, Pimco has gathered year-to-date inflows of almost 2.8bn, up 151 per cent on last year, helped by the popularity of its flagship Total Return Fund ETF which is known as BOND. Launched in March this year, BOND has already gathered inflows of more than $2.2bn so far this year.July also saw large US equity-linked ETFs attracting strong inflows even though the S&P 500 gained only 0.2 percent last month.The world’s largest ETF, the SPDR S&P 500, known as SPY, pulled in $2.9bn.The biggest ETF linked to US smaller companies, the iShares Russell 2000, known as IWM, gathered $1.6bn.The largest emerging markets ETF, Vanguard’s VWO, attracted inflows of $1.5bn while its direct rival, iShares EEM, only managed to attract $89m.A host of other US domestic equity ETFs also saw strong inflows last month but fixed income ETFs linked to the US government bond market registered outflows. Three iShares US Treasury-linked ETFs were among the biggest losers with combined outflows of 3.4bn in July.Total assets held in US ETFs (funds and products) stood at just over $1.2tn at the end of July, up 2.7 per cent over the same month in 2011.
340;STT;State Street Corp;2012-07-30T11:39:04Z;ETF providers face profitability hit;New rules to hit profits says Moody’s;New rules governing exchange traded funds and other Ucits published last week by European regulators are credit negative for asset managers that manage physical ETFs including BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors, according to Moody’s Investor Service.Moody’s said profitability would be hurt by higher compliance costs and the curtailment of profitable securities lending activities, a common practice by physical ETF providers.“Securities lending provides ETF sponsors [with] extra revenue to compensate for slim ETF management fees,” said Vanessa Robert, senior credit officer at Moody’s.The new guidelines require all securities lending revenues, net of operating costs, to be returned to ETF investors as compensation for assuming the associated counterparty risk.Securities lending revenue sharing arrangements vary widely among ETF providers in Europe. Some return all of the net income while while others retain up to half for the management company.As part of the new guidelines, the European Securities Markets Authority also said that investors should be offered a facility to redeem directly with the fund provider in case secondary market liquidity dried up.“Increasing confidence in ETFs for all these reasons bodes well for the ability of asset managers to attract more assets under management and eventually improve profitability over time,” said Ms Robert.

Profit was eroded by $212m, or 18 cents a share, because of a legal settlement related to Sigma Finance, the complex debt fund that collapsed during the financial crisis. Quarterly revenue also fell, down 6 per cent to $3.62 billion from $3.85 billion.The lower earnings are likely to increase analyst concerns over custodian banks’ business models in the face of low interest rates. The banks invest and manage money on behalf of clients but their profit margins have also been reduced by interest rates at record lows in the US and the European Central Bank’s recent rate cut.“I think we can hold these levels,” Tom Gibbons, chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts. “We do have some headwinds here because we do tend to leave some money at the European central bank and in the past that would have received a little bit of an interest rate. We won’t see that going forward for the foreseeable future.”The three big trust banks – BNY Mellon, State Street and Northern Trust – have responded to the continued interest rate pressure by cutting costs and building new business. State Street earlier this week reported a 4 per cent drop in net profits to $480m, while Northern Trust reported an 18 per cent increase in net income to $179.6m, helped by lower expenses and new acquisitions.Record levels of assets under custody of $27.1tn were not enough to boost profit at BNY Mellon, however. The company’s net interest margin - a key measure of its profitability – fell to 1.25 per cent from 1.41 per cent in the second quarter of last year. The bank is already implementing a programme aimed at reducing expenses by $700m.There’s “not a whole lot” that the company can do to expand the margin, Mr Gibbons told analysts. The bank has already been investing some of its portfolio in higher-yielding assets, including securities backed by home mortgages.BNY Mellon has also started a global secured lending programme, which enables it to lend out clients’ assets in exchange for fees, and is building up more esoteric financial businesses such as collateral management and transformation.“We also see some opportunities, for example, in trade finance as you have had a number of folks exit,” Mr Gibbons said. “That’s another area that we would be looking to push.”The ECB earlier this month reduced its benchmark rate to a record low of 0.75 per cent from 1 per cent and cut its deposit rate from 0.25 per cent to zero, putting further pressure on money market funds, important clients for custody banks.BNY Mellon’s fees from investment services fell 5 per cent to $1.7bn after the company sold one of its business and waived more fees for money market funds.Shares in the company rose 1.3 per cent to $22.01 in early New York trading.Analysts had expected BNY Mellon to report adjusted profit of 52 cents a share. The reported results equate to adjusted earnings of about 57 cents a share, said Howard Chen, analyst at Credit Suisse, meaning BNY Mellon beat estimates by a modest five cents.
342;STT;State Street Corp;2012-07-17T15:29:27Z;State Street to buy Goldman hedge fund arm;;State Street said it will buy the hedge fund administration arm of Goldman Sachs, as the Boston-based custody bank announced a drop in revenues in the second quarter.The $550m cash purchase will make State Street the world’s largest provider of services to alternative asset managers such as hedge funds, the bank said, as a 1.9 per cent drop in revenues on the year before to $2.43bn illustrated the challenge it faces to grow in volatile markets with interest rates near zero.Analysts applauded the logic of the transaction and Glenn Schorr of Nomura said that there were “pretty good core trends” in a quarter in which States Street continued to buy back stock.However, return on equity, while slightly improved, was still only 10 per cent in the quarter and by lunchtime trading in New York shares in State Street had dropped 5 per cent per cent to $41.98.Second-quarter net income dropped 4 per cent to $480m from a year ago as lower foreign exchange trading volumes and weak international stock markets cut the amount of assets that the bank oversees for clients, impacting fee income.Services fees generated from State Street’s $22.4tr assets under custody and administration dropped 3 per cent to $1.09bn from a year earlier.Custody banks have also struggled as the Federal Reserve has held short term interest rates at very low levels, reducing the return they are able to make on lending activities and forcing providers of money market funds to waive fees.Joseph Hooley, State Street chief executive, said that “we are approaching the second half of 2012 with continued caution”. He said that a cost-cutting exercise that has seen the bank jettison more than 2,000 jobs is on course to produce $94m of pre-tax savings this year.With the addition of the Goldman Sachs unit, State Street will oversee almost $900bn in so-called alternative assets, one of the few areas of asset management to continue to attract investor capital, and a source of lucrative fees.Since the financial crisis and the Bernard Madoff scandal, institutional investors such as pension plans have demanded that hedge funds demonstrate greater transparency, requiring them to pay up for high-quality systems provided by their administrators.Earlier this year, Connecticut-based SS&C Technologies beat off interest from private equity group TPG to to take over GlobeOp, a UK-listed hedge fund administrator, for £572m.George Sullivan, head of State Street alternative investment solutions, said that the bank would consider further acquisitions as the sector consolidates. “It’s increasingly difficult for smaller fund administrators to remain competitive in this business“, he said. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
343;STT;State Street Corp;2012-07-03T15:21:13Z;Bond flows driving US ETF industry higher;Fixed income inflows have almost doubled;New inflows into US listed exchange traded funds rose by almost a third in the first half of this year, boosted by growing investor interest in fixed income ETFs.US ETFs (funds and products) gathered net new inflows of $75.9bn in the first six months of 2012, up 31.1 per cent on the same period a year ago, according to the ETF Industry Association.That growth was due mainly to rising inflows into fixed income ETFs, which almost doubled in the first half (up 89.7 per cent) to just over $35bn, massively outpacing the 2.3 per cent growth for inflows into equity ETFs.Fixed income ETFs have accounted for almost half (46.2 per cent) of total ETF inflows so far this year, compared with less than a third (31.9 per cent) in the first six months of 2011.Vanguard’s emerging markets equity ETF, known as VWO, topped the product leader board with inflows of $7.4bn in the first half, pursued by a variety of bond ETFs that reflect investors’ growing use of these instruments to build exposures across fixed income markets.Second on the list was LQD (the iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF) with inflows of just under $5bn, followed by HYG (the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF) with inflows of 3.8bn.Among the ETFs that provide broad exposure to the US Treasury market, Vanguard’s BND gathered $2.6bn while its direct rival, iShares AGG, grabbed $1.1bn.Pimco’s Total Return ETF, known as BOND, the first actively managed fixed income ETF, continued its strong performance after being launched earlier this year. BOND gathered inflows of $1.7bn in the first half.Vanguard remains in pole position in the race among US ETF providers for investors cash with inflows of $29.6bn in the first half, up 41.6 per cent. Vanguard remains comfortably ahead of iShares, the world’s largest ETF provider, whose US operations registered inflows of $16.2bn, an increase of 35 per cent.State Street Global Advisors, the world’s second largest provider, attracted inflows of $10.3bn, a big turnaround from the fist half of 2011 when it saw outflows of $61m.The top three providers appear to have tightened their grip on the US market, taking almost three quarters (73.9 per cent) of the new inflows in the first half of the year, up from 56.6 per cent a year ago.Outside the top three providers, Invesco PowerShares saw inflows surge to $5bn from $1.1 while inflows into Pimco’s ETF business more than doubled to $2.1bn from $1bn.But a number of mid-sized players saw big falls in inflows, suggesting they might be struggling to maintain momentum in the face of increasing competitive pressures being exerted by the three largest managers.Van Eck saw inflows drop to $1.5bn from $4.1bn while new inflows for ProShares, a leveraged and inverse ETF specialist, shrank to $559m from $4.6bn.Total assets held in US ETFs (funds and products) stood at $1,160.8bn at the end of June, up 7.2 per cent on the same month last year.
344;STT;State Street Corp;2012-06-30T19:12:09Z;Ukraine: good job co-hosting the football, but what next?;;"Foreign visitors, numbering up to a million during Euro 2012, appear to have been left with an overwhelmingly positive impression of tournament co-host Ukraine. But international financial institutions look likely to need more convincing before they re-ignite their once intimate relationship with the developing nation.Ukraine’s largest financial investor, the EBRD, has committed €7.5bn to the country since 1992, invested across 294 projects, including badly needed pre-tournament upgrades of transport in host cities Kiev and Lviv. Yet both the EBRD and IMF are calling for major political and legal reform if they are once more to step up commitments.Two things that are non-negotiable are the upholding of rule of law and introduction of an independent judiciary. “We would also like to see a decrease of state-led bureaucratic pressure on businesses,” says Anton Usov, the EBRD’s senior adviser for Ukraine.With the country’s access to a $15.6bn IMF bailout fund currently frozen, investment strategists believe the 46m-strong nation will be held at arm’s length until subsidised gas tariffs are raised and the champion of this policy, populist opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, is released from her prison cell in Kharkiv.“The raising of natural gas costs will be Ukraine’s next big issue,” suggests Paul Ross, a fund manager at Renaissance Asset Management, although he does not expect action to be taken until after parliamentary elections in October.Renaissance suggest that if there is eventually a deal with Tymoshenko, leading to fences being mended with the IMF, Ukrainian long-term GDP growth could beat 5 per cent, boosted by development of shale gas fields. But further political isolation, loss of access to export markets and internal frustration with an intransigent leadership could easily halve this figure.Land and farming is expected to remain a key target sector for foreign investors. “It is a miracle that Ukraine has gone from forced collectivisation of farmers to having it’s agricultural producers listed on stock markets, the ultimate expression of capitalism, in little more than 70 years,” says Rick Lacaille, global chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors and a leading advocate for investment in emerging markets.Yet groups such as State Street and Renaissance are unlikely to invest heavily in Ukraine until both corporate governance and liquidity are improved in what has proved one of the worst performing markets of 2011.Challenges for foreign investors in Ukraine are however just as likely to stem from cultural issues, believes Hugh Brooks, Kiev-based business delivery manager of UK-based CSE International. The consultancy was awarded a £1.6m two-year contract to supervise development of IT for Boryspil airport in Kiev. The airport was looking to handle a record numbers of passengers during Euro 2012, with the day of the match between England and Sweden in the capital expected to be the busiest in the airport’s history. But IT priorities weren’t what he expected: “We found that people were buying their toys before getting to the important part,” said Brooks shortly before the opening of the new international terminal at a cost to the state of Hr4.7bn (€460m).“They would pay for fancy new systems before even knowing what they needed them for.”Related reading:

345;STT;State Street Corp;2012-06-28T10:45:31Z;UBS leads largest London ETF launch;Institutional investors to be targeted;UBS Global Asset Management is launching 66 exchange traded funds on the London Stock Exchange today, (June 28) marking the largest single ETF launch in the LSE’s history.The Swiss bank has expanded its ETF operations widely in recent years under Clemens Reuter, head of UBS exchange traded funds since February 2011.After launching 25 products in Europe in 2011, UBS has launched a further 18 this year and is promising that more will follow. Two dedicated ETF sales staff will be hired in London.Mr Reuter said the London launch was a “very important step” as the UK represented a key market in Europe for UBS which is also planning to expand its ETF operations in Italy.“The launch today demonstrates the commitment of UBS to the London market,” said Mr Reuter.UBS has appointed Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank as additional market makers while Jane Street Capital will act as an additional authorised participant (AP) that can create and redeem ETF units.Mr Reuter said the combination of these organisations and UBS’s own market making capabilities would ensure that trading spreads for the London listed ETFs would be extremely competitive.UBS will also offer over-the-counter (OTC) deals for any clients that require large trades beyond those offered on-screen as its intention is to focus on institutional investors.“We will be hunting for larger trading tickets,” said Mr Reuter.UBS had $10.9bn in ETF (funds and products) assets at the end of May, ranking it as the seventh largest ETF provider in Europe, according to ETFGI, the research consultancy.With net new inflows of $4.8bn in 2011, UBS was the second fastest growing ETF provider in Europe last year behind iShares.Inflows have slowed to $719m in the first five months of 2012 as market conditions have proved challenging for all ETF providers in Europe with the sovereign debt crisis continuing to worsen.Inflows into European listed ETFs have dropped 66 per cent in the first five months of 2012 compared with the same period last year.Mr Reuter said UBS was seeing strong interest in ETFs from external clients as well as from its clients in the bank’s global asset management business and wealth management operations.He added that UBS investment banking operations provided a huge distribution channel and a wide network of clients, many of whom had a growing interest in ETFs.UBS is launching 49 physical ETFs and 17 swap based ETFs. Mr Reuter emphasised that the group would continue to offer both physical and swap based ETFs.He said there were many investors that still preferred swap based ETFs as they could be more efficient in dealing with tax and dividend issues for them.Deborah Fuhr of ETFGI, the research consultancy, said competition in the UK ETF market was heating up with the entry of UBS following hot on the heels of Vanguard’s recent ETF launch in London. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s second largest ETF provider, and Amundi have also expanded their presence in the UK in the past year.Ms Fuhr said that due to the imminent implementation of the Retail Distribution Review, many ETF managers viewed the UK as an increasingly attractive market.“Listing in London is an important component for an ETF provider’s marketing and sales strategy if it wants to be able to tap into the growing demand from UK financial advisers and retail investors who normally trade on the LSE.”
346;STT;State Street Corp;2012-06-17T06:50:04Z;DC tops Fidelity’s DB fund assets;Fidelity DC assets account for 51.8% of its UK pensions business;Fidelity Worldwide Investment is managing more assets for UK defined contribution pension schemes than for defined benefit schemes.According to FTfm’s annual pension fund managers survey, 51.8 per cent of the £18bn Fidelity manages for UK pension schemes comes from the DC side of the business. This is up from 30.6 per cent last year.“The particularly marked increase comes down to the strength of our DC business, which we see as the future of the UK market,” said Nick Burchill of Fidelity. However, Mr Burchill, who oversees the group’s UK DB business, said there was no strategic intent to privilege DC over DB.Currently DB funds dominate the UK pensions market in terms of assets but commentators expect this situation to reverse as fewer employers are prepared to take the risk of pension liabilities on their balance sheet.Of the top 25 managers surveyed, just three count more than a 10th of their assets in DC schemes. For F&C Investments the proportion is one third, and for Standard Life Investments and State Street Global Advisors it is around a fifth.
347;STT;State Street Corp;2012-06-11T21:11:55Z;Banks take steam out of early S&P 500 rally;;State Street was among the top performing US shares on an otherwise gloomy day for equities on Monday following a report that the custody bank was close to completing a deal with Goldman Sachs to acquire its hedge fund administration business.Shares in State Street finished 1.5 per cent higher at $42.79. Goldman shares lost 1.8 per cent to $92.08, as most financial stocks soured shortly after a positive opening.A Financial Times report said Goldman was in “late stage” discussions with State Street, which in recent weeks had emerged as a frontrunner, for the business. If successful, State Street would become the market leader in the sector with close to $700bn of funds under administration.Overall, US equities suffered heavy losses and descended throughout the day to close at a session low. The S&P 500 closed 1.3 per cent lower at 1,308.94 points despite rising as much as 0.7 per cent at the open as investors digested the terms of the €100bn bailout package for Spain’s banks.Financial stocks, which led equities higher in the early morning session, waned quickly after trading started on the main US market. The S&P 500 financials index, which rose as much as 1.1 per cent at the open, was the worst performing sub-sector and closed 1.9 per cent lower.Shares in JPMorgan Chase dropped 2.6 per cent to $32.82. Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, is set to testify before Congress this week. Mr Dimon is expected to address the $2bn trading loss the bank suffered in May. Bank of America lost 3.7 per cent to $7.28.The S&P 500 failed to hold on to its impressive gains from last week as market watchers poured cold water on the recent rally. John Hussman, a fund manager at Hussman Funds, said: “By our analysis, the US economy is presently entering a recession. Not next year. Not later this year. But now.”He added: “We expect this to become increasingly evident in the coming months, but through a constant process of denial in which every deterioration is dismissed as transitory, and every positive outlier is celebrated as a resumption of growth.”Other analysts said that recent gains were part of a broader technical adjustment taking place in the market but warned of limited gains.Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said: “We can only say for now that the market is undergoing a counter-trend rally that should take the S&P 500 to the 1,350-1,360 resistance area.”But on Monday investors shunned riskier stocks, with defensive equities among the least hit by the sell-off. The S&P 500 telecommunications index was the only sector recording gains and increased 0.1 per cent.Among telecoms, Verizon Communications rose 0.3 per cent to $42.56 and AT&T moved 0.1 per cent higher to $34.59.Elsewhere, Diamond Food dropped 7.6 per cent to $18.63 after the Kettle chips maker said it would fail to meet an extended deadline to file its quarterly reports. The company, which failed in its efforts to purchase Pringles from Procter & Gamble this year, has seen its share price decline by more than 42 per cent since the start of January.The Dow Jones Industrial Average tracked the movement of most stocks on the day as well, starting in positive territory and later falling. The blue-chip heavy index was 1.1 per cent lower at 12,411.31.Johnson & Johnson lost 1.4 per cent to $62.12 after a Bloomberg report said the healthcare and pharmaceuticals company had agreed to pay as much as $2.2bn to settle a government inquiry into its marketing of one of its drugs.Omnicare tumbled 8.9 per cent to $30.40 after the healthcare company made an unexpected announcement on the resignation of John Figueroa, chief executive.Implied volatility, as measured by the Vix index, fell initially but soared more than 10 per cent.The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose as much as 0.8 per cent as the session began, but it ended 1.7 per cent lower at 2,809.73.Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on Nasdaq, fell 1.6 per cent to $571.17 as the company’s worldwide development conference began on Monday. The company unveiled its latest operating system and launched a new Maps application to oust rival programmes, including that of Google’s. Shares in Google dropped 2.1 per cent to $568.50.The satellite navigation manufacturer Garmin declined 8.6 per cent to $38.19, as Apple’s new mapping solution would further weaken the GPS market.Facebook lost 0.4 per cent to $27.01 as it was added to the preliminary list of stocks to be added to the Russell 3000 when the index is updated this month.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters dropped 7.8 per cent to $21.32 after the grocery chain operator Kroger said it plans to sell private label coffee pods to compete with the company’s Keurig single-cup machine. Kroger shares fell 1 per cent to $21.35.
348;STT;State Street Corp;2012-06-10T20:49:06Z;Goldman nears hedge fund admin unit sale;;Goldman Sachs is close to sealing a deal with State Street over the sale of its hedge fund administration business in a tie-up that would create the largest administration services provider to hedge funds worldwide. The investment bank is in “late stage” discussions with State Street, according to people familiar with the sale, although no formal agreement has been reached.The combined business would have funds under administration of close to $700bn, overtaking current market leader Citco. Hedge fund administration – which involves accurately valuing portfolios and assessing levels of risk – has become a big business in recent years as new global regulations and investor pressure force the $2tn hedge fund industry to employ more third-party service providers. The bank has been exploring the sale of the business, which is currently ranked fourth and looks after assets of about $200bn, for several months and has spoken to a number of potential acquirers. A potential sale of Goldman Sachs Fund Administration was first reported in April by HFM Week, an industry publication. In recent weeks State Street has emerged as a clear frontrunner and a deal could be agreed by the end of the month. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. While the use of third-party fund administrators has been relatively common in Europe for years, the practice has gained currency in the US after the Bernard Madoff scandal.US fund managers are subject to increased oversight from the US Securities and Exchange Commission and most serious investors now require managers to outsource the calculation of risk and net asset value – a measure of a portfolio’s total worth – to third parties. Goldman’s business counts several of the world’s leading hedge funds among its clients, including Och-Ziff and York Capital. In all, the business caters to more than 500 hedge fund clients and employs about 250 people worldwide, with offices in most big offshore centres. State Street’s fund administration business oversees assets of just under $500bn. Interest in what was previously regarded by many as a technical and unglamorous part of the hedge fund world was piqued earlier this year by a bidding war for GlobeOp, a big fund administration business with about $173bn in assets. The London-based company was bought in May by software group SS&C for £572m – an 80 per cent premium to GlobeOp’s then share price – trumping a £508m bid from TPG, the private equity house. 
349;STT;State Street Corp;2012-06-05T17:19:06Z;Vanguard eats alone at US ETF banquet;May inflows exceed the rest of US industry combined;Vanguard was alone among the biggest US exchange traded fund providers in reaping net inflows last month, as investors took refuge in safe haven assets but not gold.Industrywide, investors poured $4.2bn into the funds in May, compared with just over $3bn in April, according to new data from the ETF Industry Association. Despite the sales improvement, flows remained well off March’s pace of $13.2bn as recurrent Eurozone fears dragged down US shares.Without Vanguard the industry would have faced heavy outflows. The Pennsylvania-based company, which entered the UK ETF market in May, garnered $6.7bn in net new assets and year to date inflows of $28.3bn. Its closest competitor in year to date sales, BlackRock’s iShares unit, bled $642m in May, bringing its flows for the year to $12.7bn.State Street Global Advisors, the US’s second biggest ETF provider, suffered $1.8bn in outflows, while No. 4 provider Invesco PowerShares had $482m in net redemptions.The sales activity reflected demand for broad bond exposure and inflation hedges. Vanguard’s Barclays Total Bond ETF was the hottest seller, pulling in $1.2bn in new inflows, followed by the iShares Barclays 1-3 Year Treasury ETF, which added $1.1bn.Other popular funds included iShares’ Barclays TIPS ETF, which added $638m, and its iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond, with $614m in inflows.Gold ETFs repelled investors, however, in spite of the exodus from higher risk assets. The SPDR Gold Trust posted $374m in outflows, and investors withdrew $198m from the iShares Comex Gold. Contrary to typical patterns, gold trading has tracked with equities and the euro this year.
350;STT;State Street Corp;2012-05-29T17:48:18Z;State Street refutes ETF criticisms;SSgA rejects concerns about impact on retail investors;State Street Global Advisors, the world’s second largest ETF manager by assets, has rejected criticisms suggesting that the growing institutional use of exchange traded funds in the high yield bond market could deter retail investors.Jim Ross, global head of ETFs at SSgA, said he was “surprised” by Moody’s warning on Monday that retail investors and their advisers would be deterred from holding ETFs if they found themselves exposed to increased volatility and execution risks from large block trades done by institutionsThe ratings agency’s comments followed a massive redemption order on May 10 for 19.7m shares worth $780m for a junk bond ETF, managed in the US by SSgA and known by its ticker JNK.Mr Ross said client confidentiality protocols prohibited him from discussing any details of the transaction but he said market speculation and media reports that the deal was related to trading activities by JP Morgan was “not accurate”.Regarding the criticism that the transaction had forced the share price of the ETF to a discount to its net asset value when it had previously traded at a premium to its NAV earlier in 2012, Mr Ross said that it was important to understand the influence of market conditions and flows. JNK had tended to trade at a premium in the early months of 2012 when inflows were high in a period of strong risk appetite. That premium has shrunk more recently amid weaker risk appetite and the ETF has been trading closer to its ask price.“Exchange traded funds have, without doubt, been a positive factor for the high yield bond market. They have boosted overall liquidity and brought greater involvement by market makers, encouraging them to post prices on bonds that would otherwise have been more difficult to trade. Just as we have seen in the US muni bond market, ETFs have helped to provide greater transparency and to strengthen price discovery in the high yield bond market,” said Mr Ross.
351;STT;State Street Corp;2012-05-28T17:05:16Z;High yield ETF trades draw criticism;Institutional activity could deter retail investors, says Moody’s;Moody’s, the rating agency, has warned that the growing institutional use of exchange traded funds in the high yield bond market could deter retail investors and have negative implications for ETF managers.Moody’s comments follows a massive redemption order for 19.7m shares worth $780m on May 10 for a junk bond ETF, known as JNK and managed in the US by State Street Global Advisors.As this was a redemption order, the investor did not take cash but instead received the high yield corporate bonds that make up the underlying index to the ETF.The size of the order raised eyebrows among market participants. It prompted speculation that an institutional investor might be using ETFs such as JNK as a hedging tool due to mispricings in credit default swaps following heavy trading in the Markit CDX index by JP Morgan.“This sizable trade was unusual, and signifies institutional investors’ increasing use of ETFs that have long been marketed to retail investors,” said Neal Epstein, senior credit officer at Moody’s.A further large redemption order for 14.4m followed the first trade. The effect of this selling pressure was to drag the share price of JNK to a 127 basis points discount to its net asset value on May 17. Previously, the ETF had been trading at an average 40bp premium to the NAV during 2012.“This collapse in the premium would have cost an investor a substantial portion of the year-to-date total return of the ETF, which was 5.9 per cent through April 30,” said Mr Epstein.Moody’s warned that the growing use of ETFs by instutional investors was “credit negative” for fund managers, including SSgA, BlackRock and Invesco. It said this was because retail investors and their advisers would be deterred from holding ETFs if they found themselves exposed to increased volatility and execution risks from large block trades done by institutions.Moody’s said such large trades also raised the potential for additional regulatory scrutiny and increased compliance costs if the use of ETFs for implementing arbitrage strategies “proves to amplify systemic risks”.High yield ETFs have been attracting strong inflows this year as investors look for income in a low interest rate environment.JNK gathered inflows of $2.8bn in the first four months of 2012, taking its assets to just over $12bn at the end of April.A rival product from BlackRock, the iShares iBoxx high yield corporate bond ETF, known as HYG, has done even better with inflows of just under $4bn in 2012, swelling its assets to $15.1bn.These two ETFs have become increasingly important to players in the cash market, allowing them to hedge their exposures without resorting to less effective derivatives.For George Bory, credit strategist at UBS, the sheer scale of the May trade makes the growing involvement of ETFs in the high yield market “blatantly obvious”.“It is no secret that high yield ETFs have become a powerful new force in the high yield bond market,” said Mr Bory.Mr Bory said growth in high yield ETFs meant these instruments had become new repositories and conduits for risk trades in this asset class.He estimated that Wall Street’s primary dealer community (21 banks) holds $43.6bn in corporate bonds (both investment grade and high yield) while HYG and JNK have a combined “available inventory” of around $27.3bn.Mr Bory suggested JNK was chosen for the trade as it had less than half the number of bonds held by HYG, making it an easier portfolio to manage once liquidated.Both Moody’s and UBS noted that short interest (bets on prices falling) in high yield ETFs has risen substantially. UBS estimated that the short position has almost doubled since February even as retail investor money has become increasingly long.Mr Bory said there was no definitive reason why the short position had built up but he noted a breakdown in the correlation between trading in the high yield cash and derivatives markets, which he said was “likely” to be the result of outsized trades being conducted in the CDX market at that time.Mr Bory also warned that the US high yield market, and ETFs in this asset class in particular, had become a “very crowded trade”.Mr Epstein agreed that it was difficult to know for certain what motivated the increase in short interest but added that the growing use of ETFs as rapid trading vehicles by institutional block-traders and hedgers seemed to be increasing the risks for retail investors.“This dilutes the marketing message of industry sponsors that have promoted ETFs as a superior investment technology for retail investors, as well inviting additional regulatory oversight.”
352;STT;State Street Corp;2012-05-28T16:16:44Z;Short interest surge for junk bond ETFs;;Short positions in the two largest exchange-traded funds that track corporate junk bonds have reached record highs in a sign that investors are becoming more bearish on the creditworthiness of risky US companies.According to Data Explorers, a subsidiary of Markit, more than 17m shares in BlackRock’s HYG and State Street’s JNK funds were on loan to short sellers last week.Broker-dealers who lend out HYG and JNK shares to hedge fund clients, are responding to the surge in short interest by redeeming some of their own shares in the funds, in case prices fall by the time clients return shares to them.The move into the ETFs has coincided with increasing demand for credit protection against junk bonds, widening credit default swap spreads significantly. The rise in short positions also signals the increasing willingness of institutional investors to use bond ETFs, which have grown in size significantly over the past year, as an alternative to the cash and swaps markets.“We’ve reached a point where ETFs are increasingly seen as a viable way to express both long and short views,” said Eric Gross, a credit strategist at Barclays. “Even as recently as a year ago these products were not considered liquid enough to implement large positions.”Debt issued by US companies without investment grade ratings was hugely popular in the early part of the year with yields offered by such so-called junk bonds looking attractive next to low interest rates.But worries about a Greek exit from the eurozone and fears over slowing global growth appear to be leading some investors to rethink. A total of $2.5bn was withdrawn from junk bond funds last week, the fourth largest outflow since records began in 1992, according to Lipper. According to data from Lipper, $900m worth of shares in junk bond ETFs have been redeemend in each of the last two weeks, almost double the previous record weekly redemption.Institutional investors have also been using credit default swaps, which rise in value if bond prices fall, to hedge portfolios. But a surge in interest has seen the spread on junk bond CDS over the underlying bonds rise 174 basis points since the start of February, making it potentially expensive to use swaps to hedge positions.As a result investors have been turning to junk bond ETFs, whose shares trade on exchanges and can be sold short to hedge positions, in trades that are encouraged by ETF sponsors.“For sophisticated institutional investors, ETFs are an alternative to options and swaps for expressing views on the direction of a market,” said Liz Tennican, a managing director in the ETF institutional sales team at BlackRock.“Hedge funds that use ETFs to go short bring liquidity, which makes it easier for everyone to trade the product,” she added.Short sellers borrow shares from broker-dealers and sell them, anticipating that prices will fall by the time they have to buy the shares back and return them to broker-dealers.
353;STT;State Street Corp;2012-05-27T03:40:29Z;New funds: May 28;Standish Mellon AM has launched a GDP-weighted bond fund;● Having concluded that GDP-weighted bond indices offer better opportunities than traditional indices where the more debt a country issues, the greater its weight in the index, Standish Mellon Asset Management (BNY Mellon Asset Management’s fixed income specialist) has launched a bond strategy based on this concept.● Henderson Global Investors is raising money in the institutional market for two property loan funds. Henderson High Income Real Estate Debt will target an internal rate of return between 8 per cent and 10 per cent, investing in senior and subordinated debt with a typical loan-to-value ratio of 75 per cent. The lower-risk Henderson Senior Secured Real Estate Debt Fund will target a return between 5 and 6 per cent, using senior debt and a loan-to-value ratio of 60 per cent.● Pictet Asset Management is to launch the Pictet Emerging Markets High Dividend Fund on June 7. This fund is similar to an existing Pictet fund marketed in Japan, which has $3.6bn in assets. Mark Boulton and Stephen Burrows will manage the fund, which will be Ucits-compliant and structured as a compartment of Pictet’s Luxembourg Sicav.● After changes to the rules on marketing covered bonds in the US, ProShares has been quick off the mark, launching its ProShares USD Covered Bond ETF. The ETF will attempt to match the returns of the BNP Paribas Diversified USD Covered Bond index, which tracks a portfolio of triple A rated covered bonds denominated in dollars. Covered bonds are a type of collateralised corporate debt, popular as a source of funding for non-US banks. Until last week, they could not be marketed in the US retail market.● State Street Global Advisors’ exchange traded fund platform SPDR has listed four physically backed UK fixed income ETFs on the London Stock Exchange. The ETFs will track Barclays indices for sterling corporate bonds, UK gilts, 1-5 year gilts and gilts with a maturity of more than 15 years. They were listed in Germany last week.
354;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Many synthetic ETFs in ‘danger zone’;More than 75% of new synthetic ETFs face risk of closure;More than three-quarters of the synthetic exchange traded funds listed in Europe are at risk of closure after failing to attract sufficient inflows in their first three years since launching, according to Rick Genoni, global head of ETFs for Vanguard.Mr Genoni said ETFs which failed to reach $30m in assets were at “huge risk” of closure. He noted that half of all ETFs, including synthetic and non-synthetic, launched in Europe in the last five years were in the “danger zone”.But newly launched synthetic ETFs looked particularly exposed. Mr Genoni said 76 per cent of the synthetic ETFs launched over the past three years had failed to meet the $30m mark needed to secure their long-term viability.Speaking on the sidelines of an event to mark the listing of Vanguard’s first five ETFs in London, Mr Genoni emphasised that he was not predicting widespread closures of synthetic ETFs as these instruments provided their parent investment banks with other important revenue generating opportunities, such as selling derivatives.But Mr Genoni said survey evidence from the Edhec Risk Institute showed that 80 per cent of investors preferred physical replication ETFs that buy the constituents of an index, compared with 20 per cent that expressed a preference for synthetic funds that use derivatives to provide returns.Synthetic ETFs “have a place” but only in those areas or asset classes such as commodities where physical replication is not possible, said Mr Genoni.Vanguard, the world’s third largest ETF provider behind iShares and State Street Global Advisors, manages only physical ETFs.Noting that passive products are consistently winning a growing share of the total funds market in the US and rest of the world, Mr Genoni said he expected adoption patterns for ETFs in the UK and Europe to follow the lead of the US.In the US, half of all ETFs are held by institutions while 45 per cent are held by financial advisers and 5 per cent are held directly by retail investors. In contrast, UK and continental European ETF markets remain dominated by institutional investors who hold 90 and 85 per cent respectively of outstanding ETFs.The driver for great adoption of ETFs by financial advisers in the UK and Europe would be provided by a growing awareness of the importance of fund costs combined with a rise in fee based compensation and the decline of commission based payments.ETFs do not pay commissions to financial advisers, unlike most mutual funds.In the US, fee based compensation now makes up 55 per cent of the revenues earned by financial advisers (up from 20 per cent in 2000).In other markets, fee based compensation remains much lower, suggesting room to catch up with the more mature US market. Fee based compensation makes up a quarter of advisers’ revenues in Australia and 16 per cent in Canada and drops to just 10 per cent for the UK.
355;STT;State Street Corp;2012-05-13T04:23:50Z;Regulation ‘not major obstacle’ to innovation;Asset managers can be their own worst enemies;The biggest obstacle to innovation by asset managers is themselves, according to research by State Street.Some 70 per cent of managers surveyed cited internal reasons such as policies and procedures or finding consensus among senior managers as their biggest challenges in bringing new products to market quickly.The US bank surveyed 166 asset managers in 25 European countries and just 16 per cent referred to regulatory approval.Asset managers are struggling to adapt to a fast-changing environment, according to Joe Antonellis, head of State Street Global Services and Global Markets outside the US. “I don’t think I’m overstating it to say we’re living in a difficult environment, especially in Europe, and the asset management industry is in a state of flux.”New regulation combined with increased focus on risk management and demand for transparency has led to asset managers finding themselves tied up in red tape when trying to innovate, but Mr Antonellis sees this situation as temporary.“Change is always burdensome, but throughout history, when there is more regulation or administration, you figure out how to deal with it and move on,” said Mr Antonellis.State Street is expanding its infrastructure to deal with the wave of outsourcing it expects to see as asset managers decide they can delegate much of the new operational requirements.
356;STT;State Street Corp;2012-05-09T16:29:17Z;Investors take issue with ETF loan fees;;Operators of exchange traded funds are making increasing sums of money by lending securities to short-sellers in return for cash or collateral as the funds surge in popularity.Concern is growing among investors at the differences in how much of that revenue is returned to investors and how much is retained by operators, such as BlackRock and Vanguard.Financial Times research shows the share of revenue retained by operators varies from 5 per cent to 50 per cent.“I knew issuers lent out securities, but I’m shocked by how much of the revenue some are keeping back,” said Bryce James, an investment adviser at Seattle-based Smart Portfolios, which invests client money exclusively through ETFs. “It affects the cost and benefits of choosing a fund.”ETFs, which passively track indices such as the S&P 500 by buying underlying stocks, have accumulated large portfolios of securities as their assets under management have doubled to almost $1.8tn since 2007.Operators routinely lend the funds’ securities in return for cash payments, or collateral, which can be reinvested elsewhere to generate additional returns, a practice also common among mutual funds.BlackRock generated $164m by lending securities owned by the US-listed ETFs of its iShares franchise in the past fiscal year. BlackRock retained $57m, or 35 per cent, in fees.State Street keeps 15 per cent of the revenue generated by lending the securities of its SPDR funds unit, the second-largest global ETF provider by assets after iShares.These so-called revenue “splits” have drawn criticism from smaller operators. “Some providers take a portion of the lending revenue, some up to 40 per cent,” said John Woerth at Vanguard. “Would the investor give up 40 per cent of, say, Apple’s share price gain?”Mr Woerth said Vanguard, an investor-owned company that seeks to operate at cost, returned at least 95 per cent of securities lending revenue to investors in its ETF unit.SPDR said State Street required similar revenue splits from its external securities lending clients, while BlackRock said its fees were justified by strong returns.“Splits do not tell the whole story on securities lending,” said David Lonergan, managing director at BlackRock. “BlackRock has generated more revenue for shareholders on an after-split basis.”The variation in practice has emerged because of limited disclosure requirements.In the US, which accounts for more than half of global ETF assets, operators must tell investors if they plan to lend out securities but are not required to disclose revenue or fees.While BlackRock and State Street publish fees in their funds’ annual reports, Vanguard does not.Van Eck and PowerShares, who appoint external banks to administer their lending programmes, said they return all revenue to investors but declined to say what share is retained by the agents in fees.“Investors should be able to see all the costs and revenue sources involved in an ETF but it can be hard to obtain that data,” said Deborah Fuhr, a partner in London-based ETF Global Insight.Fee splits and disclosure may be less favourable to investors in non-US funds.Both BlackRock and State Street retain 40 per cent of securities lending revenue from their European-listed funds while Nomura, the Japanese bank, retains up to 50 per cent of securities lending revenues from one of its Tokyo-listed ETFs.Tony Hanlon, who regulates asset managers at the UK’s Financial Services Authority, said last month that European investment banks that offer derivative-based ETFs return securities lending revenue to shareholders only “from time to time and at their own discretion”.Additional reporting by Chris Flood
357;STT;State Street Corp;2012-05-02T14:49:27Z;Global ETF assets to exceed $3.8tn by 2016;Cerulli Associates highlights need for advanced education;Assets held in exchange traded funds globally will exceed $3.8tn by 2016, according to a new report by Cerulli Associates.The report predicts growth will be fuelled by a greater appetite for passive investing, increased adoption of ETFs by financial advisers and advances in ETF education.Almost two-thirds (63 per cent) of the managers surveyed by Cerulli expected ETF growth to accelerate this year. Strong flows into ETFs are encouraging established mutual fund managers to consider entry into the market. However, gaining approval from regulators is a long and costly process and Cerulli said potential entrants faced many onerous tasks before they could launch new ETFs.The report, titled ETFs and Retail Alternative Products and Strategies 2012, asked ETF managers for their views on the biggest challenges facing their industry.Topping the list was misconceptions about the liquidity of ETFs. Cerulli found 70 per cent of respondents thought misunderstandings about an ETF’s trading volume and its true liquidity were a major challenge to increasing sales.“Financial advisors often mistakenly assumed a connection between an ETF’s trading volume and its liquidity,” said Alec Papazian, senior analyst at Cerulli.As a result, investors worry they might not be able to move large positions in and out of ETFs with low trading volumes.Cerulli also highlighted a need for more advanced education about ETFs as “pivotal” for encouraging their greater use by financial advisers.Mr Papazian said ETF managers felt advisers understood the fundamentals of ETFs but realised more sophisticated education about issues like liquidity was required to improve the traction of their products.ETF managers appear confident that the trend for financial advisers adopting ETFs remains intact. Almost two-thirds (63 per cent) of those surveyed thought the threat of slower adoption of ETFs by financial advisers was not an issue and only 19 per cent saw this as a major challenge.However, Cerulli said some advisers would continue to resist using ETFs as they were more comfortable with active managers, even if their products were more expensive.The second major challenge facing ETF managers is penetrating the pensions market.“There has yet to be an ETF sponsor to make steady traction in the 401(k) market [in the US] and the consensus is that they are hesitant to risk resources in an effort to be the first penetrator,” said Mr Papazian, who added that managers felt it would be more advantageous to wait until a rival succeeded and then to replicate their strategy.Product proliferation was also seen as potential hindrance to the ETF industry’s growth, cited as a major issue by a quarter of the managers surveyed by Cerulli and as a moderate challenge by a further 56 per cent.In 2011, the industry launched a record number of products even though growing numbers of new ETFs are failing to accumulate sufficient assets to be profitable.The ongoing price war among ETF providers appears to hold little fear for most managers. Only 20 per cent cited downward pressure on fees as a major challenge while 80 per cent said it was an issue of moderate or no importance.But ETF providers are increasingly conscious of the importance of expense ratios and costs to investors. Almost half (47 per cent) cited costs and expense ratios as an important factor for their success, up from 27 per cent in 2011.Looking at which factors ETF managers believe could make the biggest contribution to achieving success, Cerulli found brand name recognition rated most highly. It was cited by 87 per cent of managers as the most important factor for achieving success, a notable increase from 64 per cent in 2011.“Brand name recognition is becoming increasingly important in the ETF industry, and sponsors plan to build their name through increased advertising,” said Mr Papazian.With more providers entering the ETF industry and more products coming to the market, brand reputation is also widely seen as an important factor for ETF managers to distinguish themselves from the competition.Almost three quarters (73 per cent) of those surveyed in both 2011 and 2012 cited the reputation of their brand as an important factor for driving success.The three largest players, iShares, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard, have already established themselves as the dominant brands for broad mainstream strategies due to their size and long established presence in the ETF industry.But for smaller ETF players, branding the company as a specialist with a particular niche or focus has emerged as a way to engage investors, said Mr Papazian, pointing to ProShares recently branding itself as “The Alternative ETF Company”.For players outside the top three, Cerulli warned that offering similar ETFs and attempting to undercut the competition on price was “not recommended”.“Achieving sufficient scale to make an ETF viable will be difficult enough, and distributing an ETF at a significantly lower cost than a larger competitor will likely make that challenge insurmountable,” said Mr Papazian.
358;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
359;STT;State Street Corp;2012-04-29T03:52:14Z;‘New frontiers’ in equities;EM markets seen as too correlated, so frontier markets are next;Emerging market equities have largely lost their ability to provide diversification and investors should look to peripheral “frontier” markets such as Kuwait, Nigeria and Bangladesh, according to State Street Global Advisors.The correlation between the MSCI Emerging Market Index and the MSCI World Index, which covers developed markets, has risen from 0.686 during the period 1992-2002 to 0.893 since 2003, according to SSgA, removing much diversification benefit.However, the degree of correlation between the MSCI Frontier Markets Index and the MSCI World has been just 0.635 in the period since 2003.This means frontier markets are behaving largely as emerging markets did in the 1990s. The correlation between emerging and frontier markets is lower still, at 0.613.“As the world economy has become more interconnected among countries, continents and regions, the benefit of lower correlation to developed markets that emerging markets once offered is no longer as prevalent,” said Thomas Coleman, head of emerging market equity strategies, North America at SSgA.“One pitfall to the growth emerging markets have experienced over the last decade is that globalisation of the world economy has made these markets more susceptible to the same factors and forces as developed counterparts.”In contrast, Mr Coleman argued that frontier markets remained more isolated from the global economy, meaning domestic forces retained a greater influence, as with emerging markets in the 1990s.Mr Coleman admitted only “a few” of SSgA’s clients had dipped their toes into frontier markets as yet, with investors scared off by the global financial crisis and, more recently, by the Arab uprisings.However, he said frontier markets’ relatively under-developed capital markets and higher potential economic growth could give higher returns.The MSCI Frontier Index is skewed to financial and telecoms, which account for 69 per cent, and to the Gulf, with Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates constituting 53 per cent, but Mr Coleman said the emerging markets index was similarly geographically concentrated in the 1990s.However, he said frontier markets suffered from lack of liquidity, high transaction costs, limits on foreign ownership and political risk.
360;STT;State Street Corp;2012-04-24T17:10:46Z;New trade association for US ETF industry;Nefta launches without largest ETF players on board;Exchange traded fund providers in the US have launched a trade association, but the initiative has failed to secure the support of the ETF industry’s largest players.The launch of the National Exchange Traded Funds Association (Nefta) is being led by John Hyland, chief investment officer of United States Commodity Funds, Adam Patti, chief executive of IndexIQ, and Tom Carter, president of Alps Advisors and Alps Distributors.Mr Patti, who will act as vice-chair of Nefta, said the new trade body aimed to educate investors about the benefits of ETFs and to work with regulators.Mr Patti said building membership was “a process” and that Nefta had conducted extensive consultations with most US ETF providers. More than half had already expressed strong support for the new trade body, and he hoped there would be full participation by the entire ETF industry “in time”.“We have to work hard to prove our value and to make an impact for the good of the industry,” said Mr Patti.He said it was time for the ETF industry to “speak with one voice” as there had been a great deal of misinformation published about ETFs that regulators were reacting to.However, the new trade body has not yet signed up the ETF industry’s three largest players, iShares, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard.Jennifer Grancio, managing director at BlackRock iShares, gave a cautious welcome to the new trade body. Ms Grancio said BlackRock welcomed “thoughtful discourse” if it ultimately helped investors understand and properly use different kinds of exchange traded products.Previous attempts at starting a US trade body, such as the ETF Council launched in 2010, also failed to gain traction with the largest providers.In Europe, efforts to establish a European ETF trade body last year ground to a halt after iShares decided not to participate.US fund managers are also represented by the Investment Company Institute, which launched an ETF committee in 2008 to discuss industry issues and the concerns of regulators.“ICI partners with a number of trade associations on issues of shared interest, and we welcome Nefta’s input to the ETF discussion,” said Jim Ross, global head of ETFs at SSgA, who also acts as chair for the ICI ETF committee.However, SSgA has said no to joining Nefta.“State Street Global Advisors is a member of the Investment Company Institute and its ETF Committee, which is already working effectively to advance the interests of exchange traded funds and their shareholders,” said Arlene Roberts, a spokesperson for SSgA.Mr Patti said Nefta’s aim was to build a “big tent” that would be complementary to ICI. Important players in the ETF industry, such as the New York Stock Exchange or Bank of New York Mellon in its role as an ETF service provider, were not members of ICI but would be involved in Nefta, he added.“ICI is a wonderful organisation. Mutual funds still dwarf ETFs in the US but not all of the same issues apply,” said Mr Patti.
361;STT;State Street Corp;2012-04-18T15:52:32Z;Questions for dividend focused ETFs;US corporate payout ratios remain low as pressure for higher dividends grows;Investors’ hunger for income from equities in the current low interest rate environment has fuelled a growing appetite for dividend focused exchange traded funds.The three largest dividend focused ETFs – Vanguard’s VIG, State Street Global Advisors’ SDY and iShares’ DVY – gathered between them new inflows of more than $10bn over the course of 2011.All three delivered significantly higher total returns than the S&P 500 in 2011 and their strong performances has ensured continuing momentum in 2012.VIG has attracted inflows of almost $1.3bn in the first three months of 2012 while SDY has grabbed $602m and DVY has gathered $142m.But the popularity of dividend focused investing has also led some analysts to question if interest might be coming from “investment style chasers” rather than long-term investors seeking less volatile, compounding equity returns.Andrew Lapthorne, a strategist at Société Générale, is concerned that chasing dividend income might have turned into a momentum trend rather than a consistent strategy for some investors.“The correct combination of above average quality and dividend yield provides a strategy that should be pursued every year and not just as some kind of momentum play.”Clients of SocGen have been asking Mr Lapthorne if dividend focused funds have become too expensive or if their valuations are still attractive.After last year’s strong gains, the highest yielding quintile of US equities are trading at a slight valuation premium to the wider US stock market, based on 12 month forward price earnings ratios.However, this is a US specific issue as high yielding stocks in Europe, the UK and globally are trading at discounts to their respective broader market benchmarks.This could also reflect the relative shortage of high dividend paying US stocks. Mr Lapthorne points out that only around 10 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 yield 4 per cent or more, compared with almost a quarter globally.Consensus forecasts suggest dividend growth of 7 to 8 per cent for both 2012 and 2013 in the US, Europe and globally but Mr Lapthorne says investors have to ask themselves where the risks to these forecasts lie.Payout ratios (dividends as a proportion of earnings) remain depressed globally, reflecting companies’ anxieties about future profits growth. However, it also suggests that companies do have enough headroom to increase payouts and should also provide some comfort to investors who might be worried about dividend cuts in 2012.Adour Sarkissian, who runs the ING US high dividend fund, says many large US companies have sizeable amounts of cash on their balance sheets but remain cautious about making new investments given the uncertain economic outlook.“Initiating a dividend policy, or carrying out a dividend hike, can be an alternative,” says Mr Sarkissian who argues that many companies have the resources to grow their dividends even more than their earnings, given their substantial cash positions.Mr Sarkissian says that investor demand for bigger payouts in the US is growing, citing Apple’s decision to start paying dividends this year as as example of a company listening to shareholders on this issue.Pressure for bigger dividend payments in the US is not surprising. The US stock market provides a relatively miserly dividend yield (2.06 per cent for the S&P 500 at the end of the first quarter), less than the FTSE 100 (3.6 per cent), FTSE Eurofirst 300 (4 per cent) or even the FTSE World (ex-US) index (3.3 per cent).Mr Lapthorne points out that around a quarter of US companies in the S&P 500 do not currently pay a dividend. So he thinks that dividend payouts by US non-financial companies could turn out to be higher than expected.But Keith Miller, equity strategist at Citi, cautions equity income investors also have to pay attention to macro-economic risk factors. He warns that the highest yielding stocks tend to underperform when interest rates are rising and when oil prices are rallying.“To the extent that the US economic recovery continues to gather momentum, the highest yielding stocks are likely to lag the broader market”.
362;STT;State Street Corp;2012-04-17T13:09:46Z;State Street dividend back to pre-crisis level;;State Street and Northern Trust both announced higher dividends following the completion of the Federal Reserve’s stress tests, but mixed first-quarter earnings from the custody banks highlighted the challenge ahead to improve margins.Profits dropped at State Street in the first quarter as cost inflation more than offset slight growth in revenues. Net income dropped 9 per cent on the same period last year, to $417m, on annual growth in revenues of 3 per cent, to $2.4bn.Expenses rose at more than twice the rate of sales, with payroll-related costs more than a fifth higher than the year before because of what the company called a seasonal effect related to the timing of stock-based pay and payroll taxes.Joseph Hooley, State Street’s chairman and chief executive, said that the programme of technology upgrades and reorganisation is on track to produce $94m in annual cost savings this year.Northern Trust said net income rose 7 per cent to $161m, on revenues up 8 per cent to $965m. However, non-interest expenses at the bank were 9 per cent higher than the year before, and like its larger peer, the group has begun to restructure, cutting 700 jobs in the first quarter.State Street raised its quarterly dividend to $0.24 per share, from $0.18 a year ago, taking the payout back to its pre-crisis high, adjusted for a stock split. The company has also approved stock repurchases of up to $1.8bn, or 8 per cent of its market capitalisation, by March 2013.Northern Trust’s dividend was up 7 per cent, to $0.30. The company said that it was “one of only two major US banks that did not cut its quarterly dividend throughout the financial crisis”.For State Street, the underlying picture was mixed. Servicing fees on assets under custody, the largest business, dropped 1.6 per cent to $1.08bn on weaker asset prices outside the US.State Street Global Advisors, the group’s asset management arm, reported flat fee revenues of $236m, on a 6 per cent drop in assets to $1.99tn. Some analysts have argued that State Street should spin out SSgA to remedy what Bernstein Research calculates are below average operating margins of 27 per cent, compared with the mid-30 per cent range typical for many large peers.However, Brad Hintz, Berstein analyst, said that “an alternative explanation for SSgA’s lower profit margins is unfavourable cost allocation and transfer pricing vis a vis the custody business”. Margins in custody have been largely static for two decades, even as the industry has consolidated.At lunchtime in New York State Street and Northern Trust shares were up 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent respectively, at $44.38 and $47 per share.
363;STT;State Street Corp;2012-04-05T06:15:53Z;Liability move is not best way to protect investors;;From Mr Ranjit Chatterji.Sir, The Association of Global Custodians shares the asset management industry’s concerns at the proposed implementing of measures for the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive that would further extend the liability of depositaries.As custody banks responsible for the safekeeping and administration of investors’ assets, we believe that depositaries should rightly be held to the highest standards of care in the interests of investor protection. However, depositaries cannot be responsible for risks that are beyond their control as the measures currently suggest (for example, the risk of fraud by third parties).To make depositaries liable in this way would cause significant and undesirable disruption to financial markets, particularly around collateral management practices and the clearing of derivatives. It could also result in increased systemic risk. Such outcomes are markedly counter to the tenets of the Group of 20 commitments, and the regulatory response to the financial crisis.We believe that an appropriate balance can be achieved that protects investors, limits systemic risk and respects the original consensus reached on the AIFMD.Ranjit Chatterji, Chair, Association of Global CustodiansThe Association of Global Custodians includes as members the following banks participating in this letter: The Bank of New York Mellon, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, J P Morgan, Northern Trust, RBC Dexia Investor Services, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Standard Chartered Bank and State Street Bank and Trust Company
364;STT;State Street Corp;2012-04-04T19:36:09Z;Big banks warn over funds shake-up;;The global banks that safeguard almost all fund managers’ assets are sounding the alarm over proposed Brussels rules for the hedge fund and private equity industries, warning they would “cause a significant and undesirable disruption to financial markets”.In a rare public statement that reflects the concern among executives, custodian banks are urging the European Commission to amend technical standards proposed for implementing the 2011 alternative investment fund managers directive (AIFMD).The banks – including typically low-key institutions such as State Street and Bank of New York Mellon – fear that rules intended to protect investors from fraud are unworkable, overstep the Commission’s mandate and will drive up costs for investors.The intervention will add ballast to public concerns aired by the fund management industry, which Michel Barnier, the European commissioner overseeing financial services, this week dismissed as “rearguard lobbying” aimed at wriggling out of long-overdue regulation.Writing to the Financial Times, the Association of Global Custodians in particular takes issue with the interpretation of rules that leave them liable for risks beyond their control, such as fraud by third parties such as brokers or registrars.“To make depositaries liable in this way would cause a significant and undesirable disruption to financial markets, particularly around collateral management practices and the clearing of derivatives,” the custodians said. “It could also result in increased systemic risk.”Custodian banks signing the letter include JPMorgan, Citi, HSBC and Deutsche Bank.EU officials see the rules as vital to give investors better protection from another Madoff fraud or Lehman Brothers collapse. But the banks complain that the Commission, in drafting the specialist rules on how to apply the directive, is unpicking some of the hard-fought political compromises that underpinned the AIFMD deal in 2011. Mr Barnier rejects the charge, saying it is the industry ­trying to “reopen old issues”.According to the banks, several provisions on collateral arrangements go beyond the directive. Custodians would in effect be responsible for brokers or clearing houses appointed by a fund manager, increasing risks and due diligence requirements.Should the rules go through unchanged, the banks believe they will overturn many market practices and contracts, and restrict investment options for fund managers, particularly in emerging markets.On some of the issues raised, the Commission is being asked better to reflect the advice of the European Securities and Markets Authority in its legal text.

These two categories accounted for 85 per cent of total fixed income inflows in the first quarter.In the US market, the three largest providers, BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard, appear to be tightening their grip.Between them, they shared more than two-thirds of the new cash gathered in the first quarter, up from 37.2 per cent a year ago.Vanguard, the fastest growing provider in the US market for the past two years, has already established a lead in this year’s race for investors’ cash. Vanguard gathered inflows of $17.2bn in the first quarter, ahead of BlackRock ($12.4bn) and SSgA ($8.5bn).Vanguard continues to benefit from growing investor interest in using ETFs to access emerging markets. The most popular ETF choice for US investors in the first quarter was VWO, the Vanguard MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, which gathered $6.4bn, more than double the $2.7bn inflows attracted by its direct rival from iShares, known as EEM.The two outstanding performers for BlackRock in the first quarter were HYG, the iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, which attracted $3.5bn, and LQD, the iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, which took in $2.4bn.Invesco PowerShares, the fifth largest US ETF manager, saw new inflows surge to $6.3bn in the first quarter from $1.9bn a year ago. Invesco is the manager of QQQ, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index that has been boosted by strong gains in Apple’s share price.
366;STT;State Street Corp;2012-03-29T13:40:09Z;Custodians come under fire over ‘excessive’ FX profits;‘Excessive’ profit by custodian banks has been drawing attention;"If there are at least two sides to every foreign exchange transaction, there are at least two sides to every story too – often diametrically opposed to one another.This is particularly true in the unfolding saga of lawsuits involving US pension funds, FX trades made on their behalf by custodian banks, and professional investment managers. In short, a small but growing number of pension funds or parties acting with their interest at heart is undertaking some form of legal action against their custodians.In the vanguard is the California attorney-general, alleging that State Street has made excessive profits from FX transactions arising from the day-to-day servicing needs of assets belonging to California Public Employees’ Retirement System (Calpers). Virginia and Florida have filed similar suits against Bank of New York Mellon.The actions can trace their roots back to 2003, when Calpers, the world’s largest pension fund, appointed currency risk specialist Record Currency Management to analyse foreign exchange transactions.A recent paper by Record, FX Transaction Costs – Plugging Leakage in Returns, says the extent to which custodian banks profit from foreign exchange activity seems excessive to most, especially when they fail to provide proper disclosure of actual profits. Record points to the absence of time-stamps on individual trades as an important factor in the broader equation.Record says its methodology gives a statistically significant indication of poor pricing, by comparing trades with the trading day’s highs and lows. In many cases, it argues, custodians’ execution by this measure exhibits a skew either towards the day’s low or outside the trading range.It adds that FX revenues for custodians are significantly greater than those of other banks (for the equivalent volume of trades), suggesting that for similar activities custodian banks are profiting excessively.If rates are significantly skewed towards the low, or well outside the range against the sponsor, this raises questions about the competence or integrity of the execution process, concludes Record.Record makes several suggestions to limit or eliminate such activity: the publication of time-stamps for each trade; a regular audit of FX execution; and execution of FX by an independent agent.One of several important points it fails to mention, according to some observers, is the fiduciary duty of the investment managers issuing the execution instructions, without which the custodians cannot act. A second is that its methodology can attract criticism for not comparing like with like. A third is that the key parties involved are supposedly sophisticated financial professionals; it ill behoves them to express widow- and orphan-like bemusement at high-level transactional practice, rather than acknowledge their own shortcomings.BNY Mellon defends itself vigorously against any suggestion of wrongdoing. It divides foreign exchange transactions into two classifications: negotiated and non-negotiated, the latter executed under its “standing instruction service”. The bank says that rates for larger value transactions ($1m-plus) in easy-to-execute currencies are negotiated directly with clients or their fund manager representatives.The standing instruction service offers access to wholesale rates for smaller amounts and hard-to-execute currencies (Michael Billy, managing partner at Econophy Capital Advisors, the Florida-based foreign exchange risk management specialist, says: “If a trade is being done at interbank rates you can get a very efficient rate at $100,000”).BNY Mellon argues that it publishes daily the proposed trading range for transactions that are not directly negotiated, and that clients have until 11am each day to opt out if they want to use another provider. It also says many clients opt for the standing instructions programme because it allows them to transfer the cost and risk of the trades to BNY Mellon. This additional benefit does not seem to be acknowledged in the Record methodology.State Street says it also continues vigorously to defend the allegations regarding its indirect FX services made in the civil proceedings commenced against it. “We offer clients and their investment managers a range of FX execution options and transparency as to our pricing methods,” it says. “We believe that our clients and their advisers choose indirect FX as an execution option when it represents the best mix of service and price to address their needs.”State Street attached a recent press clipping highlighting the fact that Calpers signed a three-year contract in July this year for State Street to handle all its custody work. Some might say this suggests its clients do, after all, agree with the bank – irrespective of the actions of the California attorney-general."
367;STT;State Street Corp;2012-03-26T17:48:59Z;Pretending the world is fixed is a gamble;;Greg Smith did Goldman Sachs a fair bit of damage. But he probably did the rest of Wall Street a big favour. When the previously unheard-of Goldman Sachs banker penned an opinion piece in the New York Times this month – publicly resigning and condemning his employer for a craven corporate culture – it became the main topic of conversation among bankers and anyone with a passing interest in finance for days.It also detracted from a less titillating news item – the publication the day before of the latest round of Federal Reserve stress tests on the country’s 19 big banking groups. On the face of it, the tests were a ringing endorsement of the repair work done on banks’ balance sheets since the financial crisis hit five years ago – 15 of the 19 passed the regulator’s tests even after factoring in planned dividend increases they have been itching to push through, at shareholders’ behest, for the past couple of years.The outcome was embarrassing for Citigroup, the one big-name group whose dividend plans were blocked because they fell short of the passmark – a 5 per cent core tier one capital ratio under the stress scenario. But with a few other footnotes, the tests sent a clear signal – the US banking system is back in rude health.Can we really be so sure? On the face of it the tests were tough. They included a sharp contraction of gross domestic product, unemployment peaking at over 13 per cent next year, US equity prices slumping 50 per cent and US house prices falling a further 20 per cent. The Fed’s stress testing has often been hailed by critics of Europe’s copycat exercises as a model of how things should be done – far tougher, far more credible and, when coupled with an injection of emergency state “Tarp” money a few years ago, a recipe for financial recovery.This time, with the heart of the financial crisis having shifted to Europe, it is risking complacency. Yes, the Fed modelled for an unspecified “growth slowdown” and a “very significant widening” of credit default swaps on both European sovereigns and financial institutions, as well as sharp increases in spreads on European sovereign bonds. But the Fed did not model for any sovereign default or for any of the economic doomsday scenarios that should arguably have been considered. The much criticised European Banking Authority – the pan-EU body in charge of Europe’s tests – took a tougher stance.To judge US banks to be over the worst because their domestic market seems to be recovering is to underestimate the transmission mechanisms – notably unmonitored derivatives exposures – by which global banks can be laid low.All the more reason for caution, then. Yet the US has stuck with a far lower pass mark for its stress tests than the EBA. The European regulator, much to the chagrin of the region’s banks, has demanded not only a 9 per cent core tier one pass mark but has also toughened the definition of capital according to so-called Basel 2.5 rules – a halfway house between Basel II, which the US has never implemented, and Basel III, which it is promising to.If the Fed had imposed a 9 per cent pass mark, even without a tougher definition of capital, only three of the 19 banks – American Express, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street – would have passed. Worst of all is the net result of the Fed’s green light. Within hours, the big banks had announced sweeping plans to return vast sums of money to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. JPMorgan alone announced it would buy back as much as $15bn of stock and raise its dividend by one-fifth. Wells Fargo increased its quarterly dividend by more than 80 per cent.US banks, understandably, feel hard done by, what with the restrictions of the Volcker rule, the complexities of the sprawling Dodd-Frank legislation and the imminent phase-in of Basel III. But all the more reason, surely, to build up capital buffers now and make an early and thorough transition to the realities of the new world. With the economic outlook in Europe – and globally – still so uncertain, it is too early to be eating into capital by distributing so much of it to investors.It is not a problem that many banks in Europe have to wrestle with. Many are generating losses, or such anaemic profits, that dividends have been suspended or shrunk to the minimum. Committed dividend payers, such as HSBC in the UK and Santander in Spain, are having to create fresh equity even as they make payouts to existing shareholders.It is an unpopular message for shareholders in the short term. But pretending that the world is fixed, and counting on profit accumulation to refill capital buffers over the next few years, is a gamble – either optimistic or reckless depending on how bleak your view.Patrick Jenkins is the FT’s Banking Editorpatrick.jenkins@ft.com
368;STT;State Street Corp;2012-03-25T06:39:48Z;Vanguard ETF assets surge to top $200bn;Vanguard could soon win 2nd place ranking despite being a relative latecomer;Assets held in Vanguard’s US exchange traded fund business reached the $200bn mark at the start of March and have since risen to $204bn, despite the Pennsylvania-based group being a relative latecomer to the ETF market.Vanguard remains the third-largest ETF player globally, well behind longer established rival iShares, which had assets of $670bn at the end of February. But it could soon overhaul State Street Global Advisors, on $298bn.Vanguard did not launch its first ETF until 2001, in spite of its history as a pioneer of index investing in the 1970s. Bill McNabb, chief executive, said Vanguard was slow to recognise the importance of ETFs, initially viewing them as a potential threat to its indexing business rather than an opportunity.That attitude was influenced by John Bogle, Vanguard’s founder, who remains unenthusiastic about ETFs, criticising them for encouraging investors to trade frequently, rather than following a “buy and hold” strategy.Mr McNabb said Vanguard’s attitude changed once the US adviser market started to shift from a commission-based sales model to one based on fees for advice.“That was when we began to realise that ETFs could be phenomenally helpful fundamental holdings for advisers as they started to build low-cost, highly diversified portfolios for their clients.”ETFs have become increasingly important to Vanguard, accounting for 45.2 per cent of net inflows in 2011, up from 28.4 per cent in 2009.The group has led the race among ETF providers for US investors’ cash for the past two years, gathering inflows of $35.8bn in 2011 and $40.5bn in 2010, according to the ETF Industry Association.Over the past two years, Vanguard has taken almost a third of inflows into US ETFs while a quarter has gone to iShares and 15.3 per cent to SSgA.That strong performance has continued in 2012 with Vanguard’s US ETFs gathering $12.5bn in the first two months of the year, an 86.6 per cent rise on the same period of 2011.Mr McNabb said ETFs would become “a global phenomenon” as more countries moved away from commission-based sales. However Vanguard’s focus remained on providing low-cost investing in all its forms.“Over the last decade, being a low cost provider has been very beneficial, particularly given how weak returns from equities were. If you think about how returns might look over the next decade, costs are going to matter even more to investors,” he said.Many investors tended to “shrug their shoulders” about Vanguard’s low cost message in the 1980s when equity markets were posting strong annual gains but Mr McNabb said a return to that environment looked unlikely.Mr McNabb said Vanguard had been able to establish a high level of trust among US investors and he aimed to build that same rapport in in the UK, Europe or Canda where the company is less well known.“You have to have patience and discipline, to keep telling the story. Eventually we think that the right answer wins out”.
369;STT;State Street Corp;2012-03-25T06:37:08Z;Demand for mobile data growing fast;Pictet is just the latest fund manager to provide information on a mobile app;Pictet has rolled out an iPad app for investors, joining a host of other asset managers that have responded to growing demand for fund data on-the-go.The Pictet app, which is free to download from the online Apple app store, is available in seven languages, including Dutch and Chinese.According to the Swiss-based asset manager, users of the app can choose to view key fund information, such as prices, performance and risk data, while also monitoring portfolio exposures and consulting interactive charts using their mobile device. Short investment videos can also be accessed on the new application.Pictet’s launch comes after several other fund houses already made the leap into services designed to cater for the growing use of mobile devices among investors.Legg Mason last year launched an app designed for use on the iPhone, BlackBerry and Google’s Android devices. The Legg Mason app, targeted at intermediaries, provides users with regular market updates, links to latest market commentary, fund prices, videos and webcasts. The group is due to launch an app designed for use with the iPad next month.Mike Evans, head of international marketing at Legg Mason, says digital technology is now “a key part” of how the firm engages with its clients. “Part of what we are seeing is a change in behaviour and how clients consume information,” says Mr Evans.According to statistics from Kurtosys, a financial services communications firm, smartphone usage grew by 70 per cent in 2010, with 23 per cent of all time spent online being via a mobile phone.Mr Evans says there has been a particularly strong demand for Legg Mason’s fund prices via its iPhone app.“A high proportion of client hits go towards fund prices provided on our website. But the take-up of mobile is growing quickly,” says Mr Evans.Other fund management groups to have launched iPhone or iPad apps include Baring Asset Management and Fidelity, while in the US, Pimco and Vanguard have rolled out services specifically for mobile devices.JPMorgan Asset Management rolled out an iPad app to cover its European-domiciled fund range in September last year. The app, which allows investors to access historical prices, interactive factsheets, performance charts, market and investment insights and videos, is available for both the iPad and iPhone and can be used in six languages.However, it is not just asset managers that are responding to a growing demand for data delivered via mobile devices. Fund administrators and custodians are also getting involved in the scramble to launch apps.State Street’s US business launched an app called State Street Springboard last autumn. The app enables fund managers and other institutional investors to view their entire investment portfolio at a glance, including risk-exposure analysis, net asset value summaries and fund flows.In January, BNY Mellon launched an app for its institutional clients that allows access to performance and risk analytics services via an iPad. Clients can also view data such as portfolio and benchmark information, including daily and historical returns.Others are building on their existing applications. Nordea last month rolled out a series of new applications targeted at iPad and smartphone users, some 12 months after its first iPhone app was launched.The updated apps allow investors to access fund prices and fund charts, as well as calculate the return of their Nordea funds since they were purchased. Quarterly reports, fact sheets, fund manager interviews and key investor information documents are also available via the updated apps.Legg Mason’s Mr Evans expects the uptake of mobile technology among asset managers to continue. “There is a big emphasis on digital and how we can better use it to engage with clients,” says Mr Evans.“However, a lot will depend on the different companies and what they feel is right for them. There are certain applications that live better on a website, while others work better through mobile technology.”David Ricketts is senior reporter at Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared

371;STT;State Street Corp;2012-03-23T10:49:21Z;Short-selling ban was ‘a game-changer’;The short-selling ban changed investors’ perception of securities lending;In an attempt to rein in what they saw as speculative attacks on their banks, several European countries including Spain, France and Italy late last year adopted bans on short selling of their banks.It is hard to say whether the bans, which were lifted last month, contributed to the improvement in fortunes for European Union banks – credit would also have to be given to the European Central Banks’ refunding operation, plus a general pick-up in risk appetite.But one thing is certain: it made securities lending even more complicated.It came during what has already been a turbulent period for prime brokers’ business of locating securities and lending them to “short sellers”, who seek to sell and then repurchase the borrowed stocks or bonds to repay the loan.Annual volumes have been down from about $4.5tn before the financial crisis to some $2.5tn at the end of last year, according to BNY Mellon, thanks to low interest rates and little M&A volume.Low rates make it difficult for lenders to earn a spread, and without mergers to arbitrage, short-selling activity withers.In addition, the financial crisis has seen the model of securities lending changing. Rather than using cash as collateral, which could be invested in illiquid securities and create liquidity crunches during times of stress, other securities are now being used as a way to reduce that risk.This new model, more widely used in Europe, has put further strain on what is already a shortage of quality collateral, with US Treasuries already trading at a premium, and additional collateral being used to trade swaps as part of a G20 initiative to have more derivatives trades centrally cleared.The short-selling ban on European banks only crimped demand further, bankers and traders say, and reduced the number of participants in the market.It also added complexity to the job of prime brokers who arrange loans between agents, such as State Street and BNY Mellon, which have vast warehouses of shares to loan, and clients such as active mutual funds and hedge funds.As the ban was not applied to all countries, it meant there needed to be procedures to prevent share borrowers in one country from selling them short in another.“There is no uniform system whereby a short seller must identify themselves. If I am in France but sell it through my German broker, they can sell it as a normal order,” says Georges Ugeux, chairman of Galileo Global Advisors, a boutique banking adviser. “That is why these bans are not effective.”In one respect, bankers say the transition was simple: there was no short selling, in cash or synthetic form, of the affected stocks.“As long as the processes are there, and the traders are trained in compliance, I wouldn’t say it’s more complicated. It’s totally manageable,” says Loic Lebrun, EMEA head of equity finance & delta one at HSBC.However, there were knock-on effects. There were fewer stocks committed to lending programmes by asset management firms, who feared running foul of the rules, as well as less demand for lending services by hedge funds.According to a survey by Greenwich Associates, hedge funds with at least $1bn in assets reduced the average number of prime brokers they use, as a result of the declining need to borrow, from 3.7 to 3.3 last year.The impact was also seen in the cost to trade bank shares. The fees to lend increased, to reflect the scarcity of available supply. But broader market liquidity also was affected. Bid-ask spreads on shares in the Euro Stoxx bank index have been nearly double that of their US counterparts in the S&P 500 for the past three months, according to Deutsche Bank figures.“It has been a game changer,” says Andrew Jamieson, head of EMEA equity finance at JPMorgan Chase. “Whereas previously for mature, established markets, regulatory changes were done on a consultative basis, these happened overnight. That had an impact both with regards to retroactive changes to insure we were compliant, and for changing strategies from an investor standpoint from that moment hence,” he says.Efforts are under way to streamline European rules on short-sale bans.The European Securities and Markets Authority, the pan-European regulatory watchdog, is engaged in a consultation on technical standards for short selling across countries.It faces a deadline at the end of this month for the creation of final rules, but does not appear to be close to having a system ready to go.There is also the potential financial transactions tax under consideration in France and other countries, which could effectively “double tax” short selling by taxing the loan and the short-sale.Securities lending has, further, been criticised as part of the “shadow banking” system by a report from the Bank of England and the UK’s Financial Services Authority.In the near term, Esma’s new rules are likely to establish different rules for securities deemed liquid and those considered illiquid. For illiquid shares, the owner of the shares to be lent out will be required to place a hold on them.Eventually, that will not be a barrier to trading, once banks agree on protocols for how to manage such a process.But it will require additional investment in systems to track whether the holds are in place, and could slow securities lending, particularly in Europe, for the foreseeable future.
372;STT;State Street Corp;2012-03-20T18:43:31Z;High yield ETF competition heating up;State Street in competition with Source and Pimco;Exchange traded funds that can provide an income stream from dividends or high yield bonds have been a big hit with investors in the current low interest rate environment.This has led to growing competition between ETF providers to launch new products that tap into this theme.State Street Global Advisors and Source have just launched rival short-duration high yield corporate bond ETFs that offer yields of more than 8 per cent, with both providers looking to refine the success of earlier product launches.Source has once again teamed up with Pimco for the launch of its short-term high yield corporate bond ETF, known by its ticker STHY and based on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 0-5 year US high yield constrained index.The US sister product to STHY, known as HYS, has attracted inflows of around $201m since it was launched in June of 2011.Vineer Bhansali, managing director at Pimco, said over the past 15 years the shorter-dated high yield corporate bond sector had delivered similar yields, lower volatility and a lower correlation to equities than longer-dated high yield corporate bonds.STHY is the first ETF in Europe to provide physical exposure to the short end of the high yield corporate bond sector.The underlying index contains a broad range of both issuers and securities (821) and the objective is to use Pimco’s experience to ensure that the ETF tracks its benchmark efficiently while also reducing transaction costs.This is a direct effort to counter one of the drawbacks of some other high yield ETFs that are subject to high rates of portfolio turnover as their managers usually try to maintain a constant maturity profile. This churning of the portfolio leads to higher transactions costs and shows up in higher tracking errors.Another issue affecting the performance of high yield ETFs has been the necessity for a passive ETF manager to hold the constituents of an index even though there might be a threat of an issuer going bankrupt. Active managers argue they can avoid this threat and emphasise this as an important attraction for active management strategies over passive ones in high yield.Pimco’s anwer to this is an internal ratings system for evaluating high yield bonds, more easily described as a “traffic light” system thath signals red, amber or green to potential constituents for the ETF. The aim of the traffic light system is to avoid exposure to illiquid bonds or to those issuers that might go bankrupt.Ted Hood, chief executive of Source, said: “Investors told us they were looking for opportunities to invest in high yield but they wanted a ‘smarter’ ETF to deliver access to the short maturity sector while at the same time aiming to deliver efficient tracking and improved portfolio management. STHY is designed to do just this.”The new offering in this space from State Street Global Advisors is the SPDR Barclays Capital short term high yield bond ETF, known by its ticker SJNK.This newly launched ETF is complementary to an existing SSgA product known as JNK, one of the first in the high yield space. JNK has attracted inflows of $2.6bn in the first two months of 2012, almost matching the $2.8bn which it gathered over the whole of last year.The underlying index to SJNK is the Barclays Capital US high yield 350m cash pay 0-5 year 2 per cent capped index.A notable point for both of the underyling indices of SJNK and STHY is that the maturity starts at zero, which means they can include new issues. This is again part of an effort by ETF providers to grab back an advantage previously open to active managers, who were able to buy new high yield bond issues at favourable prices relative to existing bonds. This meant active managers could obtain bonds at lower cost than passive managers who had to wait until the issue was included in the index. By extending the maturity of the index back to zero, ETF providers are attempting to negate that advantage previously enjoyed by active managers.SJNK carries an annual expense ratio of 40 basis points while STHY is slightly more expenseive with an annual charge of 55bps.

374;STT;State Street Corp;2012-03-16T18:09:16Z;Yields high enough to make you a convert;Convertibles offer upside potential and steady income;Mention convertibles to most investors and they’d think you were talking about soft-top cars. But in the US, the reaction would be very different.Investors would immediately recognise them as stocks offering chunky upside potential (in terms of capital gain), as well as a small but steady income.UK investors might become a lot more interested if they knew that convertibles – fixed-income securities that give you the option to convert them into shares at a predetermined price– tend to give a higher yield than equities and a better risk-adjusted return. That’s because you share in most of the same uplift as ordinary shares, but without the same level of risk.Also, in the UK, it is easy to access them through the investment trust sector. Over the past year, about £130m-worth of new stocks was issued, according to Simon Elliot, head of research at Winterflood. More new issues are on their way in coming weeks.Hugh Young’s Aberdeen Asian Smaller Companies trust, for example, is gauging the market’s interest in convertible unsecured loan stock (CULS) with a fixed income of 3.25 per cent to 3.5 per cent plus the option to convert into the ordinary stock – the conversion period usually runs for four to six years, at a conversion rate a smidgen above the ordinary share price at the time of issue.One of the most successful issues last year was from another Aberdeen trust: Edinburgh Dragon. It placed £60m of CULS last year with a yield of 3.5 per cent and the right to convert into ordinaries until 2018.The US market in convertibles is huge! These bond/equity hybrids are a favourite form of funding for many small to medium-sized companies. You can check out a wonderfully erudite explanation of why, and how, they work at www.fincad.com/derivatives-resources/articles/pricing-convertible-bonds.aspx.US convertibles are also researched and bought by many mainstream fund managers here in the UK: Mirabaud, F&C, Aviva, M&G, RWC, and Jupiter all offer funds that focus largely or exclusively on global convertibles as an asset class.US ETF providers Powershares and State Street also offer US listed funds that track the largest convertibles issuers on the local market – the Powershares fund ticker is CVRT while the State Street SPDR fund ticker is CWB.Commodities fund City Natural Resources also issued CULS last year, worth about £40m, with a 3.5 per cent income yield plus the option to roll into ordinary shares through to 2018. In this case, the conversion price is 377p, which is a big premium to the ordinary shares’ net asset value of 320p a share.Other issuers from last year include Standard Life UK Smaller Companies, BlackRock Latin American, Cayenne and Electra, which offered a hefty 5 per cent yield.Some analysts, such as Iain Scouller at Oriel Securities have been critical of convertible issuance, arguing that existing shareholders lose out on these issues, and face dilution of their equity holdings – which is unnecessary when trusts borrow from a bank at not much more than 4 per cent.Fund managers counter that convertibles’ income payments aren’t expensive, and new issues help to widen the investor base. However, for investors, I think the only questions are these: will I get a sustainable high yield, or will I get the potential for substantial capital growth in the long term, plus a handy income in the meantime?An example of the former is Ecofin, a specialist utilities trust, which has a large slice of CULS paying out a nominal rate of 6 per cent through to 2016 – although that falls to just 5.5 per cent once you factor in the current price of 107p per 100p of CULS and the bid-offer spread.Also bear in mind that there’s no capital guarantee here – the loan stock is secured on the fund portfolio and ranks behind mainstream bank debt and corporate bonds. Nevertheless, CULS from the likes of Ecofin and SVG Capital have weathered stock market volatility better than their ordinary share equivalents – once the option becomes essentially worthless, the CULS effectively trade as debt instruments.If I had to rely on anyone to deliver sizeable capital gains in the next six years, my money would be on Standard Life’s Harry Nimmo, City’s Will Smith, and Aberdeen’s Hugh YoungAnd, examples of the latter could include new issuance from Aberdeen Asian Smaller Companies, Standard Life UK Smaller Companies and City Natural Resources.These last two are “best of breed” specialist funds operating in inherently risky sectors where the potential for capital uplift is huge. They give you a long-dated option on the ordinary share price – through to 2018 – plus a running yield of about 3 per cent a year at current prices. At present, though, both are deeply “out of the money” – that is, the convertible’s conversion price is well above the current share price. But if I had to rely on anyone to deliver sizeable capital gains in the next six years, my money would be on Standard Life’s Harry Nimmo, City’s Will Smith, and Aberdeen’s Hugh Young.adventurous@ft.com
375;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Never mind the quality, look at the weightings;Gap in performance between two dividend indices could be due to weighting;"Standard & Poor’s US “dividend aristocrats” equity index has a track record befitting its elitist moniker. So when State Street Global Advisors unveiled plans earlier this month to lord it over their peers by launching sister strategies in the UK and Europe investors had reason to take interest.However, as is so often the case in the investment industry, matters are not quite as straightforward as at first they might seem. Indeed, closer analysis of the rapidly expanding suite of similar products reveals tantalising hints that outperformance may be driven less by exposure to dividends and more by whether or not indices embrace market capitalisation weighting or equal-weighted portfolio construction.The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index consists of S&P 500 stocks that have increased their dividends year-on-year for a quarter of a century.Indxis, the index engineering division of Mergent, a provider of business and financial data, operates a similar US Broad Dividend Achievers Index that is tracked by funds operated by BlackRock and PowerShares.Yet the S&P Aristocrats index returned 25.1 per cent (in total return terms) in the five years to December 31, 2011 and 98.6 per cent in the 10 years to 2011.In sharp contrast, the Indxis equivalent made a loss of 4.3 per cent and a gain of 30.9 per cent respectively, undershooting the returns from the broad S&P 500 (-1.2 per cent and +33.4 per cent).This staggeringly wide differential could be partly explained by the fact the Indxis vehicle selects companies that have increased their payouts for 10 years running, rather than 25, but one might think that should be a relatively minor point, with many companies likely to appear in both indices.Perhaps more crucially, while the Indxis index weights its constituents by the traditional market cap approach, the S&P option opts to equally weight its holdings, a formula that has previously been shown to be capable of generating market-beating long-term performance.Intriguingly, S&P also operates a High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index that selects the 60 highest yielding stocks in the S&P Composite 1500 that have increased their payouts for 25 years. These 60 holdings are weighted by dividend yield, but with a proviso that no stock accounts for more than 4 per cent of the index.On the face of it, this would appear to be a sort of halfway house between the market cap and equal-weighted approaches. And indeed its track record sits somewhere between the two earlier approaches, with a total return of 7.9 per cent over five years and 82.1 per cent over 10 years.Not to be entirely outdone, Indxis also operates a Dividend Achievers Select index, which is used as the basis for a $12bn fund operated by Vanguard. This differs from its Broad index in that stocks deemed to have low potential for further dividend growth are screened out, as are those with “undesirable” tax structures.Crucially however, the Select index, while still based on market cap, limits each stock to a 5 per cent weighting.This nudges the index a little in the direction of equal weighting and, surprise, surprise, improves its performance; over five years it has returned 12.4 per cent (rather than -4.3) and over 10 years 44.6 per cent (against 30.9).The upshot is that UK and European investors licking their lips at the arrival of Dividend Aristocrats funds, with their tantalising promise of strong market-beating returns, may end up being a little disappointed.SSGA and its SPDR ETF platform have tinkered with the model that appears to work in the US market. Constituents will be selected on the basis of 10 years of rising dividends, not 25, and the resultant portfolio will be weighted by dividend yield*, rather than equally weighted.In other words, the UK and European Dividend Aristocrats ETFs arguably have more in common with Indxis’ Dividend Achievers index, with its less impressive track record.“The shorter period is because a lot of UK and European companies don’t have the same track record the way a lot of US corporations do,” says Eleanor Hope Bell, head of SSGA’s intermediary sales for the UK. “Most investors are looking at the income stream rather than the total return.”Not for the first time, the message to investors may be to look before they leap – there can be more to a financial product than meets the eye.*This article has been corrected since publication"

377;STT;State Street Corp;2012-03-08T19:02:43Z;Largest ETF providers in price war;;The three largest providers of US exchange-traded funds are aggressively slashing their management fees, fuelling a price war among asset managers for market share in the fast-growing investment business.BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, which collectively manage 84 per cent of the $1.2tn in assets in exchanged-traded products, have cut fees on 75 funds so far this year, while raising fees on just two, according to XTF, a data provider.Such products – traded as funds or notes – track the returns of a basket of underlying assets and are an increasingly important source of growth for the asset management industry. While mutual funds have struggled to win back investors since the financial crisis, assets under management in exchange-traded products have nearly doubled since 2007.“Price can be an important differentiator, especially for attracting new money and some sponsors are lowering expense ratios to be competitive,” said Ogden Hammond, a McKinsey consultant who specialises in ETFs. “Its natural for a maturing industry to become more competitive and for margins in some segments to be squeezed.”ETFs, which own the assets they track, account for most US exchange-traded products, with 1,142 listed on US exchanges at the end of February.There were also 290 exchange-traded notes, for which a fund operator contracts to match the returns on the tracked assets, without necessarily owning the underlying assets. At the end of February, US ETFs held $1.06tn in assets, or 88 per cent of all assets invested in exchange-traded products. The remaining $144bn was held in exchange-traded notes.Fees for the products have been on a downward trend for several years, as more sponsors launch funds, but this year’s price cuts have been striking. By comparison, there were only 94 fee cuts across the entire industry in 2011, according to XTF, and in 2010 there were two fee increases for every five cuts.Price competition among the big three managers is compounded because the most popular products tend to be passive trackers of major indices such as the S&P 500, meaning barriers to entry are relatively low.That has resulted in what industry insiders are calling the “Vanguard effect”, whereby the investor-owned fund manager, which operates at cost, has driven down prices for products tracking a specific index by charging lower fees than rivals.For example, Vanguard has cut fees on its ETF that tracks the MSCI Emerging Market index by more than a third since 2006 to 20 basis points. Over the same period, BlackRock cut fees on its fund tracking the same index by 8 points to 67 bps, but has been supplanted by Vanguard as the operator of the largest fund tracking the index.“Our competitors may call this a price war, but we are simply passing on economies of scale. If others follow suit, the result is cheaper products for investors,” said John Woerth, a spokesman for Vanguard.Mr Woerth insists Vanguard never prices funds below cost to attract market share and that it raises prices when assets under management fall, reducing economies of scale.Vanguard has made one price increase for every four cuts since the start of 2010, according to XTF. BlackRock, whose executives have publicly stated that the asset manager does not seek to compete on price, has cut fees five times more than it has raised them over the same period. State Street made eights time as many cuts as increases.The iShares ETF franchise, which is the market leader in terms of assets managed, accounted for at least 27 per cent of revenue at its owner BlackRock, in 2011. Analysts say iShares makes up an even larger share of BlackRock’s earnings.
378;STT;State Street Corp;2012-03-08T14:00:35Z;The rise of dividend-focused emerging market ETFs;UBS says dividend strategies will prove an enduring theme;The search for income in the current low interest rate environment has led to growing interest in dividend-focused emerging market exchange traded funds.ETFs linked to emerging markets generally have enjoyed a storming start to 2012 with inflows of $14.5bn in January and February combined, the largest ever for the first two months of a year, according to BlackRock. More than half of this year’s inflows have been grabbed by the two giants of the emerging markets ETF universe, Vanguard’s VWO and iShares EEM.However, the WisdomTree emerging markets equity income fund, known as DEM, has also proved a popular choice with investors. DEM has attracted inflows of $820m in 2012, making it the ninth fastest growing US ETF so far this year.DEM is the longest established product in the emerging markets dividend space. Launched in July 2007, it has accumulated assets of more than $3.3bn.Jeremy Schwartz, director of research at WisdomTree, says dividends are not usually the first attribute that comes to mind when considering an investment in emerging markets as most investors tend to focus on growth prospects as their motivation for making allocations.Mr Schwartz says many investors would probably be surprised to learn they would have earned more from dividends between 2008 and 2011 by investing in the MSCI emerging markets index than from the US stock market, while DEM did even better.For a $10,000 initial stake, an investor in DEM would have generated total dividends of $1,755 between 2008 and 2011, compared with $719 from the MSCI emerging markets index and $680.5 from the S&P 500, according to WisdomTree.At the end of last year, DEM was offering a dividend yield of 6.4 per cent, well above the 3 per cent yield on the MSCI emerging markets index and 2.2 per cent yield on the S&P 500.Mr Schwartz says it is clear that emerging markets are now an important hunting ground for investors looking for both dividend yield and potential dividend growth.Other ETF providers have noted the popularity of DEM and launched new products to tap into the rising interest in dividend focused plays in emerging markets. These products also appear to be gaining traction rapidly with investors.In February, BlackRock launched the iShares emerging markets dividend index fund, known as DVYE, almost exactly a year after State Street brought out the SPDR S&P emerging markets dividend ETF, known as EDIV.EDIV had accumulated assets of $310.4m at the end of February after attracting inflows of $284.2m since launch.State Street also listed its emerging markets dividend ETF in Europe in October 2011 and its assets have already reached $44.1m.Not to be outdone, BlackRock followed with the London launch in November of the iShares Dow Jones emerging markets select dividend ETF, known as SEDY, which has built assets of $21.6m.Nicholas Smithie, emerging market equity strategist at UBS, says there is still “substantial upside dividend potential” in emerging markets.Mr Smithie notes that corporate balance sheets in emerging markets are relatively underleveraged with a net debt to equity ratio of around 20 per cent, well below the range of 40 per cent to 60 per cent that UBS believes would be optimal.He argues that companies in emerging markets should releverage their balance sheets and increase their dividend pay-outs, as this should prevent their stock prices from de-rating relative to developed markets once growth in profitability starts to slow.Mr Smithie also says valuations (price earnings ratios) for high dividend stocks remain attractive and there are no signs yet to suggest a bubble is forming.“We have found no evidence that the dividend theme has been overplayed and looking ahead, we believe dividend strategies will prove an enduring theme in emerging markets.”
379;STT;State Street Corp;2012-03-06T18:46:28Z;US ETF flows maintain strong start to the year;‘Risk-on’ trades such as emerging markets ETFs provide the lead;The US exchange traded funds industry maintained its strong start to 2012 with net new inflows of $13.9bn in February as investors pursued “risk-on” trades in emerging markets, high-yield corporate bonds and oil ETFs.Deborah Fuhr of ETF Global Insight said the data showed investors using ETFs to gain access to markets as their risk appetite strengthened.For the first two months of 2012, inflows into US listed ETFs rose 165 per cent to $40.3bn, compared with $15.2bn in the same period a year ago, according to the ETF Industry Association.Vanguard topped the US leader board in February with net inflows of $5.6bn, nearly twice as high as those of its nearest rival BlackRock whose iShares business drew $2.9bn.Vanguard’s strong performance in February means that it has just nosed ahead of BlackRock in the race for investors’ cash so far this year. After two months, Vanguard has gathered $12.5bn while BlackRock’s iShares operations have attracted $12.4bn.Other providers have also made a fast start to the year with State Street Global Advisors grabbing a total of $5.1bn in new flows in January and February, hotly pursued by PowerShares which has taken $4.9bn. Wisdom Tree has attracted inflows of $1.6bn, helped by strong interest in its emerging markets equity income ETF, known as DEM.Emerging markets have again provided a focus for competition between Vanguard and BlackRock, as they did for much of last year, with their directly competing ETFs based on the MSCI emerging markets index.Vanguard’s VWO gathered inflows of $2.4bn in February, compared with $1.4bn for EEM, the direct rival product from iShares.Vanguard recently announced that it had reduced the expense ratio on VWO to 20 basis points from 22bps previously after strong growth in the fund’s assets last year. The iShares EEM fund charges 67bps.Fixed income ETFs that provide investors with higher income streams than government bonds were also prominent on the February leaderboard.The SPDR Barclays Capital high yield bond ETF, known as JNK, gathered inflows of $1.1bn while the Vanguard Barclays intermediate term corporate bond ETF, known as VCIT drew $553m.Two iShares products, HYG and LQD, which target high yield and investment grade corporate bonds attracted inflows of $947m and $816m respectively.But ETFs linked to broad US equity benchmarks saw big outflows in February after the S&P 500 reached its highest level since the start of 2008.SPY, the world’s largest ETF, registered withdrawals of $3.6bn while IVV, the rival iShares ETF which is also benchmarked to the S&P 500, saw $794m withdrawn.Another notable feature of the February flows was interest in ETFs linked to physical oil and energy stocks as crude oil prices moved higher due to rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.XLE, the SPDR energy sector ETF run by State Street, attracted inflows of $437m while DBO, the PowerShares oil ETF gathered $173m.USO, the United States oil fund which provides an exposure to oil futures, drew inflows of $268m while OIL, the iPath S&P GSCI crude oil ETN from Barclays Capital, gathered $101m.Total assets help in US ETFs (funds and products) reached $1,201.6bn at the end of February, a rise of 13.7 per cent so far this year.

381;STT;State Street Corp;2012-03-03T06:03:25Z;Spotlight shines on new stars in ETP universe;Passive investment is pouring into fixed income products;"If the popularity of the Pimco Total Return fund is anything to go by, assets in fixed income exchange traded products could be about to reach new highs.The launch last week of the ETF version of the world’s largest bond fund, run by Bill Gross, is one of this year’s big events in the US investment industry.The replica of the $250bn fund will bring a lot of attention to actively managed ETFs, which are still in their infancy, but will also probably draw comparison with the fast-growing fixed income ETP sector.It is a telling sign that fixed income ETPs recently overtook Mr Gross’s mutual fund blockbuster in terms of assets, after they grew 24.4 per cent last year to a total of $258bn, according to BlackRock.In January, inflows into fixed income ETPs continued, setting a new global monthly record with $9bn of net new assets. In the ETP universe, fixed income gained 3 percentage points of market share to 17 per cent of total assets last year, when the asset class also provided three of the 10 best-selling ETFs.These figures suggest that ETPs are settling in the fixed income landscape, albeit not in all geographies or asset categories. Last year’s expansion was driven by US products, with European fixed income ETFs suffering outflows due to the eurozone crisis and concerns over bank debt.With political headlines able to quickly influence markets, the ability to allocate funds tactically is one of fixed income ETFs’ main advantages, says Alex Claringbull, a senior portfolio manager at iShares.ETFs trade on exchanges continuously, and provide direct access to what happens in a given market.Mr Claringbull says: “Investors are less thinking active versus passive or funds versus bonds, but they ask: ‘Which fixed income asset exposure do I want?’“Once you decide which asset class you want to invest in, then the choice of instruments is quite straightforward. You can buy a corporate bond but you need a view on the company, you can also buy a fund, but then you need a view on the fund manager, or you can access directly with an ETF.”Eleanor Hope-Bell, head of State Street Global Advisors’ intermediary sales for the UK, says ETFs’ ability to play fixed income characteristics such as duration or credit has led to their growing use by US fund managers.In Europe, the market has been slower to take off, which she attributes to structural inefficiencies.ETF flows are meagre in liquid fixed income asset categories such as government bonds, but the passive products are seeing steady inflows in categories where it is difficult to own assets directly, such as in high yield. iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate bond fund was the most popular fixed income ETF last year with $3.5bn of net new money.Nizam Hamid, deputy head of Lyxor ETFs, says: “[Fixed income ETFs] are marginal in terms of the core portfolio, but if we want to add an element of credit, triple-A, or a German government call, it may be easier to access them with ETFs.“Those exposures are far easier to manage in ETFs essentially because of the lack of transparency in the underlying market. “Not everybody agrees, however, that ETFs are the right tools to get exposure to fixed income. Aymeric Poizot, managing director in Fitch’s fund and asset manager ratings group, says: “Liquidity in high yield is difficult to replicate in the world of ETFs, while picking the right bonds is a management skill.“There is a logic from investors that they should not venture into this space.”Noël Amenc, director of Edhec-Risk Institute, says there are big problems with transparency, especially as fixed income issuance mostly takes place over the counter and investors have no visibility on the construction of the ETFs.“We don’t know where prices come from,” Mr Amenc says.Mr Hamid admits underlying liquidity remains a question for ETF providers, but says that an overlay is added to ensure the products are easily tradable.He says: “We discuss [liquidity] with the index provider. Clients realise that a broad benchmark cannot be broadly
investible. They want a benchmark that they can track.”Tim Gardener, global head of consultant relations at Axa Investment Managers, adds that an issue with fixed income ETFs is that they are mostly based on capitalisation weighted indexes.They are not an “intelligent way” of diversifying a basket of bonds, as “they pile into companies that are the most indebted”, he says."
382;STT;State Street Corp;2012-03-02T18:18:19Z;Evangelist rises to the challenge on fees;SCM launches a new ETF with low fees;Alan Miller is not exactly a shrinking violet. He’s a highly articulate investment manager whose various campaigns are frequently reported in this newspaper. What fascinates many journalists is the fact that Miller is an evangelist who has seen the light. A former investment trust manager and then a major player at New Star, he underwent a seemingly Damascene conversion to found SCM Private, in 2009 – a firm that abjures all the evils of traditional fund management.He has lambasted the mainstream fund industry for its excessive charges and puny returns, reserving his most withering attacks for the Absolute Return and Multi-Manager sectors. He quite rightly reminds investors that the average total expense ratio (TER) of funds in these sectors is 2.5 per cent – and stresses that this doesn’t include the cost of trading, platform charges and other assorted deductions.It’s good campaigning stuff, though a tad academic for most investors, who might be asking: what’s the alternative? Until now, SCM has focused its attentions on wealthy investors, leaving one alternative – the multi-asset passive portfolio – to small firms such as TCF, and big managers such as Vanguard and HSBC.But SCM has finally risen to the challenge and launched a new exchange traded fund (ETF) in conjunction with Deutsche Bank’s db-x tracker division. This Absolute Return Portfolio ETF will track an index complied by SCM, using a wide range of underlying synthetic index trackers from the German investment bank. Unlike some of SCM’s earlier funds, there will be no performance fee, with the total cost of fund management set at 0.89 per cent a year.Just a week after I wrote about the attractions of low/minimum volatility indices for emerging markets, specialist European ETF provider Ossiam announced it would launch one on the London market. Watch this space for more details.Meanwhile, State Street, another ETF provider, has been busy developing new dividend-oriented indices, comprising only stocks that have progressively increased their pay-outs over the past five to ten years. These additions to its SPDR range include a UK dividend tracker (ISIN IE00B6S2Z822). I think it’s a great, cheap alternative to a conventional equity income fund and one that I’m thinking of including in my own portfolios.For the latest market indicators, covering equities and other asset classes, remember to check the March update of my Investor Dashboard.This is roughly what HSBC charges, slightly more than the fees levied by less actively managed funds from TCF, and a lot more than the charges on the Vanguard portfolios – which are more ”passive” in approach.However, the big pitch from SCM is that its fund is a genuine absolute return fund that will switch between a very broad range of asset classes, based on value considerations.Currently, the index is overweight in corporate and emerging markets bonds, which now comprise just under 30 per cent of the index, and significantly underweight in inflation-based securities and currencies – cash and short-term bonds make up 7 per cent.Crucially, Miller has wrapped this active juggling of asset classes into an easily accessible ETF that is very cheap when compared with conventional absolute returns funds.So should mainstream investors think about using this fund as a core portfolio holding? Absolutely, although I would also be tempted to look at the competition. Those multi-asset passive portfolios from Vanguard, TCF and HSBC involve much less active management. Miller also warns of the risks of betting on active stockpickers, but his fund involves a similar risk: betting on a manager who’s deciding which asset class to bet on next.Miller, to be fair, has a decent record, but track records are like sand in the wind. Another Miller, this time called Ben and working for Legg Mason, also had a great investment record for many years, until it all went to pieces.If you do want to rely on the skills of a long-term asset allocator, a slightly more conventional bet might be a certain Mr Ruffer and his eponymous investment company. This is a listed vehicle with a TER of 1.51per cent – a good 60 basis points above that of the SCM fund – and a share price that currently stands at a premium of 4 per cent to its net asset value. But its returns to shareholders have been good.There are other actively managed tracker portfolios whose managers take a view on allocations to broad asset classes. Parkstone has an exchange traded note available on the Société Générale platform, with an annual management charge of 0.95 per cent.SCM’s offering is a more mainstream ETF, but prospective investors need to remember that it uses synthetic replication to track indices, ie swap contracts with a counterparty bank – not the physical replication of index holdings used by Vanguard and HSBC. Personally, I have no issue with this approach, but less adventurous investors will need to be comfortable with a synthetic product that is collateral backed.adventurous@ft.com
383;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
384;STT;State Street Corp;2012-02-26T16:36:24Z;Pimco active ETF launch seen as potential ‘game-changer’;;Pimco will launch an active exchange traded fund based on the asset manager’s flagship Total Return Fund on Thursday, a move that will be closely watched by a mutual fund industry keen to gauge the threat posed by such products.The ETF, which must publish its holdings daily, will also give bond investors a window into the thinking of Bill Gross, manager of the $250bn fund since 1987 and long considered a guru in fixed income markets. He struggled last year as a gamble on rising interest rates went awry, and has since reversed course and backed bond yields to remain low.“Pimco total return is a game-changer,” said Robert Goldsborough, an ETF analyst at Morningstar, the fund tracker. Most of the large asset managers have registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to market some form of active ETF, but Bill Gross is the first well-known manager to use the product.However, customer desire for such ETFs is far from clear. “There is a lot of fever on the supply side, but I don’t think that anyone has checked to see if there is demand,” said Ben Phillips of Casey Quirk, a consultant to asset managers. Pimco declined to comment.Passive ETFs have grown to $1.2tn under management in the US because they are a cost effective way to gain exposure to a market and are tax efficient. Institutional clients such as pension funds already pay low fees for active management, so new active ETFs are aimed at retail clients who trade through their own brokerage account, rather than paying commissions to investment advisers to help pick funds.But an active ETF presents challenges. “Asset managers that have successful equity funds do not want to distribute their funds as active ETFs,” said Craig Siegenthaler, analyst for Credit Suisse. “[They] would rather have stable allocations from institutions, rather than short-term, volatile sources from ETF distribution.”The requirement to reveal holdings daily also makes it very hard for a fund manager to move in and out of a security without alerting the market. There are 38 active ETFs in the US managing under $5bn, according to Morningstar.However, the industry is also wary of being left behind. State Street, BlackRock and Vanguard are now so large in the passive ETF market that the barriers to entry are substantial.The Total Return Fund may be better suited to an active ETF, as it invests in very liquid bond markets. “Active ETFs may have some application when it is less about a basket of stocks but more about a macroeconomic view or an investment philosophy encapsulated into a product,” said Mr Phillips. Such ETFs would allow investors to bet for or against a particular view on a currency, inflation or an economy’s prospects, for instance.
385;STT;State Street Corp;2012-02-26T06:15:28Z;Growth surge ‘will lure fund industry to Latin America’;Institutional assets in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru stand at $2.2tn and are projected to double in the next five years;Rapid growth in institutional assets across Latin America’s five big markets will encourage more global asset managers and financial service providers to establish and expand their operations in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru, says State Street, the US custody bank.Booming commodity prices have boosted economic growth and capital inflows across these five economies. This has helped create large concentrated asset pools in central banks, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and mutual funds.Assets in these institutions stand at $2.2tn and are projected to double over the next five years with a compound annual growth rate of 15 per cent.State Street says rising wealth means large institutions, asset owners and central banks in the region are looking for insights into running investment operations, creating opportunities for global service providers and international asset managers. Latin America’s sovereign wealth funds are also predicted to need management and servicing expertise from international companies as they expand their asset base and start to participate in regional infrastructure development.State Street says Latin American investors are leapfrogging to more sophisticated investment vehicles, just as consumers had rapidly adopted smartphones, skipping several generations of technology.This is reflected in a growing appetite for exchange traded funds and alternative investments such as private equity, as well as robust but uneven growth for the mutual funds industry regionally.Regulatory reforms allowing greater freedom to invest overseas are gradually being introduced in these countries. After recent regulatory changes, Brazil’s mutual fund industry, the world’s sixth-largest, with assets of $1.1tn, has the potential to send significant funds offshore if domestic interest rates fall and managers look for better returns internationally.Brazil’s voluntary pension system is currently dominated by bank-owned insurers but State Street says continued asset growth would create more room for offshore management expertise.It also predicted further expansion for Brazil’s ETF market, which has structural similarities to the US.State Street highlights Chile as the most welcoming to offshore financial service providers. The limit on cross-border investments by Chile’s pension funds is scheduled to rise from 60 to 80 per cent of assets.In Colombia, rules now allow for cross-border mutual funds and changes to pension fund rules are expected to lead to international allocations for the country’s voluntary pension system to rise to about 30 per cent by 2015, from 17 per cent today.State Street says international players should also watch Mexico carefully for new opportunities, even if it appeared uninviting at first glance. It noted that corporate pension schemes in Mexico are increasing their offshore allocations for diversification purposes.
386;STT;State Street Corp;2012-02-19T03:44:50Z;‘Drastic’ asset moves by central banks;Central banks are eyeing up corporate bond market, says SSgA;Central banks have made “drastic” changes to their asset allocation and are eyeing up the corporate bond market, according to State Street Global Advisors.SSgA, which has 25 central bank clients and is in regular dialogue with 50 more, said central banks had “dramatically” reduced their demand for bank commercial paper and certificates of deposit, and had cut back on time deposits, in a bid to cap their exposure to the banking sector.The asset manager also saw reduced appetite for second-tier sovereign debt, helping drive yields for US, UK, German and Japanese debt to very low levels.“Some central banks have all but abandoned holdings of any eurozone government bonds, except those issued by Germany, France and the Netherlands,” said John Nugée, senior managing director in SSgA’s official institutions group.Instead, central banks were moving into new asset classes, such as emerging market sovereign bonds, covered bonds and “top tier” corporate bonds, although any wholesale switch into the latter is being held up by a lack of in-house skills.Central banks have also become net buyers of gold once again, said Mr Nugée, who said the overall portfolio shake-up was the most radical since the 1980s.
387;STT;State Street Corp;2012-02-17T13:51:46Z;Fund management: the lure of Lat Am;;"Are you a fund manager looking for new business opportunities? Perhaps it’s time to look to Latin America.State Street, a Boston-based fund manager and service provider, has identified the region as “a strategic marketplace for money management”. Recent expansion of pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and mutual funds makes it make it “particularly attractive to asset managers looking to sell products or for places to invest, as well as for financial service providers”.So where should overseas professionals pitch their tents? State Street breezily talks of the region’s five “major” economies as being Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru – possibly putting a few noses out of joint in Argentina and elsewhere. But in terms of opportunities for fund management, few would question that choice. State Street estimates that central bank reserves, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and mutual funds in the five countries add up to $2.2tr – with projected annual growth of 10 per cent to 15 per cent over the coming five years.Take the pension fund industry. While Brazil has lagged in terms of reform – much of the industry is still in closed sponsored funds, with the biggest run by public sector companies – the other four, with Chile in the lead, have developed thriving industries expected to go on growing, as this chart shows:State Street writes:Spurred by mandatory participation and a large working-age population, the pension fund systems of the major five have seen rapid asset growth. The privatized pension systems of Chile, Colombia, Peru and Mexico account for some $400 billion in assets today, of which approximately $120 billion are cross-border.That opens opportunities for managers who can advise, for example, on investment outside the region.While high exposure to local equities helped some Latin American pension funds rebound from the recent financial crisis, allocations for overseas investment are now climbing due to the limited capacity for domestic investments in these markets. However, room for growth in international investment allocations remains as the average overseas allocation is only 27 percent across all Latin American private pension fund managers.Nor should Brazil be ignored. Its corporate pension fund market “is by far the largest in the region, with more than $440bn in assets, including open and closed vehicles” says State Street, although the country’s high interest rates and deep local markets – as well as regulation – mean fund managers have less incentive to look overseas.Opportunities should develop, however, in Brazil’s growing voluntary pensions market which, says State Street, remains dominated by insurers owned by local banks but may expand to make room for offshore management expertise.Turn to mutual funds, however, and Brazil snaps into focus. State Street estimates that assets under management amount to $1.1tr – half the five countries’ total assets.It is also evolving. Recent regulatory changes, for example, set the overseas investment cap at 100 percent for multimarket/hedge funds with qualifi ed investors, 20 percent for other multimarket funds and 10 percent for other mutual funds. This sizable market has the potential to shift offshore quickly should market conditions warrant it.The ETF (exchange traded fund) market is especially attractive from a distributor’s perspective, says State Street, because of structural similarities with the US including sophisticated, segmented distribution channels and a high level of institutional and retail interest. But “the Brazilian market is highly regulated, open only to locally domiciled and manufactured ETFs that invest solely in local stocks.” ETF distributors must have a local presence approved by regulators.Other markets are already more open to offshore financial service providers. State Street finds Chile to be the most welcoming, with mutual fund and pension fund industries that invest overseas. Colombia and, to a lesser extent, Peru have followed a similar pattern.Mexico looks uninviting at first glance, says State Street. Big banks dominate, leaving little space for niche operators, while in the mutual fund and ETF businesses, regulatory and tax rules work at cross purposes. Registration of cross-border funds on the Mexico Stock Exchange is prohibited.But service providers should stay tuned.Regulatory shifts now under way at Mexico’s pensions fund regulator suggest a recognition that future growth will depend on diversified investment strategies as well as more flexible investment strategies.The bottom line? The region offers great opportunities but to exploit them requires a lot of hard work. The biggest markets are the toughest to get into – Brazil and Mexico are both dominated by big local players and have complex, fast-changing and at times contradictory regulation. That means professionals must be prepared to put in the time studying markets in depth. A challenge that holds out rich rewards.Related reading:

388;STT;State Street Corp;2012-02-15T20:13:29Z;State Street plans OTC derivatives platform;;State Street, the investment management and custody company, plans to challenge Wall Street banks involved with derivatives trading with the launch of an electronic trading platform for over-the-counter swaps.The move is a sign that the market for OTC derivatives is set to be contested by “buyside” institutions not hitherto associated with such markets.Sweeping G20 reforms such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US require that swaths of OTC derivatives be traded on exchanges or other electronic trading platforms, known as “swap execution facilities”.SEFs are expected to be launched by banks and operators of existing electronic trading platforms, such as Tradeweb – in which large banks are shareholders – and MarketAxess, listed on Nasdaq.State Street in September said it planned to set up a swaps clearing platform, on top of existing services in custody and accounting, collateral management, valuation and risk and analytics for derivatives.The company plans to launch an SEF, known as SwapEx, and will apply to US regulators for approval once the rules defining how SEFs operate are clarified in coming months.Charley Cooper, senior managing director at State Street Global Markets, said: “If you look at the clearing piece, the core competencies that are required – payments, compliance and risk management – are the very things that we do as a custodial bank for our clients.“It became very clear to us that this offered us an opportunity to trade in the [OTC] derivatives market, and to do so in direct competition with the sellside, and we’re very excited about that.”State Street will use the same trading technology for the SEF as on its Currenex, FX Connect and GovEx electronic trading platforms for FX and bonds. It is also used by Eris Exchange, a Chicago-based interest rate swaps platform.State Street believes it will be able to compete by offering a complete set of services beyond purely execution of OTC derivatives.The company said SwapEx would provide “the first step in a global end-to-end solution that reduces operational risk through the automation of the many stages of derivatives processing, including execution, clearing, collateral management, cash and securities flows between the middle and back offices, transaction cost and risk reporting, valuations, and the reconciliation of positions”.J.R. Lowry, senior vice-president of State Street Global Services – part of State Street that provides investment managers with custody, accounting and fund administration services – said: “We have no strong competitors that can provide the entire package.”The move comes amid uncertainty about the final rules for implementing Dodd-Frank, including how SEFs will operate.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission, which are producing the rules, have fallen behind the original timetable for such implementation.While that has prompted a “wait-and-see” attitude among many market participants, larger businesses with strong balance sheets are pressing ahead with investments in key market infrastructures – such as SEFs and clearing services – in the belief that they need to be among the first to offer such services once the rules are finalised.Mr Cooper said: “Our belief was that even if it took longer than the regulators had initially intended for the final rules to be implemented, it was important that we be seen as committed to this space early on, and dedicated to offering a buyside alternative.“We had the choice of sitting back and waiting until things were finalised and potentially losing market share or playing a role with the marketplace and the regulators in terms of defining how these platforms would work,” he said.The planned SEF will offer traders a choice of how to execute a trade, including a “central limit order book”, a “request for quote”, “indications of interest”, and auctions.Mr Cooper said: “We wanted to build a number of execution styles that our clients have been demanding now rather than waiting to see what would be mandated. It is better for us to have it built them and be able to offer them as part of the package rather than wait and find out that certain [trading] styles would be allowed and we hadn’t built them yet. It helps with a ‘first mover advantage’.”

The fund aims to deliver a bond-like income stream with lower volatility than the wider equity markets.● Prism Capital Management is instead targeting a stable yield of 4-5 per cent, with capital growth at least in line with inflation, from its IFDS Prism Distribution Fund. The multi-manager, multi-asset class fund will combine active and passive investment and be managed by Octopus Investments.● Income-seekers may also be interested in the SPDR Barclays Capital Euro High Yield Bond exchange traded fund, State Street Global Advisors’ latest listing on the London Stock Exchange. The launch takes the European SPDR ETF range into a new segment of the European fixed income market, one that is currently yielding more than twice as much as investment grade European corporate bonds.● Heartwood Investment Management has unveiled the CF Heartwood Defensive Multi Asset Fund, the sixth offering in its range of cautious and balanced vehicles. It is structured as a non-Ucits retail scheme, allowing for greater investment flexibility than for a Ucits fund.● Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management is unveiling a Euro Convictions fund. The concentrated 30-50 stock fund will comprise Rothschild’s strong conviction picks from across its existing range of eurozone equity funds.● CQS has soft closed its ABS Alpha Fund, launched on February 1 with $140m to invest in asset-backed securities, and with a further $60m committed. Further inflows will be “contingent on market opportunity”.● JPMorgan and Source have combined forces to unveil the JPMorgan Macro Hedge US TR Source ETF, which aims to provide long-term exposure to volatility, either long or short depending on market conditions, via a systematic strategy developed by the US bank.
390;STT;State Street Corp;2012-02-10T18:34:31Z;ETF price war intensifies with new launches;iShares locks sights on rapidly growing rivals;A fresh round of price wars among exchange traded fund providers has broken out with fees for some of the fastest growing ETFs being undercut by new product launches from iShares.Product developers at BlackRock’s iShares, the world’s largest ETF provider, have already rolled out 19 new ETFs so far this year. Several have been priced extremely competitively against successful products managed by rivals.The Market Vectors agribusiness ETF managed by Van Eck Global and known as MOO attracted inflows of $3.8bn, making it the sixth fastest growing US listed ETF in 2011. MOO carries a total expense ratio of 56 basis points, but it has been undercut by iShares’ new MSCI global agriculture producers fund, known as VEGI, which charges just 39bps. A glance at the top holdings of both ETFs suggests there is considerable overlap although VEGI is a more diversified with 147 constituents compared with 47 for MOO.Charges for VEGI also undercut other rival products in this space such as CROP, the global agribusiness small cap ETF run by Index IQ and PAGG, the global agriculture fun run by Invesco Powershares. PAGG and CROP both charge 75bps.Another new iShares product known as RING also points to a more competitive attitude to pricing. RING is based on the MSCI global gold miners index and will compete with the GDX, the Market Vectors gold miners ETF.While GDX carries a total expense ratio of 53bps, RING is charging 39bps.GDX gathered inflows of just under $2.8bn last year, making it the 15th fastest growing US ETF in 2011.A third example of increased price competition from iShares is provided by the launch of SLVP which is based on the MSCI global silver miners index. SLVP carries a total expense ratio of 39bps and it undercuts SIL, the silver miners ETF run by Global X which charges 65bps.SIL is a relatively small fund which attracted inflows of $45m in 2011 and ended last year with assets of $314m. Silver mining companies are enjoying extremely high operating margins and strong cash flows but these factors are also reflected in their high valuations.BlackRock has also launched an iShares India ETF and small cap Canada ETF whose charges undercut existing rivals.Back in October 2010, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, played down the impact of price competition with other ETF providers on iShares business.Mr Fink was speaking after iShares had reduced the charges on its gold ETF and Vanguard had cut the expense ratio for its emerging markets earlier that year.However, both of those moves have had an impact on competing funds.Last year, GLD, the world’s largest gold ETF run by State Street Global Advisors, registered outflows of $372m while IAU, the cheaper rival offered by iShares managed to attract $2.7bn.The impact of price competition in emerging markets funds between iShares and Vanguard has been even more dramatic. Vanguard’s VWO, based on the MSCI emerging markets index, was the fastest growing US ETF last year with inflows of $7.8bn while EEM, a direct rival run by iShares, suffered outflows of $6.8bn.The effect of price competition was also evident in fixed income where iShares’ AGG lost its crown as the world’s largest bond ETF to BND, a direct rival from Vanguard.BND, which charges 11bps, attracted inflows of $5.2bn last year, lifting assets to $14.6bn at the end of 2011.That performance helped it overtake AGG which charges 22bps. It gathered inflows of $2.4bn in 2011, taking its assets to $14.1bn.Having seen how price cuts have both hurt and benefited its own ETFs, these latest launches underline the importance of competitive pricing for iShares in defending its position against up and coming rivals.
391;STT;State Street Corp;2012-02-08T23:18:14Z;Deutsche Bank Asset Management auction falters;;The auction process to sell Deutsche Bank Asset Management is faltering after JPMorgan and State Street withdrew from the bidding, making it more likely the bank will have to break up the business as part of a prolonged sale of the assets.Deutsche Bank had raced ahead with the sale process in the past week, narrowing interest from a wide range of potential bidders to a shortlist of a half a dozen, before the leading contenders withdrew. Ameriprise, another candidate to buy the business, is baulking at the price and could soon withdraw, according to people familiar with the situation.The sale is the first strategic move from Deutsche’s new co-chief executives in waiting, Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen, as they seek to streamline the bank. DWS, Deutsche’s asset management business in its home market of Germany, is not included in the sale process.Private equity groups had previously expressed interest, while the Australian investment bank Macquarie, has made an approach for parts of the business. The bank would prefer to sell the business intact to a trade buyer, and believes further bidders may emerge, according to people familiar with the process.Attempts by the existing management to secure support from private equity investors for a management buy-out were unsuccessful, several people say.State Street, the US custody bank wthat also owns a large asset management business, is understood to believe the business is too large to take in one piece and lacks scale in some areas. Bidders were not necessarily interested in Rreef, Deutsche’s property business.Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, State Street and Ameriprise declined to comment.Deutsche is hoping to sell the business, which is largely US-focused, for as much as $2bn. Industry experts expressed scepticism that a prolonged sales process of the individual parts would raise that amount, with analysts predicting a sale could raise around $1.3bn.Assets under management from the units for sale total about €400bn, split between DB Advisors, its institutional division, €150bn worth of insurance mandates at Deutsche Insurance Asset Management and €46bn in alternative assets within Rreef.Splitting the business into three would be more complex than an outright sale, and also increases the possibility key staff and investment teams leave.The German group says the sale comes as costs associated with recent regulatory changes increase, and that the “the competitive landscape” is impacting the fund arm’s growth prospects within that of a bank platform.The move comes as many banks in Europe are expected to examine their continued involvement in asset management as they seek to raise capital to meet new regulatory requirements.
392;STT;State Street Corp;2012-02-07T18:04:16Z;US ETF inflows triple in January;Largest monthly inflows for more than two years;The US exchange traded funds industry made a strong start to 2012, attracting the largest monthly new inflows for more than two years.US listed ETFs (funds and products) attracted $28.8bn in new inflows in January, a 200 per cent increase from $9.6m in the same month a year ago, according to the ETF Industry Association, a US trade body.An improvement in risk appetite was evident from strong inflows into emerging markets ETFs – Vanguard’s VWO lead the product league table with inflows of $3.2bn while rival iShares’ EEM fund grabbed $1.3bn.This marks a distinct change from last year when US investors withdrew $2.4bn from emerging markets ETFs over the course of 2011,But after dropping by a fifth last year, the MSCI emerging markets index rebounded 11.2 per cent in January and some analysts predict further gains.Geoffrey Dennis, emerging markets strategist at Citigroup, says emerging markets could rise 25 to 30 per cent over 2012. As well as highlighting attractive valuations, Mr Dennis says falling inflation and lower interest rates will provide support for emerging markets in 2012.He notes that there have already been reductions in official interest rates in Brazil, India, Russia, Chile, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand while China cut its reserve requirements at the end of November with further monetary easing thought likely this year.ETFs linked to US technology stocks also grabbed investors’ attention with the Nasdaq Composite up 8 per cent in January, outperforming the broader US equity market. The Powershares QQQ, the ETF benchmarked to the Nasdaq Composite, attracted inflows of $3.2bn in January, already surpassing the $3.1bn which it gathered over the whole of last year.With the Federal Reserve explicitly signalling recently that US interest rates will remain at extremely low levels until the end of 2014, investors continued to show a strong appetite for income related plays in corporate bond markets.The iShares iBoxx high yield corporate bond ETF, known as HYG, grabbed $2.2bn in January while a close rival, the SPDR Barcap high yield bond ETF, known as JNK, attracted $1.2bn. Meanwhile, LQD, the iShares ETF which focuses on investment grade bonds gathered $1.1bn.The combination of strong inflows into its corporate bond ETFs and renewed interest in its emerging markets ETF meant iShares led the race among providers for investors’ cash in January with inflows of $9.4bn. Vanguard (in second place with inflows of $6.9bn) and State Street Global Advisors (in third place with inflows of $5.7bn) both saw inflows rise strongly compared with January 2011.The top three providers (iShares, SSgA, and Vanguard) won more than three-quarters (76.6 per cent) of total inflows in January, suggesting they are winning the fight against the combined weight of smaller players and up and coming providers. For comparison, the same top three providers grabbed 69.6 per cent of total inflows over the whole of 2011.Analysts have been questioning why markets have managed to make such a strong start to the year.Nicholas Colas, ConvergEx group chief market strategist, notes that correlations across a broad range of risk assets have dropped precipitously in the previous month.“If this trend continues, it is unalloyed good news for active managers – provided, of course, they get their calls correct,” said Mr Colas.Although some investors might doubt if markets can really return to health so quickly, Mr Colas says the decline in correlations is a sign that portfolio managers are taking time to assess what sectors and stocks hold the most promise and investing accordingly.
393;STT;State Street Corp;2012-02-03T10:41:04Z;Roles include buying gold and reducing risk;2011 was a year of two halves as investors switched from equities to defensive and niche exchange traded products;"In a year that has often been described as one of two halves, exchange traded products (ETPs, the umbrella term that includes ETFs and exchange traded commodities) found themselves playing a variety of roles.Stephen Cohen, head of investment strategies for the Emea region at iShares, says the first half of 2011 saw strong flows into equities. From August onwards there was a major reversal as investors became unusually wary of taking on risk, moving away from emerging market equities in favour of ultra-safe government bonds, to the extent that there was a net outflow from emerging market equities compared with the inflow seen in 2010.So ETPs were used to reduce risk, park cash and buy gold, particularly in Europe, where investors assumed a more defensive stance than their counterparts in the US.“ Gold was the big winner in December, with inflows of more than €730m into European-domiciled ETFs,” says Eleanor Hope-Bell, head of intermediary business for northern Europe at State Street Global Advisors. The company’s SPDR gold ETF, she says, has already seen net inflows of $1.32bn in 2012, compared with a net outflow of $518m in the whole of 2011; meanwhile SSgA’s US-domiciled GLD fund is the largest gold ETF in the world with $71bn under management towards the end of January.Defensive sectors outperformed in 2011 and saw mostly modest inflows, says Ms Hope-Bell. An exception was financials which saw significant inflows in January 2011. “January 2012 seems to be shaping up in a similar fashion, with cyclicals and financials leading the way,” she says. “We have seen good activity and inflows in our SPDR MSCI Financials ETF.”The atmosphere today seems more positive, Mr Cohen believes, as the US generates improving economic data. In Europe, the European Central Bank’s three-year refinancing facility appears to have stabilised investor confidence by reducing the possibility of an all-out banking crisis.“Markets have performed very well in early 2012, and ETP flows have reflected that, taking into account statistical and anecdotal evidence,” says Mr Cohen. The early indicators, he suggests, are that emerging market equities inflows this year could well offset the 2011 outflow. “Bunds and money markets were a big destination for funds, but we are seeing that being reversed now,” he adds.Income from equities and bonds remains a strong investment theme in his view, with fund raising accelerating in 2012 on the back of the success enjoyed in 2011. iShares recently launched an emerging market dividend income fund and has also seen significant flows into European non-financial corporate bonds. “Corporate credit is an area where investors are focused on yield pick-up,” he says.US corporate bonds in particular have gathered much interest, delivering not only the desired pick-up but also currency exposure to the US dollar. Mr Cohen describes high yield as “flavour of the month”, reflecting the twin impact of increasing investor confidence and the desire for income. Investors, it would appear, are regaining an appetite for inching along the credit spectrum. “Interest in our high yield fund is very strong,” says Ms Hope-Bell.Emerging market debt is also gaining in popularity, but perhaps with a bit of a twist, if Nizam Hamid, deputy head of ETFs at Lyxor, is correct. “The credit trade has pretty much run its course and investors are focusing on FX trade as the source of yield in emerging market bonds,” he says.Volatility is emerging as an asset class in its own right, as the market adjusts to the often extraordinary peaks and troughs of recent years, he ventures, and ETFs are a good way to access such exposure inexpensively. “We are seeing a need from clients who are trading, swapping or simply diversifying,” he says.Mr Hamid is one of a number of market participants who identify diversification as a theme driving ETF growth. Nick Shellard, head of ETF sales at Citi, says the growing fashion for multi-asset class portfolios sits well with the rise in popularity of ETFs offering exposure to geographies, industry sectors, precious and base metals, soft commodities, as well as oil and gas, fixed income and equities.Michael Levas, senior managing principal at Olympian Capital Management in Florida, describes as explosive the increasing interest in ETFs. “We are seeing inflows into all asset classes, especially indices, and into currency ETFs.”A summary of the likely future for ETFs is contained in a report by McKinsey, the consultancy, in the latter part of last year, on what it describes as “ETFs’ second act”. Ogden Hammond, associate principal, says category specialists will focus on designing specialised passive – and, in time, active – ETF products to satisfy profitable niches of unmet investor demand (he describes the development of actively investing ETFs as the Holy Grail of the ETF industry).The envisaged niches will include ever narrower slices of international or sector exposure, more exotic commodities, levered or inverse funds, and a wide variety of alternatively weighted indexes.As small to mid-sized ETF sponsors strive to develop unique market positioning and brand identity, many have concentrated on consolidating leadership positions within product categories. This trend toward increased specialisation is likely to continue as ETF sponsors seek to balance their quest to uncover new pockets of investor demand with the need to maintain business focus, cost-effectiveness and a distinctive brand on a crowded ETF product shelf.As this trend plays out, it could have direct consequences for successful specialists in some larger categories. The McKinsey judgment is that they could become acquisition targets of larger sponsors seeking to augment and diversify product portfolios."
394;STT;State Street Corp;2012-02-03T10:38:58Z;War of words mars year of contrasting fortunes;Winners and losers in a year of opacity and almost zero growth;It is difficult to talk of winners and losers in the ETF market when the last year has been one marred by infighting, accusations of opacity, and almost zero growth.In the US the likes of Vanguard and State Street, which each saw their ETF assets under management rise by some $20bn in 2011, can look back on last year with a fair degree of satisfaction, but in Europe the picture is very different.European ETF assets tumbled by 5.3 per cent in 2011, according to BlackRock figures, regulators lined up to voice their concerns over the possible systemic risks of synthetic ETFs, and a London-based ETF trader at UBS allegedly racked up losses of $2.3bn (€1.7bn) for the Zurich-based banking group.The Financial Stability Board, which was set up after the 2008 financial crisis and represents central banks and regulators, said it had seen “a number of disquieting developments” in the synthetic ETF sector, while the Bank of England warned that the risks associated with swap-based ETFs were not being made clear to investors.ETFs are “characterised by increasing complexity, opacity and interconnectedness”, the central bank said in a June report, adding that such products “can give rise to risks that may not be transparent to end-investors”.The result was that investors fled the ETF market and, in particular, the funds of synthetic ETF providers. Lyxor Asset Management, for example, lost some $18bn last year, db x-trackers saw almost $6bn wiped off its asset base, while ETF Securities – which is up for sale – lost $1.3bn.The big winner from this was iShares – a fierce critic of the swap-based ETF approach. The BlackRock-owned provider, an ardent supporter of physical ETFs, saw its ETF assets under management jump by $4.1bn in 2011, with its European market share rising 3.2 per cent.“ETF investors showed a clear preference for iShares products last year,” the firm says, although Source, Amundi and UBS were other notable winners of 2011. “We captured over 70 per cent of all flows into ETFs in Emea in 2011, and maintained our position as the market leader in assets.”To do that iShares engaged in a fair amount of gamesmanship – and consequently lost quite a few friends along the way. For example Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive, said in November that any investor buying into a Lyxor product was basically “an unsecured creditor of SocGen” (Lyxor is a subsidiary of Société Générale, the French bank).He also appealed to regulators to ban synthetic funds from calling themselves exchange traded funds, saying they were too “opaque”.A senior industry participant at one synthetic ETF house believes Mr Fink’s comments were nothing more than propaganda and that BlackRock’s stance is all about the “battle for market share”.“The position taken by iShares and BlackRock is nothing more than a blatant attempt to win market share,” he says. “Their stance is divisive for the market at a time when the industry should be coming together to allay investors’ fears.”BlackRock was also accused last month by Edhec Risk Institute, part of Edhec business school, of “doubletalk” and “Orwellian doublethink” in showing different attitudes regarding the use of derivatives to US and European regulators.In a report, Edhec quoted a letter from BlackRock to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in which the group backs the naming of funds based on their economic exposure.The position, says Edhec, clashes with BlackRock’s response to European regulators in which the firm demands a clear distinction between physical and synthetic ETFs.Nevertheless, iShares increased its assets under management in Europe to $105.9bn and expanded its market share to 35.5 per cent, while db x-trackers’ market share slipped to 14.4 per cent and Lyxor’s to 11.6 per cent.Joe Linhares, head of iShares Emea, says: “Our growth benefited from investors’ choice for transparent and liquid products in volatile market conditions as was also the case in 2008. Our growth in assets and market share is testament to the breadth and quality of funds offered and our client service.”He adds: “As more investors return to the market and reposition portfolios in 2012, we are well placed to grow and meet investors’ needs as they put their money to work.“Already this year, the market has captured global net inflows of over $30bn of which iShares has led the way in the US and Emea in gathering over $9bn.”Growth is evidently strong at the BlackRock-owned ETF house, but it might find that it is lonely at the top.
395;STT;State Street Corp;2012-02-03T10:36:03Z;Europe in good position to play catch-up with US;The RDR should spur ETF growth in UK, but change will be slower elsewhere;“In terms of the ETF sector, Europe is where the US was five years ago: growth has the potential to be explosive,” says Scott Ebner, global head of sales at State Street Global Advisors.The refrain is a common one: Europe, with its large retail investor market has long been considered ripe for the rapid growth that has seen assets under management in the US exchange traded sector double since 2008. There are, fund distributors say, many reasons to be hopeful that 2012 could be the year.From next January, implementation of the Retail Distribution Review in the UK will bar financial advisers from taking commission from investment product providers. Instead advisers will charge upfront fees, which should ensure low ETF management fees are clear to end users. Similar moves are under way in the Netherlands, and European product distributors are already making adjustments.“RDR is transforming the sector here,” says Andy Clark at HSBC Asset Management in London, who is responsible for ETF product launches in Europe. “Active strategies were the default before, but we’re seeing increasing demand from financial advisers for lower priced products.”But the story is not so simple. In the UK, while some large money managers have already taken steps to offer customers access to ETFs, many small advisers do not have the capacity to execute intra-day trades, or accounting systems to recognise intra-day changes in the value of ETF securities.“Rule changes are only half of the battle. Just because advisers won’t be able to take commissions from active managers any more, it doesn’t mean they will have to offer ETFs,” warns David Gardiner, head of sales for the Emea region at iShares, BlackRock’s ETF franchise.Mr Gardiner estimates that only 40 per cent of the UK’s financial advisory businesses have made proactive moves to be RDR compliant ahead of the January 2013 deadline.In Germany and France, potentially two of Europe’s largest markets, change is coming more slowly, if at all: for all the talk of a single European market, the regulation of retail investment remains stubbornly national.ETF distributors may be partly to blame: there is no umbrella European body for the sector, nor any talk of forming one. That means pressure for change, such as for the RDR in UK, has come from regulators, or retail investors themselves.“Until recently ETFs in Europe were seen as institutional products, and distributors had pre-existing relationships with institutional clients,” says Mr Gardiner. “There is probably scope for more co-operation between us, especially on educating investors, and supporting retail financial advisers so they can make ETFs part of their offering.”While funds in the Asia-Pacific region are also thought to be dominated by institutional flows – in particular from private wealth managers in Singapore – the retail sector appears to be on the rise in Australia.Self-managed funds account for roughly a third of Australia’s pension or superannuation industry, and one provider at least offered its customers the option to invest directly in ETFs as well as single name equities last year.Just before Christmas the country’s regulators also paved the way for Australian bond ETFs, with the first products launching this week.While retail investors may remain the prize, ETF distributors are also targeting institutional investors with new products. A large portion of last year’s US product launches, which reached a record 302 according to industry research firm XTF, were so-called “factor” ETFs. These “intelligent” funds select out of an index constituents that display particular characteristics, for example high volatility.In Europe distributors have also launched fund-of-fund style ETFs, which allocate investor money between different ETFs and index funds, to gain exposure to global equities, bonds and commodities.But some innovations have struggled to attract inflows: the flurry of “factor” ETFs were partly responsible for the record number of unsuccessful product launches in the US last year.Institutional investors offer mixed reviews of the new products. “ETFs that allocate assets could be a great one stop shop for retail investors, but I don’t see the attraction for active managers like myself, who tend to see the asset allocation decision as a chance to add value,” says Stephen Doran, a portfolio manager in HSBC’s wealth management division in London.
396;STT;State Street Corp;2012-02-01T22:57:23Z;D Bank sets up shortlist on asset management sale;;Deutsche Bank is racing ahead with the sale process for its asset management business and is poised to narrow down a shortlist of half a dozen bidders to the final two or three within days.State Street, the US bank-cum-asset manager, is among the leading contenders to buy the business, according to people close to the situation, with JPMorgan and Apax, the private equity firm, also strong bidders. Deutsche is hoping to sell the business, which is largely US-focused, for as much as $2bn.The sale is the first strategic move from Deutsche’s new co-chief executives in waiting, Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen, as they seek to streamline the bank. DWS, Deutsche’s asset management business in its home market of Germany, is not included in the sale process. Deutsche is expected to provide an update on the progress of the transaction on Thursday, as it announces annual results.According to people involved, there has also been interest from asset managers, including US group Ameriprise, and private equity firm Aquiline Capital Partners, though it is unclear whether they remain in the process. Macquarie, the Australian group, has made an approach for parts of the business.State Street and JPMorgan may be prepared to buy the whole of the operation that Deutsche is selling, bankers said. But a large portion of interest is from bidders seeking only parts of the business. In particular, several groups are loath to buy the property arm Rreef as part of the deal.
397;STT;State Street Corp;2012-01-21T02:24:11Z;Vision of buyside clearing fails to become reality;Many clients of the banks are still not ready for the ’big bang’ of central clearing;Even in the world of complex derivatives, it is worth remembering a hoary old business tenet: the customer comes first.Many arcane debates have raged around the core Dodd-Frank financial reform act principle that more derivatives trades should be centrally cleared, including whether smaller dealers should be allowed to participate in clearing.Yet it is easy to forget that dealers have already been centrally clearing trades among themselves for a few years.The same cannot be said for trades between banks and their clients, even as the final clearing rules near, with the beginning of the implementation phase expected later this year.Though in recent months CME Group and LCH.Clearnet have cleared a number of such trades, market participants say the landscape is still evolving, and many clients of the banks are still not ready for the “big bang”.Despite the law’s requirement of “fair and open access” to clearing, the initial vision of having asset managers, hedge funds and other institutions that trade risks related to commodity prices or interest rates with banks become direct clearing members has not come to fruition.Instead, buyside firms have chosen to operate through futures clearing merchants, or FCMs, as the law also allows. BlackRock’s recent trades cleared on LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear platform, for example, were via Goldman Sachs as FCM.The primary barrier, aside from the costs of new systems and the expense of contributing to clearing houses’ central funds, is that clearing houses typically ask that members step in to trades in the event of a default – a prospect now much more real after MF Global’s collapse. That requires the member to have a trading desk and agree to take that principal risk, which many institutions do not want to do.“If we were to take the current clearing house and regulatory requirements that exist today, for large asset managers that act as a fiduciary, direct membership doesn’t work,” says Supurna VedBrat, co-head of BlackRock’s market structure and electronic trading team.Clearing houses acknowledge this challenge. “We are talking to some on the buyside about whether they want to be members themselves,” says Michael Davie, chief executive of LCH’s SwapClear. “But I think that most will avail themselves of clearing services rather than provide them.”But that does not mean the buyside is leaving these choices up to dealers. As more standardised swaps begin to trade in electronic, transparent markets, with trades reported to a central marketplace, known as a swap execution facility, they are likely to rely far less on dealers.“Discussions among the buyside have been around how can we respond to regulation, and how can we derive business benefit,” says Ebbe Kjaersbo, chief business consultant at SimCorp, which provides back office services for fund managers.On cue, new firms are popping up to serve more agile fund managers. The custodian banks BNY Mellon and State Street, for example, have launched FCMs.“The traditional buyside/sellside dichotomy is breaking down,” says Charley Cooper, senior managing director at State Street Global Markets. “In the old days, you would clear with whom you were doing the trade with. Those things are now unbundling.”Clearing houses are also competing to have buyside clients direct their FCMs to send trades to one house or another with more streamlined processes for posting margin or expanded ranges of acceptable collateral.“It may be that when buyside clients clear through CME, it is a lot more capital efficient than another clearing house,” says Laurent Paulhac, managing director of OTC services at CME Group.Sanjay Kannambadi, chief executive at BNY Mellon Clearing, also cites concern about margin and collateral as an advantage that custodian banks may have over the incumbent dealers.“The main demand to start this business came from the client side,” he says. “These clients have assets with us already, and clearing is a natural extension, with efficiencies therein to help mobilise their collateral.”But there may be limits to how creative the buyside wants to be in chasing opportunities to take out costs and trade agressively.“I cannot emphasise how important it is that clients are comfortable that collateral is protected,” says Ms VedBrat of BlackRock. Or as Mr Paulhac puts it: “The buyside is not seeking to compete. Their aim is to reduce risk.”
398;STT;State Street Corp;2012-01-19T00:56:44Z;US custodian banks hit by shift into cash;;Global custodian banks have adopted a defensive position as fund managers and large institutions shift into cash and ultra-safe assets, putting pressure on the banks’ ability to generate income.Bank of New York Mellon earnings in the fourth quarter dropped from $679m last year to $505m. The quarter’s results included a $107m restructuring charge, primarily a result of lay-offs.“As the year-end approached last year, [we saw a] complete risk-off mode: a decline in volumes, movement to cash,” said Gerald Hassell, chief executive. That “doesn’t allow for fee activity either in investment services or investment management area”.Low interest rates have put tremendous pressure on custodian banks that manage funds for large institutions and retail brokerages, with the Federal Reserve’s commitment to near-zero rates through 2013 make it difficult to invest customer funds in safe investments that generate return.Coming at the same time that fees generated by trading and investment activity are falling sharply, such groups have been forced to rely on cost-cutting and lay-offs to generate consistent earnings growth.Northern Trust profits dropped 17 per cent for the fourth quarter to $130m, down from $157m in the same period in 2010 and also hit by restructuring charges of $61m.State Street’s quarterly net income jumped from $81m to $383m, though the favourable comparison was due to a large charge taken in the fourth quarter of last year.Shares of BNY Mellon were down 4.4 per cent by mid-afternoon, at $20.33, giving up all of its gains so far for the year. State Street dropped 6.8 per cent to $39.84, and Northern Trust was down 2.2 per cent to $41.02.The firms reported a doubling in waivers on fees charged on money-market funds that offer low returns but promise immediate liquidity, with some $90m in fees waived this year. Low rates have forced the banks to forgo fees that would push money-market funds into the negative.“Money market fund managers, including our own, have been particularly conservative. They shortened durations and reduced European exposure, which resulted in lower yields and even higher money market feed fund waivers,” Mr Hassell said.As of January 11, US money market mutual fund assets totalled $2.7tn, according to the Investment Company Institute. That is up from $2.64tn at the end of the third quarter, but down from the $2.8tn held in such funds a year ago. Industry assets peaked in January 2009 at $3.92tn.The groups are responding with aggressive cost-cutting. Northern Trust is cutting 700 jobs. State Street said it would likely continue to cut staff, having closed a fixed-income trading unit in the fourth quarter.“The most recent market action looks good, but we still worry about Europe, and we’re trying to be realistic and …straightforward in our disclosure that we keep trying to adjust the expense base to generate earnings,” said Jay Hooley, State Street chief executive.
399;STT;State Street Corp;2012-01-10T18:39:43Z;Appetite for new US ETF wanes;;A record number of new US exchange-traded funds failed to attract substantial investor demand last year, leaving fund operators facing losses in one of the first signs that the industry’s explosive growth may have peaked.ETFs allow investors to trade baskets of securities, such as the S&P 500 or precious metals, on exchanges with low management fees. Their popularity has surged in recent years, drawing investors away from mutual funds.The US ETF industry ended last year with more than $1tn in assets under management, compared with $540bn at the start of 2009. But that rapid growth has attracted scrutiny from regulators, and there are signs the market may be saturated.“There are a huge and growing number of ETFs out there that are truly sub-scale [uneconomic]” said Ogden Hammond, who tracks the industry for McKinsey, the consultancy. “Larger fund managers have more ability to absorb losses, but at some point operators will have to make a decision about pulling the plug.”Data prepared for the Financial Times by XTF, an ETF research firm, shows 79 per cent of the 190 exchange traded products launched in the first six months of last year failed to attract $30m in assets under management, an industry benchmark for profitability. In 2010 the corresponding figure was 62 per cent and in 2009 it was less than half.Funds with few assets under management may have few buyers and sellers of their shares, making them illiquid and prone to greater price volatility.Poor equity market performance goes some way to explaining the unpopularity of last year’s vintage, but even when the S&P 500 plunged by 40 per cent in 2008, almost a third of products launched in the first two quarters attracted $30m in assets at some point in the year.Industry participants instead point to growing saturation in the market, with a record 302 products launched in 2011, bringing the total to 1,369, compared to only 389 at the start of 2007.Mel Herman, chief executive of XTF, said: “Most popular indices already have an ETF tracking them, so issuers are launching more and more niche products.”Russell Investments, operator of the Russell 1000 and 2000 indices, launched 10 funds in the first half of 2011, offering “intelligent beta” strategies, designed to isolate specific characteristics, such as low volatility or high correlation, within Russell indices. Only one of those funds reached $30m in assets under management at any point in 2011.“ETFs which passively track indices don’t need any explanation to investors,” said James Polisson, chief executive of Russell ETFs. “We need to sit down with fund managers, and explain the strategy, so it will take a little longer to gather assets.”Despite the cost of keeping open unpopular products, their operators appear less willing to close them down. Just 32 exchange traded products were shuttered in 2011, the fewest in five years, according to XTF.While operators of small funds have been forced to close down lossmaking funds, the industry has consolidated in recent years. Large operators like BlackRock or State Street, which run the large iShares and SPDR ETF franchises, have the means to keep funds open in the hope they may yet capture the imagination of investors. Industry participants also say large operators are willing to absorb losses on some funds to avoid the stigma of closures.“We closed three funds at iShares, and there was such a reaction, that we never closed one again,” said Greg Friedman, who developed products at iShares, the leading ETF operator by assets under management, and is now at Russell. “It hurts your reputation with investors and leads to questions about whether your other funds will be there for the long run.
400;STT;State Street Corp;2012-01-10T16:29:37Z;Vanguard leads 2011 cash race for US ETF providers;Tops leadeboard for second year in succession;Vanguard led the race among US exchange traded fund providers for investors’ cash for a second year in succession in 2011, pushing iShares, the world’s largest ETF provider, into the runner’s up spot, according to data from the ETF Industry Association.Net new inflows into US listed ETFs (funds and products) topped the $100bn mark for a fifth year in succession at $117.6bn, down 1 per cent on the $118.7bn gathered in 2010.Strong inflows helped boost total assets held in US ETFs (funds and products) which rose 5.1 per cent to $1,060.2bn at the end of 2011 in spite of big falls in many stock markets around the world and a flat performance from the S&P 500.Competition in the US ETF market continued to intensify as the three largest providers, iShares, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard, all saw inflows decline in 2011, while a swathe of smaller providers grabbed a bigger share of investors’ cash.Vanguard attracted inflows of $35.8bn last year, down 11.6 per cent from $40.5bn in 2010 while iShares inflows fell 4.7 per cent to $28.8bn and those for SSgA declined 9.3 per cent to $17.2bn.ProShares, the world’s largest manager of leveraged and inverse funds, took fourth spot for new inflows after gathering $6.4bn, more than double the $2.8bn which it attracted in 2010. Investors have continued to show an appetite for leveraged and inverse ETFs in spite of regulators’ criticisms of these instruments. Inflows into all US listed leveraged and inverse ETFs also more than doubled last year to $11.1bn.Deborah Fuhr, an independent ETF strategist, said last year’s difficult market conditions and periods of high volatility boosted the use of inverse ETFs in particular as investors looked for instruments that helped them put on hedges to mitigate the impact of any big falls in asset prices.ETF inflows last year reflected clear shifts in US investors’ risk appetite and the search for income or yield in a low interest rate environment. So inflows rose strongly for fixed income ETFs and US domestic equity ETFs while international equity ETFs saw inflows fall and commodity linked ETFs registered net outflows.Long fixed income ETFs (expecting bond prices to rise) saw inflows reach $44.6bn in 2011, up 70 per cent on the $26.2bn gathered in 2010, helped by strong returns from US government bonds, which delivered total returns of just under 10 per cent last year, well ahead of the 1 per cent total return from the US stock market.Two of the largest fixed income ETFs that provide broad exposure to bond markets grabbed a big share of last year’s inflows. The Vanguard Barclays total bond ETF, known as BND, gathered inflows of $5.2bn, taking its assets to $14.6bn and helping it to overtake its rival iShares product, known as AGG, which attracted $2.4bn and saw its assets rise to $14.1bn by the end of 2011.Investors’ appetite for yield was evident from the appearance in the top 10 most popular funds of the iShares iBoxx high yield corporate bond ETF, known as HYG, and the iShares iBoxx investment grade corporate bond, known as LQD, which gathered $3.5bn and $3.3bn respectively.Kathy Jones, fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab, said there was still relative value in investment grade and high yield bonds at current levels.“Leverage in the corporate sector has declined in the past few years and default rates remain low. Even in a slow-growth economy, we don’t expect much increase in defaults,” said Ms Jones.She also noted that many high-yield issuers had been able to refinance out to 2014 or 2015.“Of course, high yield is correlated with the stock market, so that is a risk in an economic downturn, but the fundamentals are good and spreads are reasonably attractive.”The US stock market was one of just a few worldwide that managed to deliver a positive performance in 2011. This was reflected in a rise for inflows into domestic US equity focused ETFs, which reached $41.2bn, up 10.3 per cent on the $37.4bn gathered in 2010.The world’s biggest exchange traded fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, known as SPY, gathered inflows of $6.3bn last year compared with outflows of $3.8bn in 2010, while investors’ appetite for income from equities was demonstrated by Vanguard’s Mergent Dividend ETF, known as VIG, which attracted $4.1bn, up from $2.3bn in 2010.But weakness in risk appetite translated into a very disappointing year for US listed commodity ETFs, which saw outflows of $45m in 2011, a marked contrast to 2010 when these instruments gathered just under $11bn.There was a revival of interest in currency linked ETFs, which attracted inflows of $1.5bn compared with outflows of $2.6bn in the previous year.
401;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Scottish financial sector remains resilient;;The Financial Services Authority’s recent analysis of the downfall of the Royal Bank of Scotland sent shivers down the spine of those who recall the desperate mood in Edinburgh at that time.It was just over three years ago that Scotland’s financial sector, long hailed as the jewel in the country’s economic crown, was traumatised by the need for the UK government to rescue RBS and HBOS, which both embodied three centuries of Scottish banking history.But, given the gloom at that time, what is most remarkable is how well the Scottish financial sector has survived – and even shown signs of growth in what have continued to be troubled economic times.The biggest relief has been on the jobs front. Although both banks have swung the axe, Scotland appears to have escaped relatively lightly for employees of RBS and HBOS, which was taken over by Lloyds TSB to create the Lloyds Banking Group.Owen Kelly, chief executive of Scottish Financial Enterprise, the industry’s trade body, says: “In 2008 we set up a jobs task force with the devolved government because everyone was thinking: ‘My goodness, tens of thousands of jobs are going to go – what is going to happen?’ That did not come to pass.”In fact, of the 27,500 jobs that RBS has shed since then, 21,500 were from the UK and only 2,000 of them from Scotland. Lloyds has cut the same total number, 27,500 – of which about 2,000 were Scottish jobs.The availability of trained bank staff has attracted companies that are keen to break into the market. About 2,400 of the Edinburgh-based Tesco Bank’s 3,000 employees are based in Scotland.Last year, Virgin Money said it would lease the former Edinburgh head offices of Scottish & Newcastle, the brewing group that was bought by Heineken, as headquarters of its bank.“Scotland has a solid reputation for financial services and of course has highly talented and skilled people to help us grow the Virgin Money business,” says Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Virgin Money.The country has benefited from the resilience of other parts of the financial sector – such as asset service companies, fund managers, life assurers and general insurers.“While the biggest banks are going through a transition and jobs are going, there is a countervailing trend where Scotland stacks up very, very well on grounds of cost and quality of skills within the UK as a place to do business,” says Mr Kelly of the SFE.Asset servicing has been a particularly successful niche, with Barclays announcing that it would create up to 600 jobs by establishing a global shared services hub in Glasgow to support the activity of its investment banking and wealth management divisions.BlackRock, the US money management group, also announced it would locate its European servicing hub in Edinburgh, which would lead to the creation of 250 jobs.State Street, the US bank, has also named Edinburgh as a European centre of excellence and expanded its operation to encompass 840 jobs.In spite of difficult market conditions, fund management has also proved resilient and an informal “ring around” survey by the SFE estimates that total funds under management in Scotland rose to £750bn in 2011, compared with £650bn the previous year.The depth of Scotland’s skills pool was emphasised recently when Avaloq, a Swiss banking software company, said it would create a development centre in Edinburgh that is expected to employ 500 people within its first five years.Explaining that Scotland had been chosen in competition with Brazil and the Philippines, Francisco Fernandez, founder and chief executive of Avaloq, says: “One of the most important factors was the wealth of potential graduate talent available in Scotland and the number of universities offering excellent degrees in software engineering.”Taking into account redundancies and new jobs, Mr Kelly reckoned the total direct employment in the financial sector is stable at about 100,000. About 27 per cent of UK life assurance employees are based in Scotland, as are 14 per cent of fund management employees and 10 per cent of banking posts.The jobs are also usefully spread: about 40 per cent are in Edinburgh, 24 per cent in Glasgow and 36 per cent in the rest of Scotland.The country has certainly not been unscathed by the crisis. The latest Global Financial Centres Index puts Edinburgh at 32nd and Glasgow at 33rd, some way down from their rankings three years ago when the cities were ranked 18th and 28th respectively. But this loss of ground also reflects the steady advance of Asia, with eight Asian cities now in the top 20, compared with three four years ago.Given how demoralised people were three years ago, the outlook of the Scottish financial sector is remarkably robust, although there are plenty of concerns about the global economy and the eurozone in particular.Recalling the traumatic mood of 2008, Mr Kelly says: “At the time, we were probably not appreciating just how multi-dimensional this sector is.”
402;STT;State Street Corp;2011-12-19T20:21:47Z;Volcker conundrums fuel confusion over rules;The proposal must not curb trading activity too much;Proprietary trading is not like pornography. Participants in both have a good chance of losing their shirts but there the similarity ends.Paul Volcker, who inspired a forthcoming ban on banks trading for their own account, thinks differently. The former Federal Reserve chairman has repeatedly told Congress that identifying prop trading can be as simple as the US Supreme Court judge’s famous line on porn: “I know it when I see it.”Bank regulators rightly concluded that this intuitive approach wouldn’t work when it came to drawing up the ban on proprietary trading now known as the Volcker rule, which is due to go into force in July next year. Instead, they have come up with a complex network of metrics.Bankers didn’t much like dealing with a rule that hadn’t been defined, but they are not enjoying the prospect of complying with the complex network of tests either. The new banner cry is this will hurt liquidity.The problem is that even with the regulators’ raft of tools, it is still difficult to distinguish between banks’ soon-to-be banned buying and selling for their own account and “market making”, the permitted buying and selling on behalf of customers. Start impinging on the latter and you do risk seeing institutional investors’ trading getting less liquid and more expensive.The rules proposal has had multiple hands on it, reflecting the various bank regulators with different points of view who have haggled over the wording. The text contains a ludicrous 1,346 question marks, ostensibly asking for public comment (due in three weeks) but much of it reflecting officials’ disagreements and punting of key decisions.Among many apparent contradictions, the text talks of using a two-year compliance period for the new rules and then tells banks that after it comes into force in July they must meet the new standards “as soon as practicable”.For all their slickness, it’s also difficult to see the metrics working well for borderline cases. The proposed rule suggests that if a security held in a bank’s trading account goes up in price it might be prop trading. But one banker, who calls this the “central paradox” of Volcker, says: “A good market maker wants to hold inventory that’s going up because he thinks clients will want it.”Another banker says traders are going to be confused and stay away from perfectly proper business, hurting markets. “A client wants me to own this bond. If I make money, I get in trouble. If I lose money, not only will I lose money but someone will force me to get out of the position at a loss. It’s one thing for all these issues to be thought about by strategic management, but for traders two to three years out of school this becomes impossible.”Trying to highlight these conundrums is difficult. The banks have cried wolf so often on financial regulations that they are likely to be ignored. But there is some substance this time. And if the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley get a deaf ear in Washington, their only hope is that less-tainted financial institutions will have more success.In a move that received little attention earlier this month, State Street, the big Boston-based custody bank, announced it was closing a business that traded in the UK and German government bond markets. It blamed the Volcker rule. State Street’s pre-crisis activity in the riskier parts of credit markets has made it an example for some of why the Volcker rule should be enforced. But the withdrawal involved traditionally safe securities.Meanwhile, AllianceBernstein and BlackRock have gone public with their own concerns about Volcker. Wall Street’s hope is that these institutions will be more effective lobbyists in the remaining weeks before the rule is finalised and applied. As they finalise the rules, regulators must ensure that trading activity is not curbed too much by Volcker. There are plenty of better moves to boost banks’ safety in the Dodd-Frank Act – from higher capital requirements to pushing more derivatives through clearing houses and on to exchanges. Dodd-Frank’s rule to kill off ailing banks safely is more important than the Volcker rule’s efforts to stop them committing suicide.Equally, though, there is one area where regulators could be tougher. The proposed Volcker rule focuses on short-term trading as if this presents the most dangerous activity, ignoring the fact that big, long-term illiquid bets can cause the most harm. Take Lehman Brothers’ $22bn acquisition of Archstone, the real estate group, in 2007. Lehman collapsed less than a year later. Archstone is now valued at about $5bn. And that is the sort of disastrous long-term gamble that banks could merrily make again. Some would call that obscene.Tom Braithwaite is the FT’s US Banking Editor.tom.braithwaite@ft.com
403;STT;State Street Corp;2011-12-18T19:00:47Z;SEC bares teeth with Fannie and Freddie charges;Regulator eager to shake criticism;The Securities and Exchange Commission’s civil fraud charges against six former Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives brings the total number of senior executives charged in connection with the financial crisis to 45, a statistic the agency is promoting as it seeks to rebuff criticism of its enforcement efforts.“At its core, today’s action is about holding individuals accountable for their role in misleading the public about their companies’ subprime exposure,” Robert Khuzami, the SEC’s enforcement chief, said Friday when announcing the case. “First and foremost it is the responsibility of company executives to provide full, complete and accurate disclosure of its operations.”The case comes as the SEC has been deflecting criticism from politicians and judges who have questioned the agency’s enforcement policies and its willingness to go after top executives tied to the crisis.To date, Mr Khuzami said, the SEC has filed 38 actions against 87 defendants, including 45 who are chief executives and chief financial officers. The SEC has sued the former chief executives of New Century, IndyMac and Countrywide. Some of the executives have settled while others are fighting the allegations.The former Fannie and Freddie executives have denied any wrongdoing.US Judge Jed Rakoff has been a frequent critic of the SEC. Last month he refused to approve the SEC’s $285m settlement with Citigroup over its sale of a mortgage-related security, citing the SEC’s policy to allow companies to settle allegations without admitting or denying wrongdoing. The SEC said Thursday it is appealing against the decision. On Friday, the House Financial Services Committee said it would hold a hearing next year to review the no-admit, no-deny policy.Mr Rakoff pressed the SEC in 2009 over its settlement with Bank of America partly because no individuals had been sued.Another US judge queried the SEC’s decision to sue only two Citigroup officials and not others in 2009 for failing to disclose nearly $40bn in subprime mortgages.The SEC has sought to highlight its record through recent speeches by top officials who maintain they pursue individuals aggressively and bring cases when there is evidence to support an allegation.Unlike companies that usually settle, individuals are more willing to fight the allegations, especially if their legal fees are advanced by their former employer.Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs banker sued in 2009 for misleading investors who bought a mortgage-related security, is fighting the allegations. Goldman paid $550m to settle the same case without admitting or denying wrongdoing. It agreed it made a “mistake” in its marketing documents.Edward Stefflin, a team leader at a collateral manager responsible for a mortgage-related securities sold by JPMorgan, has denied SEC allegations he misled buyers of the security. JPM paid $153.6m to settle the same allegation, without admitting or denying wrongdoing.Going to trial can tie up SEC resources for years and reveal the challenges with some of the cases.State Street paid $600m to settle allegations it misled investors about an investment fund’s $3bn exposure to subprime mortgages. Two former State Street executives sued by the SEC fought the allegations, and in October an administrative law judge issued a scathing opinion dismissing the SEC’s complaint.The SEC did not sue Fannie or Freddie, which is now controlled by US taxpayers, but signed non-prosecution agreements in exchange for their co-operation against the executives.

405;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;State Street leaves UK and German bond markets;Became official dealer three months ago;State Street, the large US custodian bank, has cited new regulations including the “ Volcker rule” for its decision to quit the UK and German government bond markets just three months after becoming an official dealer.The Volcker rule bans US banks from proprietary trading – buying and selling for their own account. It contains an exemption for US Treasury securities but not foreign sovereign debt. Although market-making – buying and selling on behalf of clients – is permitted under the rule, bankers say worries that that activity will be deemed “prop” will hamper liquidity.State Street’s withdrawal is one of the first concrete signs that banks are preparing to walk away from European market-making businesses because of the new regulatory environment.“The decision to wind-down our cash bond trading initiative was precipitated by the potential impact of the Volcker rule that may prohibit flow trading in certain government bonds and evolving rules affecting European banks that would greatly increase capital requirements for cash bond trading,” State Street said.It marks the first withdrawal of a US bank from making prices for a non-US government bond market, with more banks expected to follow as the Volcker rule begins to bite and limit the trading activity of financial firms. It also reflects highly volatile European bond markets amid the current sovereign debt crisis.State Street’s retreat from supporting European bond markets marks an abrupt turnround as it only moved into the area in September, after many months spent on planning and meeting the requirements of being a market maker in the UK and Germany. In the US, State Street is not and does not intend to become a primary dealer, one of the banks and brokers which underwrite US Treasury debt sales.Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who pushed for last year’s financial regulatory overhaul to include a crackdown on the “casino” activities of banks, recently defended his namesake rule in an interview with the FT.For the UK gilts market, the withdrawal by State Street leaves 21 banks acting as market makers.Strategists say the exit from the market by State Street is not a problem for the UK Debt Management Office, which is responsible for selling gilts, as it has more than enough market makers.Their number increased from 15 in 2010 as more banks see opportunities in making money in gilts amid increasing issuance and fewer opportunities to boost returns in other markets, say strategists.Gilt-edged market makers have to buy 2 per cent of new issuance every six months. These banks are the only institutions allowed to buy gilts at auctions. They buy bonds for their own book as well as making purchases for fund managers, pension funds and life insurance companies.One strategist said: “The more market makers the better, as this tends to lead to more competitive prices and improved liquidity, which is better for the banks themselves and the investors they act on behalf of.”
406;STT;State Street Corp;2011-12-07T12:51:32Z;Big withdrawals from US equity ETFs in November;Investors turn to bonds and gold;Investors in US listed exchange traded funds made big withdrawals from domestic equity ETFs in November, shifting into fixed income ETFs and gold amid concerns about the impact of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis on the global economy.The equity withdrawals came in the wake of strong market performance in October, when the S&P 500 rose by 10.8 per cent, its best monthly performance for almost 20 years (since December 1991).In November, the US stock market struggled for positive momentum, requiring a strong rally in the final few days to eke out a gain of just 0.5 per cent over the month.This was reflected in ETF flows. ETFs linked to long positions in domestic US stock indices saw outflows of $7bn in November, a big reversal from October when they attracted positive inflows of just under $15bn, according to data released by the National Stock Exchange.But ETFs linked to long positions in fixed income markets gathered just over $5bn in new inflows last month, up from $4.3bn in October.Perhaps the biggest surprise of last month was the strong revival of interest in physical gold ETFs after a lacklustre performance since the summer.The world’s largest physically backed gold ETF, the SPDR Gold Trust, gathered net new inflows of $3.1bn in November, its biggest monthly flows by value so far this year, taking assets to $72.9bn.In aggregate however, the outflows from equity ETFs outweighed the inflows for fixed income and physical gold products, resulting in a small net outflow of $238m across all US listed ETFs (funds and products). This was in stark contrast to the inflows of $23.9bn gathered in October.So far this year, US ETFs have attracted inflows of $101.3bn, on track for annual inflows to exceed $100bn for a fifth successive year.Looking ahead to December, Victor Lin, an analyst at Credit Suisse says ETF inflows historically tend to be highest in the final month of the year as investors rebalance their portfolios, make tax-driven trades and switch between funds.Among the top three providers, Vanguard attracted inflows of $5.5bn while iShares and State Street Global Advisors saw outflows of $1.6bn and $5.1bn respectively last month. That helped Vanguard extend its lead in the race for investors cash this year. So far in 2011, Vanguard has gathered $35.8bn in new inflows, more than its main rivals iShares ($21.1bn) and SSgA ($8.4bn) combined.Total US ETF assets (funds and products) stood at $1,063.6bn at the end of November, up 5.4 per cent from $1,008.7bn at the start of the year.
407;STT;State Street Corp;2011-12-07T12:25:32Z;ETF usage ‘deepening’ among asset managers;Inflow data show investors are focusing on ETF benefits;Growing use of exchange traded funds by asset managers in Europe will support future asset growth for the ETF industry, according to Scott Ebner, global head of ETF product development at SPDR ETFs, a division of State Street Global Advisors.Speaking at a SPDR seminar in London on Monday, Mr Ebner said he expected to see ETF usage “deepening and broadening” with asset managers employing ETFs to gain access to different areas across global financial markets.Noting that ETFs listed in Europe were seeing strong inflows even as traditional mutual funds have registered outflows, Mr Ebner said that much of the recent debate among regulators about the risks of ETFs had distracted many investors from the benefits that these instruments could offer.Questions about the merits of physical versus synthetic regulation were a debate about technique, said Mr Ebner, emphasising that the purpose of an ETF was the most important discussion to have with investors.SSgA’s range of 30 SPDR ETFs listed in Europe are entirely “physical” funds that buy the constituents of the index they are tracking rather than relying on derivatives to deliver returns. However, some areas of financial markets are not readily accessible through physical replication so an exposure can only be gained by using derivatives and in those cases it was vital to have clear processes to explain to investors how counterparty risk could be controlled, said Mr Ebner.Justin Urquhart Stewart, co-founder and marketing director at 7IM, an investment manager offering both active and passive solutions, said there had already been significant growth in the use of ETFs by asset managers such as smaller pension funds and charities as well as in the Sipps (self-invested personal pensions) market.This growth, driven by concerns about the impact of costs on returns, would continue in an environment where economic growth was likely to remain weak.“Costs stick out like rocks through water,” said Mr Urquhart Stewart.He anticipated “huge change” across the fund management industry following the UK’s retail distribution review which is expected to ban commission payments to financial advisers.But Mr Urquhart Stewart also said that he was deeply concerned about the lack of education about basic finance among the general public.Many investors had “no idea” about the importance of cost measures such as total expense ratios while the regulatory debate about synthetic versus physical replication seemed like “something out of Dr Who” to the general public.Jose Garcia Zarate, an ETF analyst at Morningstar, the investment research company, said the regulatory criticisms of synthetic ETFs had highlighted the issue of counterparty risk for many investors. He noted that a recent Morningstar survey had shown a growing preference for traditional physical funds among UK investors with 90 per cent of respondents saying they preferred them over synthetic products.Stephen Doran, a fund manager at HSBC Global Asset Management, said synthetic ETFs were not suitable for retail investors as there were potential conflicts of interest in those cases where an investment bank acted as both ETF manager and swap counterparty.He added that there was widespread dissatisfaction about active fund management but there was “some way to go” in educating retail investors and even financial professionals about ETFs and how these could be used to build sophisticated inexpensive multi-asset portfolios.
408;STT;State Street Corp;2011-12-04T17:26:43Z;Fidelity comes off the ETF sidelines;Fund giant gears up for expansion after years of tentative presence;Fidelity is gearing up for what appears to be a major expansion into exchange traded funds, leaving just one heavyweight US fund provider on the ETF sidelines.The Boston-based fund company filed regulatory papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday seeking permission to launch a range of index based ETFs, including foreign and domestic stock and bond investments, targeting both retail and institutional investors.Fidelity already runs one ETF, the $158.7m Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index Tracking Stock Fund, launched in 2003, but the new filing would grant it wider product latitude. For instance, Fidelity requests clearance to employ a “master feeder” structure for new ETFs, in which the ETFs invest in a traditional mutual fund – the “master fund” – that shares the identical investment objective of the ETFs, or the “feeder funds.” The technique would be “substantially similar” to that used by State Street Global Advisors, which gained approval from the SEC to use the structure late last year, the filing said.ETFs tracking indices constructed using 130/30 strategies and other long/short investment schemes would also be permitted.Fidelity’s gambit marks the biggest capitulation yet from the conventional mutual fund world, which has steadily surrendered fund market share to ETFs. This year through September, for example, stock mutual funds have had net outflows of $21.6bn, compared with $32.8bn flowing into stock ETFs, according to Morningstar data.The classic actively managed stock mutual fund was the hallmark of Fidelity’s rise in the 1980s and 1990s, exemplified by its flagship Magellan fund. Yet amid an ETF-propelled tectonic shift to index investing, Fidelity has surrendered its claim as the largest US mutual fund manager to passive fund powerhouse Vanguard, while Magellan has endured a prolonged sales and performance slump, shrinking from nearly $110bn in assets in 2000 to $16.0bn today.Other US mutual fund managers specialising in actively managed stock funds – namely, T Rowe Price and Janus Capital Group – had like Fidelity shunned the ETF market as their peers crowded in. But they have relented within the past two years, filing plans to launch active ETFs.The one holdout remaining among the US industry’s biggest managers is American Funds, also an active management stalwart. The pressure to cave in may be mounting there too amid more than two years of nonstop outflows. In the year through to the end of September, its long-term fund assets have fallen 11.0 per cent, to $814bn, Morningstar data show.
409;STT;State Street Corp;2011-12-04T03:40:34Z;Active managers spark row;DC Investment Forum claims passive funds may damage savers’ interests;A move by a cabal of active asset managers to fight back against the growing uptake of passive investment strategies has provoked an industry row.The first white paper produced by the newly formed Defined Contribution Investment Forum, backed by Barings, Henderson, JPMorgan, Schroders, Standard Life and Threadneedle, claimed that the “prodigious use” of passive investment in UK DC pension schemes was a “structural imbalance that may damage the interests” of savers.However, Nick Hodges of Legal & General Investment Management, a leading provider of passive funds, described the document as “belly-aching” and “absolutely ill-conceived and ill-argued in its approach”.Likewise Richard Hannam, European head of passive equity at State Street Global Advisors, argued passive funds were simply the “cheapest and most effective way” for DC investors to get access to most asset classes. “If you are a DC investor you want simplicity and you want it at the cheapest cost,” he added.According to the paper, large UK DC schemes typically have 69 per cent of their assets in passive funds, with the average level for all UK schemes about 35 per cent. In contrast, passive vehicles account for just 16 per cent of assets in the much larger and more developed US DC market. “There is no other pension environment I have found where passive makes up 70 per cent,” said Magnus Spence, director of consultancy Spence Johnson, which wrote the report.Mr Spence argued the “over-use” of passive vehicles in some schemes could lead to “unintended risk imbalances”, particularly if trustees concentrated primarily on minimising costs, rather than “appropriate risk minimisation”.“If your primary concern as a trustee is to reduce costs it may be that you lose sight of some other issues, such as ensuring that there is an appropriate balance of risks,” he argued. “If you have as your goal to enable a member to achieve a certain income in retirement it makes sense, when you build that portfolio, to mitigate the risk of that not happening. In the US they are looking at asset classes according to what risk they bring with them.”Stephen Bowles, head of DC at Schroders and chairman of the DCIF, said the aim of the report was not to “bash” passive funds but to provoke debate. “There have been instances when solutions have not been considered [by trustees]. It has taken five years for diversified, multi-asset and absolute return funds to make much impact,” he said, arguing that there was a role for “active decision-making in DC in terms of asset allocation”.Mr Bowles accepted that the members of the DCIF would benefit from any roll-back in the use of passive vehicles.Mr Hodges argued: “The reason they are doing it is that they have lost so much business to the passive managers. That is why they are belly-aching about it and come up with some exercise to say we in the UK have got it wrong and in the US it is right [but] there is no evidence that people in the US get better value. In the US they are greedier than us and they think they are going to get something better than passive returns.“The reason investors have shunned active managers in the US and UK is because they can’t rely on the returns. To cite anything else is spurious.”
410;STT;State Street Corp;2011-12-04T03:35:42Z;Low-cost, tax-efficient asset with risks galore;Do investors fully understand the risks associated with ETFs?;The global market for exchange traded funds has doubled in size in just four years to nearly $1.5tn in assets today. BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard lead the market with a combined share of roughly 84 per cent of ETF assets. Amid this exponential growth, Dave Larrabee evaluates whether investors fully appreciate some of the risks associated with ETFs.What is behind the popularity of ETFs?They can be bought and sold easily, and offer tax efficiency (in some jurisdictions), low costs, and the ability to provide broad diversification within an asset class, sector or geographic region. ETFs trade throughout the day like stocks and, like stocks, can be shorted and purchased on margin.The versatility of ETFs has made them especially popular with financial advisers and individual investors. ETF sponsors have capitalised on the demand for ETF products by aggressively expanding their offerings. The development of more exotic types of ETFs, including leveraged, inverse and synthetic ETFs, have brought greater complexity to the market, and investors may not fully understand the risks embedded in these products.What are the principal risks associated with ETFs?The degree of risk ETF investors face varies depending on factors such as the type of ETF, the fund strategy, the nature of the underlying assets and the fund sponsor. Risks can include tracking error risk, counterparty risk, collateral risk and currency risk. Most of the focus of late has been on risks associated with some of the more exotic versions of ETFs, including leveraged, inverse and synthetic funds. Most leveraged and inverse ETFs are designed to deliver a multiple of the daily underlying index return using swaps, futures and other derivatives. Over longer periods of time, volatility erodes the returns that short-term oriented funds such as these are designed to deliver, often resulting in large performance differences between the ETF and its underlying index.Synthetic ETFs, which are popular in Europe and Asia, attempt to replicate an index using asset swaps with counterparties. The sponsor then backs the synthetic ETF with often lower quality, less liquid collateral that does not match the underlying assets. An ETF forced to liquidate assets could easily find that its collateral is suddenly worth much less.Are ETFs responsible for increased market volatility?While synthetic, leveraged and inverse ETFs account for a relatively small portion of industry assets, they may have an oversized impact when it comes to contributing to market volatility. The G20’s Financial Stability Board, the International Monetary Fund, and the Bank of International Settlements have each cited synthetic ETFs as potential threats to global financial stability. Critics of leveraged and inverse ETFs say they can artificially magnify sell-offs and also create short squeezes, and this systemic risk was noted in a 2010 report by the Kauffman Foundation. Whether recent market volatility can be definitively attributed to the growth of ETFs, or the use of specific ETF products, is still being studied and debated.Are there any important regulatory concerns or issues facing ETFs?Increased market volatility, including the “Flash Crash” of May 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 1,000 points in just minutes, put the regulatory spotlight on ETFs, along with high frequency trading. And the 2011 UBS rogue trading scandal involving allegedly fictitious ETF trading has heightened the scrutiny of lawmakers. The absence of over the counter (OTC) trade reporting requirements in Europe, where 60 per cent of ETF trades take place OTC, have raised transparency concerns.The US Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly investigating leveraged ETFs and their impact on market volatility. And the European Securities and Markets Authority has called for tighter regulations and recommended greater transparency and disclosure regarding the risks posed by ETFs.What are the key considerations for investors?ETFs offer investors diversification at a comparatively low cost, and strong investor demand has driven dramatic industry growth. In their more exotic forms, however, ETFs can bring unintended and excessive risk to portfolios. Accordingly, it is critical that they be analysed carefully and used judiciously by investors.David Larrabee is director of member and corporate products at CFA Institute
411;STT;State Street Corp;2011-12-01T18:35:44Z;Ermotti ousts chief risk officer at UBS;;The chief risk officer of UBS has been abruptly replaced at the Swiss bank less than fortnight after Sergio Ermotti was confirmed as chief executive.Maureen Miskovic has left the Swiss bank after less than a year in the job after joining from State Street where she was chief risk officer.She is being replaced by Philip Lofts, a UBS veteran who had held the top risk job between 2008 and 2010 before being appointed chief executive of the bank’s operations in the Americas.People close to UBS said Ms Miskovic’s departure was not the result of the bank’s $2.3bn loss in a rogue trading scandal at UBS’s London operation.However, as the executive ultimately responsible for risk, her position had been increasingly criticised by Swiss media.Before State Street, Ms Miskovic had worked at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. One of her longest stints had been at Lehman Brothers, where she was chief global risk officer between 1996 and 2002. Ms Miskovic was not available for comment.Analysts described Mr Lofts, who is aged 49 and has been with UBS for more than 20 years, as a familiar face and a safe pair of hands.“Ermotti wanted to return to a known quantity that the bank knew and trusted,” said Christian Stark, sector analyst at Cheuvreux in Zurich.Mr Lofts won plaudits during his initial stint as chief risk officer for getting to grips with UBS’s problems amassed during the credit crisis, when the Swiss group once known for its caution wrote off more than $50bn on toxic securities.He he also played a part in the big revamp of the group’s risk procedures – albeit focused on the fixed income, rather than equity, side of the business.Mr Lofts’ job as head of operations in the Americas is being assumed by Bob McCann, who will maintain his responsibilities for the group’s US wealth management operation.In recent months, questions had been raised over Mr McCann, amid market speculation he favoured a sale or spin-off of the US wealth management arm.Mr McCann joined in October 2009 as part of a management revival under former UBS chief executive Oswald Grübel. Mr Ermotti and Mr McCann spent large parts of their careers on the equities side at Merrill Lynch.In a further move, Ulrich Körner, UBS’s chief operating officer who was brought in as one of Mr Grübel’s first injections of outside talent in April 2009, will be given the additional role of chief executive for Europe, the Middle East and the Americas, a region formerly covered by Mr Ermotti.Shares in UBS closed down 1.88 per cent on Thursday at SFr10.97.
412;STT;State Street Corp;2011-11-29T18:16:35Z;Emerging markets dividends attract ETF providers;BlackRock launches rival to SSgA emerging market dividend ETF;BlackRock has became the latest exchange traded fund provider to seek to capitalise on investors’ growing interest in emerging market dividends. On Tuesday, it launched the iShares Dow Jones emerging markets select dividend ETF, a physically replicating fund which invests in 100 high yielding companies spread across 18 emerging markets.The new ETF, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, is a “distributing” fund which allows investors to withdraw income on a quarterly basis or to reinvest dividend payments.It had a yield of 7.34 per cent at the end of October, more than double the yield offered by a broad emerging markets benchmark. (FTSE All World emerging market index yield was 3.17 per cent at end October).“This ETF offers investors the potential to achieve dividend yield combined with access to the growth potential of emerging markets companies,” said Axel Lomholt, head of iShares product development EMEA, adding that it should appeal to investors who were finding it increasingly difficult to achieve their income targets with interest rates in many developed market interest rates stuck at historic lows.The new iShares ETF has a total expense ratio of 0.65 basis points, which matches the cost of State Street Global Advisors’ rival product which launched in Europe in October.SSgA’s SPDR Emerging Markets dividend ETF also tracks the performance of high-yielding stocks from emerging markets. Like the rival iShares fund, it is a physical fund so it buys the underlying constituents and it also distributes income (twice yearly). It has assets of $6.9m but its sister US-listed product which was launched in February has already seen assets surpass the $100m mark. Known as EDIV, this ETF attracted inflows of $92m by the end of October, helping lift its assets to $103.6m.Both iShares and SSgA appear to have been attracted to this space by the success of the Wisdom Tree EM equity income ETF. Known as DEM, this ETF has gathered $908m in new inflows so far this year, boosting its assets to $1.9bn. It has a yield of 7.58 per cent and it carries a total expense ratio of 63 basis points.DEM has delivered a total return of 13.7 per cent since it was launched in mid-July 2009 but this is less than the 33 per cent total return delivered by the FTSE All World emerging market index over the same period.Wisdom Tree launched DEM as a follow-up to DGS, an ETF based on small cap stocks from emerging markets which pay high dividends. DGS, which was launched in 2007, has attracted new inflows of $17m so far this year, taking its assets to $769m. Since launching in October 2007, DGS has delivered a negative total return of 10.5 per cent but this still compares favourably with the -33 per cent total return for the FTSE All World emerging market index over the same period.Robert Holderith, who founded Emerging Global Shares, a specialist ETF provider, says investors are now taking a much more focused approach to emerging makets, looking for thematic and precise exposures. Dividend focused ETFs provide one of these exposures.EGShares offering in this space looks to invest in stocks which offer both higher dividend payments and lower volatility than a broad emerging markets benchmark. This ETF, known as HILO, has attracted inflows of around $20m since it was launched in August. With just 29 constituent holdings, it is a more concentrated fund than its rivals and is slightly more expensive with an 85 basis points expense ratio.HILO has delivered a total return of -8 per cent since launch but this compares favourably with the -15 per cent total return for the FTSE All World emerging market index over the same period.
413;STT;State Street Corp;2011-11-27T03:52:02Z;Deutsche asset arm contenders touted;Contenders for Deutsche’s asset arm touted;State Street, BlackRock, BNY Mellon and JPMorgan have all been named by analysts as the most likely contenders to make a bid for parts of Deutsche Bank’s asset management division.Deutsche announced on Tuesday that “all strategic options are being considered” for its asset arm, except for its DWS retail franchise. It says this is part of the bank’s “continual effort to maintain an optimal business mix”.The German group says the move, which analysts believe will most likely end in a divestment, comes at a time of increasing costs associated with recent regulatory changes.Deutsche says “the competitive landscape” is impacting the fund arm’s growth prospects within that of a bank platform.Parts of the business covered by the review include DB Advisors, its €162bn ($215bn) institutional division, €150bn worth of insurance mandates at Deutsche Insurance Asset Management and €46bn worth of alternative assets within RREEF Alternative Investments.The review also includes its €42bn US retail arm.State Street and BNY Mellon could be among those players vying for parts of the business, says Matthew Czepliewicz, an analyst at Collins Stewart.“State Street and BNY Mellon have both been buyers of asset managers and servicers in Europe, but because [State Street] shares have been much better performers this year they might have more appetite.”The prediction comes after State Street chief executive Jay Hooley said recently that the US group was primed for a purchase in Europe, with banks likely to be forced into selling off certain “non-core” businesses.Any purchase by State Street would add to its growing European asset management capabilities. Earlier this year, the US group snapped up Bank of Ireland’s asset management arm for about €57m.Aside from State Street, Mr Czepliewicz says JPMorgan “might be willing at least to take a look at DB Advisors”, while BlackRock might have an interest in snapping up the asset management division.Another London-based analyst also cites BlackRock as a potential candidate that “springs to mind” as a suitor for parts of Deutsche’s asset management arm.Analysts predict a sale could raise about €1bn, although some suggest the different business streams will most likely be sold off in chunks, rather than a suitor buying the entire asset management division.“The combined assets may be chopped up and sold to different buyers depending on their speciality,” says Piers Brown, an analyst at Macquarie Equities Research.“It will be quite a lumpy deal to do in one chunk and the assets are all very different. It will probably be a couple or more buyers that would be interested.”Aberdeen Asset Management is also touted as a possible suitor, having already acquired parts of Deutsche’s UK asset management business in 2005.Aberdeen has previously made its ambitions known that it wants to expand its footprint in the US retail market, although chief executive Martin Gilbert recently said the firm would focus on organic growth.With any sale unlikely to be a “game changer”, according to KBW analyst Matt Clark, others are surprised it has taken Deutsche so long to consider a sale of its asset management division. Dirk Becker, analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, says: “We have wondered why they have been holding onto these businesses.“They have spent a lot of money to build a better brand and franchise but could not do it.”Assets under management from the units put up for review total about €400bn as of the end of the third quarter, with “negligible profit contribution” from these business units in recent years, say analysts at KBW.“The asset management division has been a lacklustre performer historically, but has been doing better recently,” says Mr Clark.“One has always had the sense the German retail business has been driving profits. The alternatives business seems to be making a nice contribution pre-crisis, but in post crisis environment it has been harder to maintain.”David Ricketts is a senior reporter on Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared
414;STT;State Street Corp;2011-11-18T18:08:14Z;Index tracker puts consistent dividends first;Tracker can be a waste if its index is flawed;In recent years, index tracker funds have become a mainstream investment choice both here and in the US – prompting a healthy debate about costs and performance. But one debate about passive index tracking hasn’t been properly aired: the appropriateness of the index being tracked.It needs to be, because a wonderfully transparent and low-cost tracker can be a waste of time if the index it tracks is flawed.Almost all stock market indices are weighted by their constituent companies’ value, or market capitalisation. Consequently, tracker funds weight their shareholdings in these companies in the same way. It means the biggest companies by market capitalisation dominate the index and the fund.But what happens if that weighting doesn’t recognise successful companies whose profits have powered ahead – only those companies with a high share price rating? Arguably, the index and the tracker fund end up full of the “wrong” kind of stocks at the “wrong” time.That’s why some argue that indices should be weighted by fundamental measures, such as low price/earnings or price/book value ratios. US analyst Rob Arnott has pioneered this approach with his RAFI indices, and UK fund manager Invesco Powershares now offers a range of RAFI trackers. Its RAFI UK 100 exchange traded fund (ETF) has outperformed the comparable FTSE 100 index since 2007 – not startlingly, nor consistently, but by enough to suggest it will add a “value premium” of about 1 per cent per annum over the long term.ETF specialist Invesco Powershares has a range of fundamental index trackers that provide a valuable lower-cost alternative for contrarian passive investors.Its flagship RAFI UK 100 ETF (ticker symbol PSRU) was launched in 2007 and has outperformed the comparable FTSE 100 index since then.This outperformance hasn’t been consistent but appears to add around 1 per cent per annum over the long term – which is precisely what academic studies of past performance have suggested constitutes the “value premium”.This observation is backed up by recent – if limited – data from the past month: PSRU was up 9.44 per cent in price terms while the iShares FTSE 100 ETF was up 9.1 per cent.In 2010, PSRU underperformed, rising 6.65 per cent versus 7.5 per cent for the iShares fund. But in 2009 PSRU stormed ahead by 22.8 per cent, against 17.8 per cent for the iShares tracker.However, this type of fundamental indexing is complicated and not entirely transparent – it’s hard to know the mix of fundamental measures being used. That’s why I’d prefer an index tracker focused on one factor: rising dividends backed by strong balance sheets.This idea hasn’t found an expression via a UK product – although there are dividend-weighted funds. For example, the Munro fund weights companies in the FTSE 100 index by their dividend pay-out, and the iShares UK Dividend Plus ETF is a FTSE 350 fund that only invests in the highest-yielding companies. Vanguard also has a UK Equity Income fund based on the FTSE 350 index and dividend yield, but with a bias towards larger cap companies.Thankfully, though, the US fund manager State Street has come up with some interesting offerings. It has been building an impressive range of low-cost tracker ETFs, using physical replication of an index – ie, the fund buys actual shares in the index rather than relying on a “synthetic” IOU or swap contract with a bank to provide the return.I particularly like its new tracker called the SPDR US Dividend Aristocrats fund. This tracks an index of 60 US companies from the S&P Composite 1500 Index, all of which have increased their dividends every year for the past 25 years.Crucially, the underlying index avoids concentration in a few large-cap stocks by capping any weighting to a single company at 4 per cent. But I’m more taken with the SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend Opportunities Index fund.This tracks an index of the top 100 companies in the developing world that can boast at least three years of dividend growth, a high dividend yield, and strong liquidity in their shares. According to the index designers, “individual stocks are capped at 3 per cent and both countries and sectors are capped at 25 per cent to ensure diversification”.State Street reckons this strategy of only buying into dividend-paying emerging market stocks has paid off, as the fund has outperformed the MSCI Emerging Markets index since 2009.Total expense ratios are 0.35 per cent for the US Dividend Aristocrats fund, and 0.65 per cent for the Emerging Markets Dividend Opportunities fund. That is great value compared with equivalent actively managed funds – even more so if, like me, you struggle to understand how any active fund manager can add value picking US dividend stocks. It may not have much of a record yet, but I think it’s a good core holding for any passive adventurous type wanting US exposureadventurous@ft.com
415;STT;State Street Corp;2011-11-13T07:57:10Z;Equity markets set to rally, says SSgA;Equity markets set to rally in next 3 to 6 months;Equity markets are set to rally in the next three to six months, despite all the doom and gloom shrouding the global economy.So says State Street Global Advisors, which is calling a sharp turning point in markets, with hitherto beaten-up economically sensitive stocks such as consumer cyclicals leading the rally and defensive sectors lagging.Marc Reinganum, global head of active equities for developed markets at SSgA, argued that current investor sentiment was “wrong”.SSgA’s models suggest that equity valuations, based on measures such as the price-to-book ratio, are currently cheaper than during 90 per cent of time periods since the mid-1980s, while volatility is at elevated levels.“When market volatility gets to extreme levels and market participants are most fearful, the subsequent period [of three to six months] is historically one in which risk begins to pay off,” said Mr Reinganum, who argued that a solution to the eurozone debt crisis was not necessary for a market rebound.“We are not denying [the eurozone] is a problem but we think investors have probably overreacted to what this means for equity values,” he said.
416;STT;State Street Corp;2011-11-06T05:04:35Z;New-fangled convertibles poised to take off;Many expect strong growth in cocos, securities designed to bolster struggling banks;"Mark Twain famously said reports of his death were “greatly exaggerated”, and the same might be true of contingent convertible bonds (cocos) and other new-fangled hybrid securities designed to make banks less dependent on bail-outs from taxpayers if and when they hit the rocks.Back in July, some industry commentators were predicting cocos would be strangled at birth after the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ruled the instruments could not be used to provide the enlarged equity buffers it is demanding the world’s 30 most systemically important banks erect.Yet Rabobank, the Dutch co-operative lender, last week became the first bank to issue such hybrid paper since February, and a host of houses, including Pimco, Swisscanto Asset Management, Algebris Investments and European Credit Management, have launched funds offering investors the chance to dabble in the new asset class, alongside other financial securities.“We anticipate it will become a significantly larger market,” says Satish Pulle, manager of European Credit Management’s newly launched ECM Financials Fund. “It can easily be up to €500bn.”Davide Serra, co-founder of Algebris Investments, a London-based hedge fund manager, which has raised close to $400m for its Financial CoCo Fund since May, says “they are an instrument that’s here to stay”, thanks to regulatory support in the UK, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Italy, France and Canada.Mr Serra believes cocos will account for €35bn ($48bn) of the €106bn recapitalisation of European banks agreed as part of the latest eurozone rescue plan, with the market ultimately growing to at least €300bn.Mirko Santucci, head of credit at Zürich’s Swisscanto Asset Management, which has raised $100m for its Bond Invest CoCo Fund since May, foresees a “flurry” of issuance if cocos are permitted for recapitalisation purposes.Even a disinterested party such as State Street Global Advisors foresees issuance of €180bn of coco-like debt, in spite of the Basel brush-off, with their potential attractions to banks and regulators alike heightened in the current environment.“European regulators are forcing banks to raise capital but banks don’t want to issue diluted equity because their stock price is so low, so they are deleveraging. That has already caused a quasi-credit crunch in the eurozone,” says Jay Contis, senior fixed income credit analyst at SSGA.Cocos are fixed income instruments designed to convert into equity if the issuing bank’s Tier 1 core equity capital falls below a specified level. The label also applies to hybrid bonds that are written down if these capital limits are breached, such as those issued by Rabobank which does not have listed equity.Cocos are designed to bolster bank capital in the event of a bank incurring significant losses, and ensure private capital providers absorb losses before taxpayers are called upon to provide support.SSGA calculates that of the $1,000bn of equity US banks held at the end of 2007 (supporting $10,000bn of assets), some $860bn was wiped out by losses incurred in the financial crisis. It believes the situation was worse still in Europe, where banks were typically more leveraged.Under the Basel III rules, scheduled to come into place at the start of 2013, all banks will be required to hold common equity equivalent to 7 per cent of their risk-weighted assets and an additional 3.5 per cent of subordinated debt instruments, such as cocos.Regulators in some countries, such as Switzerland, have gone further, and SSGA estimates that Credit Suisse and UBS alone will issue about €49bn of cocos or other loss-absorbing subordinated debt.So far there have only been a handful of issues, with Rabobank, Credit Suisse, Lloyds Banking Group and Bank of Cyprus raising about €5bn, with a further €500m from Allianz, the German insurer, in a bilateral deal with Japan’s Nippon Life.Mr Contis says cocos have “drawn a lot of interest from investors, particularly in the US.”Existing cocos typically offer “equity-like returns,” with yields of 8-10 per cent, and are converted to equity if a bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio falls below 8 per cent. Mr Santucci says the probability of such a trigger being breached is low, with Credit Suisse currently reporting a capital ratio of 12 per cent and Rabobank 14 per cent. “Compared to the dividend yield, cocos are very attractive and they don’t have the volatility of equities,” says Mr Santucci, who says he has seen private banks selling equities and buying cocos.Mr Serra adds: “It’s an equity instrument that pays a super-high coupon.”Mr Santucci says the Credit Suisse coco, issued in February, has so far produced a zero return (with the fall in price balanced by the income stream) even as the bank’s shares have fallen 40 per cent.“They are a reasonable canary in the coalmine, a good proxy for the credit markets’ perception of the banks and also that of their sovereign,” says Mr Pulle.Moreover, Rabobank’s coupon of 8.4 per cent is three times the 2.7 per cent payable on comparable senior debt.The Credit Suisse deal reportedly attracted an army of wealthy individuals looking for a high yield in a bank seen as relatively stable, while Mr Pulle reports interest from funds of hedge funds and insurance companies. Mr Serra says his clients include sovereign wealth funds and other “absolute return” chasing institutions.However, demand appears to be softening amid the economic gloom; while the $2bn Credit Suisse coco was 20 times subscribed, last week’s $2bn Rabobank issue reportedly attracted cover of just two times.And the concept is not expected to take off in the US, where the tax regime is not favourable, although Mr Pulle says: “If in a couple of years’ time European banks have issued a lot of these instruments and it seems to be working then I would suspect they will find a way to develop in the US.”"
417;STT;State Street Corp;2011-11-04T23:24:04Z;G20 leaders endorse ‘living wills’;;Twenty-nine banks are being targeted for capital surcharges and will be required to write “living wills” by the end of 2012 under reforms endorsed by the leaders of the Group of 20 leading economies in Cannes.As expected, the list of “global systemically important financial institutions”, revealed on Friday, includes the major US and European universal banks as well as the big US investment banks. The main surprises were the inclusion of Bank of China, which is significant domestically but small outside of China, and the omission of Intesa Sanpaolo and BBVA, but they appear to have escaped because so much of their business is in Italy and Spain respectively. The measures are part of a broad package of reforms announced on Friday by the Financial Stability Board, a group of banking regulators, aimed at preventing another wave of taxpayer-funded bank rescues like those that followed the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. New bank resolution regimes and tighter supervision of both banks and “shadow banks”, that operated just outside regulatory perimeters, will also play an important role.The 29 banks will have to hold extra top-quality capital starting in 2016. While the rates will change as banks shrink or expand balance sheets, one calculation shows five banks – JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, BNP Paribas, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland – getting a 2.5 per cent surcharge.Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Bank of America will probably have to hold an extra 2 per cent and Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Crédit Agricole, Bank of New York Mellon and UBS are likely to have to have 1.5 per cent. The remaining 15 banks would receive a 1 per cent surcharge, the estimate shows. The extra capital requirements come on top of the “Basel III” rules that will require all banks to hold core tier one capital equal to 7.0 per cent of their risk-weighted assets.Regulators plan to update the list annually and will initially be watching a total of 73 banks for potential inclusion, the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said.The list and the size of each bank’s surcharge will be based on how the institution scores on a series of measurements of its size, riskiness and importance to the broader financial system. The package ann-ounced on Friday includes tweaks to measurements based on complaints, but its general thrust is unchanged from earlier drafts.“The reforms for the too-big-to-fail institutions are very important . . . They are aimed at reducing moral hazard so that we can deal with, if needed, the failures of large institutions without hopefully having market disruption and without having to use taxpayers’ money,” said Mario Draghi, the outgoing FSB chairman.The full list of 29 banks is below:Bank of AmericaBank of ChinaBank of New York MellonBanque PopulaireBarclaysBNP ParibasCitigroupCommerzbankCredit SuisseDeutsche BankDexiaGoldman SachsCrédit AgricoleHSBCINGJPMorgan ChaseLloyds Banking GroupMitsubishi UFJ Financial GroupMizuho Financial GroupMorgan StanleyNordea BankRoyal Bank of ScotlandBanco SantanderSociété GénéraleState StreetSumitomo Mitsui Financial GroupUBSUniCredit SpaWells Fargo & Co
418;STT;State Street Corp;2011-11-03T18:05:56Z;US ETF inflows surpass $100bn;Investors rediscover appetite for equity ETFs;New inflows into US-listed exchange traded funds rose strongly in October, pushing net inflows so far this year beyond the $100bn mark.US ETFs (funds and products) gathered new inflows of $23.9bn in October, up from $4.6bn in September as investors rediscovered their appetite for long equity products that provide exposure to gains in stock markets.Net new ETF inflows for the first 10 months of the year reached $101.6bn, up 14.5 per cent on the same period in 2010.With the S&P Composite rebounding 11.8 per cent in October after falling in September, investors made large allocations to ETFs linked to long positions in US domestic stocks. These gathered inflows of $15bn in October.The world’s largest ETF, the SPDR S&P Composite ETF, known as SPY, gathered inflows of $1.2bn but it was comfortably outpaced by iShares Russell 2000 ETF, known as IWM, which attracted $2.9bn as well as the PowerShares QQQ ETF which is benchmarked to the Nasdaq Composite and drew $1.9bn.Emerging markets ETFs also enjoyed strong inflows with the MSCI emerging markets index up 13.1 per cent in October.The iShares MSCI emerging markets ETF, known as EEM, attracted inflows of $3.8bn in October, while the rival Vanguard MSCI emerging markets ETF, known as VWO gathered $1.2bn.The strong performance for EEM helped BlackRock win the race for investors’ cash with total inflows of $10.1bn in October, ahead of State Street Global Advisors which gathered $8.3bn and Vanguard which drew a total of $2.4bn.In capturing 87 per cent of all investor inflows last month, the “big three” providers – BlackRock, Vanguard and SSgA – and their well established products have re-asserted their dominance of the US market, in contrast to developments earlier this year when smaller players and new entrants were making clear progress in winning market share.Long fixed income ETFs continued to attract strong inflows in October at $4.3bn, down from $5.7bn in September. So far this year, long fixed income ETFs have gathered $33.5bn, up 16.7 per cent on the same period last year.But long commodity linked ETFs are now registering net outflows for the year at $373m, a dramatic collapse compared with 2010 when they attracted just over $8bn in the first 10 months of the year.
419;STT;State Street Corp;2011-11-01T13:20:17Z;New dividend ETF draws strong inflows;SNew PDR Dividend Aristocrats ETF attracts $100m in just 10 days;State Street Global Advisors has announced that its SPDR S&P US Dividend Aristocrats ETF has raised nearly $100m just 10 trading days after launching in Europe.The ETF invests in 60 US stocks from the S&P Composite 1500 Index that have paid consistently growing annual dividends for the last 25 years. It invests “physically” by buying the underlying stocks rather than using derivatives to deliver returns.Leslie Gent, global head of research and product solutions at Coutts said Coutts had decided to invest in the ETF because it was impressed by the product’s strong track record in the US and attracted by its physically backed methodology and low fees. The ETF carries a total expense ratio of 35 basis points.Dividend focused exchange traded funds have proved a big hit in the US with investors looking for a consistent income stream. European investors appear to share that appetite.“During the ongoing market volatility, we’ve seen a strong demand from clients for investment products which offer a steady cash flow and consistent yields,” said Ms Gent.The original US listed product, the SPDR S&P US Dividend ETF, known as SDY, has attracted new inflows of $1.3bn in the first nine months of this year, boosting its assets to $5.9bn.Rival US-listed dividend products from iShares and Vanguard have also proved highly popular.The iShares DJ US Select Dividend ETF, know as DVY, has attracted inflows of $1.3bn so far this year, helping its assets reach just over $7bn by the end of September.Meanwhile Vanguard’s Mergent Dividend ETF, known as VIG, has gathered inflows of $3.1bn, taking its assets to $7.1bn.The success of these US listed products has attracted Charles Schwab which launched its own dividend ETF, known as SCHD, in late October. It tracks the total return of the Dow Jones US Dividend 100 Index. Schwab has priced its new ETF aggressively at just 17 basis points undercutting rival products. VIG has a expense ratio of 18bps while DVY charges 40bps and SDP costs 35bps.Schwab’s move to undercut other providers might mark the first salvo in another price war for dividend ETFs. Investor inflows tend to have reacted favourably when providers have opted to compete aggressively on price in physical gold ETFs and ETFs linked to emerging markets.Eleanor Hope-Bell, SSgA’s head of intermediary business Northern Europe said dividends provided a source of income that could help offset the capital depreciation that often occurred in periods of market turbulence. Further, dividend-based strategies also captured the majority of returns when stock markets were appreciating.In 2008, the S&P Dividend Aristocrats (total return) index fell 23 per cent when the US stock market was down 37 per cent. In 2009, when the S&P rebounded 26.5 per cent, the Dividend Aristocrats index was up 18.9 per cent.Over the past 10 years, the S&P Dividend Aristocrats has returned 97.4 per cent while the S&P composite has delivered total returns of 44.8 per cent.
420;STT;State Street Corp;2011-10-31T22:40:07Z;Pension funds eye challenge to Nabors payout;;US trade union pension funds are considering a legal challenge after oil drilling company Nabors Industries said it will make a $100m cash payment to chairman Eugene Isenberg, to honour a contract clause as he stands aside as chief executive.Mr Isenberg will remain chairman of the board of directors, a salaried position, although Nabors would not comment on how much he will be paid or his working hours.The 81-year-old has been chairman and chief executive of Nabors since 1987, taking the company from a small Alaska-based operator to the world’s largest provider of land and platform drilling contract services.He also moved the company offshore to Bermuda and has ignored previous shareholder resolutions. A majority of shareholders used the “say on pay” vote enshrined in Dodd Frank legislation to express dissatisfaction at executive pay this year.“Its stunning that a long-term CEO of retirement age would be provided with severance benefits for relinquishing the position as CEO while remaining on as chairman,” said Brandon Rees, deputy director of the AFL-CIO Office of Investment. The AFL-CIO is one of the largest US union investment funds, and holds 14,288 Nabors shares, worth just under $250m.“Shareholders can bring a derivative lawsuit under the corporate waste doctrine,” Mr Rees said, although he noted Nabors move to Bermuda in 2002, which was opposed by the AFL-CIO, may make it more difficult to bring such a case.Scott Zdrazil at Amalgamated Bank, which was set up by a clothing workers’ union in 1923, criticised “the board’s inaction to implement resolutions supported by a majority of investor votes”, and said Amalgamated would take action against the payment.In 2009, Amalgamated Bank brought an unsuccessful resolution to give shareholders a vote on bonus payments to deceased Nabors executivesGovernance Metrics International, a research organisation, said the payment, which totals $160m when stock and options are included using a $19 share price, is the highest payment made to an executive who has remained with a company. Nabors shares were off 3.8 per cent to $18.33 at the close of trading in New York on Monday.Mr Isenberg is also the oldest executive to receive such a large payment, according to GMI records.“Its frankly ridiculous that this is being passed off as a termination, when he should be retiring,” said Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate at GMI.Unions face a problem in galvanising momentum against the Nabors board. Union holdings represent a fraction of Nabors’ $5bn market capitalisation.The largest shareholders are institutional money managers, including State Street and Vanguard, which tend to be passive investors, and have large holdings in most blue-chip companies because they track indices.But oil company analysts said action against the board, which approved the payment clause in Mr Isenberg’s contract, is needed.“Board members have to be held responsible,” said Philip Weiss, who follows Nabors stock at Argus Research.“Nabors has underperformed the S&P 500 over one, five and 10 years and Mr Isenberg has a long history of overpromising and underdelivering,” he added.
421;STT;State Street Corp;2011-10-31T19:52:26Z;SEC case against State Street pair thrown out;;The Securities and Exchange Commission’s case against two former State Street executives accused of misleading investors about a $3bn investment fund’s exposure to subprime mortgages was thrown out, dealing a blow to US efforts to hold individuals accountable in cases linked to the financial crisis.In a 58-page decision, Chief Administrative Law Judge Brenda Murray rejected all of the SEC’s allegations that the executives, John Flannery and James Hopkins, committed fraud, finding in one 2007 investor letter that “there is no evidence that any statement” was false.“It is with the benefit of hindsight that the [SEC] believes it was incumbent on Flannery and Hopkins to warn investors of something that the evidence shows they were unaware of at the time – the vulnerability” of subprime bonds, the judge wrote.The SEC said it was “reviewing the decision”.Mark Pearlstein, a lawyer for Mr Flannery, the former chief investment officer of State Street Global Advisors, said: “This is a case that we genuinely believe never should have been brought.”Jack Sylvia, a lawyer for Mr Hopkins, said his client was thrilled with the decision. “It may be that the SEC will be a little more circumspect in the future when they bring charges,” he said.State Street has paid $600m to settle nearly identical allegations brought by the SEC, the state of Massachusetts and investors in private lawsuits.The decision comes as the SEC is under scrutiny for not holding senior executives accountable for alleged wrongdoing tied to the financial crisis. US judges have challenged SEC settlements with companies when there are no charges against individuals. The SEC says it has charged 39 senior corporate executives in such cases.The ruling cuts both ways for the SEC. Some lawyers say it shows the SEC is arm-wrestling settlements out of companies that would rather pay than litigate to satisfy political pressures. Others say the decision shows the SEC is willing to bring cases it may not win.One issue in the case was whether investors were misled about the concentration of subprime mortgage securities held by the Limited Duration Bond Fund, launched in 2002 as a safe alternative to a money-market fund.In a July 26 letter to investors, State Street said it sold more than $1bn in holdings to reduce risk to the portfolio. The SEC alleged that was misleading because it failed to state that some sales were made to handle redemptions by certain investors, including State Street’s pension plan.
422;STT;State Street Corp;2011-10-23T03:10:11Z;Regional and global jitters prompt defensive trades;Worries about volatility are increasing demand for Asian ETFs;If only a bearish fund manager made as lucrative a tourist attraction as a panda bear, Asia these days would be much more cheerful.As it is, pessimistic investors are less photogenic than pandas – which is unfortunate, because Asia now has far more stock-selling bears than the bamboo-chewing variety.Outflows are moderating, but emerging market equity funds have seen 11 consecutive weeks of outflows, while hard-currency bond funds have seen outflows in eight of the past 10 weeks, according to Royal Bank of Scotland.In Asia, global jitters about European disorder are compounded by worries about China, where the pace of gross domestic growth has slowed for the past three quarters. That retrenchment combined with worries about unsustainable real estate development and accounting scandals at Chinese companies listed overseas has driven away investors“For the first time in a long time managers on the ground in Hong Kong are saying ‘look, there are some problems here, and we need to be really careful about what we’re doing’,” says Sarah Lien, senior research analyst at Russell Investments, which runs funds of funds.But what is it to be positioned defensively now within Asia’s diverse markets? Managers of exchange traded funds say they have seen sustained interest as fund managers look to reduce volatility by tracking broad indices, thus betting on the growth of whole markets rather than individual companies, says Frank Henze, Asia-Pacific head of ETFs at State Street Global Advisors.ETFs have proved particularly popular with investors moving into some of Asia’s frontier and smaller emerging markets, increasingly popular investments as worries mount about the sustainability of China’s growth.Countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia are considered markets driven by rising domestic consumption and thus more insulated from a slowdown in global trade than countries such as Taiwan or South Korea.Db x-trackers this year launched ETFs tracking the Philippines, while Nomura unveiled a fund tracking Malaysia and Lyxor launched one covering Indonesia. HSBC also started funds tracking Malaysia and Indonesia.Ms Lien says that within Hong Kong, fund managers have been amassing positions in blue-chip Chinese stocks like China Mobile while adding other large-cap names to increase their portfolio diversity and reduce single stock risk.On top of that, she says, managers have been rotating more money into Singapore and southeast Asia to cut exposure to China.“The China market just doesn’t offer those types of more defensive stable places to park money during a crisis,” whereas US and European markets contain many more companies that are themselves diversified worldwide, she says.Australia too – although itself not an emerging market – has offered popular defensive trades for investors looking to hedge against China, a big factor driving Australia’s large commodity sector.The rates market in Australia has been pricing in an interest rate cut, latching onto language from the central bank perceived as more dovish, suggesting that the central bank could loosen policy if growth slows. As traders point out, Australia is one of the few places where the central bank still has scope to cut rates.Other investors are taking a more contrarian view of the market, using the historically low valuations of Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies as a buying opportunity.In the short term Aberdeen Asset Management is still positioning for “further disappointment” from Europe, while Asia is not much of a safe-haven despite its high growth, says Anthony Michael, the group’s head of fixed income for Asia Pacific.Falling exports will hit open and trade-based economies hard, says Mr Michael, and for now he is focused more on sovereign, quasi-sovereign and investment-grade corporate debt.Already, investors have moved out of Asian currencies this autumn as growth in trade has slowed, he points out.Only the Japanese yen and the tightly controlled Chinese renminbi and Hong Kong dollar have risen in the past three months.However, says his colleague Hugh Young, Aberdeen’s head of equities, companies’ fundamentals can create opportunities for long-term investors.“Debt levels have come crashing down from the days of the [1997] Asian crisis,” says Mr Young. “All the businesses that we’re investing in can continue to invest in their businesses.”Part of the challenge with traditional defensive plays now in Asia, such as consumer staples, healthcare and telecoms, is that they are expensive, says Khiem Do, head of Asian multi-asset strategy for Barings Asset Management.Barings’ pan-Asia portfolio is slightly overweight Chinese companies, he says, amid a belief that fears of an economic “hard landing” in China are overblown. Valuations have fallen below the levels of 2008 by some measures.The portfolio has put some of its cash in Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks in the past two weeks, he says.“Some of them are strong companies, [it’s] just they are labelled as economically sensitive and trade sensitive so they’ve been smashed and rejected by the average investor,” he says.The equity portfolio is also run on a mostly currency unhedged basis because Barings believes that Asian currencies are currently undervalued after their September sell-offs, he says.Of the consensus bearishness, he adds: “That’s where you feel cosy, warm and nice, but in the investment world warm and nice is dangerous because that means everyone is going for the same trade. On any unexpected news they may have to reverse quite dramatically.”
423;STT;State Street Corp;2011-10-19T18:47:40Z;US regulator concerned with ETF trading;;The top US securities regulator said it was concerned about risks posed by the growth of complex exchange traded funds and intended to continue closely monitoring the booming market.A surge in market volatility over the past three months has heightened worries that the growth of the more complex funds, which rely on using borrowed money to amplify returns, have been a contributing factor and represent a potential systemic risk.ETFs that aim to produce magnified or inverse returns to their underlying index have grown in popularity. Such funds represent just a sliver of the market, $32bn out of $954bn in total US ETF assets as of September, but have grown by nearly a third this year compared with 8 per cent for all ETFs, according to State Street Global Advisors.A key cause for concern is the fact that inverse and leveraged ETFs make a flurry of trades at the end of each day in order to match the fund’s performance to moves in its underlying assets.Eileen Rominger, director of the investment division at the Securities and Exchange Commission, told the Senate banking committee on Wednesday that the agency is studying whether such ETFs have contributed to market volatility as a result of their need to rebalance.She said existing evidence “tends to support that thesis” and that “it is something we’re doing more work on and we hope to reach some conclusions in due course”.The SEC has recently stepped up efforts to police ETFs. Last year it stopped issuing exemptions that would allow ETFs to be primarily based on derivatives, and this August it issued a concept release that suggested the use of derivatives was allowing funds to exceed legal limits on leverage.The ETF industry has agreed with many of those concerns, as scrutiny arose following the discovery of a rogue trader at UBS earlier this year who primarily traded ETFs.Earlier this month, BlackRock, the largest sponsor of ETFs, representing about 40 per cent of all assets, unveiled a series of proposals for reforms.Noel Archard, managing director at BlackRock, said at the hearing that proposals included stripping leveraged and inverse products of the “ETF” label. “[Leverage and inverse] products make up less than 10 per cent of ETF assets in the US, but have created about concern about all ETFs,” he said.But Harold Bradley, an outspoken critic of ETFs and chief investment officer of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, told the committee that “my big concerns about ETFs are not the sponsors but who trades these instruments”.Mr Bradley said that there were problems with the process of creating ETFs that allowed many more shares than actually existed to be lent out, creating volatility and potential counterparty risks. “That’s where you have a systemic problem,” he said.However, Eric Noll, executive vice-president for transaction services at Nasdaq, the stock exchange, said that “we have not seen any signs that ETFs or leveraged ETFs cause volatility during the day or at the close“, arguing that volatility was “a function of the overall economy”.Not all members of the ETF industry agreed with BlackRock’s proposal. Michael Sapir, chief executive of ProShares, an ETF sponsor, said after the hearing: “The classification system recommended by BlackRock is arbitrary, anticompetitive and unworkable. The recommendation may serve BlackRock’s competitive interests, but would not serve investors’ interests and likely result in confusion.”
424;STT;State Street Corp;2011-10-19T12:33:17Z;BNY Mellon earnings rise amid turbulence;;Bank of New York Mellon reported a 4.7 per cent rise in profits to $651m amid a quarter in which the world’s largest custody bank replaced its chief executive and battled fresh lawsuits alleging fraud from multiple US state attorneys-general and the Department of Justice.Assets under custody rose 6 per cent from the same period last year to $25,900bn, the bank said, suggesting clients are not fleeing the company after state and federal allegations that the bank regularly defrauded customers including pension funds on foreign exchange trades. Assets under management also increased, rising 5 per cent to $1,200bn. The company said new business accounted for the growth.Shares of the bank fell 1.2 per cent to $19.54 in New York trading on WednesdayNon-interest expenses increased 6 per cent, and its share as a percentage of revenues also rose, from 72.7 per cent in the third quarter of last year to 75 per cent the same period of this year.The company has come under increased pressure from investors and Wall Street analysts to rein in costs as BNY fights to maintain profit levels despite the continuing squeeze on net interest margins. It announced job cuts earlier this year and has pledged to cut expenses.Analysts have questioned the bank’s strategy in dealing with a multiple of issues, from legal risks – like the lawsuits from the justice department, New York, Florida and Virginia – to more structural challenges like BNY’s ability to weather the current low interest rate environment and its effect on profit margins.Net interest margins fell year-on-year from 1.7 per cent to 1.3 per cent, reflecting the bank’s difficulties at finding higher-yielding investments for its growing pile of deposits. The flattening from the preceding quarter was mostly due to an influx of “pretty hot money” into customers’ deposit accounts. For example, non-interest-bearing deposits surged 71 per cent quarter-on-quarter to $73.4bn.“If the balance sheet had been stable, we estimate the margin probably would have been up slightly,” said Thomas Gibbons, BNY’s chief financial officer.Two weeks ago, the state of New York and the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan filed separate lawsuits against BNY, claiming that the company defrauded and misled pension funds, US banks and millions of investors nationwide on currency transactions for 10 years. New York is seeking to recover more than $2bn.The lawsuits claim that the bank bought and sold foreign currencies at the worst rate at which the currency traded on the day of the trade, as opposed to the market price at the time of the trade. The suits alleges that the bank kept the difference. The states of Virginia and Florida filed similar suits earlier this year.The bank has rejected the accusations and vowed to fight the claims, describing the claims as “flat out wrong, both on the law and on the facts”. It also said on Wednesday that clients had not left as a result of the claims.“We have not seen any attrition over the FX matter,” said chairman and chief executive Gerald Hassell, who took over from Robert Kelly on August 31.BNY’s revenues off foreign exchange jumped 38 per cent year-on-year to $221m, due largely to increased volatility and higher volumes, the bank said.Separately, in August New York attorney-general Eric Schneiderman accused the bank of “repeated fraud and illegality” in asking a state judge to reject a proposed $8.5bn settlement agreement over soured loans between Bank of America and a group of investors which BNY served as trustee. Mr Schneiderman claimed BNY “knowingly, repeatedly and consistently” misled investors into thinking that the mortgage bonds they purchased were created properly.The bank has denied Mr Schneiderman’s mortgage bond allegations.On Tuesday, rival custody bank State Street reported an 11 per cent rise in earnings. BNY’s share price has fared worse than peers State Street and Northern Trust, plummeting nearly 35 per cent year-to-date through Tuesday’s close. State Street has fallen 19 per cent while Northern Trust has dropped 30 per cent.
425;STT;State Street Corp;2011-10-18T14:31:39Z;US banks rise despite Goldman loss;;Bank stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday even though Goldman Sachs posted its second quarterly loss as a public company and Bank of America only avoided being in the red after accounting adjustments and disposals.The main S&P 500 was up 2 per cent at 1,225.38, its highest close since August 3.But Apple, the highest weighted stock in the index, fell more than 5 per cent in after-hours trading, after the firm reported quarterly earnings of $7.05 a share, on revenue of $28.3bn, both much lower than expected.That knocked S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures significantly, suggesting both indices may open lower on Wednesday.Goldman, the biggest US investment bank by market capitalisation, closed up 5.5 per cent to $102.25 despite posting an 84 cents per share loss as the bank’s investments were hit by falling asset prices.Investors were cheered as the bank revealed $2bn in share buy-backs, significantly more than expectedBut Richard Staite, US bank analyst at Atlantic Equities warned: “I think the management will be reluctant to shrink the balance sheet and return much more capital to investors through buy backs”.Goldman took a $1bn hit on its investment in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and $1.9bn in other mark-to-market losses. Investment banking net revenues fell 33 per cent year-on-year to $781m as underwriting revenues seized up with the initial public offering market stalling over the summer.Bank of America surged 10.1 per cent to $6.64 after posting earnings per share of 56 cents on net profit of $6.2bn, its first profit since the first quarter of 2011.But stripping out $3.6bn from the sale of a stake in China Construction Bank and a $4.5bn boost from an accounting adjustment widely used by banks this earnings season to bolster the value of their own debt, BofA was lossmaking.“It’s a relief just to get through most of the major bank announcements and not hear anything too terrible,” said Randy Warren, principal of Warren Financial Service.Mr Warren initiated a position in BofA in August when the stock sunk to $7 and he was impressed by the bank’s work to boost its capital position.BofA’s tier 1 common equity ratio reached 8.65 per cent, well on course to meet Basel III requirements by 2019.Trust bank State Street jumped 10.7 per cent to $37.49 after posting earnings per share of 96 cents, handily beating the average forecast in a Bloomberg poll of analysts of 88 cents.That gave a boost to its rivals Bank of New York Mellon, up 7.6 per cent to $19.77, and Northern Trust, up 4.4 per cent to $38.78, but analysts warned State Street’s performance might not be mirrored at other trust institutions.“State Street is less banklike than the other two, which means it faces less regulatory risk and is less vulnerable to losses on outstanding loans,” said Jeff Hopson at Stifel Nicolaus.Financials in the S&P 500 were up 5 per cent, significantly outperforming every other sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6 per cent to 11,577.05 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.6 per cent to 2,657.43, into positive territory for the year.In a frantic last hour of trading the S&P 500 had jumped as high as 1,233 on reports Germany and France have agreed the outlines of a $2trn European bail-out package, but sellers forced the market back down towards 1,220, where all previous rallies this summer have ended.Homebuilders, which had been sold heavily on Monday as bank earnings figures suggested mortgage delinquencies may be on the rise again, rebounded strongly.Lennar was up 9.3 per cent to $15.92, DR Horton jumped 11 per cent to $10.59 and PulteGroup was up 11.2 per cent to $4.46 after a better than expected sentiment report from the National Association of Homebuilders.Pharmaceutical company Hospira plunged 21 per cent to $29.51, after it cut its earnings per share guidance for the year to between $2.95 and $3.05, less than the analyst consensus estimate of $3.91, because of production problems at its largest manufacturing plant.IBM fell 4.1 per cent to $178.90 after the computer giant’s quarterly earnings, out after the close of markets on Monday, showed flat performance in major European markets.Coca-Cola was down 0.4 per cent to $66.74 despite reporting increased profit of $2.22bn, as margins shrank.Motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson fell 7.8 per cent to $34.31. Quarterly results appeared strong with retail sales up 5.4 per cent year-on-year, much better than expected. But margin was hit by the strong dollar and restructuring costs at its main manufacturing plant in York, Pennsylvania.
426;STT;State Street Corp;2011-10-17T11:33:27Z;State Street called on to unload SSgA;Activist investor ratcheting up pressure for fund unit spinoff;State Street Corp has come under pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz to unload its State Street Global Advisors unit.Mr Peltz’s Trian Fund Management, which owns 3.3 per cent of the custody bank, went public Sunday evening with its recommendations for boosting State Street’s share price, including selling or spinning off SSgA.“Shareholders would benefit, as asset managers typically trade at higher multiples than custody banks…[and] a separation would unlock the strategic value inherent in State Street’s fast-growing passive investment management franchise,” Trian said in a white paper released to the public.State Street has resisted Trian’s calls in private communications for more than a year, prompting Sunday’s public appeal that sets the stage for a shareholder battle.“If management and the board fail to make progress, Trian may decide to become significantly more active in evaluating its alternatives as a large shareholder,” Trian said.Trian is proposing State Street rein in costs, return more capital to shareholders and initiate a “tax-free spin” of SSgA or Reverse Morris Trust transaction, in which SSgA would be spun off to State Street shareholders then merged with a “complementary publicly traded asset management company”.SSgA oversees $239.6bn in exchange traded fund assets, ranking as the second-biggest ETF manager player behind BlackRock’s iShares. Trian references iShares’ 2009 sale to BlackRock for $13.5bn as a potential model, saying “SSgA could likewise become an attractive acquisition candidate”.State Street issued a statement late Sunday in response to Trian’s release, saying “our business has remained resilient” and it “maintained the strongest capital position among our closest peers”. Capital would continue to be returned to shareholders, State Street added, “with the approval of the Federal Reserve and within the context of growing our business”. The Fed imposes limitations on how much capital can be returned.
427;STT;State Street Corp;2011-10-09T05:22:52Z;A question of survival for custodians;Custodian banks in Europe are faced with a raft of new rules and costs;From the bowels of the earth a distant rumbling can be heard. The denizens of European custodian banks are positively quivering with anger at the responsibilities being heaped on them by regulators. Many are weighing how they might share with their clients the costs that a glut of new rules forces them to pay, whether they will be more profitable by shifting business away from Europe and how they might position themselves for a regulation-related wave of consolidation.In the wake of the Madoff and Lehman collapses, the coming Ucits V and alternative investment fund managers directives have been framed to tighten the rules under which custodian banks operate. The final shape of either directive is still not known, but it is clear that regulators aim to make depositaries fully liable for assets.The directives make a custodian liable for “unjustifiable failure to perform its obligation or its improper performance of them”, including failures at its sub-custodians. It renders the custodian liable for all losses suffered as a result “of the depositary’s negligent or intentional failure to properly perform its obligations”. Losses must either be made good by replacing the lost instruments with similar instruments or through cash compensation.Their new fiduciary duties will range from monitoring cashflows (making sure that subscription monies actually arrive in accounts), to subjecting third-party sub-custodians to prudential supervision, to setting limits to rehypothecation.The extent of the demands is alarming, says Charley Cock, head of client development at BNP Paribas Securities Services. “The authorities are looking to custodians to guarantee the ultimate safety of all assets. Regulators are moving towards an environment where global custody is responsible for the entire asset chain.”Responsibility for failures of sub-custodians is the final straw for some. “My clients demand that I service them across all asset classes in every part of the world,” says Mr Cock. Custodians often have to appoint agents, but in some countries there is very little choice. “My responsibility should be limited to the prudent selection of the sub-custodian,” says Mr Cock.“We are there to support our clients, not to insure every risk from forex to renationalisation.”Even substantial due diligence may not be enough to offset the risks: a sub-custodian could collapse because of a risky loan made by another part of the bank. In addition, in many countries, it is not clear whether bank assets are guaranteed by the state.It is not impossible to imagine that investment in “problem” countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland could be muted in the future because custodians do not wish to take the riskFor a few custodians, this represents an opportunity: Citi, for one, services 98 per cent of its world markets through its proprietary network and relies little on sub-custodians.For the rest, the likelihood is that costs will rise and that clients will have to share the burden. Asset managers currently pay 3-6 basis points for custody depending on the size of the fund, but that could double under the new rules. As Chandresh Iyer, global head of custody at Citi, notes: “There will be a repricing of services based on the changing risk management requirements.”That is, custodians will accept more risk and agree to outsource more services, but investment houses will pay for it.Citi is so confident that clients will be prepared to pay more for custody services it has launched a new offering, Enhanced Custody, which goes beyond the safekeeping of assets and tackles activities such as investment servicing, compliance, risk and performance measurement.A higher cost environment in Europe and the consequent erosion of margins could lead asset managers and custodians alike to start migrating to Asia and the US, which has similar principles but does not apply them so severely.“There is more work, more liability and more responsibility for the same pay,” says Paul Bodart, head of EMEA operations at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, in Brussels.“I alerted the EU authorities to the fact that if it pushed too hard on AIFM and Ucits V and put too much emphasis on custodians, the fund business could shift to countries where the requirements are lower.”Although there could be a long-term trickle of business from Europe to the US and Asia, the more immediate impact could be further consolidation in Europe. Custodians are groaning under the weight of coming regulations aside from Ucits and AIFM. Mr Cock says: “I have been in this business for 30 years and have never seen so much hitting the market simultaneously.”The bill for Fatca alone runs into the tens of millions for the larger custodians. The effort involved in tracking the ultimate investors and reporting their positions and income on behalf of the US government has proved painful. Then there is T2S, Dodd-Frank, Basel III, Solvency II and a raft of others to comply with.The inevitable outcome is a rise in the cost base of the custody business. “Pricing hasn’t changed yet, but when regulations are in place it will,” says Mr Cock.The 10-12 truly global custodians, led by the big four of JPMorgan, BNY Mellon, State Street and Citi, are widely predicted to take the entire global market share within a few years.“Being number one or two in your domestic market can no longer ensure your survival,” says Mr Cock.The three French custodians, for instance, all have ambitions to be global firms, but common sense dictates there is at best room for two, perhaps only one.For now, competition between custodians ensures that asset managers have the upper hand in pricing. Regulatory pressures on custodian banks and the likelihood of a new wave of consolidation is likely to change that balance for good.phil@phil-davis.co.ukThis is part of a monthly series on regulation
428;STT;State Street Corp;2011-10-06T03:16:45Z;Yahoo surges on Microsoft takeover reports;;Shares in US internet portal Yahoo rose 9 per cent in the last two hours of trading on reports that Microsoft is considering a bid.An existing tie-up means Yahoo’s website is powered by Microsoft’s Bing search engine, leaving some analysts sceptical of the value of a bid.“Why buy the cow when you already get the milk for free?” said Herman Leung, senior internet analyst at Susquehanna Financial.“Its not clear what’s in it for Microsoft, but if anyone has the cash, it’s them, so you can’t rule it out.”Buyers pushed Yahoo up to $15.77, a rise of 20 per cent on the week, on hopes of a bidding war between Microsoft and Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce site, which confirmed its interest in buying out the California-based group last Friday.Microsoft closed up 2.2 per cent to $25.89.The broad S&P 500 was up 1.8 per cent to 1,144.04 as the International Monetary Fund pushed for a speedy recapitalisation of European banks, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said she was inclined to act soon. That followed a 4 per cent surge in the last 40 minutes of trading on Tuesday, after the Financial Times broke news of European government talks about co-ordinated bank recapitalisations.Wednesday’s gains left the benchmark up 1 per cent for the week and 50 points clear of the bear market territory it had traded in for much of Tuesday.Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, warned: “It’s still difficult for retail and institutional investors to commit to this market. With volatility still elevated, it’s a day trader’s market.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent to 10,939.95 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.3 per cent to 2,460.51.Bank of New York Mellon fell 2.9 per cent to $18.28 after the bank was hit by government lawsuits for allegedly systematically mispricing forex transactions for clients over 10 years. That briefly pushed down shares in all the major US trust banks as investors absorbed further reputational damage to the industry.But State Street, which is subject to a separate $54m civil lawsuit for forex mispricing, closed up 1.3 per cent to $32.47, and Northern Trust, which is not subject to litigation, was also up 1 per cent to $36.37.Brad Hintz, trust bank analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the financial implications of the lawsuits facing State Street and BNY Mellon were manageable.“Fraud is hard to prove. And although this will encourage more civil lawsuits, the dollar amounts involved aren’t large,” he said.Residential real estate investment trusts suffered in the morning session.Equity Residential fell 1 per cent to $51.70 and AvalonBay Communities was off 1.2 per cent to $111.55.Reits have attracted flows from yield-seeking investors because they are required to pay out any profits in dividends. They have been able to take advantage of a recovery in the rental market faster than commercial reits, because tenancies come up for renewal more frequently. But their dependence on short-term funding from the repo market is worrying some investors.Sectoral movements in the S&P 500 hinted at positive sentiment.Cyclical materials and energy stocks were up 4.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively.Alpha Natural Resources, the Appalachian metallurgical coal miner, whose share price has been hit by concerns over Chinese demand, jumped 12 per cent to $19.70. Refiner Tesoro was up 13.8 per cent to $21.95.Apple inched up 1.5 per cent to $378.25. Investors were underwhelmed by the launch of the latest iPhone model. The stock is down 2.1 per cent for the week.Jefferies analyst Peter Misek predicted a quick turnround once investors tune into the upgrades “under the hood” of the iPhone.Costco fell 1.7 per cent to $80.25, despite reporting fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $27.58bn, a 17 per cent increase on the same quarter last year. Some analysts had expected even better results from the wholesale club, while investors were cautious about the company’s decision to increase membership fees to offset rising commodity costs.Seed company Monsanto rose 5.2 per cent to $66.25, after reporting better than expected fiscal fourth quarter results. The company also promised to restate its financial results for the past three fiscal years as a result of a federal investigation into incentives paid to distributors of its herbicide.

That decline would have been even bigger were it not for inflows of $3.7bn for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, known as SPY.But even after the withdrawals in September, domestic long US equity ETFs have still managed to attract $20.6bn in new cash the first three quarters of this year, almost double the $10.8bn gathered by the same time in 2010.Fixed income ETFs saw inflows rise in August in spite of long term Treasury yields trading at multi-decade lows. Long fixed income ETFs gathered inflows of $5.7bn in September, up from $4.7 in August.So far this year, long fixed income ETFs have attracted inflows of $29.2bn, up from $27.1 over the same period in 2010.Vanguard continues to lead the race among providers for investors’ cash, gathering just under $28bn so far this year, compared with $26.9bn over the same period in 2010.Meanwhile BlackRock, the world’s largest ETF provider, has seen US inflows fall to $12.7bn from $20.8bn while State Street Global Advisors, the second largest provider has also seen inflows slow, to $5.3bn from $7.1bn.Among the “new wave” of players who are attempting to break dominance of the “big three” players in the US market, Van Eck, Wisdom Tree, Charles Schwab and Pimco have all enjoyed substantial increases in inflows so far this year.For Van Eck, inflows in the first three quarters of this year jumped to $6.7bn from $2.2bn in the same period last year, while Wisdom Tree’s inflows have more than doubled to $3.2bn from $1.3bn. Charles Schwab has seen inflows rise from $2bn from $1.3bn while Pimco has benefited from its deep expertise in fixed income markets and seen inflows increase to $1.4bn from $806m.

AMR ended the day down 33 per cent at $1.98 on speculation that the company may file for bankruptcy.A sell-off in big bank stocks followed almost immediately afterwards. Citigroup led fallers down 9.8 per cent to $23.11, Bank of America fell 9.6 per cent to $5.53, a full 47 cents below its previous year low. Goldman Sachs was down 4.7 per cent to $90.08. All three stocks were at levels not seen since March or April 2009.Morgan Stanley fell to a level not seen since December 2008. The stock was down 7.7 per cent to $12.47, amid heavy trading in options.In just three hours of trading, open interest in $5 October puts on Morgan Stanley – giving buyers the right to sell 100 Morgan Stanley shares for $5 in October – increased by a factor of five to 24,000. The cost of $5 October puts doubled from 12 to 25 cents during the day.The cost of default protection on Morgan Stanley’s debt rose to 558 basis points at the close of the New York Session, up 72bp. That equates to $558,000 a year to insure $10m of Morgan Stanley debt for five years.Bank of America CDS rose 30bp to an all-time wide spread of 446bp, while Citigroup rose 33bp to 348bp.Shell-shocked banking analysts were at a loss to explain the falls.“I left for lunch at midday and things were quiet, I came back and the bottom had fallen out of banks,” Christopher Mustacio at Stifel Nicolaus said.Tentative explanations ranged from the reports about American Airlines, although the company’s $11bn is unlikely to sink a bank, to exposures to Europe, where Franco-Belgian bank Dexia had been downgraded, before markets opened.But all analysts agreed the falls did not reflect the fundamentals. “Investors are afraid of 2008, there’s a sell first, ask questions later attitude,” said Mr Mustacio.Dan Greenhouse, chief investment strategist BTIG, said investors might be “derisking in case the S&P 500 breaks through 1,100, because a lot of people think it will fall a lot more if it does”.And therein lies the importance of the 1,100 figure. Although the S&P 500 has suffered heavy selling during August and July, the 1,100 had served as a signal for bargain hunters to pour back in to the market. When the benchmark index touched its previous year intraday low of 1,101.54 on August 9, it rebounded immediately, closing the day at 1,172.88.On Monday, the barrier was broken in the last minutes of trading, holding out hopes for a quick bounce on Tuesday.But Monday’s losses leaves the S&P 500 perilously close to bear market territory, signalled by a fall of 20 per cent from a previous cyclical high. The benchmark index is down 19.4 per cent since its April 29 peak.Shares in trust banks also fell sharply, after Sanford Bernstein Research evaluated the revenue impact of a flatter yield curve on lending margins, and revenue from reinvested earnings.Bank of New York Mellon fell 4.7 per cent to $17.72, State Street lost 5.5 per cent to $30.40 and Northern Trust Corporation retreated 2.8 per cent to $34.01.Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz said earnings per share at all three institutions could suffer a 3-4 per cent hit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.4 per cent to 10,665.08 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 3.3 per cent to 2335.83.Yahoo jumped 2.7 per cent to $13.53 as Wall Street had its first chance to react to news of a potential bid that broke after the markets closed Friday.Jack Ma, chairman of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, which is 40 per cent owned by Yahoo and controls Yahoo China, told an audience at Stanford university that he was “very, very interested” in buying Yahoo.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar fell 8.4 per cent to $57.90 as analysts weighed the company’s sales of the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch I and 550MW Desert Sunlight plants, immediately after securing government loan guarantees on Friday.Micron Technology, a volatile semiconductor stock that suffered heavy selling last week after poor quarterly results, was down a further 14.1 per cent to $4.33, the first time the stock has broken through the $5 level since 2009. Fellow semi stock Advanced Micro Devices fell 10.8 per cent to $4.53 as fallout from weak quarterly results last week continued.Frontier Communications fell 7.4 per cent to $5.66 after Macquarie recommended that clients sell the stock due to the telecommunications group’s dependence on high-yield debt funding.Pharmaceutical Product Development jumped some 25.8 per cent to $32.28 after confirming that it would be acquired by Carlyle Group and Hellman & Friedman in a $3.9bn cash deal.Energy and industrial stocks linked to global economic growth, however, sold off heavily.Wynn Resorts fell 0.7 per cent to $114.32. The company is down by a third in just two weeks, on fears of a decline in junket tourism to the Chinese gaming island of Macau, which accounts for up to a third of the company’s revenue.

432;STT;State Street Corp;2011-09-23T17:21:21Z;Distribution: New rules expected to boost retail flows;Global regulators are moving towards fee-based models for advice;Eleanor Hope-Bell, who heads State Street Global Advisor’s Northern European business, has a ready pitch to retail investors: “Transparency about what you’re investing in, the liquidity to enter or exit a fund intraday, and low management fees.”Add to that the potential to outperform traditional mutual funds, because ETFs are not handicapped by flow costs – the expense associated with cashing shareholders into and out of funds – and there is a compelling case for individual investors to use ETFs.BlackRock, the biggest issuer of ETFs globally, estimates that two-thirds of assets in its US iShares suite are retail and only a third institutional. However, the inverse is true for its funds under management in Europe.Issuers are hopeful that regulatory changes could drive retail business in Europe. Proposals under the UK Financial Services Authority’s retail distribution review would prevent independent financial advisers from taking commission from fund managers for directing clients’ investments to their products. Advisers would charge a fee for their advice instead, aligning their incentives with clients.The FSA move is part of a wider trend among global regulators towards fee-based models for advice, which are already established practice in the US, because of bottom-up pressure from retail investors.“Anything that makes investment offerings stand on their own two feet is beneficial for ETFs,” says Scott Ebner, head of product development for SSgA’s ETFs. “It allows the value on offer to show up.”ETFs also offer individuals the chance to cut financial advisers out of the investment process altogether. iShares allows individuals to trade in and out of its funds via its website, or even with an iPhone app.But even in the US, there is a notable reluctance among issuers to market directly to individuals.“Only about 10 per cent of our flows are unmediated trades by retail investors, and we’re happy with that,” says Jennifer Grancio, managing director at iShares. “It’s one thing for a retail investor to buy an ETF tracking an index like the S&P 500, but when products are more complex, we think financial advisers are key.”When it comes to institutional investors, which potentially represent a far bigger market than retail, issuers are less cautious about pushing their products, especially to slow-adopting European institutions. “When I talk to some British pension fund managers about ETFs, the reaction can still be ‘ET what?’” says Ms Hope-Bell. Even in the US, a Greenwich Associates survey found only 15 per cent of institutional investors were using ETFs at all by the end of 2010.Those institutions that are users tend only to allocate a small proportion of their portfolio to ETFs. Pension funds use ETFs to quickly deploy cash, which would otherwise be idle. Other funds use ETFs for transition trades, to keep exposure to a sector or country, while rebalancing a portfolio, or picking between active fund managers. “If we’re talking about a time horizon of six months, there’s a big risk of underperformance from an active manager,” says Stephen Doran, a fund manager at HSBC Global Asset Management. “In those situations, ETFs are a cost-efficient way of having a passive exposure.”He estimates 15 per cent of his portfolio is in ETFs, but “for longer-term strategies, we’d be looking at private equity, hedge funds, or picking active managers”.Mr Doran’s approach would seem to be representative. Greenwich Associates estimates that only a third of the institutions that use ETFs do so for investments of longer than a year.Institutional use of ETFs for cash utilisation and transition trading is a boon for issuers.“Institutions like pension funds are so huge that even if a tiny proportion of their funds under management are in ETFs, that is a significant fillip for the industry,” says Mr Ebner.But ambitious issuers say institutions could deploy the majority of their portfolios through ETFs.“The potential is there for institutions to use ETFs for their entire baseline strategy,” says Mr Lytle. “What’s left of the portfolio can be used to go long or short on individual stocks or sectors, where they have conviction.”In May, a Greenwich Associates survey found only 23 per cent of institutions using ETFs employed them for baseline exposure to domestic equities. That fell to 13 per cent for exposure to international equity markets.One of the hurdles to further institutional use is liquidity. Although ETFs accounted for more than a third of all trading on US equity markets in August, according to iShares, liquidity can be sparse beyond the most popular funds.That can make it hard for an institution to move the large funds – tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in a single trade – required to execute an institutional asset allocation strategy.“We tend to move in and out of ETFs through over- the-counter trades,” says Mr Doran, “because there is not enough natural liquidity from market makers on exchanges.”Some institutional investors and issuers fear that excessive innovation may be fragmenting liquidity. This problem is exacerbated in Europe, where the same ETF may be traded on several different exchanges.“I think for the European market in particular, there is a problem of getting a critical mass of liquidity in ETFs, which means issuers being more restrained,” says Mr Lytle.Ensuring sufficient liquidity will be especially important as ETF issuers seek to offer institutional investors access to new asset classes, such as fixed income products, and funds with returns linked to volatility.
433;STT;State Street Corp;2011-09-23T17:21:21Z;Market share: Battling for assets alongside the Big Three;The biggest three ETF providers recognise their market dominance is fragile;To those standing on the sidelines of the exchange traded fund industry, attempts to make inroads into the market share of the world’s largest three players must seem like an insurmountable challenge.iShares, State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) and Vanguard currently dwarf their closest competitors, commanding around 69 per cent of the global ETF business between them, leaving those further down the pecking order with the daunting task of playing catch-up.In the US, the same three players have an even tighter grip on the market, with the trio holding some 84 per cent of ETF assets, according to BlackRock figures from the end of July.Turn to Europe, and the picture is very different. BlackRock’s iShares still holds onto its number one spot by some margin (37 per cent market share), but SSgA lingers as the 17th largest provider (0.4 per cent market share). Vanguard, meanwhile, is yet to get out of the starting blocks with its European ETF offering.Talk around the ETF industry is prone to focusing on league tables and on which providers are nibbling at the market share of the industry’s established players. Change at the top is rare, although recent events have shown that even large players are susceptible to being overtaken.Lyxor was recently ousted by db x-trackers as Europe’s second largest ETF provider.While providers continue to grapple for assets, Scott Burns, director of ETF research at Morningstar, says it is difficult to identify the real “winners and losers” when the industry is still in its growth phase. “In a sense they all are winners as they all continue to gather assets,” he says.BlackRock figures show iShares is not the only player enjoying strong growth. Despite it garnering net new assets of $14.6bn in Europe to the end of July, UBS pulled in an impressive $4.2bn, Source $3bn and Amundi $2.4bn.In the US, Charles Schwab recorded net new assets of $1.8bn, while Van Eck and Wisdom Tree have pulled in $5.1bn and $3.5bn respectively during the 12 month period to the end of July.Mr Burns adds: “Market share slippage is usually a discussion to be had when a market is matured and the pie is not growing any more. With ETFs, everyone gets a trophy if each is growing their overall market share.”Although the industry is still in expansion mode, Daniel Draper, global head of ETFs at Credit Suisse, argues the formula used by firms in the past to hoover up assets will no longer ensure future success.Investment banks, for example, no longer have the deep pockets they once had to plough investment into their ETF distribution teams and get large marketing campaigns off the ground.Instead, scale is what will become “crucial” to increasing market share. Using its weight is something Mr Draper hopes will see Credit Suisse realise its ambition of reaching $20bn in assets under management in the near future.It certainly sounds achievable. The firm is currently the fourth largest ETF provider in Europe and has jumped from around $10bn to $19bn in assets during the past 18 months.Mr Draper’s outlook on the future ETF landscape is clear-cut. “Over the next three to five years the ETF industry can only have two or three big winners. If you have ambitions to be a top three player, you need to build scale.”Joe Linhares, head of iShares’ EMEA business, agrees. However, he says new entrants do not always appreciate how scale, product manufacturing capabilities and distribution are all important factors.“An ETF business is not one where you can launch a few products and expect to gather assets,” says Mr Linhares. “You need to focus on clients and scale can help with that.”But even those with significant muscle in the ETF arena recognise the challenges of replicating their dominance across all markets.“We understand we have some way to go in Europe,” says Jim Ross, senior managing director and global head of SPDR ETFs at SSgA. In an attempt to beef up its European ETF business, SPDR ETFs launched 14 new ETFs this year and plans to bring more to market before the close of 2011.Mr Ross says: “We have one of the largest ETF AUM bases globally, but a much smaller number of products than our competitors. Hence SPDR ETFs does not launch products for the sake of it and only launches products it believes clients will appreciate and use.”While space still exists for late arrivals, those looking to compete with established players are being advised to stand out, even if this requires being niche.“Creativity is needed if you want to push ahead, but you are going to have to make your bets,” says Mr Draper.Others believe existing players need to up their game. “Though the ETF space is relatively new, what the market needs is a breath of fresh air,” says Mebane Faber, chief investment officer at US-based Cambria Investment Management.“We’re at a stage in the development of the ETF market where certain vanilla products have been launched over and over. Some segments are oversaturated with ‘me-too’ funds, where providers jumped into the arena simply because it was the popular thing to do.”
434;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;China: Increased trade lifts banks’ profile;High entry barriers may limit their global role at first, says Sharlene Goff;The increased presence of Chinese lenders at high-profile transaction banking events indicates their ambition to burst into a business that has long been dominated by a handful of big international groups.Driven by the loosening of restrictions on China’s currency – the renminbi – and a growing recognition of the resilience of areas such as cash management, custody and settlement, big Chinese banks are keen to build up their businesses.But while the additional competition is squeezing pricing for banks such as JPMorgan, Citigroup and State Street in the US and HSBC and Standard Chartered in Britain, it is also bringing opportunities for big operators.International banks say rapidly growing demand from Chinese companies to trade and invest overseas provides them with an opportunity to forge lucrative partnerships.Karen Fawcett, group head of transaction banking at Standard Chartered, says domestic Chinese banks have been “strategic and aggressive” in their support of national enterprises that are venturing abroad.“Banks in China compete well in their ability to facilitate international trade and investment for Chinese enterprises,” she says.However she believes their activities compliment rather than threaten Standard Chartered’s business.“Although Chinese multinational companies often rely on a domestic bank to establish an initial foothold overseas, this is frequently followed with subsequent engagements with an international bank for more comprehensive cross-border services,” she says.This reflects one of the significant constraints to Chinese and other Asian banks as they look to expand their transaction services divisions.While they have built powerful cash management, custody and trade businesses at home – and which overseas banks cannot rival – they do not have the global networks to fully support businesses in their quest to expand overseas.“Chinese and other Asian banks have been growing in various areas but are not yet global custodians,” says John Coverdale head of global transaction banking at HSBC.“They tend to play more of a regional game.”While Chinese banks have huge scale in their home markets, international rivals say it is essential to have an established global network and sophisticated systems in order to offer cross-border transaction services.They are also quick to point out that businesses such as cash management, custody and securities require high capital expenditure.Put simply, the barriers to entry can be prohibitively high for local Chinese banks to move overseas.“Scale is important when the technology investment is so high,” says Mr Coverdale. “And with the regulatory environment, if anything the barriers are going to go up higher.”Citi’s global transaction services unit, for example, spent $1bn on technology last year.“It is hard for single country providers to invest like that,” says David Russell, Asia head of Citi’s securities and fund services.He says that while Chinese banks can offer basic offshore services for local asset managers, they need to be able to tap into a bigger and broader network. But he does not underestimate their potential to bulk up their offshore business, particularly as currency markets open up.Mr Russell, too, believes there are opportunities to link up.“They are capable of moving aggressively into the offshore space as competitors – but also as partners and clients,” he says.Bankers also expect the landscape to change, as China’s currency becomes more widely used.They say this will unlock the potential of domestic companies to trade and invest offshore and Chinese banks will want to be there to support them.They also note that while increased competition has brought pricing pressures to some parts of their business, the expansion of the renminbi also brings benefits for global banks.“The rapid and significant expansion of business opportunities, such as the internationalisation of the [renminbi], offer potential revenue growth,” says Ms Fawcett.……………………………………………………………..The renminbi rides abroad: A crucial step as Chinese companies seek to expandChina’s efforts to internationalise its currency have accelerated in the past year and restrictions are now being lifted much faster than forecast.The country is keen to encourage an offshore renminbi market both in Hong Kong and in London, while central banks in other emerging markets – such as Nigeria – plan to diversify their foreign reserves into the currency.Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, recently wrote in the Financial Times that the renminbi could even displace the dollar as the premier reserve currency in the next decade.This expansion is crucial for international trade, as Chinese companies are keen to expand into overseas markets.Experts say the volumes of trades settled in the renminbi outside China are still small but are growing rapidly.Some banks have seen their volumes of renminbi-denominated trades more than triple in the past year.China is seen as an important trading partner by emerging markets in Africa and Latin America as well as Europe and the US.Being able to trade in the domestic currency reduces costs and helps mitigate risks for exporters. Liquidity from China is also expected to relieve inflationary pressures in other economies.
435;STT;State Street Corp;2011-09-19T15:34:02Z;Overview: China is emerging as a force;As the industry gets to grips with a fresh set of reforms, Jeremy Grant and Sharlene Goff look at the implications;"As delegates from the world’s payments, custodial, asset servicing and post-trade industries attend this year’s Sibos conference in Toronto, the memory of the turmoil of 2008 is fading.But that has been replaced by fresh uncertainties, as a blizzard of regulatory reform bears down on the sector.For banks, opportunities to expand in areas such as trade finance – and their increased appetite for less risky types of business – have been somewhat dimmed by the prospect of much larger capital requirements.Bankers and industry groups have spent much of this year attempting to convince the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision that new capital rules could undermine cross-border trade by making finance much more expensive.There is a growing consensus that their lobbying has paid off, and that the package of Basel III reforms announced a year ago will be watered down for some crucial transaction banking activities.But providers remain concerned that uncertainties are making it harder to develop their businesses.And as banks increasingly move away from riskier investment banking activities, which have come under pressure from extreme volatility in markets as well as much larger capital requirements, they are keen to beef up their transaction services divisions.In Britain, where the government is relying on exports to reinvigorate the economy, the two state-backed banks – Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group – have both revealed plans to expand in trade finance and other areas of transaction services.RBS, which derives about 12 per cent of group revenue from its global transaction services arm, hopes to double this in five years.Other European banks, including Deutsche Bank, are planning to step up their efforts in these areas, attracted by the stable income streams and the recovery in international trade and investment.Strong growth is evident in Asia, as banks there move to strengthen their presence in areas such as cash management, trade finance and securities.Big market participants, such as JPMorgan and State Street in the US and HSBC and Standard Chartered in the UK, are benefiting from rising trade volumes in Asia. But they are increasingly having to offer lower prices to compete with Asian rivals.While they believe the opening of the Chinese currency markets will exacerbate this trend, they also see opportunities to partner with new competitors, particularly Chinese lenders.International banks say that China’s domestic lenders are increasingly seeking to offer clients a foothold overseas, but are unable to give them access to a worldwide network, which can cost billions of dollars to build and maintain.None the less, China is emerging as a force in the payments and securities servicing business, with its biggest banks muscling in on western rivals.The renminbi’s gradual move towards convertibility could have significant implications for banks; already, 7 per cent of the value of China’s international trade is being settled in the renminbi, rather than in US dollars, according to Swift, the payments services group that has organised Sibos.At the same time, technology is helping reduce complexity by automating processes, reducing settlement and reputation risks. “E-invoicing” is taking off.In parallel, other parts of the financial “plumbing” – trade compression, matching and confirmation, clearing and settlement – are gearing up for the implementation of G20 regulatory reforms enshrined in the Dodd-Frank Act in the US and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) and revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), in the European Union.Aite, a consultancy, says one area – trade reconciliation – is returning to growth after a downturn in spending because of the credit crisis. Vendors are trying to adapt to an evolving marketplace.Aite also estimates that spending on reconciliation will reach $520m a year by 2014.As Swift notes: “Much of the responsibility for ensuring market safety and better risk controls post the financial crisis is being placed on the shoulders of the market infrastructures – the central securities depositories, the trade repositories and the clearing houses that are being relied upon to inject greater robustness and risk management into post-trade processing across all asset classes.”At the same time, reforms that require the shifting of over-the-counter (OTC) derivative trading on to formal platforms – such as “swap execution facilities” – and the move into clearing, will produce a surge in the amount of data being handled and a need for improved risk management.Last month, a company called AcadiaSoft launched a web portal that allows market participants to receive, send and confirm margin calls, as an alternative to the current widely-used practice of using e-mail, fax and phone.Tabb Group, a consultancy, estimates that implementation of OTC reform will cause data levels to surge by 400 per cent above current levels because of electronic trading, clearing, reporting, risk management and other processes.Kevin McPartland, head of fixed income research at Tabb, says: “He or she who holds the data, and knows what to do with it, will hold the power. Just like equities, futures and options before them, OTC derivative market winners and losers will be determined by the strength and intelligence of their technology infrastructure.”To what extent are market participants making the necessary investments to comply?The move to central clearing of OTC derivatives – a key requirement of Dodd-Frank and Emir – has led to questions over the robustness of clearing houses, or central counterparties (CCPs), as well as a new burden in the form of widespread data reporting to “trade repositories”.Neil Vernon, development director at Gresham Computing, a banking software company, says: “For the instruments that are well understood, where best practice exists and standards are emerging or defined, the market infrastructures are ready to take on the task of providing confirmation and central counterparty clearing.“Where the instruments are more innovative, less well understood, traded by fewer market participants, there appears to be some reluctance on behalf of the participants to determine best practice and appropriate standards.”"
436;STT;State Street Corp;2011-09-18T23:41:16Z;Winners & losers: Bigger providers increase domination;Marginal players will exit, but choice will increase as the value chain unbundles;The identification of winners and losers is as long-running a story as any in the asset services world. This latest instalment unfurls around several themes: domination, competition, evolution, cost-cutting and globalisation.The dominance of the big four providers (Bank of New York Mellon, JP Morgan Chase, State Street and Citi) is unquestioned.So far ahead of the field are they in terms of assets under custody alone that it is apparently the height of futility to aspire to join their ranks by any means other than by being consolidated into one of them. It should be noted that few in the industry are prepared to rule out further consolidation, and there is little sign of complacency even at the top of the tree.“It is as competitive a market as I have ever seen,” says Tim Keaney, chief executive of BNYM Asset Servicing.“Clients want a better deal even if providers face rising costs, and they have zero tolerance of error. Those who want to stay in the business face levels of investment in technology the likes of which they have never seen before.”Despite the intensity of competition in the industry, some players predict that the dominance of the big players will continue to grow as clients and potential clients increasingly focus on the strength of their preferred supplier’s balance sheet. “You need a strong balance sheet to give clients comfort,” says Wilson Leech, chief executive of Northern Trust, EMEA region. “This has always been the case, but it’s probably truer now than it has ever been, given the new capital requirements being mandated by the Basel III regime [covering banks].”There is talk in some quarters of an evolutionary change that is taking place in the nature of niche providers, including new entrants to the market. Chandresh Iyer, head of global custody and investment services at Citi in New York, argues that the basic driving forces in the industry have changed in recent years.Before the credit crisis the industry was fundamentally driven by growth in assets, asset classes, geographies and client segments. Today, the asset servicing business model is driven by globalisation, regulation and risk management. Continual rejuvenation is taking place as custody redefines itself. Bigger providers continue to gain scale, whether by cannibalising one another, or by acquiring new product capabilities and clients.But opportunities also exist for new entrants and niche players, whether in fund administration or the provision of analytical tools. Marginal players are likely to exit, but choice will increase as the value chain unbundles.Steve Smit, head of global services, UK MEA and global markets EMEA, at State Street in Boston, also expects to see further consolidation in asset services – not least in continental Europe where there remain too many players servicing only a local or a regional market.He sees sales taking place in cases where a parent institution of such an entity decides the business has no strategic importance because it does not have the necessary scale, and has no appetite to make the investment necessary to achieve that scale. A further and increasingly familiar impetus for sales could be the simple imperative of raising new funds to support tougher capital requirements relating to their core banking business.“We expect State Street to participate in that consolidation,” he says. The ultimate winners in this evolving marketplace will be those players that have an unwavering focus on asset services and can devote to their development the capital and management time they demand, combined with global scale and balance sheet strength, he adds. Whoever might he be thinking of?Charley Cock, head of client development and a member of the executive committee at BNP Paribas Securities Services in Paris, says much the same. The future belongs to those who can do everything everywhere in every asset class, to those who have all the abilities and the critical mass and the cash flow to finance continuous investment as new assets and services are defined.“Market by market, incumbents are slowly getting out,” he says. The buyers are, by definition, international players keen to expand, who appreciate the stream of revenues and healthy return on capital that the business offers.However, the world will continue to need the services of non-global custodians, says Goran Fors, global head of custody at SEB in Stockholm, defiantly.Some observers may feel that SEB looks vulnerable to expansion in that region by the likes of JP Morgan, Northern Trust and Citi, but not Mr Fors. He also thinks it unlikely that new entrants of any note will appear in the industry any time soon. On the other hand, he does envisage further consolidation at the central securities depository level, which will make life harder for smaller players. Size, as always, does matter.So do costs, which remain a perennial topic, along with how to squeeze them still further out of the system by pushing for ever greater efficiency and automation.One new theme beginning to excite debate is the potential emergence of Chinese competitors. There is speculation that one or more Chinese banks, perhaps ICBC or Agricultural Bank of China, could look to move beyond their domestic market and emerge as serious contenders in cross-border asset services over the next decade.This would be a logical development, but it currently requires a leap of faith to imagine a high-profile US investor deciding to switch from one of the big four in favour of a Chinese supplier.However, if a company such as Apple can rely on China as a commercial provider, perhaps banks looking to cut costs and increase efficiences will take a similar view in time.
437;STT;State Street Corp;2011-09-18T23:37:28Z;Regulation: A crucial part of the service;Custodian banks are having to support their clients with a regulatory onslaught;AIFMD, Fatca, Ucits IV, Ucits V, Dodd-Frank. The asset management industry is drowning in a morass of alphabet soup made up of regulations and directives from national and international bodies.“The whole industry has been challenged in the last 18 months because of the sheer volume of regulations that has come to a head,” says Clive Bellow, recently appointed Ireland country head for Northern Trust.“There’s a tsunami of regulation about to break over the industry,” agrees Steve Smit, head of global services, UKMEA, and global markets, Emea, at State Street.In Europe, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and its counterpart for mainstream investors, Ucits IV (plus its pending iteration Ucits V), are tightening the requirements for asset managers to monitor risk, provide transparency and communicate with their clients, as well as increasing the liability of custodians themselves.From Washington, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act means that any investment manager with US clients has to have disclosure compliance agreements with the US Treasury, while the Dodd-Frank legislation is likely to see the use of over-the-counter derivatives become much more onerous in terms of compliance.Mr Smit, along with most of his peers and competitors, sees supporting clients in negotiating all these new regulations as an inevitable part of the role of custodian banks that serve the asset management industry.“It really has to be a key element of what any asset servicing organisation is doing right now,” he says.Nadine Chakar, head of the global financial institutions group at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, identifies four ways in which the custodian is responding to the flood of regulations.The first is education: because new regulations often develop over a series of iterations and may not be very clear in the detail of how they should be implemented, custodians can add value by helping clients interpret the text and understand its impact.Their understanding may be particularly insightful as custodians play an active role in developing the regulation, in Ms Chakar’s second category, client advocacy. BNY Mellon is currently represented at between 25 to 30 organisations involved in drawing up industry regulations, compared with a handful five years ago, according to Ms Chakar.State Street is also active in this area, according to Mr Smit: “As we interact with regulators in Washington and Brussels, we ensure our clients’ voices are heard.”Having puzzled out what the regulations mean, Ms Chakar says the next step is working out what tools clients will need to comply with them. Risk monitoring compliance is a major area of concern for clients who are facing requirements to measure and manage risk in all sorts of unfamiliar ways.Finally the custodian has to invest in its own infrastructure to make sure it can support its clients’ new requirements. These may not be smoothly uniform, of course, as regulations emanate from different authorities around the world, so each asset manager is likely to have a different set of requirements, depending on where they are active.All this activity is fundamentally altering the business model of the custodian, as the emphasis changes from the traditional mechanical functions of settling trades and safe-keeping of securities to more value-added services around compliance and risk monitoring.“The core services remain fundamental but the type of skills you need to make the connections are very different. It’s changing in a big way,” says Ms Chakar.These developments are all likely to have an impact on prices charged by the service providers, who will face higher costs as they move up the value chain, allowing the investment managers to focus more and more on pure investment issues.Some of the European legislation increasing the custodian’s liability will also put pressure on prices.“It will increase the level of risk we have to assume and the amount of capital we have to hold,” explains Mr Smit. “Those costs will be passed on to clients.”Ms Chakar is already having that conversation with clients and, although she warns it is early days to talk about higher pricing being accepted, she is sanguine that clients will recognise they are being asked to pay more for a higher standard of service.Mr Bellow of Northern Trust does not see prices being pushed up quite so directly. “Fees are definitely not going up as a direct result of this. Rather, other things you might be doing to improve efficiency have gone on the backburner.” So in effect the client pays the same for a service that is not updated as quickly as it might otherwise be.This increase in the value-added services a custodian can offer has given a turbo-thrust to the long-standing trend for outsourcing, all commentators agree. Mr Smit also points out that investment managers are under pressure to work more efficiently than before, which can lead to their considering outsourcing more non-core functions.“Levels of assets under management have returned to pre-crisis levels, costs have returned to pre-crisis levels but revenue has only returned to, say, 85 per cent of pre-crisis levels,” he says. “Asset managers are facing a significant need to reduce expense.”This time around, however, outsourcing is more complex than the straightforward lift-out of the back-office that did not always work out so well in previous rounds.Mr Bellow talks of “a move towards componentising outsourcing”, while Ms Chakar says: “In this round of outsourcing, the platform has matured and expectations are more realistic.” It is now understood to be a partnership requiring significant management by the outsourcing partner, not just the wholesale banishment of an entire business function.All of this offers significant business opportunities for custodians and other asset services, but the levels of investment required to make the most of the opportunities may be too much for some smaller players.“We’re not predicting the demise of the smaller custodian,” says Ms Chakar, “but there’s not a week that goes by without an approach from someone asking if we are interested [in making an acquisition].”
438;STT;State Street Corp;2011-09-11T11:17:15Z;SPDR Gold Shares acts on credit risk;ETF quietly changes policy on overnight bullion ownership;SPDR Gold Shares, the world’s biggest gold exchange traded fund, has quietly altered its accounting structure to shield its gold from unsecured credit risk.Since June 1, none of the ETF’s gold has been stored overnight in “unallocated accounts”, in which it is merely assigned to the fund rather than set aside for its account and owned outright.Previously, up to 430 ounces could remain in unallocated accounts at the end of each business day, susceptible to being frozen in the event of the gold custodian’s bankruptcy.This was little more than a technical point, with the value of unallocated gold limited to less than $1m of the SPDR Gold Shares’ market capitalisation of $74.3bn. However, it did play into the hands of conspiracy theorists who question whether all the gold said to be backing financial instruments such as ETFs is really squirrelled away in vaults.Kevin Quigg, vice-president and director of the ETF Global Capital Markets Group at State Street Global Advisors, said no single factor, such as investor concerns over unallocated gold, prompted the change. He did acknowledge, however, that the new policy would “eliminate any unclarity or any misperceptions regarding the fund itself”.“It’s something we’ve monitored for quite some time,” Mr Quigg added. “We made the decision that it was pursuant to the investment objective.”Gold ETFs typically channel gold through unallocated accounts as shares are created and redeemed. Low-level investor anxiety over the risk potential has long simmered, but it flared last year on news of unusual gold swaps between European commercial banks and the Bank for International Settlements involving gold from the banks’ unallocated accounts.The price of gold fell sharply in response, and soon thereafter BlackRock’s iShares ETF unit announced that its Gold Trust, the second-biggest gold ETF, would become the only US-listed gold ETF to be fully allocated daily.SSgA disclosed its new custody agreement terms in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in June but chose not to trumpet the news as iShares did in press releases and online marketing. As FTfm went to press, SPDR Gold Shares’ online prospectus had yet to be updated. “It’s something that we didn’t deem a particularly material change or something that would directly impact the shareholders from a fund perspective,” Mr Quigg said.
439;STT;State Street Corp;2011-09-07T20:58:44Z;State Street launches swaps clearing operation;;State Street Corporation, the financial services group, is to launch a swaps clearing service in a sign that market participants are starting to build new businesses to take advantage of sweeping reform of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.The move suggests that large custodian institutions – not previously associated with OTC derivatives clearing – are grasping the opportunities thrown up by the Dodd-Frank act in the US to rival banks such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank.The act requires that such derivatives be traded more transparently on formal trading platforms and that they be cleared, where possible, in clearing houses.A clearing house acts as guarantor of trades between two parties, using funds deposited with it by market participants to ensure that deals are completed if one side defaults. Regulators believe greater use of clearing will help safeguard the financial system against the effect of any future defaults – such as that of Lehman Brothers in 2008.Clifford Lewis, head of State Street’s eExchange business, said: “As the derivatives markets evolve, we are increasingly aware of the need for full-service clearing and other services to help clients realise the benefits of the new derivatives regime, through enhanced transparency, more open execution platforms and central clearing.”He said State Street was able to provide the service “in an unconflicted way”.Dodd-Frank gives futures brokers – also known as futures commission merchants (FCMs) – a key role in the OTC process by requiring them to act as intermediaries between users of derivatives and the clearing houses.Banks that have long controlled the OTC derivatives markets have expanded their existing FCM businesses focused on exchange-traded derivatives to include OTC derivatives.Kevin McPartland, head of fixed-income research at Tabb Group, a consultancy, said: “The custodian banks see clearing as a huge opportunity because they are very well capitalised and have high credit ratings and are very focused on a post trade processing already. So it makes a lot of sense that they would step in as a clearing broker.”State Street, which set up its own FCM last year, said it was expanding this to include a swaps clearing platform, on top of existing custody and accounting, collateral management, valuation and risk and analytics for derivatives.Bank of New York Mellon, a rival, also last year set up an FCM to provide OTC clearing services. In June it created a new company based in Dublin to clear futures and derivatives trades on behalf of institutional clients in Europe.State Street has operated an FCM since April last year. Most of that businesses’ clients are so-called buyside – asset managers, companies and hedge funds.
440;STT;State Street Corp;2011-09-05T17:04:44Z;Wall St’s awful August a disaster for financials;;"After a disastrous start for US equities, August ended up merely awful. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for shares of banks and other financial groups.Banks enjoyed solid gains in the second half of the month, like the rest of the market. But they had much further to travel. The S&P 500 financial sector is still furthest from its cyclical peak of any big S&P sector, and nearest to its bottom.Financials, which make up 14 per cent of the weighting of the S&P 500, are the worst performers this year, down 20.1 per cent versus the broader index’s 6 per cent decline.The S&P 500 ended lower by 5.7 per cent in August, while the financials sector was down 9.4 per cent.The banks segment was hardest hit. The KBW Banks index fell 13.2 per cent.Analysts say a sustained equity rally will be difficult unless there is a sharp change of fortune for financial stocks.“There’s a very strong correlation between the relative returns of financials and the market itself,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank.For banks, fears of a slowdown do not just mean fewer people and companies buying things; it also means falling home prices that stress balance sheets still weighed down by mortgage obligations, as well as related litigation.Financials in the S&P 500 fell another 3.5 per cent on Friday as the Federal Housing Finance Agency said it would sue US-based banks for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.Bank of America has been acutely affected by fears for banks. Its stock fell to just $6.01 a share at one point in August amid rumours it would have to raise capital or sell a big asset to survive an economic slowdown.Warren Buffett’s agreement to buy shares only returned the shares to $7.91 by September, still a 19.4 per cent fall over the month.The bank’s executives and many analysts rushed to its defence, and to the defence of peer Citigroup. They cited a balance sheet repair in the past two years and less exposure to mortgage losses than some had feared.But fears persist over how banks fund themselves amid the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. While US banks have little exposure to Greece – less than $10bn, according to the Cleveland Fed – they are counterparties to large European financial institutions. Many also fear they could be affected by a run on money market funds that own bank paper.Even normally staid custodian banks, such as BNY Mellon – down 18 per cent in August – and State Street – down 15.9 per cent – demonstrated some of that worry. Early in August, BNY Mellon began charging additional fees for cash deposits, citing complexities in managing its balance sheet, as customers dumped money market funds ahead of the US debt ceiling deadline.The anxiety is stark in the gap between the expected volatility of the broad S&P 500 and US financials, which continues to widen. While the US 30-day expected volatility has fallen to about 30 per cent, from highs just above 40, bank volatility is still nearly 60. “At the core of the stress evident in S&P volatility is the perception that risks are growing in the financial sector,” said Barry Knapp, US equity market strategist at Barclays, in a note. “A return to equity market normality is unlikely without a sharp drop in perceived risks in the financial sector.”He said that although Barclays analysts were “sceptical” of a funding crisis – he cited policymakers’ experience during the 2008 crisis in providing interbank funding – “investors seem intent on looking at financing markets for signs that capital problems are evolving into a liquidity crisis”.But analysts are also lowering expectation for financials’ core businesses. Analysts at ISI Group downgraded Goldman Sachs from “buy” to “hold” last week.“Debt and equity underwriting fees have also been under pressure due to equity market weakness,” they said, citing “high market volatility” and “much wider debt spreads”.Goldman’s shares fell 16 per cent for August. Morgan Stanley was down 24 per cent.Though volatility can also help banks’ trading businesses, risks were still seen there, including a transactions tax being considered in Europe.The KBW Capital Markets index – which includes groups such as Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext – closed the month down 11.5 per cent."

442;STT;State Street Corp;2011-08-31T23:40:47Z;BNY Mellon ousts chief executive Kelly;;Bank of New York Mellon has ousted Robert Kelly as chief executive, citing “differences in approach to managing the company”, and appointed Gerald Hassell, a 30-year veteran of the bank, as his successor.“We’ve got some management issues,” said a person close to the situation. “This is not a precipitous thing. It was over a period of time. We thought we had to make a change. We’ve got a good guy in Gerald.”People close to the situation said the bank’s strategy remained unchanged and that the departure was unrelated to a recently announced bout of job cuts and had nothing to do with “integrity” or “any pending litigation”.Mr Kelly could not be reached for comment. In a statement released by BNY Mellon, he said it had “been an honour to serve” the bank.“We have navigated tremendously difficult markets and built one of the world’s premier financial institutions,” he said. “I am confident that under Gerald’s leadership of the firm’s strong management team, BNY Mellon will continue to flourish going forward.”Mr Kelly had been touted as a potential future head of a bigger bank and linked to Bank of America, where Brian Moynihan, chief executive, is under pressure. A person close to the situation said Mr Kelly had not left for any such position.In the statement released after the market closed, Wesley von Schack, a long-time board member of the bank, said that Mr Hassell was “ideally positioned to guide BNY Mellon through the next phase of its growth and to bring it to its full potential” and commended Mr Kelly as “a person of the highest integrity”.BNY Mellon recently announced it would charge fees on some large deposits because it was swamped with cash from investors and could not make a good return on investing the money. It also announced this month that it would eliminate about 1,500 jobs, or 3 per cent of its employees, in a cost-cutting drive.Over the past year, the company has come under increasing pressure from investors, who have questioned the bank’s strategy in the current low interest rate environment, its ability to weather structural issues such as the squeeze on its higher-margin businesses and its ability to reduce costs, one analyst covering the company said.“Kelly was well liked and fairly visible,” the analyst said. “But a little bit of the Kelly magic was wearing off.”The states of Virginia and Florida sued the company this month, alleging that it overcharged state pension funds on foreign exchange transactions.Those lawsuits, along with the legal risks posed by the firm’s role as a trustee in ­mortgage securities, may have been the biggest driver behind investor anxiety, the analyst said.In the past 12 months, the bank’s share price has fared worse than State Street, one of its closest peers, but performed slightly better than Northern Trust, another peer, and better than bigger, more diversified competitors such as Citigroup and Bank of America.BNY Mellon’s shares on Wednesday closed down 0.7 per cent at $20.67.
443;STT;State Street Corp;2011-08-30T19:23:25Z;Whistleblower sets sights on BNY Mellon;;The whistleblower who tried unsuccessfully to expose Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme claims large financial institutions are “above the law” as he seeks to expose allegedly deceptive foreign currency exchange practices at State Street and Bank of New York Mellon.Harry Markopolos, now an independent fraud investigator, has helped build cases against the banks, which have resulted in probes in Ohio, California, Florida and Virginia. The investigations and lawsuits claim that the banks priced foreign exchange trades to the detriment of clients.BNY Mellon and State Street both say their practices are fair and that they will defend themselves vigorously against the suits.Mr Markopolos is working on his own time but says he is poised to receive 15 to 20 per cent of any settlement the government reaches through the US False Claims Act, which rewards whistleblowers.Since leaving the financial industry in 2004 Mr Markopolos has worked to expose financial fraud. And though he has not yet been rewarded as part of a successful government settlement, he said he had saved enough during his time in finance to fund his work.“I can afford to do this for a long time,” he said. “I know where skeletons are buried and I’m going to start digging them up one at a time.”Mr Markopolos rose to fame in the wake of Mr Madoff’s 2008 confession, when it was revealed that the former head of the Nasdaq exchange was running the largest Ponzi scheme to date.It soon became clear that the Securities and Exchange Commission had for years ignored warnings from Mr Markopolos that Mr Madoff’s firm was corrupt.In an interview with the Financial Times earlier this year, Mr Madoff displayed flashes of anger when Mr Markopolos’s name came up. “Markopolos was the biggest idiot in the world,” Mr Madoff said. “He had a hedge fund that couldn’t make money and his clients abandoned him [so he called the regulators].”The story of Mr Markopolos’s involvement with Mr Madoff is told in a new documentary film, Chasing Madoff. Starring Mr Markopolos and based on his book, No One Would Listen, the film describes how while employed at a private equity firm in Boston, he was asked to match Mr Madoff’s consistent returns.He quickly realised Mr Madoff’s operation was a fraud and began petitioning the SEC to investigate.Mr Markopolos said he hoped the film would illustrate the perils of self-regulation in the financial industry. “Hundreds knew what we know, and if they had done something they would have changed the course of history,” he said.
444;STT;State Street Corp;2011-08-28T11:50:01Z;Edinburgh seeks school-leavers’ jobs guarantee;;"Edinburgh is working on an ambitious jobs guarantee for school-leavers as part of a five-year economic strategy for the Scottish capital and its surrounding area.The economic review is the largest and most wide-ranging economic analysis ever undertaken in Edinburgh and is expected to herald a raft of new policies, focused on stimulating jobs and investment.Led by the City of Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh Business Forum – a group of leading chief executives, entrepreneurs and academics who advise the council on sustainable economic development – the review covers the current economic situation and future trends.Councillor Tom Buchanan, convenor of economic development at the council, said the capital’s economy had already shown tremendous resilience in difficult times and the outlook was good, with unemployment in the city currently at 3.2 per cent – well below the UK and Scottish averages. But carrying out a thorough analysis of the economy had allowed gaps in knowledge to be filled in.“A really good example is the jobs gap,” he said. “It may not look like Edinburgh is suffering in terms of unemployment at the moment. But when you look at the projected jobs demand, it is growing at 1.8 per cent a year while the supply of jobs is growing at just 0.6 per cent a year. So we’re projecting unemployment rates before they happen – rather than reacting when they do happen.”Rising youth unemployment is a particular concern and will be a priority for the council’s strategists. Joblessness among young people is being made worse by the tightening of the labour market – forcing people to accept jobs at a lower scale than their qualifications and experience.“If this is happening at every level, you’re squeezing out the youth because they haven’t got experience,” Mr Buchanan said. “The great thing is that we now know these things at a level of detail and understanding that we didn’t know before.”To tackle youth unemployment, the council is working with partners to launch the “Edinburgh Guarantee” – an initiative to offer a job, training or further education to every child who leaves school in Edinburgh with no future career path. Almost 600 young people a year in Edinburgh currently fall into this category.“We should not tolerate any child leaving school and being allowed to drift into unemployment,” said Mr Buchanan. “Research has shown that young people who are out of work for more than a year find it significantly harder to find employment, and so the costs of supporting them will stay with us for much longer.”Jim Rafferty heads up Capital City Partnership, a collaboration of statutory, voluntary, community and private sector organisations focused on getting people in Edinburgh into work. His biggest worry is that Edinburgh is currently bottom of the league among Scotland’s 32 local authorities in terms of positive destinations – work, training or education – for leavers from state schools.Boosting investment by incoming and indigenous companies has been identified as another vital driver for employment growth. Mr Buchanan said Edinburgh was performing well on this front, with recent investments including Amazon (380 jobs); Primark (600 jobs); Toshiba (100 jobs); State Street (90 jobs); BNY Mellon (60 jobs) and Dell (30 jobs).Edinburgh has attracted 22 foreign direct investment projects in the year to August 2011 compared with 13 in the same period last year and is rated fourth overall in Europe for foreign direct investment – behind Dublin, Dusseldorf and Aberdeen.However, the economic review has highlighted that, while Edinburgh is a natural host to larger companies, smaller companies – which are key drivers of employment growth and typically create 50 per cent of new jobs – are not growing as quickly as they could.To address this, the council and partners, including the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, are calling for improved access to debt and equity finance, as well as launching their own funding initiatives.Greg Ward, the council’s head of economic development, said Edinburgh accounted for 10 per cent of Scotland’s business stock – rising to 25 per cent when the wider city region was included.He said this highlighted the importance of cities as critical drivers of national economic growth. Together, Scotland’s six cities – Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee, Stirling and Inverness – and their regions, account for 90 per cent of Scotland’s population.The review was inspired by the Manchester Independent Economic Review, published in 2009, which was believed to be the first independent economic review of a city region.As budgets tighten, Mr Ward said councils across the UK were taking a much more robust approach to economic development and looking at what impact they could provide over and above traditional statutory functions such as planning.“We need to integrate economic drivers into everything we do,” he said. “In this respect it’s been hugely helpful to have at our fingertips a thorough analysis of the city region’s economy – and it’s given us a very strong motive and real clarity around the need to create job security through investment.”"
445;STT;State Street Corp;2011-08-28T08:48:55Z;Muted flows will cause funds to slash budgets;2011 is not expected to compare well with 2010 on fund flows;"Asset managers predict they will need to make more budget cuts over the coming months as flows remain muted.The findings come after UBS announced large-scale job cuts last week, following similar moves by HSBC, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, after poor results.Rob Lay, European head of wholesale distribution at UBS Global Asset Management, says the rest of the year is going to be “tough” for European asset managers after the eurozone crisis and US credit downgrade. “Firms will strive to cut costs because 2011 is probably not going to compare with 2010 in terms of net new money,” he says.Last year, European funds, excluding money market products, gathered a little more than €300bn ($433bn) in assets, but it is doubtful sales will reach that total this year.Half-year data from Lipper show such fund sales are €60bn behind this time last year. In the first half of 2010, European funds garnered €152.1bn in assets; in 2011 that shrunk to just €90.6bn.Ed Moisson, head of UK and cross-border research at Lipper, says: “For long-term funds, even looking solely at cross-border activity, the reduced sales volumes this year are clear. Needless to say it has been the local continental European industries that have suffered the greatest outflows.”But Franklin Templeton Investments says it is too early to be making budget cuts and thinks managers should wait and see until the end of the year.Reinhard Berben, senior director, central Europe at Franklin Templeton, says fund groups face a “critical environment” from a sales perspective but does not believe the industry is in crisis.“Everybody is worried. But it is much too soon to make big budget cuts. We are watching the scene very closely,” he says.Mike Karpik, head of investments, Europe at State Street Global Advisors, is also optimistic. He expects markets will stabilise in the coming months. “Volatility will continue over the next few months but will not be as extreme as . . . over the past few weeks.“As we move beyond the summer break, greater market depth should appear – but unfortunately the macro issues the market faces are not going away.” Richard Garland, a managing director at Investec, is more doubtful. “On the retail side of the business every major fund group is seeing outflows and people are taking risk off the table,” he says. “We have seen a slowdown in the UK retail market, but that has been offset by flows into institutional mandates elsewhere.”Managers that have a global footprint may also not be as badly affected, says Mr Garland, as inflows from less developed countries and those not hit by sovereign-debt crises will help buoy sales figures.Heather Dale is a senior reporter for Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared"
446;STT;State Street Corp;2011-08-22T19:41:22Z;SPDR Gold Shares sits atop ETF league;;"SPDR Gold Shares has become the world’s largest exchange traded fund by market value, surpassing the biggest equity fund as investor worries propel gold to a record high price.Assets in the gold fund climbed to $76.7bn, new data showed, edging out State Street Global Advisors’ flagship $74.4bn SPDR S&P 500 index fund for the first time.As recently as the end of July, the SPDR fund was by far the biggest ETF globally, with $93.3bn in assets under management, versus $66bn for the gold fund, the second biggest, according to State Street.“This acutely signifies investor uncertainty and lack of confidence right now; investors are shunning risk assets and looking instead to safe havens like gold,” said Edel Tully, precious metals analyst at UBS.The gold fund’s ascent comes as the precious metal on Monday reached a new record of more than $1,894 per troy ounce as investors worry that government debt burdens will erode the value of currencies.The S&P 500 benchmark has meanwhile fallen 12 per cent in August after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the US credit rating and the economic recovery began to flag.An especially sharp outflow last Friday from the S&P fund, a drop of $3.6bn in assets, triggered the switch in rankings.The gold fund has enabled investors to own a share of bullion without the storage costs or security risks of storing coins or bars.The World Gold Council, an industry group, created the fund in 2004 and remains its sponsor. The fund’s holdings, gold bars locked in a London vault, now total 41.5m ounces.Investors include hedge funds managers such as John Paulson, Millennium Management and Sun Valley Gold; the New Jersey state pension fund; and individuals now holding gold in retirement accounts.Traders also use the highly liquid gold fund to hedge other trades. Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, said that the strongest correlation since 2003 between the price of gold and spikes in the CBOE Volatility Index, or the “Vix”, had been driving trading.“Gold has become something of a near-perfect hedge for financial assets such as stocks,” he said in a recent note.On Monday, Citigroup raised its forecast for gold prices from 2011 to 2015, saying that bullion would this year average $1,590 an ounce, up from a previous forecast of $1,440 an ounce.For 2012, the bank forecast $1,650 an ounce, but said there was upside for prices to average $1,900."
447;STT;State Street Corp;2011-08-08T19:59:32Z;Oil and gold;The oil market seems to fear recession, not inflation;Just as oil and water do not mix, oil and gold have repelled one another in the recent financial market carnage. The performance of exchange traded funds tracking the energy sector and physical gold offered by State Street (two of the most liquid products available to retail investors) have diverged by 25 per cent over the past two weeks. Net speculative bets on US oil and gold futures plunged and surged respectively.At first glance this makes perfect sense: oil, the premier industrial commodity, acts as a barometer for growth expectations, while gold is the ultimate haven. But consider the context of the market swoon. Yes, growth concerns have re-emerged, but the main story is that the issuer of the world’s reserve currency – the one in which gold, oil and all other commodities are denominated – has been questioned. Armed with a printing press, gold bulls feel it will ultimately rely on its last line of defence – dollar debasement. The way to get there is through keeping interest rates low or negative in real terms for the foreseeable future, plus fresh quantitative easing.But the last easing, QE2, sparked a broad rush into commodities. Oil and gold rose in tandem. The two commodities also were positively correlated during the cheap money era of 2006 until mid-2008. Financial downturns, though, have been varied. The two assets rose together through the Middle East instability of the 1970s but diverged in 2008-09.If those pushing gold to daily records today believe that this crisis is about the demise of fiat currencies, then the far larger market for a far more useful commodity – stored for free underground by Mother Nature – should surely catch a bid. But for now, the oil market’s collective wisdom seems to hold that it is recession, not inflation, that is the thing to fear.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
448;STT;State Street Corp;2011-08-03T19:34:14Z;Hedge fund champion takes a global view;;In Amelia Fawcett, the former top Morgan Stanley banker, current chairman of the Guardian Media Group and a director of the asset management group State Street, the hedge fund industry has found an influential new champion.Ms Fawcett is the recently installed chairman of the Hedge Fund Standards Board, a hitherto quiescent but well-respected UK-based body that she now means to take global as part of a drive for the $2,000bn industry to seize control of the regulatory agenda.“I wasn’t interested in running a trade body,” says Ms Fawcett from a panelled office overlooking St James’s park in central London. “But this is different. It’s a chance to shape the standards of a whole industry.“When I looked at taking on this job I saw there was a model that could be exported globally.”As one of London’s most successful financiers, the 54-year-old Bostonian already has a career and personal life that straddle the Atlantic comfortably. Her directorships – they are numerous, including the National Portrait Gallery in London – require her to. To boot, she has just swapped her house on the Roseland peninsula in Cornwall for a near identical one on Massachusetts’ North Shore.“It’s like I’ve flipped it over the Atlantic. The view and outlook are almost exactly the same. But the only bits of Cornwall in the new house will be all the pictures on the walls,” says Ms Fawcett.1984 Joins law firm Sullivan & Cromwell1987 Joins Morgan Stanley2002 Vice-chairman and chief operating officer Morgan Stanley International2004-09 Member of Court of Directors of Bank of England2006-present Director, State Street Corporation2009-present Chairman, Guardian Media Group2010 Awarded DBE2011-present Chairman, Hedge Fund Standards BoardIn a parallel flip, it will be US hedge fund managers that Ms Fawcett wants to target first with the HFSB “standards” that most of the UK hedge fund industry is already signed up to.In an announcement to be made on Thursday, the HFSB will launch a major push to target US hedge fund managers. Until now, the appeal to sign up to such industry-set regulatory strictures has fallen on deaf ears across the pond.Against the unwelcome backdrop of a tougher and more punitive regulatory environment, Ms Fawcett aims to make that change.“There is an increasing interest in light of the dysfunctionality of government,” she says. “Markets need effective standards to run properly …you can’t do that globally with black-line laws.”In recent efforts, both the US and Europe have failed successfully to regulate hedge funds to the satisfaction of real investors, she says.Testament, perhaps, to that fact, was the move last week by George Soros to sidestep US regulations and make Soros Fund Management even less transparent but no less systemically important.“Let me be very clear: standards don’t replace regulations, but they do complement them and do things that they can’t,” says Ms Fawcett emphatically. And she adds: “Can standards be more effective than regulations? Absolutely.”It is a difficult point to make. In the wake of the financial crisis, self-regulation and principles-based regulation have become watchwords for toothlessness thanks to the palpable failings of the regulators, chief among them the UK’s Financial Services Authority.For hedge funds, it is different, Ms Fawcett believes. The HFSB’s existing standards include detailed transparency requirements and exacting procedural checks for fund managers to abide by. They must submit an annual report to the HFSB explaining whether they do or not.“The beauty of standards as opposed to detailed hard rules is that people often flout the spirit of the law even if they are following the letter of it,” contends Ms Fawcett – a truth perhaps nowhere more so than in traditionally high-octane, low-transparency hedge funds.“Hedge funds are not like banks. I have seen the limits of what banks can do. It is important we have a healthy, diverse and flexible hedge fund industry to make markets work well.”

The Powershares QQQ (based on the Nasdaq Composite) gathered inflows of $1.6bn while SSgA’s Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF attracted $586m and iShares S&P 500 took in $484m and Vanguard’s MSCI total market ETF grabbed $260m.Counterbalancing those inflows were substantial withdrawals from the two biggest losers with the iShares S&P midcap 400 registering outflows of $632m and $1.7bn exiting from the iShares Russell 2000 (which is linked to the best known index for smaller US companies).Even more striking was a sharp recover in inflows for precious metals ETFs as the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and debt ceiling negotiations in the US reached a new pitch. The July inflows of $2.8bn for GLD meant it almost recovered all of the withdrawals of $3.1bn which it suffered in the first six months of the year.Meanwhile, the iShares Comex gold ETF pulled in $632m while the iShares silver trust, the largest silver ETF attracted inflows of $362m.Investors also showed a continued appetite for yield with ETFs linked to the high yield bond market. The iShares iBoxx high yield corporate bond ETF, known as HYG, pulled in $506m while the SPDR Barclays Capital high yield bond ETF, known as JNK, gathered new inflows of $408m.Other notable performers included the Rydex Swiss franc currency ETF which pulled in $251m in July, reflecting haven demand for the currency which has traded at a record high against both the euro and dollar amid continuing concerns over the twin debt crises in the eurozone and US.MOO, the Market Vectors agribusiness ETF continued its remarkable run with inflows of $434m, taking its assets beyond the $6bn milestone. MOO had assets of $1.6bn a year ago.Total assets held by the US ETF industry (funds and products) reached $1,107.1bn, up 9.8 per cent so far this year.
450;STT;State Street Corp;2011-07-26T11:06:57Z;State Street brings new ETFs to London;SSgA moves to strengthen position in Europe;State Street Global Advisors is making its next move to strengthen its exchange traded funds business in Europe with the launch of 11 ETFs in London.SSgA initially launched its new range of SPDR ETFs in Germany in May and the cross-listing of these products in London on Tuesday is seen by the company as a further important step ahead of the UK’s retail distribution review, which is widely expected to lead to greater interest in ETFs from investors and financial advisers.Vin Bhattacharjee, head of the intermediary business for Europe Middle East and Africa at SSgA, said ETF use was already increasing, but “the forthcoming retail distribution review will bring about changes in the distribution landscape which will increase the interest in this product set among retail investors because of the uniform pricing structure of most ETFs in the UK”.SSgA is the world’s second largest ETF provider with assets of $266bn at the end of June. But it has lacked a significant presence historically in Europe, languishing at 20th place in the European league table with just $1.4bn of assets under management, according to BlackRock data.However, early signs suggest the new ETF range has bolstered SSgA’s position in Europe. Inflows into the group’s European listed ETFs reached $300m in the first half of 2011, compared with outflows of around $400m for the whole of last year.SSgA has high hopes of for its local-currency emerging-market bond ETF, the first of its kind to be launched in Europe.“The depth and liquidity of the markets for government debt issued by developing countries in local currency continues to improve and international investors are increasingly interested in opportunities in this dynamic asset class,” said Mr Bhattacharjee. He noted that the new SPDR Barclays Capital emerging markets local bond ETF had attracted $50.3m since listing in Germany in May.SSgA’s new ETFs use optimised physical replication, which means they buy a selection of the constituents of each underlying benchmark. The decision to launch physical ETFs in Europe coincides fortuitously with a period of unprecedented regulatory scrutiny of synthetic ETFs that use derivatives to replicate index returns.SSgA’s renewed focus on the European ETF market comes at a time when its US ETF operations have struggled for momentum. Investors withdrew $61m from SSgA’s US listed ETFs in the first six months of 2011, in contrast to last year when they allocated $17.5bn over the whole of 2010.This year’s withdrawals have been concentrated in the world’s two largest ETFs, the SPDR 500 ETF and the SPDR Gold Trust which registered outflows of $2.3bn and $3.1bn respectively in the first half of 2011.However, the SPDR Gold Trust , known as GLD, has seen inflows returning in July as the Greek debt crisis and concerns over a possible US debt downgrade have encouraged investors to look again for a haven in physical gold.
451;STT;State Street Corp;2011-07-19T22:12:58Z;Wall Street lifted by tech shares;;Technology stocks rose the most in a year after IBM’s strong earnings.Industry bellwether IBM topped expectations as revenues surged across its businesses, particularly in sales of servers. It raised its full-year earnings forecast to $13.25 a share, versus the $12.31 that analysts had been anticipating.IBM shares were up 5.7 per cent at $185.21. It led the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which added 200 points, rising 1.6 per cent to 12,587.42.There were hints of caution, as IBM explained that many of the sales of servers were delayed refreshings of existing equipment rather than new sales.But tech traders drove shares of other IT infrastructure groups higher. Broadcom and F5 Networks, which build data storage and networking equipment, led the sector.Broadcom added 6.2 per cent to $34.70, and F5 gained 6.1 per cent to $118.56.Technology groups dominated gains, with the S&P 500 sector higher by 2.7 per cent, its best one-day gain since July 2010.The Nasdaq Composite index enjoyed its best session since October, rising 2.2 per cent to 2,826.52.The broader S&P index – where tech shares make up the largest weighting – was up 1.6 per cent at 1,326.73, its biggest gain since March.The index was boosted by a jump in News Corp, whose shares jumped 5.5 per cent to $15.79. Rupert Murdoch, the company’s chairman and chief executive, was questioned by MPs on a UK parliamentary committee on Tuesday and denied responsibility for alleged phone hacking.Apple recorded earnings of $7.79 a share versus forecasts of $5.87 a share. The shares hit $400 in after-hour trading. Apple’s shares are 10 per cent above their 50-day moving average at $376.85, an all-time high. The shares were up just 0.8 per cent on Tuesday.But strategists at Bespoke Investment Group say that should not prevent big gains if Apple tops estimates of $5.87 in earnings per share for the quarter.“History has shown that the stock has actually done better on report days when it has been overbought than when it has been oversold,” they said.Kevin Pleines, Birinyi Associates analyst, noted that Apple never issues guidance above what Wall Street expects, and so has easily beaten expectations in every quarter since 2004. During trading the day before it reports, Apple has registered gains 71 per cent of the time.The financial sector is lagging, up 1.4 per cent on the session, due to mixed trading among its biggest members.Bank of America reported a one-time writedown of $8.8bn related to settlements of mortgage fraud accusations.But the rest of BofA’s businesses earned 33 cents a share, which topped estimates of 28.7 cents. Improvements were seen in its market share of fixed income trading and growth in consumer loans.Wells Fargo topped estimates by earning 70 cents a share, versus forecasts of 69.4 cents. It set aside fewer dollars for loan loss reserves, leading to a record net income of $3.95bn for the quarter.Wells Fargo shares led the financials, gaining 5.7 per cent to $28.41.BofA’s shares were down 1.5 per cent in trading, to $9.57.Banks that reported strong earnings earlier were stronger. JPMorgan was up 1.4 per cent at $40.39, and Citigroup added 0.7 per cent to $38.02.Goldman Sachs delivered the first disappointing bank earnings of the second-quarter earnings season, thanks to its heavy reliance on trading. The shares fell 0.7 per cent in early trading to $128.49, at one point touching their lowest level since 2009.The Dow was led by IBM and The Coca-Cola Company, which reported earnings per share that topped forecasts by 1 cent, thanks to strong international demand. Its shares rose 3.4 per cent to $69.40.The top advancer in the S&P 500 was Harley-Davidson, the motorbike manufacturer, which jumped 8.9 per cent to $45.11.It reported the first year-over-year quarterly boost in US sales since 2006. That was its highest price since 2007.Avery Dennison was the worst performer in the index, falling 13.7 per cent to $32.65 after the designer of business equipment warned that its third-quarter earnings would fall short of expectations.
452;STT;State Street Corp;2011-07-19T18:27:37Z;State Street to cut another 850 jobs;;State Street announced a new round of cost cutting on Tuesday as the New York-based custody bank reported a big rise in expenses for the second quarter.The world’s third largest money manager by assets said that it would cut 850 jobs over the next 20 months, in addition to the 1,400 redundancies announced in November, as the company restructures following three acquisitions in the past two years.State Street reported net income of $968m, up 5 per cent on the same period last year, as fee income on rising assets under management offset declines in net interest income due to very low interest rates. On an operating basis, expenses rose 20 per cent, due largely to a 22 per cent rise in salaries and benefits for employees.The company attributed the rise in costs to performance awards this year, against a comparative fall in incentive compensation in the previous year, and the ongoing impact of integration and restructuring of its operations and technology infrastructure. The new job cuts announced on Tuesday are the elimination of 530 information technology staff and the transfer of 320 jobs to IT outsourcing providers.Return on equity declined in the quarter to 10.6 per cent, from 11 per cent in the second quarter of 2010. In response to analyst questions on the appropriate amount of capital for the bank to hold, Jay Hooley, chief executive, expressed frustration at the regulatory processes.“The question is really the equity question: how much capital should a trust bank hold in order to execute its business model?” Mr Hooley said.The bank currently holds more than enough capital under the proposed Basel III regulations, but the size of any buffer required should State Street be declared a systemically important financial institution remains unknown. “I wish I could be more insightful,” Mr Hooley added.Earnings per share of $1 for the second quarter was an increase on the 87 cents produced in the same period last year, on a GAAP basis, but below the $1.01 consensus forecast of analysts.Shares in State Street were down 2.6 per cent at $41.81 in mid-afternoon trading in New York. Shares in the bank are down 10 per cent so far this year.
453;STT;State Street Corp;2011-07-19T14:21:03Z;BNY Mellon gains on European uncertainty;;Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank by assets, reported growth in earnings for the second quarter on rising assets under management and highlighted the opportunity created by uncertainty in Europe’s banking system.Net income for the New York-based bank rose 8 per cent to $735m from the same period last year. Revenues of $3.06bn were up 15 per cent on the year before, but BNY Mellon reported non-interest expenses up 21 per cent as the company integrated acquisitions, such as last year’s $2.31bn deal to buy PNC Financial Services’ global-investment services business, and faced significant litigation costs.“Expense growth remained high due in part to legal and regulatory costs. We are taking additional actions to reduce expenses,” said Robert Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer.Mr Kelly sought to play down a series of ongoing law suits and investigations into foreign exchange practices at BNY Mellon and peer State Street launched by attorneys-general in several states related to transaction charges paid by state pension funds.“The related business represents less than one half of 1 per cent of our revenues,” he said. The bank maintains that its pricing practices were fair, based on contractual agreements and that customers always had the option to negotiate trades directly.Very low short term interest rates remained a drag on earnings, with fee waivers on money market funds as interest rates approach zero costing the bank $60m to $65m in the quarter. However, Mr Kelly attributed a $32bn gain in long-term assets to the uncertainty in Europe.He also attempted to reassure analysts that the $34bn of European assets held in the firm’s prime money market funds are not at risk from the sovereign debt crisis, with only one in five of the European banks passing BNY Mellon’s credit assessment and bank debt representing 28 per cent of the European assets.“We have a really good opportunity to gain market share in Europe,” Mr Kelly said. Acquisitions may not be available in the next two or three years, he said, but added, “there is a pretty long list of opportunities here. The question is how quick and aggressive the banks and financial institutions want to act to free up capital and realign their businesses”.BNY Mellon shares were up 1.5 per cent at $25 per share in early New York trading.

455;STT;State Street Corp;2011-07-14T17:40:41Z;ETF ‘price war’ spreads to bonds with Schwab launch;US aggregate bond ETF undercuts rival products;The “price war” among exchange traded providers has spread into fixed income products after Charles Schwab launched a new US aggregate bond ETF which is cheaper than existing rivals.The new ETF carries an expense ratio of just 10 basis points, undercutting competing products from Vanguard, iShares and State Street Global Advisors.It will track the Barclays Capital US aggregate bond index, a broad-based benchmark that includes Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage securities and asset-backed securities.This is the same benchmark used by two of the best known bond ETFs, the Vanguard Barclays total bond ETF, known as BND, and the iShares Barclays aggregate bond fund, known as AGG.BND has assets of $10.2bn while AGG has assets of $11.8bn which means that Schwab’s new ETF will be taking on the two biggest players in the US ETF bond sector.Vanguard’s BND fund carries a total expense ratio of 11 basis points while iShares AGG is priced at 20bps.A third direct competitor in this space, the State Street Barclays Capital aggregate bond ETF, known as LAG, has an expense ratio of 17bps.Commission free trading for the new ETF will be available to investors with accounts on Schwab’s trading platform.Schwab’s press release highlights the charges of its entire range of 14 ETFs against rival products from Vanguard, iShares and State Street, showing that competitive pricing is clearly a key factor in its drive to build a substantial ETF business.Schwab’s ETFs attracted $1.6bn in new inflows in the first six months of 2011, an increase of 60.6 per cent on the same period last year.Vanguard’s BND fund gathered $1.1bn in net new inflows in the first six months of this year while AGG attracted $570m. This means these two funds alone accounted for more than half of inflows into all US fixed income ETFs ($3.8bn) so far this year.Competition in this space will get even hotter as Pimco, the bond fund specialist, is planning to launch a range of fixed income ETFs which will is expected to include an aggregate bond fund to rival with BND and AGG.
456;STT;State Street Corp;2011-07-07T15:36:38Z;Emerging investors cross new frontiers;Emerging market investors are looking beyond Brics and equities;Emerging markets have become such a strong focus for asset managers that the topic enjoyed a whole day to itself at the recent Fund Forum conference in Monaco. Those attending heard that interest has widened, both in geographical and asset class terms, but were warned not to expect outsized returns.Investors are increasingly pinning their hopes on emerging markets as developed countries grapple with debt problems and flat economies. But they are looking beyond the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to a wider mix of countries, including frontier markets such as Nigeria, Qatar and Vietnam.“Diversification is crucial in emerging markets,” says Slim Feriani, chief executive and chief investment officer at Advance Emerging Capital, which invests 80 per cent of the $850m assets under management in emerging markets and the rest in frontier markets. “The emerging market story is not just about China, Asia or Brics but about an investable universe of roughly 25 countries – deemed emerging by index providers – and another 50 countries called frontier markets,” he adds.While China has “taken the spotlight and put emerging markets on the global map over the past decade”, he believes the best investment opportunities are currently in countries benefiting from Chinese and Asian growth, such as resource-rich Brazil, Russia and Nigeria, and parts of the Middle East such as Qatar.Cheap valuations are attractive, say asset managers. Mr Feriani maintains frontier markets offer “compelling value and are among the cheapest global asset classes”. They are under-researched and lacking in aggregate data, which provides “plenty of valuation anomalies to exploit for those doing their homework,” he maintains.Qatar is trading at a trailing price/earnings ratio of 13.5 times and Nigeria a trailing 13.7 times, says Mr Feriani, while Turkey, with a p/e ratio of 10.9 times, offers compelling valuations. He also likes Russia which, although not a frontier market, trades at a p/e ratio of 7.5 times. “Yet these countries do not get the positive coverage that China or Asia get,” he adds. In comparison the MSCI World index sports a trailing p/e ratio of 14.5 times.Mr Feriani believes the risk/reward trade off in Nigeria, Qatar, Russia and Turkey is “worth it at this stage,” as at these valuations a significant part of the risk is priced in.Mark Mobius, chairman of Templeton’s Emerging Markets Group, is also keen on Russia. It offers the cheapest prices as “people are so negative on the country that stocks are cheap”. Unlike many investors who worry about political risk, governance and the country’s heavy reliance on natural resources, Mr Mobius believes Russia is “going the right way”.He also has large exposure to China where he likes local telecommunication companies and consumer stocks when the price is right, but is keen to broaden the scope of Templeton’s Frontier Market Fund, which has $1bn of assets under management. He is looking at markets such as Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, which he believes are “feeling their way towards a market economy”.More exotic frontier markets such as Mongolia are moving into the frame. Hong Kong-based Quam Asset Management recently launched the Silkroad Mongolia Fund, focusing on the country’s commodity-driven growth and local currency.Factors such as rapid economic growth, driven by the rise of middle class consumers, and lower debt levels than those in developed economies are also catching investor interest. Public and private sector debt levels compared to reserves in regions such as the Middle East and Africa are far healthier than in Europe or the US, according to the International Monetary Fund.Traditionally investors have gained exposure to emerging markets largely through equities but are looking at other asset classes such as currency and local currency debt.“If you go into countries like Ghana and Nigeria you can get double digit returns in local currency terms. But choose your countries carefully and on the credit side look at companies with good balance sheets and solid management. Look at the fundamentals,” says Zin Bekkali, chief executive of Silk Invest, an emerging market specialist.According to EPFR Global, the fund data provider, in the second quarter of the year emerging markets dollar bond funds took in a net $3.63bn, while local currency ones attracted more than $8bn.“EM local currency debt offers something for the yield-hungry, a hedge against long-term dollar weakness,” says Cameron Brandt, research director at EPFR.However, the question of just how much further emerging markets will go before blowing up continues to be a concern. Opinions vary. Mr Mobius discounts a bubble in the short term because new money in initial public offerings in Asia is boosting the region. In 2010, $450bn poured into the region’s companies, surpassing the US, effectively banishing any spectre of a bubble for now, he says.China is leading the global recovery, says Linda Yueh, an economist and director of the China Growth Centre at Oxford University. If it wants “to sustain its place and secure another golden era of growth it will have to open its economy,” she adds. She is cautious on the risks of investing when “so much reform is needed”, and advises investors to “go in a bit at at time”.Rick Lacaille, global chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, is equally cautious about the wider emerging market scene. “Don’t expect too much and have overblown expectations of returns but there is a case for emerging market currencies, such as renminbi denominated products,” he says.
457;STT;State Street Corp;2011-07-05T17:39:19Z;US ETF provider competition reaches new heights;Vanguard leads race for investors’ cash in 2011;A swathe of US exchange traded funds providers saw substantial increases in global investor inflows in the first half of 2011 as momentum for the ETF industry continued to build strongly.Newer providers of US-listed ETFs are capturing a growing share of investor inflows and posing a greater threat to the previously impregnable dominance of the largest players in the industry.The US ETF industry attracted total inflows of $58.6bn in the first six months of the year, up 46.9 per cent on the same period in 2010, according to data released by the National Stock Exchange.Vanguard led the race for inflows among ETF providers. It gathered $20.9bn in the first half of 2011, an increase of 21.9 per cent on the same period last year.BlackRock also enjoyed a strong first half with inflows into its iShares ETF business of just over $12bn, up 12.1 per cent.That was in spite of big outflows ($8.5bn) from the iShares emerging markets ETF (known as EEM) which has suffered as a result of a price war with the rival Vanguard emerging markets ETF (known as VWO) which managed to attract $5.3bn.The iShares silver ETF, the world’s largest, also saw big outflows after the sharp correction in silver prices earlier this year.Meanwhile, State Street Global Advisors, the third largest ETF provider by assets, continued to lag behind its peers as it suffered disappointment with net outflows of $61m in the first half.But the grip of the established “big three” ETF providers on investor inflows appears to be weakening. BlackRock (iShares), Vanguard and State Street captured 56.1 per cent of all inflows in the first half of the year, a big drop compared with the same period of 2010 when they captured almost three-quarters (72.4 per cent) of the new cash for ETFs.Van Eck ranked third in terms of inflows, which it saw more than double to just under $5bn in the first half of the year, helped by the growing popularity of its Market Vectors agriculture ETF (known as MOO) which alone attracted almost $3bn, making it the second most popular product choice for ETF investors so far this year.Wisdom Tree saw inflows rise eightfold to just under $3bn from $338m.A total of 11 providers gathered more than $1bn in cash each in the first half. Pimco fell just short with inflows of $969m.Pimco, which entered the market in 2009, now has ETF assets of $3.2bn and is just one example of how new entrants have managed to build substantial ETF business very rapidly.Charles Schwab attracted inflows of $1.6bn this year, helping it to construct an ETF business with assets of $4.4bn from a range of just 13 products.Another example of a strongly performing “upstart” came from GlobalX which attracted $521m in the first half, pushing its assets up to $1.7bn by the end of June.
458;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Bank plans will help Singapore be leading fund centre;There have been calls for Singapore to instate a more flexible fund structure;Last month, Singapore’s financial market regulator and central banking authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), reiterated its intentions of strengthening the city-state’s fund administration services. Unsurprising, perhaps, but a further indication of the regulator’s committment to making the Lion City Asia’s leading fund centre.Pragmatic regulation, including exempt licensing provisions for smaller managers, has largely been applauded by the investment community and has helped Singapore extend the depth and diversity of local and global fund managers operating there.“This [fund administration initiative] is a multi-year and multi-phased plan of MAS to position Singapore as the leading fund management hub for Asia-Pacific,” says Chong Jin Leow of BNY Mellon. The regulator has for a long time courted administrators, he says, and should be commended for transforming an industry that five years ago only had around four dominant administrators, three of which were bank subsidiaries.Currently, roughly half the funds sold in Singapore are Dublin and Luxembourg-domiciled Ucits funds, but few if any are administered there.Han Ming Ho, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance, says: “Plan 2.0 for MAS now is to think about how to bring the funds themselves to Singapore. We’ve always known MAS has been supportive of strengthening the infrastructure. Part of this would include service providers, including administrators.”Nick Wright, chief operating officer at State Street Global Services, adds: “If Singapore is successful in building itself out as a fund domicile I think fund administration will logically grow from that.”Mr Ho points out that MAS had previously called for hedge fund administrators to set up in the city, “and I think we now have more than 30 administrators here”.According to the regulator, fund administrators find Singapore an ideal base from which to service their Asian clients.“MAS will continue to enhance the ecosystem for fund managers, including building up the fund administration and fund domiciliation sectors, to ensure the long term sustainable growth of the asset management industry,” says a spokesperson.Mr Chong says MAS consulted last year on the requirement for the separation of fund management and fund administration functions. He believes part of the regulator’s next phase of building up administration services is to encourage administrators to offer an outsourced service to fund houses in order for the latter to comply with the independence requirements that will be imposed on them.State Street’s Mr Wright has a different stance. The bigger opportunity being considered by MAS, he believes, is for Asia to develop a fund passporting capability that encompasses either the whole of Asia-Pacific, or, more realistically, Asean member states, of which there are 10 including Singapore.“If this can be achieved you could potentially lose the link between fund domicile and fund administration centre,” he says. He does not see Singapore becoming a regional hub until a funds passporting solution akin to the European Union Ucits framework is realised.Questioned on whether a cross-border initiative is under discussion, a spokesperson for MAS says: “The Asean Capital Markets Forum, of which the Monetary Authority of Singapore is a member, is currently looking into developing mutual recognition of CIS [collective investment schemes] among Asean [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] members.”To become a more attractive local fund domicile Singapore also needs more legal vehicles. The capability is there to set up a fund as a company, a unit trust or as a limited partnership but what is lacking is the flexibility of an open-ended investment company (Oeic) structure, which is widely used in centres such as the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg.“I believe MAS is aware the legal infrastructure needs to be expanded,” says Mr Ho.“If they’re able to get the framework out in a reasonable time, Singapore would put itself in a strong position to capture quality funds.”Peter Douglas, principal of GFIA, a Singapore-based hedge fund advisory business, is in agreement: “For the policy to be successful there needs to be a suite of different structures available. Singapore fund structures for a broader market have been on paper for a while but I think we’re beginning to see early signs of traction.”With a more flexible Oeic-like structure, MAS would hope to attract quality private equity, infrastructure and real estate funds in addition to hedge funds, says Mr Ho.
459;STT;State Street Corp;2011-06-08T02:44:34Z;State Street to roll out iPad app;;State Street, one of the leading providers of financial services to institutional investors, will roll out a new mobile application for Apple’s iPad this autumn that will enable users to view their entire investment portfolio at a glance, including risk-exposure analysis, net asset value (NAV) summaries, and fund flows.Boston-based State Street, which has $22,600bn assets in custody for other institutions and $2,100bn under management, is one of the first custodian banks to embrace Apple’s popular tablet device.“As part of its multiyear business transformation program, State Street continues to invest in new technologies, like mobile applications, to introduce new or strengthen existing services that meet the changing needs of our clients,” said Chris Perretta, State Street’s chief information officer. “The rapid adoption of the iPad in the financial services industry makes it a natural fit for our first foray into mobile applications for our institutional client base.”Mr Perratta has championed the use of digital devices such as the iPad, smartphones and ‘the consumerisation of IT’ within State Street in the belief that much of the most exciting innovation in the IT industry is taking place in the consumer segment.The app, called State Street Springboard, is targeted at executive-level portfolio and fund managers and allows clients to view essential portfolio information that is specifically designed for mobile users.

460;STT;State Street Corp;2011-05-29T11:17:44Z;Star managers bring success, report suggests;;"The most successful fund firms have visible fund managers and are pro-active in terms of their marketing and communications, according to a report by Strategic Insight.The report shows “blockbuster” firms, such as Carmignac Gestion and Skagen, have succeeded because of being able to roll out their star managers to investors and the media.Daniel Enskat, head of global consulting for Strategic Insight, says: “It is clearly easier for an investor or distributor to grasp a concept if it is tied to a personality.“It makes life easier for intermediaries to distribute a firm’s flagship fund if the manager is [likeable] and communicative.”The report, David and Goliath in the Global Asset Management Industry, finds that during the first quarter of 2011 the lion’s share of assets was collected by only a fraction of the mutual funds that exist globally (0.3 per cent).Mr Enskat says this confirms a trend towards “blockbuster products and an accelerating winner-takes-all phenomenon in the global asset management industry since the financial crisis”.Guy Boden, head of fund research at S&P Fund Services, is not convinced. He says there are also good funds managed by a team and are quant driven.“Quant funds are not run by stars but have experts in technology and process,” he says. Mr Boden adds that star managers are stars because fund firms have pro-actively marketed them.He says: “For example, it’s not Fidelity’s China Special Situations; it’s known as Anthony Bolton’s fund.“[The stars] are fantastic fund managers but the organisations have put out press releases on their behalf, which gives them visibility but protects those individuals from spending all their time doing interviews.”Mike Karpik, senior managing director and head of investments at State Street Global Advisors, is also not a fan of the star approach. “The distinction of a highly visible fund manager is just another form of marketing or brand development.”SSgA relies on a team-based approach with a “solid and consistent investment process”, he says. Mr Karpik adds this is how SSgA builds and supports its brand.“Our approach is an enduring one relative to one that might be dependent on a single manager or glossy marketing.”Mr Enskat does concede in his report that distributors are looking for strategic partners as well as blockbuster funds.“The difficulty for asset managers is that on the one hand they need to develop the blockbuster fund, but on the other they need to develop a partnership.”He says there are also a number of risks for asset managers that have star managers, such as how that strategy can “blow up” and “limit a brand”.Gartmore ran into such difficulties in November last year when Roger Guy, one of its star managers, resigned, resulting in a strategic review, a bruising £10m cost-cutting programme and an eventual sale to Henderson.Heather Dale is a senior reporter on Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared"
461;STT;State Street Corp;2011-05-15T17:01:02Z;State Street eyes securities services buys;European banks expected to shed units to raise capital;State Street plans to expand its securities services arm outside the US through acquisitions, benefiting from European lenders’ needs to shed ancillary businesses to raise capital.“The market is going to deliver opportunity,” Jay Hooley, the trust bank’s chief executive, told the Financial Times. “I think we’re poised very well, from the standpoint of business model and capital strength, to take advantage of acquisitions as they present themselves.”Under Mr Hooley’s direction, State Street has sought to bulk up a custody and securities services arm that can benefit from greater scale.In adding to the business’s pool of assets, the company can spread out the costs of information technology expenses and boost returns.State Street bought the securities services businesses of Intesa Sanpaolo, the Italian bank, in late 2009 for about €1.3bn. It also acquired Mourant International Finance Administration, a fund administrator.Mr Hooley, who succeeded Ronald Logue as CEO in 2010, said he hoped to strike more deals this year.Extending its footprint in Europe will help Mr Hooley deliver on his promise to reduce its dependence on its home market. State Street, which is based in Boston, has said it aims to double non-US revenues from 2009 to the end of 2014.State Street recently won approval from the US Federal Reserve to raise its dividend and buy back shares, although “management would like to keep some dry powder in the event they find an attractive acquisition”, Robert Lee, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote in a note to clients.Spain’s Banco Santander owns a smaller custody arm. While some European banks might seek to sell their subscale securities businesses, industry bankers suggested that there was little left to buy in that sector in the US.Mr Hooley told the FT that a spate of lawsuits and regulatory probes into State Street’s foreign exchange business had not cost the company business.“We’ve seen no deterioration in volumes of our foreign exchange and feel quite comfortable with the service,” he said. “Customers are voting with their feet, viewing that there is good value in this service.”Federal and state prosecutors, along with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, are investigating the way State Street priced certain forex services, the company said in a regulatory filing this month.State Street has about $23,000bn in assets under custody and administration, as well as about $2,100bn in its asset management arm. The company operates in 26 countries.
462;STT;State Street Corp;2011-05-04T22:22:00Z;Bank to publish inflation data from internet;;Inflation data harvested from the internet will take its first big step into financial markets on Thursday after a bank agreed to publish real-time price indices developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.State Street will initially publish inflation data for the US, UK, Germany, France and Brazil in a partnership with PriceStats, a spin-off from MIT.The new indices will allow investors to track inflation almost as it happens and may help them to forecast official inflation data, which often move markets, with greater accuracy.Unlike official inflation numbers, which come out monthly with a lag of weeks, the new indices will come out every day with a lag of just three days. A further advantage is that the methodology used for different countries is the same whereas official agencies use different techniques.Roberto Rigobon, an economics professor who set up MIT’s Billion Prices Project’ with colleague Alberto Cavallo, told the Financial Times that a long-term goal is to “change the way that data is collected around the world”.The deal marks another step in the rapid development of real-time information on the economy, using electronic collection of data to produce statistics faster and at lower cost than traditional surveys.The MIT data is collected by automatically scanning retailer websites. By contrast, traditional inflation data is collected by researchers who visit thousands of shops to record prices.There are several other projects to collect economic information electronically or publish it in real time. For example, the payroll processor ADP publishes a monthly jobs index based on its internal data, which on Wednesday reported a 179,000 increase in private payrolls from March to April.Ceridian, another payment processor, publishes an industrial activity index based on credit card payments by truckers to buy fuel. Real estate websites have produced price indices and employment sites have published data on job openings.Google has developed its own Google Price Index based on similar scouring of internet retailers but has not yet published its results.Mr Rigobon said the PriceStats inflation indices are similar to official data in many countries. There are still differences, however, because some goods are not bought online so internet data is unlikely to displace official statistics soon.”We’re collecting information on almost every sector except for the services sector,” said Mr Rigobon.The PriceStats index for the US rose 1.91 per cent from January to March compared with a 1.96 per cent rise in the official consumer price index published by the Bureau of Labour Statistics.But the PriceStats index moved earlier – rising 0.81 per cent in January, before the official CPI caught up in March.“Our prices seem to move earlier than the official statistics,” Mr Rigobon said. State Street said using this to forecast official data would be an early priority.Mr Rigobon said a likely reason was that online shoppers tend to have higher incomes and are less price sensitive when they are buying. That may mean that online retailers can raise prices earlier than physical shops when they suffer an increase in their own costs.Neither PriceStats nor State Street would comment on the financial terms of the partnership or whether State Street has invested in PriceStats.
463;STT;State Street Corp;2011-04-29T13:26:06Z;Pension funds take shine to ETFs;;As exchange traded funds continue to grow in the retail space, managers say they are also seeing steady interest from pension funds and other institutional investors.Some of the biggest managers are leveraging their firms’ existing institutional relationships to introduce ETFs to pensions, while also educating investment consultants on what, according to managers, are the benefits of ETFs for institutional investors.The exact size of the institutional market for ETFs is hard to nail down. Most managers will say that about half of their total ETF assets come from “institutional” investors – but that term encompasses not just pensions, endowments and foundations, but also hedge funds, other asset managers, insurance companies and other financial institutions.Managers say they do not track exactly how much of their ETF assets come from pensions and similar institutional investors. A Greenwich Associates survey from last year, however, found that about 14 per cent of pensions, foundations and endowments use ETFs, and that figure is expected to grow.ETF managers agree. “We’ve seen great adoption by PFEs [pensions, foundations and endowments],” says Liz Tennican, managing director and head of institutional sales for iShares, BlackRock’s ETF unit.Jim Ross, global head of SPDR ETFs at State Street Global Advisors, has similar words. “The engagement we have with institutions today on ETFs, compared to two years ago, is dramatically different,” he says.Managers do not like to disclose their clients but regulatory filings give some insight into institutional ETF holdings. Harvard University’s endowment holds billions of dollars worth of ETFs from multiple providers. Raytheon’s corporate pension had about $2.4bn in ETFs at the end of last year, while the University of Notre Dame’s endowment held nearly $37m worth of ETFs at year-end.ETFs bring several advantages to pensions and endowments, experts say, including their liquidity. “They like the idea of using ETFs for a liquid overlay,” Mr Ross says. “They like that they can come in and out of the securities quickly” – a feature that makes ETFs a great vehicle for some of an institution’s cash allocation.Also, he says, ETFs are “used significantly during the transition management process” – that is, when a manager has been terminated, ETFs can be a great place to park the cash, and keep the exposure to an asset class, while the pension decides on a replacement manager.Furthermore, because they are tradable securities, ETFs can be put to work in a pension’s securities lending programme to earn a few extra points of return. And some institutions use ETFs for selected tactical exposure, Ms Tennican notes, to quickly and easily gain equity exposure to a certain country, sector or region, for example.Winning ETF business from a pension differs from winning a traditional institutional account, as there will not be an RFP (request for proposal) process. For that reason, the playing field may be slanted toward the larger ETF managers, since their parent firm will have existing relationships with such clients all over the world – relationships the ETF unit can leverage.“My team here at iShares works very closely with the broader BlackRock institutional team,” Ms Tennican says. “The primary focus for us tends to be those clients with in-house asset management. Those that do more tactical trades, or that are transitioning more, tend to be heavier users of iShares.”SPDR takes the same tack with its parent, institutional giant SSgA. “Our approach has been to leverage our existing sales and relationship management people,” Mr Ross says. “We partner with them to become an institutional ETF team. Instead of cold-calling their clients, we want to go in with them.”ETF providers also need to engage investment consultants, the gatekeepers that help institutional investors decide where to put their money. “We speak with consultants and spend a lot of time with them, but we want to spend more time with them,” Ms Tennican says. “Obviously we view iShares as a powerful tool in portfolios, so we want to work with consultants on how iShares can be beneficial in their client portfolios.”Mr Ross adds: “The consultant community is getting more questions about ETFs [from pension clients], so at a minimum they want to be educated and have an understanding. We know those consultants, so we’re obviously actively offering to help educate them.”But scepticism remains. “Some consultants still have very little interest,” Mr Ross concedes. “Some say the cost is higher than a separate account, for example.”That may be true in one sense, but the real cost will depend on factors such as trading costs and how long a pension intends to hold the investment. Ms Tennican says BlackRock, for instance, will run cost analyses for prospective pension clients, and may end up suggesting both ETFs and commingled trust funds as the most cost-effective solution.While ETF managers are understandably bullish about their products, not every gatekeeper is. “We don’t have anyone with ETF-only mandates,” says Jay Kloepfer, executive vice-president and head of capital market and alternatives research at institutional consultanct Callan Associates. “We’re not opposed to them. ETFs are simply a tool,” he says. But, he adds, Callan has few if any clients with notable exposure to ETFs.Mr Kloepfer does not expect that to change, and few experts see ETFs ever being a huge institutional play.But slow, steady growth is expected: the Greenwich Associates survey last year found 61 per cent of respondents expecting to increase their ETF holdings over the next three years, with rises of between 1 and 4 per cent the most likely.Just 16 per cent said they would reduce their ETF investments, while a third of respondents said they expected no change.
464;STT;State Street Corp;2011-04-27T20:17:49Z;State Street hires former CFTC official;;State Street Corporation, the financial services group, has hired Charley Cooper, a former senior official at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to run a derivatives trading unit of the company’s eExchange business.The eExchange unit is part of State Street Global Markets and provides electronic trading across various asset class including FX, futures, government bonds and swaps.The move comes as many large financial institutions, including Wall Street banks, are hiring staff to build new market structures to comply with requirements for increased trading and clearing of over-the-counter derivatives under the Dodd-Frank act.Mr Cooper joins the company as senior managing director of State Street’s eExchange “derivatives programme”. Based in New York, he will report to Clifford Lewis, executive vice-president and head of eExchange.eExchange traces its roots to Currenex, an FX trading platform founded by Mr Lewis in 1999 and which was bought by State Street in 2007.State Street said Mr Cooper, 39, will “lead eExchange’s efforts to respond to market changes stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill”.“He will work with clients to ensure the continued success of existing products and build new state-of-the-art trading and settlement offerings to comply with the evolving regulatory landscape. State Street’s growing derivative servicing suite now includes end-to-end OTC and exchange traded derivatives processing, collateral management, and independent valuations,” State Street said.Mr Lewis said Mr Cooper’s “extensive experience in both the public and private sector make him a unique resource to help State Street and our clients navigate the market and regulatory changes ahead”.Mr Cooper spent more than two years as chief operating officer and chief of staff for CFTC, the US futures regulator, under the chairmanship of Rueben Jeffery.After that he worked at Deutsche Bank in London, where he was global head of legal operations in the risk management division, helping the company navigate the global financial crisis that began in 2007.From January 2004 to August 2005 Mr Cooper was special assistant and chief spokesman to deputy secretary of defence Paul Wolfowitz at the Pentagon.
465;STT;State Street Corp;2011-04-20T23:18:30Z;Pimco’s new ETF to focus on US debt;;Bill Gross, manager of the world’s largest mutual fund, is to run a new exchange-traded fund for Pimco.The involvement of such a high-profile investor in an actively traded ETF will attract attention, and assets, to a corner of an industry better known as a cheap and flexible way to make passive investments.Out of $929bn held in US ETFs at the end of February just $1.3bn, or 0.1 per cent, was actively managed, according to BlackRock.Several US money managers have registered active ETFs with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but have delayed launch due to the complexities of the product.While a mutual fund is traded on the basis of its net asset value at the end of each day, an ETF is traded intraday and underlying positions must be disclosed daily: revealing a manager’s strategy far sooner than with a mutual fund.For instance, the first active ETF to be launched by State Street Global Advisors this year will be quasi-active, using other ETFs for asset allocation.However, cheap ETFs are regarded as a key threat to traditional active managers. Introduced in 1993, the industry now accounts for 6.4 per cent of total assets managed by US investment companies, according to Aite Group, a consultancy.“Active ETFs are where you are going to see the disintermediation of mutual funds,” said Scott Powers, chief executive of SSGA.Fixed-income ETFs have grown rapidly since 2008, with assets tripling to around $133bn at the end of last year, notes Aite.Pimco’s new Total Return ETF will hold at least 65 per cent of its assets in US public and private debt, according to a regulatory filing.It may hold up to 10 per cent in high yield debt and up to a fifth in assets denominated in foreign currencies.The SEC bars such funds from significant use of derivatives.The ETF will be closely watched as an indication of the thinking of Mr Gross, who recently made a very public bet against the value of US Treasuries. A spokesperson for Pimco declined to comment.In an ETF market dominated by BlackRock’s iShares, SSGA and Vanguard, Pimco is the 14th largest US ETF manager, with $3bn of assets under management in 13 ETFs, at the end of March, according to BlackRock.
466;STT;State Street Corp;2011-04-03T09:23:28Z;Top US managers study bank overcharging claim;;With allegations mounting in the US that banks have overcharged pension funds for foreign exchange transactions, mutual fund investors are asking whether they are being fleeced too.The latest lawsuit was filed by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, which accuses Bank of New York Mellon of bilking its pension fund during forex trades. The court case comes on the heels of similar suits charging that pension funds in four states had been defrauded by BNY or a competitor, State Street Corp.Now Fidelity and the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, have reportedly looked into whether they were overbilled. According to The Wall Street Journal, BlackRock discovered the allegedly questionable charges because a newly acquired subsidiary had better monitoring systems than it did and received better prices from custody banks, including Bank of New York Mellon Corp.BlackRock declined to comment. Fidelity’s trading desk handles the vast majority of its funds’ forex transactions, although a subsidiary does use custodian banks for certain trades, Vincent Loporchio says in a statement. The firm is “monitoring information and allegations concerning custodian bank practices”, he says. There is no information as yet from Fidelity as to which banks are suspected.Both BNY and State Street have denied wrongdoing.The lawsuits allege the banks inflated the prices of forex trades in violation of their agreements with the pension funds. In addition to Septa, BNY is being sued by Virginia and Florida.State Street faces lawsuits by California and Arkansas, and it agreed to pay the state of Washington a nearly $12m out-of-court settlement last year after similar accusations over the pricing of foreign exchange trades. Attorneys general in Massachusetts and Illinois are also said to be investigating.“The first principles in any market where you don’t have transparency and regulation is that people are potential victims of predatory behaviour,” says Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a Wall Street watchdog group. “The urgency to have transparency and regulation could not be more clear.”Many mutual funds rely on custodian banks for forex trading in the same way pension funds do. “A few pennies of difference can cost a fund complex tens or hundreds of millions of dollars if they’re trading billions of dollars of securities,” says Ron Fernandes, chief executive of Raven Partners.The funds’ managers are starting to demand more information from custodian banks.“What’s it going to cost us? How are you going to charge us?” asks David Thelander, managing director of Promontory Financial Group. “There are ways to structure a revised agreement so both sides understand their responsibilities.”The $4,000bn-a-day foreign exchange market is notoriously opaque.If a US mutual fund seeks to buy or sell a foreign security, first it must convert its dollars to the appropriate currency. Many fund complexes – especially smaller firms, or large ones making difficult trades – use custodian banks to execute those foreign exchange transactions.Custodian banks’ clients typically either directly negotiate the price of each transaction or place orders through “standing instruction” services, in which banks handle large numbers of transactions in bulk and the client learns the price later. The pension funds’ lawsuits allege the custodian banks used the opacity of standing instructions to game the system.Septa’s lawsuit alleges BNY – which bills itself as “the world’s largest global custodian,” with more than $20,000bn in assets under custody – assured clients that standing instruction forex trades were subject to best execution standards, which require the bank to obtain the best possible prices for its clients.However, the bank did not provide the transit system with time-stamped trading data that would have reflected the actual price of each trade, according to the lawsuit. Instead, the bank only disclosed to clients the full range of prices for the day, and “pocketed the difference” between its own relatively good trading prices and the worse prices it charged clients, the lawsuit charges.“If some of the accusations are true, that’s a very serious manipulative activity,” says David Hearth, a partner at Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker. “It could be a breach of the responsibilities the custodians have, depending on what the clients’ contracts say and what the custodian disclosed to its clients.”BNY publishes a guaranteed range of rates each morning, allows clients to opt out by 11 am and reports prices to clients daily, spokesman Kevin Heine says. Clients choose its standing instruction services because they provide “substantial benefits,” including better-than-retail prices and relief from certain risks and costs, he says.Foreign exchange trading is complex and demanding, and many fund managers do not have the desire or ability to negotiate their own trades, according to Mr Hearth. “The problem with it being automatic is the fund is a little bit of a captive customer,” he says.Maura McDermott is a reporter on Board IQ, a Financial Times publication
467;STT;State Street Corp;2011-03-30T19:02:12Z;Brics in the wall: smaller nations offer value;;While the Brics make headlines, smaller markets can often give investors a better return. The problem is that a small market can be more volatile – too many eggs in Thailand can be riskier than too many in China.But a basket of smaller markets is a different matter. State Street Global Advisors has calculated that a group of smaller EMs outperformed the Brics in equities by 39 per cent over 14 years. That’s worth going for. But there are catches – smaller markets offer less liquidity and less stock choice.The US fund management company, which has about $75bn in assets under management in EM equities, looked at the performance of 11 smaller markets from the end of 1996 – Colombia, Egypt, the Czech Republic, Peru, Hungary, Turkey, Chile, Poland, the Philippines, Thailand and Israel (although Israel was dropped last year when it graduated from the MSCI emerging markets index).Portfolio manager Chris Laine chose the countries on the basis that they accounted for a maximum of 2 per cent of the MSCI emerging markets index and their stock markets were not overly dependent on a handful of dominant stocks (as is the case, for example, in Morocco, with Maroc Telecom).Mr Laine’s report says: “The rise of the emerging markets is more than just a Bric story. Investors, while maintaining a core exposure to these Bric economies, should not close their eyes to other growth areas in the emerging world.“Many of the smaller emerging and frontier economies have quietly been making investor-friendly reforms and deserve the attention of international investors. Many of these economies offer value, growth, and solid profitability, but certainly with some challenges [liquidity, investability, and volatility to name a few].”Mr Laine estimates that his 10 countries account for about 10 per cent of the MSCI EM index and he advises investors to go overweight and hold up to about 15 per cent of their EM equity portfolio in these markets. But it is horses for courses – big funds may have trouble building sufficiently big positions because of the lower levels of liquidity than in Bric markets.Curiously, as well as the greater capital appreciation, the smaller markets offer better dividend yields – 2.8 per cent versus 2.1 per cent for Brics. Looking forward, Mr Laine suggests that smaller markets should continue to do better than Brics because they tend to perform better than the MSCI EM benchmark index.But diversification is the key. He warns against trying to pick one small market over others, particularly in the light of the recent upsurge in unexpected events, notably the turmoil in the Middle East. “A high level of diversification should always be in fashion.”
468;STT;State Street Corp;2011-03-21T19:55:11Z;US Treasury eyes $20bn profit on crisis securities;;The US Treasury will sell a $142bn portfolio of mortgage-backed securities acquired during the financial crisis, in the latest withdrawal from government market intervention.Officials said on Monday they expect to generate $15bn to $20bn in profit from the sale of the securities. The assets were acquired in 2008 and 2009 under authority granted by Congress to fight market turmoil.The sale, at a rate of up to $10bn a month, will help reduce the federal deficit, but officials stressed its timing was not related to an impending debt limit crunch. The government is expected to breach its debt limit between April 15 and May 31 and needs a reprieve from fiscal hawks in Congress.“The pace that we’ll be unwinding this will not have much impact on the debt ceiling discussions,” a senior Treasury official said.However, analysts noted that a faster sale of the MBS might be one of several stopgap measures the Obama administration deploys to avoid a US debt default, if a sufficient number of congressional Republicans ignore pleas to increase the debt limit from $14,300bn.The yield on the 30-year current mortgage coupon initially rose to 4.21 per cent from a close of 4.10 per cent on Friday as prices fell. In late afternoon trade in New York, it was yielding 4.18 per cent.“The market is trying to make sense out of the unexpected actions of the US Treasury,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank. “If there is a positive, it is that the Treasury believes the market is strong enough to absorb this supply and it may actually mean they sell less Treasuries,” he said.The Treasury’s investments are dwarfed by the holdings of the Federal Reserve, which bought $1,250bn of MBS in the crisis. At some point the Fed will sell its portfolio as part of a tightening of monetary policy. The Treasury said it made the Fed aware of its plan to sell.Market talk queried whether any large holder of the securities also had advance notice because there was heavy selling pressure for some of the MBS last week. “We absolutely did not discuss it with anyone in the market,” the senior official said.State Street Global Advisors, which acted for the Treasury to buy the MBS between October 2008 and December 2009, will manage the sale of the securities, most of which are 30-year fixed rate MBS backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage guarantors.In another sign of a return to pre-crisis financial markets, Citigroup, which came close to collapse in 2008, announced plans to pay a modest dividend of 1 cent a share, which it eliminated in 2009.
469;STT;State Street Corp;2011-03-16T18:43:59Z;Traders seek answers on US derivatives reform;;Amid the turmoil of the markets, the hundreds of executives from trading firms, exchanges and clearing houses meeting this week at Boca Raton in the US are sure of one thing. There are many more of them at this year’s annual industry gathering than during the financial crisis.The higher numbers partly reflect a strong recovery in the trading of derivatives that are the lifeblood of the members of the Futures Industry Association, the trade body hosting the event in Florida. FIA data show the number of futures and options contracts traded on exchanges globally rose 25.6 per cent last year from 2009.Many, however, will also have attended for answers to one question dominating the derivatives industry: how to make money out of the sweeping US regulatory reform of off-exchange, or “over-the-counter” markets.When the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill was working its way through Congress, the assumption of many in the industry was that its requirement for OTC derivatives to be moved on to exchanges and electronic trading platforms known as “swap execution facilities” would mean a fees bonanza.The same thinking applied to clearing houses, which stand between the parties to a trade and take on the financial risk if one party defaults.In theory, they should benefit from the act’s insistence that standardised OTC derivatives be processed through them.Yet, in the nine months since the law was passed and as Europe moves ahead with similar reforms, nagging doubts over the scale of the opportunity for exchange operators and clearers have turned into fears the reforms will in fact saddle many players with additional costs.Jonathan Herbst, partner in the London office of law firm Norton Rose says: “These are the conversations we are having with clients. What impact is this going to have on our business and what opportunities are there for us? They are finding the answers difficult.”Doubts over the final shape of the reforms have been exacerbated by US regulators struggling to meet a timetable for detailed rules on how Dodd-Frank is to be implemented. Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, said last month that a July 15 deadline to complete the work was likely to be missed, admitting: “We are human.”Lee Olesky, chief executive of Tradeweb, an electronic trading platform, says: “When you add up all these costs and layer in the regulatory structure and what it’s going to look like, you do have a very challenging environment for market participants.”The requirement for OTC derivatives to be more formally traded is likely to result in a proliferation of SEFs, as many as 40, the CFTC thinks.Yet that rule could fragment trading, making it harder for clear winners to emerge and even reducing liquidity. That is because OTC derivatives are mostly in the hands of dealers, where large-sized trades, especially in interest rate swaps, are done privately. Forcing trading on to SEFs, where prices must be displayed publicly, could reduce the incentive to trade, experts say.Nicholas Watts, Redburn Partners analyst, believes that consolidation will eventually thin out the number of SEFs. But, in the meantime, the growth of SEFs “could impact pricing and liquidity”.Regulatory developments in Europe are adding complications. The region’s equivalent of SEFs, known as “organised trading facilities”, has been defined loosely so far. The existing dealer model in OTC derivatives could well survive there. But that is at odds with the more “exchange-like” model being pushed by the CFTC in the US.On the clearing side, too, banks have been busy transforming their existing on-exchange futures and options broking units to incorporate OTC derivatives. That is because Dodd-Frank says futures brokers must act as the intermediaries between users of OTC derivatives, such as hedge funds, and clearing houses.Some banks are unsure how much to invest in building this new business line. Moreover, daily turnover in some of the biggest OTC derivatives markets by value is relatively small. Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman, a consultancy, estimate that only 3,000-3,500 interest rate swaps contracts are traded each day. That compares with 2.7m eurodollar interest rate futures contracts traded daily last month at CME Group, the US operator of futures exchanges.Steve Martin, head of futures for Europe at State Street, told a conference in London recently: “If I were a betting man this is likely to be more of a client service rather than a revenue opportunity.”Banks also worry about the spider’s web of technology and back office connections they will need to be connected to clearing houses, as well as to the “trade repositories” that Dodd-Frank says must be set up to provide an electronic audit trail of trades.The technology will only get more complicated as new clearing initiatives emerge in Asia. Last month, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing unveiled plans to launch OTC interest rate swaps clearing in 2012, on the heels of a similar initiative at SGX, the Singapore Exchange.Karen Newton, European head of OTC operations at Credit Suisse, says: “This will inevitably increase costs for banks in the short term although it’s probable these will be reduced as competition reduces the number of companies in the market.”Few are willing to guess when that will happen.www.ft.com/tradingroom

Put away your national flags;This is getting ridiculous.First US senator Chuck Schumer, senior Democratic senator for New York, warns that the proposed combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext could be problematic if the “NYSE” name doesn’t come first in the way the merged entity is eventually named. America first, he seems to be saying.Then a labour union member of the Deutsche Börse supervisory board, Johannes Witt, warns that the merged group could eventually be taken over by the Americans, just as Euronext was when the New York Stock Exchange bought it in 2007.Time out, people. Put away your national flags. This isn’t about German or American control, it’s about the globalised nature of exchanges and markets.Yes, it looks like five of the nine executive positions on the merged entity’s board will be from Deutsche Börse. And yes NYSE Euronext seems to have done rather well in the allocation of management jobs.Not only has Duncan Niedauerer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, snagged that job in the new group, but Larry Leibowitz remains COO and will carry on running US cash equities. No change for New York there.And in Europe, Rolande Bellegarde stays as head of European cash equities, while Dominique Cerrutti, deputy NYSE Euronext CEO, stays on too in a tech role.The only concession I will make to the fear-mongers about German influence is that two of the plum jobs are indeed going to Börse people: Andreas Preuss, CEO of Eurex, gets to be global head of derivatives and Jeffrey Tessler, CEO of Clearstream, gets to be head of clearing and settlement. Given how vastly more important in the exchange business are derivatives and clearing, this is significant. But Mr Tessler is not German, he is an American based in Luxembourg.One puzzle here is what happens to Garry Jones, NYSE Euronext’s highly respected global head of derivatives at NYSE Liffe. If you compare and contrast the job he has done at NYSE Liffe with what Mr Preuss has done at Eurex, you have to wonder what made them pick Mr Preuss, aside from the fact that, mathematically, they couldn’t very well give the global derivatives job to an NYSE Euronext guy in addition to all the other slots that the US group has secured.I’m not saying Mr Preuss is not up to the job. But Mr Jones has very effectively built out the NYSE Liffe business since he’s been in that job. Mr Preuss has presided over an uncomfortable foray into the US options market with the purchase of the International Securities Exchange, resulting in a massive writedown. Eurex has not exactly blazed a trail in over-the-counter derivatives clearing either.But I digress.The real point here is: who owns these businesses? Who are the shareholders? Not only do Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext have very much the same set of shareholders but they are – wait for it – US-based institutions with global portfolios. People like BlackRock, Fidelity and State Street. The largest shareholder in the merged group is likely to be T Rowe Price.For New York, this should be a source of re-assurance. For Germany? Well, only a fraction of Deutsche Börse’s shareholders were German anyway. Deutsche Bank, for example, doesn’t even figure in the top 17.For any Germans worried about American influence, I go back to my point above: Börse executives are in something of a driving seat with derivatives and clearing. It’s easy to underestimate that.In the end this may all balance out perfectly well. And to be honest Mr Schumer and Mr Witt both have galleries to play to. What’s really striking in all of this is that neither of them has come out against the industrial logic of this deal.For that, we will have to wait and see how far the banks are willing to go in expressing their concerns about the global derivatives duopoly that this will create, with the CME Group in Chicago set against this new behemoth. So far they haven’t said much.But you never know, perhaps that’s because they are too busy realising how much money they can make instead as advisers on these mega-deals.
471;STT;State Street Corp;2011-02-13T23:57:28Z;Personal devices invade the corporation;;Until a few years ago, most companies’ “mobile strategy” consisted of issuing a BlackBerry and a laptop PC to executives, sales reps and consultants who needed to communicate while working off-base.Times have changed.Today, companies are grappling with the implications of the flood of mobile devices originally designed for the consumer market into the enterprise.Rather than battling the trend, some, including SAP, the German enterprise software group, and Boston-based State Street Bank, are embracing it and incorporating these devices into their business strategies.Others, recognising the potential of mobile and remote working to transform their operations, are investing heavily in new mobile strategies to improve efficiency, reach new markets and serve their customers better.“Mobilising as many employees as possible is a key effort in which enterprises have to invest,” says Oliver Bussmann, who became SAP’s chief information officer in 2009, after working for Allianz Group and Deutsche Bank.“It is important to allow certain employee-purchased devices and device platforms controlled access to enterprise processes and data,” he says.“Allowing mobile access to employees allows much smoother data consumption and processing, for example time recording, travel expenses and employee directory. This motivates employees and keeps corporate data up-to-date and best-consumed across the enterprise.”Mr Bussmann says SAP is seeing a significant rise in requests from employees to use personal devices, such as smartphones, laptops and tablets for work purposes.“The key challenge is to have a clear separation – from a security and data privacy point of view – between the personal user end and the security aspect. The raw infrastructure has to have the ability to manage multiple devices in a more secure way.”Chris Perretta, State Street Bank’s chief information officer, agrees. “Job number one is to secure [customer] information,” he says. State Street, which provides custodial and other services for institutional investors, is working on an application that will enable its institutional customers to access their portfolio information via an iPad.“We need to innovate in order to serve our customers,” he says.Like other business leaders, Mr Perretta believes it is inevitable that consumer devices such as the iPad will find their way into business, because the consumer electronics industry has the funds to invest in products that employees and customers want.SAP’s Mr Bussmann adds: “People want to use the same device in their personal life and in their work life.” But Mr Bussmann sees broader potential in this shift. “We see a trend in which the attention of users and IT organisations shifts from devices, infrastructure and applications to information and interaction with peers.”SAP began deploying tablets in May 2010, because it enabled the company’s software team to develop and test applications, and to provide SAP’s mobile workforce in sales and marketing, as well as executives, with a tool that would enable them to have real-time access to corporate data.“The most important thing is access to dashboards, and business intelligence information that is already in the corporate environment,” he says.Enabling existing company software applications to run on smartphones and other mobile devices – or building new mobile apps from scratch – is becoming a significant growth area for software companies, system integrators and mobile network operators.“We are seeing a big increase in interest [in mobile application development] from our enterprise customers,” says Abhi Ingle, vice-president of AT&T’s advanced enterprise mobility solutions group.Custom Bandag, a 35-year-old family-owned company with 350 employees and 80 trucks that specialises in providing trucking and construction firms with commercial tyre services in the New York area, is using a navigation and tracking tool called TeleNav Track from AT&T, running on ruggedised Motorola Tundra handsets.Dispatchers can log on to a web page, and see a map showing where each truck is, along with information on its speed and direction.“When a call comes into one of our locations for emergency road service, a dispatcher can quickly tell which of his trucks to send,” explains Fred De Jesus, the general manager.In Europe, Securitas, a security company, turned to Sonim, a specialist manufacturer of extremely rugged and reliable mobile phones with extended battery lives, when it needed a better way to protect its security guards in the Netherlands.In the past, Securitas had relied on portable private radios to communicate with its guards, many of whom work alone. However, in some rural environments, guards experienced poor reception, causing them to lose contact with the team during their rounds and they were often not monitored by the emergency response centre.“Safety of our personnel is paramount,” says Guido Krauss, IT project manager at Securitas. “The risk of being confronted with criminals is increasing, especially during night shifts.”Securitas is equipping its security guards with Sonim’s XP3 Sentinel handset, a Mars-bar sized ruggedised phone with advanced “loneworker” features, enabling the employee to communicate at all times with the Securitas dispatch centre.The new system has been configured to send an SMS text message every 15 minutes to check if the guard is safe. The handsets can be configured to send the guard’s location automatically to the control centre, using GPS.Utilities, transportation and logistics companies are using mobile networks and technologies such as GPS to connect machines as well as humans.While still in its infancy, the machine-to-machine, or M2M, market is one of the fastest growing segments of the mobile market, giving service providers a lucrative way to make use of their lower speed “legacy” networks.Trucking and railway companies use sensors, GPS and mobile communications to relay information about shipments to customers.Other companies such as Mednet, a US provider of cardiac monitoring products and surveillance services, are using mobile communications to improve customer healthcare.Mednet’s system helps doctors and patients monitor heart arrhythmia remotely through personal mobile devices.
472;STT;State Street Corp;2011-02-06T21:51:52Z;Goldman’s plans for cash pile hit by asset price rises;;Goldman Sachs’ attempt to spend some of its $170bn excess capital on loans, real estate and other distressed assets is being hampered by a prolonged rebound in risk appetite that has lifted prices on many would-be bargains.Goldman’s financial strength in the wake of the crisis has helped the bank stockpile “excess liquidity,” or cash deposits and securities it could sell or pledge quickly, but the assets have weighed down its returns.Undaunted, Goldman executives have said they would continue to prioritise these deals above accelerating stock buy-back plans or raising dividends.David Viniar, Goldman’s finance chief, told analysts last month: “Our number one choice will be to find opportunities to use the capital profitably, and if not we would probably give some more back.”The strategy stands in contrast to those pursued by many of Goldman’s rivals, which are awaiting US regulators’ approval to return their excess capital to shareholders.Goldman bought more than $8bn in mortgage-backed securities in December from State Street, a US trust bank, people familiar with the matter said. Similar deals, Goldman executives lament, have been elusive.If asset prices remain at current levels, Goldman has said it could change gear and begin to sell portfolios.Goldman has long been one of Wall Street’s most active investors in distressed assets – from bankrupt golf courses in Japan to empty office buildings in China – using its vast network of contacts to help identify troubled assets and snap them up at attractive prices.But the rapid return of risk appetite and the availability of relatively cheap credit has left a number of distressed assets funds bereft of opportunities.
473;STT;State Street Corp;2011-02-06T11:11:54Z;Smaller players make their quality mark;;"The exchange traded funds landscape may be dominated by three big players – BlackRock’s iShares, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors – but newcomers are gaining a foothold, winning market share.Among the new wave of providers gaining business are Charles Schwab, Pimco and GlobalX. Each shows US net inflows between $1bn and $2bn in 2010, establishing a market share of 0.3 per cent, 0.2 per cent and 0.1 per cent, respectively, according to BlackRock’s recent annual industry report and the National Stock Exchange. Another
27 asset managers are planning to enter the US market.It is not knock-the-lights-out competition for the big players: iShares remains the dominant provider globally, with a 44 per cent market share last year, while State Street has nearly 15 per cent and Vanguard 11 per cent. But greater competition is eroding the lead of the biggest groups, with iShares seeing its share fall by 3 percentage points in 2010 while State Street Global Advisors was down one point.So smaller players are starting to build business but will they succeed without the scale of their bigger rivals? Opinions are mixed.“Success is still pinned down to the top three [providers] which account for 70 per cent of assets on a global basis,” says Deborah Fuhr, head of ETF research at BlackRock. “Everyone else has less than 5 per cent of market share.”However, Ms Fuhr believes success is not simply a question of scale. “The challenge is not just to become big but to offer the right products in the right place.” Having scale in one market does not mean it will work in others, she adds. It is not possible to sell European funds into the US, for example.Mike Latham, global head of iShares, believes only about two or three newcomers will become big players. “You need scale to reach this and to drive billions of dollars in ETFs. It will not happen overnight,” he says.He believes “the [ETF] pie is likely to grow so there will be space for others”. In Europe retail investors are just beginning to see the benefit of ETFs, he adds.He does not place too much emphasis on market share “as it can be down to a lot of factors” but is more concerned about net assets. “We had $43bn net new assets in 2010 and that is what counts,” he says.At Source, an ETF provider that launched 18 months ago, Ted Hood, chief executive, believes there is space for niche players to grow and succeed, with “huge room for ETFs to grow for people who add value”.He points to Vanguard which “came from nowhere a few years ago”, now taking market share from iShares. He believes others can do the same and also expects to see greater investor participation in Europe, following the more mature US market.He believes getting into the business with “what is already there” will not work. The way to compete is to offer “good quality content”, he says. On the fixed income side, he says Source is doing this through a joint venture set up in December with Pimco to roll out fixed income ETFs. Pimco already has more than $2bn of ETF assets under management in the US since launching in 2009.Niche providers eyeing the European market hope that ETFs will benefit from the UK’s retail distribution review, which is to ban commission payments on advised sales from 2013. ETFs do not typically pay commission so tend not to be on the menu for commission-based advisers.“This change could send more business to ETF providers,” says Mr Hood.Some new players, including discount and online brokers, are competing for business by offering commission-free ETFs.Charles Schwab, a new entrant in 2009, led the way in the US, followed by Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, and TD Ameritrade, a big US online broker. German brokers have followed suit.After introducing the offer to its retail investors last year, Charles Schwab saw net inflows in the US shoot up to more than $2bn in 2010, up from $313m, a year earlier.“As a newcomer we had a great year in flows last year”, says Tamara Bohlig, vice-president of product management.“A combination of a zero commission offer and low pricing certainly helps inflows,” she adds. Having a distribution platform, economies of scale, existing clients and being a manufacturer as well as a broker, also help, she says.Ms Fuhr believes US discount and online brokers see commission-free ETFs as “a marketing tool to bring people in, then sell them other products”.Ms Bohlig challenges this, saying Schwab’s ETFs are aimed largely at existing clients. But “of course we also look to attract new clients, which allows us to offer other products”, she adds.In the coming year, Schwab is determined to win market share from dominant players, she says. “We will make sure our distribution, core products and offer are right,” Ms Bohlig asserts.There were also losers last year. One of these, US Commodity Funds, a US provider offering oil and natural gas ETFs, saw nearly $1bn ($977m) of outflows. This followed significant underperformance of spot prices by both funds in 2009 due to contango (when new futures contracts cost more than expiring ones).Others also suffered outflows last year, including Old Mutual Global Shares, closing five funds last September, and Geary Advisors, which closed two, before making an exit from the ETF market.However, in spite of the pitfalls and the jostling with dominant providers, a number of new entrants and niche players made enough ripples last year to cause their bigger rivals to take notice."
474;STT;State Street Corp;2011-02-06T11:11:28Z;New players vie to scale heights of big three;;"The exchange traded funds industry is on a roll. Fuelled by a tenfold increase in assets over the past eight years and growing levels of investor interest, numerous new providers are battling for market share while established players are launching record numbers of new products. full reportThe three biggest players, iShares, Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors, are facing multiple challengers, including the ETF businesses linked to investment banks such as Deutsche Bank, Société Générale (Lyxor), and Credit Suisse, as well as the new wave of providers that have been able to build sizeable ETF operations in just a few years.Thirty-one new providers joined the market last year and 40 more are planning their first ETF launch.But this burgeoning success is attracting greater regulatory scrutiny and the industry faces some important challenges if ETFs are to become as widely used as traditional mutual funds.They have a long way to go to match the size of the mutual fund industry, but are enjoying strong growth. Global assets (all funds and products) rose 28.2 per cent to $1,482bn by the end of 2010 and are forecast by BlackRock to reach the $2,000bn mark by early 2012.That growth has been driven by investors’ appetite for more transparent and liquid products following the financial crisis.ETFs have also helped transform access to some of the asset classes that have grown in popularity since the financial crisis, such as gold and emerging markets.The ETF industry’s expansion also reflects a growing discontent with the performance and charges of traditional actively managed mutual funds, particularly in the US.A recent survey by Cogent Research found that mutual fund ownership among affluent US investors (with investable assets of more than $100,000 excluding property holdings) has dropped substantially over the past four years, from 94 per cent in 2006 to 75 per cent in 2010.The decline in investor allocations to mutual funds has been even more dramatic.“In 2006, about half of all retail-directed dollars were invested in mutual funds; today it is just under one-third,” says John Meunier, principal at Cogent.ETFs have been big beneficiaries of the shift in flows. Cogent’s study suggests the shift could have much further to run, as ETF ownership among wealthy investors has only increased from 7 per cent in 2006 to 11 per cent last year.Further, allocations to ETFs remain low, rising from just 0.8 per cent in 2006 to 1.9 per cent last year. Mr Meunier points out that younger investors have been embracing ETFs as they are now owned by 16 per cent of those aged between 29 and 44, compared with about 9 per cent for both retired investors and the baby-boom generation (aged between 46 and 64).Data like these have fuelled optimism among ETF providers.“We see the use of ETFs continuing to increase and further substitution into ETFs from other products,” says Joe Linhares, head of iShares EMEA.But Cogent’s research also highlights a potential problem: a basic lack of awareness. About 27 per cent of those surveyed had never heard of ETFs.Another report , from Mintel Comperemedia, the research group, suggests the problem is more widespread, finding that more than six in 10 investors do not know what an ETF is.However, Mintel notes a growing interest in ETFs among financial advisers , a finding backed up by a separate Cogent study. The latter reports a rise in the proportion of US financial advisers using ETFs from 46 per cent in 2007 to 60 per cent by last year, with significant numbers using ETFs exclusively in their portfolios.Financial advisers will play a crucial role in the adoption of ETFs in both the UK and Australia, where planned regulatory reforms will ban commission payments on sales of retail financial products.These changes are widely expected to increase interest in ETFs, which typically do not pay commission, and create a demand for more ETF education.For Deborah Fuhr, global head of ETF research at BlackRock, the industry’s rapid growth has added to the need for education on how ETFs work, differences in product design, and how they can best be used in an overall portfolio.Ms Fuhr says the future for ETFs is bright but warns that the industry is at a crossroads. Agreement on definitions for the various product structures is a “pressing need” for the industry in 2011, she says.“Not everything that starts with ET is the same,” agrees Michael John Lytle, managing director at Source. “There are different regulatory regimes for funds and securities.”Mr Lytle says these issues would be better addressed by education rather than legislation but it is not clear regulators agree.In November, Hong Kong’s regulator issued new guidelines for synthetic ETFs, requiring them to put an “X” in front of their names to help investors distinguish them from traditional ETFs.In the US, regulators have already halted the development of any new ETFs that use derivatives as they investigate whether additional protections are required.But regulatory pressures could also bring benefits, particularly in Europe, if they lead to the establishment of a “consolidated tape” (a complete record of ETF trading) as in the US.European ETF trading remains fragmented across different exchanges in multiple countries, with many large deals conducted in over-the-counter bilateral deals.Building a “consolidated tape” remains logistically challenging but Mr Lytle says it would be “transformative”, helping to attract more institutional investors to the market.For Deborah Fuhr, ETFs have already fundamentally changed the way investment portfolios are constructed by both institutional and retail investors.In the US, Charles Schwab, the broker, has been able to build a substantial ETF business rapidly after launching commission-free ETFs to appeal to retail investors in November 2009.This move sparked a “ price war” among US brokers with Fidelity, TD Ameritrade and Vanguard all bringing out rival offers.Deutsche Bank has brought the ETF price war to Europe with the launch of commission-free ETFs for regular savers in Germany and hints that similar offers will be rolled out in other countries.Christos Costandinides, ETF strategist at Deutsche Bank doubts whether commission-free deals will become standard industry practice for all ETFs but says trading fees will become more competitive, particularly as bigger players become more active.Although competitive pressures are increasing, Farley Thomas, head of ETFs at HSBC, says there is a “secular opportunity” for strong financial institutions to add ETFs to their range of products.“It could take a decade before ETFs achieve meaningful market share in Europe and the US, so there is time for new entrants to establish themselves,” says Mr Thomas.He sees “different paths” for ETF managers to build their businesses. They might be niche providers for products such as precious metals ETFs, which a company like ETF Securities has successfully developed.Then there are the broad-based ETF players with specific brands and distribution capabilities, which the market leaders have.Finally, there are the “universal” financial services providers, including HSBC, that can integrate ETFs into their existing business expertise in capital markets and asset management.Mr Thomas says niche and broad-based ETF providers should be able to make rapid progress but some early pace-setters may not necessarily be among the market leaders in 10 years’ time. In particular, specialists face difficulties sustaining growth if investors’ preferences shift.Mr Thomas also maintains ETFs do not provide answers to the issues of asset allocation and risk management.“ETFs have a role in the toolkit but need to be seen in the context of overall investment objectives and an investor’s risk tolerance. There is a phenomenal opportunity for the industry to grow but these very high expectations may mean ETF providers have also created something of a rod for their own back.”"
475;STT;State Street Corp;2011-01-20T01:48:39Z;US retail investors return to equities;;US retail investment in equities is rebounding as rising share prices lift sentiment.Equity mutual funds in the US saw their biggest weekly inflow since May 2009 in the second week of January, according to figures from the Investment Company Institute, adding $6.5bn in assets, versus an outflow of $980m from bond funds.Brokerages that cater to US retail traders also saw a surge of client inflows at the end of last year, although investors in traditional mutual funds focused on US equities remain wary.Charles Schwab said it added $26.2bn in net new client assets in the fourth quarter, the most since the end of 2008 and an increase of 6 per cent from the same period a year ago. The inflows were 79 per cent higher than the third quarter.TD Ameritrade said it saw an inflow of $9.7bn, an increase of 11 per cent year-over-year.The bulk of those new assets, in addition to reallocations from cash, went into equities and they mostly came from day traders.“The retail investor is back, but they’re not all the way back yet,” said Fred Tomczyk, chief executive of TD Ameritrade.Schwab said client assets in individual stocks and exchange-traded funds grew 22 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2009, while mutual funds grew 4 per cent and bond funds grew 2 per cent in the quarter last year.TD Ameritrade said that margin lending – or short-term loans extended to traders looking to leverage their bets – was up 31 per cent in the quarter from last year.“The quarter illustrated increased investor activity, especially among active retail investors, despite a large percentage of less active, long-term investors who continue to await further signs of market and macro recovery,” said Brad Hintz, analyst at Bernstein Research.Individual investors, who withdrew about $25bn from equity mutual funds last year, are still reluctant to embrace riskier strategies. State Street, the global asset manager, said its net flow of $40bn into equities in the fourth quarter was led by growth in exchange- traded funds.Traders have begun to reverse a shift out of US equities into foreign equities. ICI’s reported flows into domestic stocks in the second week of January were greater than flows into non-US stocks for the first time since April. US hedge funds are also recording strong inflows. Hedge Fund Research said net flows were $55bn in 2010, the highest since 2007.
476;STT;State Street Corp;2011-01-16T18:18:36Z;Competition intensifies as ETF market grows;;Competition between iShares and Vanguard reached new heights last year in the rapidly expanding market for exchange traded funds.Vanguard overtook iShares in the race among ETF providers for US investors’ cash but lost out narrowly in global inflows.Vanguard ETFs gathered inflows of $40.5bn last year, according to data from BlackRock, while iShares took in $43.6bn in new cash.iShares remains the world’s largest ETF provider, with a market share of 40 per cent and $596.7bn of assets under management at the end of 2010, an increase of 27 per cent over the year. That puts it well ahead of Vanguard, the third biggest provider with 10 per cent of the market, which saw its ETF assets increase 61.4 per cent to $148.5bn.However, Mike Miller, managing director, Vanguard planning and development, says Vanguard does not consider itself to be in any kind of race or competition with iShares, State Street or any other provider.“Whether through our ETFs or traditional mutual funds, our aim is to bring the economies of scale that are available to a provider of our size to individual investors,” says Mr Miller.Vanguard’s plans for international expansion will see operations starting in Hong Kong and Canada during 2011.Mr Miller also describes the UK as “a critically important market” for Vanguard, and expects the UK business to become a “flagship operation”.The other top three player, State Street Global Advisors, is set to offer more competition for iShares in Europe, with plans to launch a range of new European ETFs early in 2011. Although SSgA is the second largest ETF provider globally, commanding a 17 per cent market share, it is only ranked 20th in Europe.In November, Scott Ebner, previously global head of ETF products for NYSE Euronext, was hired as global head of ETF product development to strengthen SSgA’s position globally.Mr Ebner says the growth potential of the US ETF industry had been under-estimated “enormously.”Assets held by the US ETF industry (all funds and products) surpassed the trillion dollar mark last year, reaching $1,011.3bn, a rise of 27.4 per cent.Mr Ebner also said that the European ETF market, where assets (funds and products) rose 30 per cent to $315.3bn last year, could “easily grow” to a similar size as the more mature US market.Deutsche Bank expects European ETF assets to almost double over the next three years, reaching $575.5bn by the end of 2013. “In our view this is a conservative estimate,” says Thorsten Michalik, global head of db x-trackers, Deutsche Bank’s ETF arm.Competition among providers looks sure to intensify, particularly among new entrants. BlackRock reckons that 40 companies are planning to launch their first exchange traded products after 31 new providers entered the industry last year.Assets held across all exchange traded products worldwide surged to almost $1,500bn last year, up 28.2 per cent to $1,482bn by the end of December, according to BlackRock. Deborah Fuhr, global head of ETF research at BlackRock, says: “At the start of last year we forecast exchange traded products would see their global assets rise by between 20 and 30 per cent in 2010. We believe the industry can repeat that strong performance in 2011 with similar growth of 20 to 30 per cent.”BlackRock’s data revealed distinct shifts in investors’ preferences in 2010 including a marked improvement in the appetite for equities and a cooling in enthusiasm for bonds and commodities.Particularly striking was a huge recovery in investor inflows into North American equity ETFs, which leapt from just $3.5bn in 2009 to $41.8bn last year as the gradual improvement in the outlook for the US economy helped the S&P 500 to deliver total returns of 15.1 per cent.But investors also continued to pump money into emerging market ETFs, which registered a 22 per cent rise in inflows to $42.1bn last year from $34.5bn in 2009.“But what is really encouraging is that we are seeing continuing growth in the main measures of activity for the ETP industry in terms of assets, products and numbers of users,” says Ms Fuhr.
477;STT;State Street Corp;2011-01-12T21:30:01Z;Fragmented sector set for more tie-ups;;Henderson Global Investors’ acquisition of Gartmore is likely to trigger further consolidation in the fragmented fund management industry.“It is the right environment for mergers and acquisitions and there are buyers in the market,” says Pars Purewal, head of UK asset management at PwC.Many smaller boutique managers are struggling to cover costs, particularly in a more demanding regulatory environment, and bigger players are likely to be the survivors.Buyers are likely to be large companies keen to get bigger, according to Mr Purewal. “The Henderson deal is about building more assets and scale and keeping costs down,” he adds.The Gartmore deal follows others on both sides of the Atlantic, including State Street Global Advisors’ recent acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management and Royal Bank of Canada’s acquisition of BlueBay Asset Management, as asset managers seek scale and aim to increase their presence in Europe.BlackRock’s merger with Barclays Global Advisors in 2009 turned it into the world’s biggest asset manager in addition to giving BlackRock an entry into the passive investment business.Other recent deals include F&C Asset Management’s purchase of Thames River Capital, the boutique group, and, in 2009, Aberdeen Asset Management’s purchase of Credit Suisse’s long-only equity funds. Since then Aberdeen has acquired RBS Asset Management, bringing it expertise in funds of hedge funds.But in spite of these acquisitions the pace of industry consolidation has been slower than expected and there has been more talk than action, analysts say.Greg Ehret, head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Global Advisors, says the forecast for sweeping industry consolidation was “overblown” and the pace is now returning to normal.Mergers and acquisitions over the past few years have not changed the landscape dramatically, with the exception of BlackRock and BGI. Unlike the banking sector, there is little expectation that a handful of big players will dominate the landscape.One of the biggest stumbling blocks is the integration of different investment house cultures. “Asset management is a people business and getting the fit right is extremely difficult,” says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, a consultancy.Much depends on the execution of the deal and requires “exceptional leadership skills as well as investment”, he adds.If the cultures “do not line up the merger will not work”, says Mr Ehret. For many asset managers this is the single-biggest obstacle to heading down the merger route, and they choose instead to grow organically.The first half of 2010 showed a drop in the number and value of deals in the sector, according to Jefferies, an investment bank that specialises in asset management M&A, although it is expecting the “tide to turn” in coming months.Further consolidation this year also depends on markets “picking up”, says Mr Rajan. Few are expecting a return to the volume of activity seen before the financial crisis and even fewer expect to see a return to the high prices struck then.
478;STT;State Street Corp;2011-01-11T17:08:34Z;State Street planning European ETF push;New products in pipeline;State Street Global Advisors is preparing to launch a range of new exchange traded funds in Europe, aiming to bolster its presence in a region where it has previously lagged behind some of its main competitors.Although State Street is the second largest ETF provider in the US and worldwide, it is only the 20th biggest player in Europe, with assets of just $1.1bn at the end of December, according to BlackRock data.State Street’s European ETF business recorded net outflows of $400m in 2010, one of only three providers in Europe to see investors withdrawing cash last year.In November, however, Jim Ross, global head of ETFs at SSgA, hired Scott Ebner, previously global head of ETF products for NYSE Euronext, to lead the effort to strengthen State Street’s position globally.Mr Ebner, who has been appointed as global head of ETF product development for SSgA, is under no illusions about the size of the task facing him.“Our initial focus was on building a successful ETF business in the US, by far the largest (by assets) and most competitive ETF marketplace,” said Mr Ebner: “We are now ready to begin more focused distribution across Europe.”State Street currently has 13 ETFs on offer in Europe. New products are in the pipeline, but details will not be available until they obtain regulatory approval.The company will stick to “physical replication” (buying the constituents of an index) for ETFs but SSgA is prepared to consider “synthetic replication” (using derivatives to match a benchmark) for indices that are more problematic to replicate.Mr Ebner is planning a five year programme for product development and is confident SSgA can replicate the success it has enjoyed in the US, following a reorganisatioin of the company’s European sales force.He also predicts significant further growth for the ETF industry on both sides of the Atlantic.“People underestimate just how much room there is for the ETF industry in the US to grow enormously,” said Mr Ebner.European ETF assets, currently at $315bn, “could easily grow” to a similar size as the more mature US market, where assets surpassed the $1,000bn mark in December.He noted that European ETF assets were still small relative to the total stock market value of the region or compared with assets held by mutual funds in Europe.“Institutional penetration by ETFs is still light,” he said.Noting that financial advisors in the US have become increasingly enthusiatic adopters of ETFs, Mr Ebner said he expected to see regulatory changes, such as the UK’s Retail Distribution Review, helping to promote ETF usage in Europe.But SSgA is not planning to directly appeal to retail investors, as Deutsche Bank has done with its offer of commission free ETFs for regular savers in Germany.Instead Mr Ebner expects State Street’s existing global network of relationships to provide a ready audience for its new products.“Our core client base is institutional, professional investors and intermediaries. Our distribution network is global and we have numerous regional and local managers with a presence on the ground.”

Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
480;STT;State Street Corp;2011-01-10T18:13:58Z;Vanguard leads race for US investors’ cash in 2010;Price competition boosts inflows;Competing aggressively on price helped Vanguard to grab first prize as the fastest growing US exchange traded fund provider of 2010, pushing BlackRock, the long-time leader for investor inflows, into second place, according to data just released by the National Stock Exchange.Vanguard’s ETF business gathered $40.5bn in new cash in 2010 with investor inflows rising for a fifth year in succession.In contrast, BlackRock’s ETF inflows dropped for a third year in succession, down 28.2 per cent to $30.2bn in 2010.Vanguard will view the shift as a resounding vindication of its decision to cut the charges on its emerging markets ETF, a move which has fuelled an escalating price war among US exchange traded fund providers.After gathering $19.3bn in new cash from investors last year, Vanguard’s MSCI emerging markets ETF took top spot as the most popular ETF of 2010 with its inflows vastly outpacing those of the rival iShares emerging markets ETF which slumped to $2.3bn.Inflows into the State Street’s SPDR Gold Trust, the most popular ETF of 2009, saw inflows drop from $13.8bn to $5.8bn last year.Price competition also played a part in the slowdown in inflows for the SPDR Gold Trust after charges on a rival product, the iShares Gold Trust were cut by BlackRock in June. The iShares Gold Trust attracted inflows of $1.6bn last year, up from $0.4bn in 2009.In spite of the drop in new investor inflows, BlackRock retained its position as the largest US ETF provider with assets of $448bn at the end of 2010, up 20.2 per cent on the previous year.Meanwhile Vanguard cemented its hold on third place with its assets surging 61.5 per cent to $147.9bn, behind State Street whose assets increased 24.2 per cent to $234.7bn.Behind the three behomoths of the US ETF industry, the National Stock Exchange data also showed some of the recent entrants to the market gaining significant momentum in 2010.ETF Securities, Charles Schwab, Pimco, GlobalX, new entrants to the US ETF market in 2009, each attracted more than $1bn in new inflows last year.The ongoing broadening of the US ETF market was further illustrated by the fact that 14 providers gathered inflows of more than $1bn in 2010, up from 10 in 2009.Meanwhile just seven providers (from a total of 49) saw net outflows from their US based ETFs.One of the biggest losers was US Commodity Funds, which runs the US oil and US natural gas ETFs. It saw outflows of $977m, a marked contrast to 2009 when it gathered $5.8bn.In aggregate, US ETF providers attracted $118.7bn from investors last year, almost matching inflows for 2009 at $119.4bn but well down on the $175.7bn recorded in 2008.Investors appear to have rediscovered their appetite for domestic equities as inflows into long US equity ETFs rebounded to $37.4bn in 2010 after registering outflows of 7.1bn in the previous year.However, this came at the expense of fixed income ETFs where inflows dropped from $42bn in 2009 to $26.2bn last year.Investors willinginess to bet on further gains for commodities also weakened with inflows into long commodity ETFs falling from $30.2bn in 2009 to $11bn last year.Reflecting the ongoing problems in the US property market, long real estate ETFs remained unloved with inflows down to $2bn last year from $3.1bn in 2009.
481;STT;State Street Corp;2010-12-12T23:43:21Z;Shake-up for dull world of transaction banking;;Transaction banking is one of those dreadful financial labels that gives little clue as to what it is. But that has not stopped the lowbrow businesses it em­braces – cash management, trade finance, securities custody and card payments – from becoming high fashion in the post-crisis world.The reason is simple. “Even when economic conditions are weak, transaction banking can still generate relatively stable revenues from fees,” says Brian Stevenson, head of global transaction services at Royal Bank of Scotland. And that, he says, made it important to banks as they retreated from some of the more volatile areas of investment banking .“This business has been seen as a low priority for years,” says Francesco Burelli, a principal at consultancy Value Partners. “Until the crisis, a lot of banks were even questioning whether they should do it at all. Now, all of a sudden, transaction bankers are in expansion mode.”The steady transaction-based fees make it low-risk, and thanks to the relatively low levels of capital needed to sustain it, it is high-profit, typically generating a return on equity of 50 to 100 per cent, according to some bankers.But the question many are asking now is whether the tougher competitive landscape – as more banks are drawn to the business – and a more costly regulatory environment will spoil the financial appeal of transaction banking. Last week, attention was drawn to the potential risks in custody services by the $6.6bn lawsuit targeted at HSBC by the trustee of the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme. Could such worries undermine the broader appeal of transaction banking?It is impossible to pin down precise growth or profit numbers for the industry. Specialists have clearly been booming. State Street’s “investment servicing” business has been generating profits of $2bn-$3bn over the past few years, dwarfing the group’s asset management business and accounting for virtually all of group profits. “The revenue base is quite stable,” says Tim Keaney, chief executive of BNY Mellon Asset Servicing. “We keep clients each year. That is a very different business from investment banking where you reset to zero every January.”Few universal banks split out their transaction banking performance. But Deutsche Bank, for example, recorded transaction banking pre-tax profits of €1.1bn in 2008, up 17 per cent and equivalent to an ROE of 108 per cent. Though the number slipped back – to €776m – in 2009, that relatively stable performance contrasts with the investment banking result, which was €7.4bn in the red in 2008, thanks to the toxic asset fall-out from the financial crisis, and then €4.3bn in the black again last year.Deutsche has been one of several banks that have strategically prioritised the business, recently buying the old ABN Amro transaction banking unit.The big US names – State Street and BNY Mellon – have also been acquisitive in the wake of the financial crisis. BNY Mellon picked up asset servicing businesses from Sal Oppenheim in Germany and PNC in the US. State Street, meanwhile, bought the servicing business of Italy’s Intesa.“There are two reasons for the consolidation trend,” says Mr Keaney at BNY Mellon. “This business requires enormous investment in technology and it’s becoming more global.”The investment budgets are vast – BNY Mellon spends $600m-$700m a year from $12bn of revenues – as banks respond to client pressure for faster, cheaper services, and in turn make it ever harder for smaller operators to compete.For State Street, the Intesa deal was the perfect illustration of the other consolidation driver – the need for a global presence. Strong as Intesa’s position was in Italy, it was becoming difficult to compete given clients’ international requirements.But there are new competitors, too. Citigroup’s deal to sell its technology arm to India’s Wipro is seen as part of a trend that could see technology and utility groups become far bigger in securities processing.More challenging still is the potential threat posed by new regulatory rules. The most sweeping rule book is the Basel III framework – which toughens capital, liquidity and leverage standards. Trade finance, in particular, is set to be hit, prompting strong lobbying from some big trade finance banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered.The European Union’s Alternative Investment Fund Management directive will add to the burden, particularly in global custody.For assets capable of being held in custody, the AIFM directive sets a tough legal standard – custodians will have to replace any missing assets, unless they can prove the losses are due to something beyond their reasonable control.“The AIFM directive has the potential to change the dynamics between global custodians, prime brokers and depositaries in Europe with the emphasis on fiduciary risks and responsibilities,” says Andrew Long, head of transaction banking at HSBC.If custodians can be held responsible for vast losses incurred on activities they intermediatedbanks and their regulators will need to establish higher capital standards for the business.One big UK investor says: “Suddenly the banks are realising that the custody business is low-margin and high-risk, really high-risk.”The dull world of transaction banking is now being shaken up. Quite how much will determine the degree to which it can continue to be a ballast of reliable profitability in troubled times.
482;STT;State Street Corp;2010-12-12T17:04:26Z;Two memos divided by understanding;How to deliver bad tidings – and how not to;"Because it’s almost Christmas, I’ve decided to focus on two things that are always popular at this time of year. Layoffs and stand-up rows. Last week, along with e-mails from flat-footed employers telling staff how to behave at Christmas parties, I was forwarded two other equally seasonal messages bearing bad tidings of firings and fall-outs. The first was the perfect example of how not to do this sort of thing. The second was a rarer document: an example of how to do it properly.The first e-mail was written by Jay Hooley, CEO of State Street, the financial services company, and conveyed the news that 1,400 people would shortly be out of a job. It bore the innocuous title “Staff Announcement” and began: “Today we are announcing a multiyear programme that will enhance service excellence and innovation, help achieve greater operating efficiencies and position us for accelerated growth.”Ignoring the dreary pomposity of the tone, there are two bad things about this. There is the hyperbole: if your service is excellent, it doesn’t need enhancing; if it’s not excellent, it’s dangerously deluded to pretend that it is. And then there is the upbeat tone, a cowardly attempt to hoodwink staff into thinking something good will surely follow.What actually follows is a volley of “visions” “goals” and “objectives” that include “creating an industry-leading operating model” and “leveraging our scale”.After a few hundred words of gung-ho waffle and general throat clearing, comes the following: “To gain better use of these advantages, we will implement targeted cost initiatives including staff reductions impacting approximately 1,400 of our workforce.”Having thus eliminated 5 per cent of the company, the memo sweeps on to to a further discussion about nothing in particular. There is much talk of establishing “centres of excellence to better align core functions with client needs” and the need to “accelerate our development of leading-edge solutions for our clients”.Eventually he stops spinning, doubtless satisfied at how he has made a bitter pill vanish in a cloud of candyfloss, and ends thus: “I am confident the components of this programme are necessary to ensure this success.”I’m not sure about that, but I’m confident about something else. If I were one of State Street’s 29,000 workers – who are described on the company’s website as “talented and dedicated” – I would find my stocks of dedication were diminished by this disingenuous, dishonourable, jamboree of jargon. Indeed, I might contemplate taking my talent elsewhere.On the very same day that the CEO of State Street was penning his wretched message, Nick Denton, ex-FT journalist and founder of Gawker, was addressing his staff at the media gossip company in a memo entitled “Change”.“Yes, this may be a shock to some of you,” he begins, before announcing that two senior people are leaving the company. He praises their achievements, and goes on: “Sure, we’ve rowed over everything from politics to page layout. But that’s been part of the fun; and the arguments have generally led to better decisions.”Then comes the meat: “Our sites are allergic to corporate boilerplate, so I’m going to be explicit. Chris and I diverge seriously over strategy. That spilled over into unhealthy conflict between editorial and sales.”This is good. It is readable, clear, and it feels true. It happens – often in fact – that people disagree so violently they can’t work together. Come to think of it, Nick wasn’t known as the sweetest, easiest guy to work with when he was at the FT. But the way he describes this falling out is just right. It eliminates damaging gossip and it gives the departing people more dignity than if the announcement was full of nonsense about spending more time with the family.State Street would have done much better to do a Denton. Its e-mail should have gone something like this: “This may be a shock to some of you. Our costs are too high, and in order to survive we must reduce them. We are going to have to cut 1,400 jobs. We will do everything we can to limit the pain . . . ” It should have been clear, practical, telling people what to expect.Above all, it should not have banged on about platforms for accelerating growth. Not just because this is an ugly mouthful, but because if a company is really planning to grow faster, it is hard to understand why it needs to get rid of anyone.lucy.kellaway@ft.com"

The plan will see a secondary offering worth up to $20bn in the first half of next year.AIG also said it had agreed to repay a $20bn loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with money from the sale of its businesses in Asia and that the Treasury would convert its preferred stock into common shares, raising its stake to 92 per cent.Financials led the risers, up 0.4 per cent, as bank stocks were buoyed by hopes that a higher Treasury yield could boost profit.Bank of America jumped 2.6 per cent to $12.31, Wells Fargo gained 0.9 per cent to $29.62 and JPMorgan climbed 1.1 per cent to $40.71.Elsewhere in financials, BlackRock added 2.1 per cent to $177.37 after it was reported that the world’s largest money manager expected “very strong” earnings for the fourth quarter.But State Street sank 3.5 per cent to $44.57 after it said it had sold $11bn in mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities as part of a strategic repositioning of its investment portfolio, resulting in a $350m charge to be recorded in the fourth quarter.The S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent to 1,228.92 by midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.2 per cent to 11,344.89 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,610.65.Investors were cheered when data showed initial jobless claims had fallen more than expected last week with the four-week moving average hovering around two-year lows.But the government revised the previous week’s figure higher, saying claims tended to jump after the Thanksgiving holiday.“The holiday season normally creates volatility in these figures that doesn’t shake out until late January/early February, so unfortunately it will be difficult to draw firm conclusions from these data for a while,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Global markets and S&P futures had already been edging higher after data showed that Japan’s economy had grown faster than its government had initially calculated and that Australian employers had added more than double the number of workers previously forecast last month.Elsewhere, plans to return more money to shareholders were celebrated.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 1.6 per cent to $110.28 after the company announced a two-for-one stock split and a supplemental dividend of $1 a share, on the back of the rising price of copper.Richard Adkerson, chief executive, said: “Authorisation of this supplemental dividend reflects the strong current cash position and significant cash flows being generated by our global operations.”United Parcel Service added 1.1 per cent to $72.83, a 52-week high, after the delivery company’s chief financial officer told a German newspaper that it planned a higher dividend and more share buy-backs rather than use its free cash flow for large acquisitions.Whole Foods, the high-end supermarket, also announced that it would resume paying a dividend but its shares nudged down 0.4 per cent to $48.94.Analysts at JPMorgan said the company had discontinued its dividend in August 2008 because of negative free cash flow trends but, after eight quarters of robust cash flow generation, it now felt more comfortable.“We note that the ongoing dividend payment is a good indicator for the long-term outlook for the company and we believe this will be a positive catalyst for the stock,” they said.Meanwhile, Ford edged up 0.4 per cent to $16.75 after analysts at Bank of America raised the carmaker’s 2011 and 2012 earnings-per-share estimates. They added that its shares were likely to outperform on earnings growth and balance sheet improvement.
485;STT;State Street Corp;2010-11-14T17:39:55Z;State Street eyes European consolidation;;"It is becoming increasingly rare to hear a chief executive of a multinational company identify Europe as their great hope for the future.Not so for Jay Hooley, the recently installed chief executive of State Street, who argues that in spite of the continent’s economic travails Europe will be the key driver of growth for one of the world’s largest custodian banks.“Europe is the single biggest opportunity State Street has going into the future,” he says from State Street’s Canary Wharf headquarters in London.State Street, with $20,200bn assets in custody for other institutions and $1,900bn under management, aims to double non-US revenues in the next five years, having made two acquisitions in Europe this year.For Mr Hooley, the weakness of parts of the European banking sector, with many institutions expected to raise capital or shrink in the coming years, means that a further string of custodian and asset management businesses is likely to become available.“We all have a point of view on the banking industry in Europe, and [its] potential future needs to recapitalise,” he says. “You put all those things together and it seems natural that we’ll see more of these properties come to market.”He also argues that Europe’s ageing population and retirement saving shortfalls, coupled with a developed pensions industry, make it the ideal focal point for his plans.“Most growth is tied to GDP growth and economic growth. We’d like that, but we also are as interested in the evolution of asset pools. As asset pools move from government to company sponsored pension plans…there are more things we can do.”This month, the National Employment Savings Trust, a government-run UK pension scheme, awarded its fund administration contract to State Street.State Street’s non-US revenues have risen from 23 per cent in 1999 to 41 per cent last year, with a recent study by Boston Consultancy Group forecasting the European pension and insurance markets as a whole to grow by 5.9 per cent in the next three years.Mr Hooley, who became chief executive this year and joined the group 24 years ago, has benefited from State Street’s stability during the financial crisis to pluck assets from weakened rivals.He has just sealed the purchase of Bank of Ireland’s asset management business for €57m ($78m), bringing in an extra €36bn of assets and a staff that specialises in active, fundamental investment strategies that State Street previously lacked.The Bank of Ireland acquisition is State Street’s third European deal in little more than a year and a half. In May it purchased Intesa Sanpaolo’s security services business in Italy for €1.75bn, while last year it bought Mourant International Finance Administration, a Jersey and Channel Islands-based fund administrator.Such bolt-on acquisitions add to State Street’s already significant presence in Europe, where it employs 7,800 people across 11 countries.Mr Hooley argues many banks have built small custodian businesses to service their internal asset managers, many of which do not have the scale to compete with the largest custodian banks – Bank of New York Mellon, State Street and Northern Trust.“There is a long list of European banks that are in this business in a minor way,” he says. “We compete every day in Europe; we know they’re not gaining any share, they’re not growing and as time moves on, they’re not probably investing at the level that you need to invest to be competitive.”The Bank of Ireland acquisition allows State Street Global Advisors, its asset management arm, to develop its so-called active fund management strategies, lessening its traditional focus on index-tracking funds and computer generated quantitative strategies, according to Scott Powers, chief executive of SSGA.“We’ve had quite a lot of success over the years, but in the past three years the active, quantitative strategies, like any style, have gone out of favour and have had underperformance,” he says. “[We want] to build a business that has a more resilient and more durable revenue stream.”Mr Hooley, meanwhile, is convinced that Europe’s custodian sector is now riper for consolidation than ever before, with State Street intent on winning business from smaller rivals. “It seems inevitable that when you have the scale differences we are talking about, there is going to be further consolidation,” he says."
486;STT;State Street Corp;2010-11-11T16:48:04Z;ETF investors get ready for US recovery;Dan Dolan of State Street on SPDR flows;Inflows into US exchange traded funds suggest institutional investors are increasingly positioning themselves for economic recovery, according to Dan Dolan, director of wealth management strategies for the Select Sector SPDRs, which are managed by State Street.The cyclically orientated sectors of the nine Select Sector SPDRs have seen big increases in inflows this year, substantially stronger than the price gains for their corresponding S&P sectors. Net assets have increased $5.8bn, or 18.5 per cent, to $37.1bn this year.Mr Dolan said the rapid growth of the products, which held just $4bn in 2003, was evidence of growing institutional appetite for these asset allocation building blocks.“Initially, sector ETFs were viewed as a more risky type of investing,” said Mr Dolan. “But the volatility that was seen for single stock names over the past 10 years and during the financial crisis persuaded many investors, including large hedge funds, that they had to consider something other than trying to pick individual companies.”He said investors had shifted from thinking: ”I want to double my money” to thinking: ”don’t lose my money”. “But an investor doesn’t have to be right about choosing Microsoft or Intel if they spread their exposure by using the technology SPDR,” he said.So far this year (to the close on November 9) net assets in the industrial SPDR have risen 46.4 per cent while the S&P industrials index has gained 18.7 per cent.The materials SPDR has reported a 32.1 per cent increase for net assets while the S&P materials index has rallied 8.4 per cent.The one non-cyclical sector doing well is staples. The consumer staples SPDR has seen net assets increase 39.3 per cent while the S&P consumer staples index has risen 9.2 per cent.Net asset growth for defensively orientated sectors has been far slower or even turned negative. So the utilities SPDR has seen net assets increase 10 per cent and the healthcare SPDR has reported a 2.9 per cent fall in net assets.Mr Dolan is a veteran of the ETF industry who spent 18 years with Merrill Lynch before moving to ALPS Funds Services in 2003. ALPS has been the distributor for Sector SPDRs since inception.He said many of the new products, such as leveraged and inverse ETFs, had diluted the “purity” of the early products, which were “clean structures that do not have counterparty risk”.He noted that trading volumes for the Select Sector SPDRs were running above 200m shares daily and bid and ask spreads were less than one penny wide.Mr Dolan said costs for transactions in the ETF industry were “very quickly going to zero”. This was also evident in the retail space, with discount brokers such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade now offering commission free trading on some ETFs.
487;STT;State Street Corp;2010-11-10T16:06:44Z;Smaller emerging markets companies shine;S&P indices show broad outperformance over past decade;Investors in emerging markets are now shifting their attention to smaller company stocks due to their robust performance over the past decade, according to Standard & Poor’s, the index provider.“Emerging market small cap stocks have generated significantly larger gains than large and mid cap stocks in recent years,” said Alka Banerjee, vice president global equities at S&P.Small cap stocks in emerging markets have outperformed their larger peers in eight out of the past 10 years.Since 2001, the S&P emerging small cap index has risen by 16.6 per cent annually, compared with 13.2 per cent for the S&P emerging large/mid cap benchmark.Ms Banerjee said the outperformance reflected the shift towards investing across a broad and diverse set of emerging market equities as opposed to a few blue chip stocks.She noted that investors had concentrated on larger companies in earlier periods of emerging market investing and that the S&P emerging small cap index had underperformed the large/mid cap benchmark for six consecutive years between 1995 and 2000.Ms Banerjee also pointed out that the outperformance by small cap stocks in emerging markets generally held across regions, sectors and styles (growth vs value).Over the past ten decades, nine out of the ten sectors of the S&P emerging small cap index have outperformed the large cap counterparts. The only small cap sector to have underperformed over the past ten years is the consumer discretionary sector.Significant differences occur in weightings between sectors in the small and large cap emerging markets indices.So energy, financial and telecoms stocks make up a much smaller part of the small cap index compared with the weightings within the large cap index. Instead consumer stocks (discretionary and staples) and health care companies account for a larger share of the small cap universe, reflecting the growing prosperity of the middle classes in emerging economies.Ms Banerjee also noted that valuations remained reasonable in spite of strong gains for emerging market equities over the past decade. At the end of the third quarter, the S&P small cap emerging markets index was trading on a price earnings multiple of 15.4 times while the large cap index was trading at 16.6 times (earnings over the previous 12 months). Valuations for both indices were around 11 per cent above their 15-year averages.Exchange traded fund providers have already latched on to small cap emerging market funds as a proposition to attract investors.The SPDR S&P Small Cap Emerging Markets ETF, run by State Street, has gathered $595m in new cash from investors so far this year (January to September), taking its assets to $797m.WisdomTree was the first provider to launch an emerging markets small cap ETF in October 2007 and this product has seen assets under management grow to almost $777bn over the past three years.Van Eck has built a range of emerging markets small cap ETFs, bringing out an India small cap ETF in August to complement the sister Latin America and Brazil products which it launched in June 2010 and December 2009 respectively.Active fund managers have also been drawn to this space as small cap emerging market stocks with their bias towards domestic growth-focused companies offer greater exposure to the developing consumer story than large caps.Aberdeen Asset Management,Somerset Capital, Hong Kong-based Lloyd George Management and California’s Dimensional Fund Advisors have been joined by Franklin Templeton, Pictet and JPMorgan in offering either EM or Asian small cap funds
488;STT;State Street Corp;2010-11-05T23:46:55Z;US financials up on higher dividends hopes;;Financials surged as investors hoped banks would raise dividends but strong employment data failed to push the wider indices much beyond their two-year high.Non-farm payroll data beat expectations in October and the figures for previous months were revised up. Some investors saw the improvement in jobs as a sign that quantitative easing could be scaled back.“Equity markets have been surging but the potential for reduced QE2 suggests that indices could be in their final upleg for a while, particularly since some have started to bump up against resistance levels that have been in place for years,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,225.85, rising 3.6 per cent in a week where confidence was buoyed by further quantitative easing and a Republican victory in the House of Representatives.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1 per cent higher at 11,444.08, after climbing 2.8 per cent over the five days and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,578.99, after adding 2.8 per cent on the week.Financial stocks climbed 1.8 per cent after it was reported that the Federal Reserve may allow banks to increase their dividends. Goldman Sachs climbed 2.8 per cent to $171.07, JPMorgan advanced 2.9 per cent to $40.94 and Bank of America was up 1.9 per cent to $12.36.“While this [predicted] decision by the Fed will probably provide a positive catalyst in the near term for the banks, we don’t think it is the most prudent of actions,” said analysts at FBR Capital Markets.“Given the current economic environment, we would rather see banks hold on to their capital until economic data, earnings, and credit trends improved more.”Shares in AIG, the bailed-out insurer, rose 1.9 per cent to $45.61 even though it reported losses of more than $2bn in the third quarter. The loss, caused by a writedown in the value of the businesses it is selling and charges tied to repaying rescue loans, compares with a profit for the same period a year earlier.Elsewhere in financials, State Street, the money manager, added 3.5 per cent to $45.47 after it was raised from “neutral” to “buy” by analysts at Goldman Sachs.The analysts cited its many strengths in its core custody business, the highest global exposure among its peers and excess capital.As the earnings season continued, rising commodity prices hit consumer companies. Starbucks managed to beat expectations after it successfully passed on cost increases to its customers but Kraft suffered after some shoppers were deterred by rising prices.The coffee shop chain raised its full-year profit forecast as it increased some drinks prices to compensate for the surging price of coffee. Shares advanced 3.8 per cent to $30.87.John Ivankoe, an analyst at JPMorgan, said he believed the new guidance figure remained conservative. He raised his price target for the company.Kraft Foods’ quarterly results were squeezed by cost inflation.The shares fell 2.2 per cent to $31.08 after the consumer goods company said rising ingredient costs had forced it to raise prices on 40 per cent of its products in North America and more than half of its European products.CBS Corp became the latest broadcast network to beat expectations as profits rose 42 per cent and it announced a $1.5bn share buy-back over 18 months.A rebound in advertising revenue has boosted TV networks in the past few monnths. But total revenue fell as the adverts and subscription fees could not make up for a lack of big syndication sales. The shares dropped 3.7 per cent to $17.01.

They are also cleared through CME Group’s clearing house.The emergence of Eris is also a sign of the proliferation of types of trading venues that are likely in the wake of passage of the Dodd-Frank act, which sets new rules for the trading and clearing of OTC derivatives.Clifford Lewis, executive vice-president and head of State Street’s eExchange business, said: “State Street’s relationship with Eris Exchange is yet another important step realising our objective that asset managers, asset owners and other clients have the tools to benefit from the rapid transformation in the derivative market structure through expanded access to liquidity, improved transparency, and access to central clearing.”
490;STT;State Street Corp;2010-10-26T11:27:44Z;Berkshire hires new investment manager;;Berkshire Hathaway took a significant step on Monday in its planning for the eventual departure of Warren Buffett as it appointed a new investment manager to oversee a large portion of the group’s portfolio.Todd Combs, 39, who has managed Castle Point Capital, a small hedge fund, for the past five years, is to start at Berkshire shortly, the company said. Castle Point Capital, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, invests in financial services companies such as US Bancorp, MasterCard and State Street.Mr Buffett said he had been “looking for someone of Todd’s calibre to handle a significant portion of Berkshire’s investment portfolio” for three years.Shareholders have speculated for years about who would replace the 80-year-old Mr Buffett in his dual role of chief executive and chief investment officer.Mr Buffett, who currently has no intention of retiring, has said he would split the top job between a chief executive to oversee Berkshire’s operating companies and a handful of managers to look after the $100bn investment portfolio.Pundits had identified David Sokol, chairman of Berkshire subsidiaries MidAmerican Energy and NetJets, as likely to take over the chief executive role, and Li Lu, a hedge fund manager, as a candidate for an investment officer slot.Chuck Davis, chief executive of Stone Point Capital, a private equity firm that helped provide start-up capital for Castle Point, said Mr Combs had the qualities Mr Buffett looked for.“He has a good background in securities analysis at Columbia Business School [Mr Buffett’s alma mater]. He is a deep-dive, granular, research-oriented person who really understands the inner workings of companies and is just a very free-cash-flow, hard-asset-based investor.”The news came as regulatory filings showed US regulators had quizzed Berkshire during the summer over its accounting treatment of certain reinsurance contracts, stock holdings and executive compensation.The SEC’s corporate finance division closed its review in September, but not before Berkshire had agreed to provide more detailed descriptions of its directors’ qualifications and change the way it accounted for certain compensation payments.In future, Berkshire said it would count items such as the $344,490 of personal and home security services spent on Mr Buffett in 2009 as compensation.
491;STT;State Street Corp;2010-10-19T15:54:29Z;Equity investors must be ready for US deflation;Companies that can outperform need to be identified;The US is on the cusp of a liquidity trap and equity investors may need to think through what types of companies will outperform in an environment of modest deflation, says George Hoguet, global investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.“Recent comments by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke implies he is increasingly worried about a Japan-style deflation unfolding in the US,” he says. “The good news is that Japan has not experienced a vicious deflationary spiral. The bad news is that the Japanese stock market has returned minus 2 per cent per annum in dollar terms over the past 15 years.”Mr Hoguet notes that the Fed has formidable tools at its disposal to pre-empt the onset of a cycle of deflationary expectations. These include not just large-scale asset purchases but also more unconventional measures, such as a negative interest rate on bank reserves and advocacy of a tax on currency holdings.And he points out there are some companies that could outperform in an environment of moderate deflation. “These might include US companies with low debt and high financial and operating flexibility, exporters, and those with substantial foreign, and particularly emerging market, operations.“Companies with large cash positions could also benefit, as could those that can maintain pricing power, such as technology and pharmaceutical firms.”
492;STT;State Street Corp;2010-10-17T07:51:12Z;ETP growth spurs boost in servicing role;;The huge growth in the number and variety of exchange-traded products (ETPs) over the past decade has also led to a big increase in demand for the expertise of asset servicing managers, such as BNY Mellon, State Street and Brown Brothers Harriman.The number of ETPs has increased to more than 3,000 from just 35 in 1999, according to BlackRock, as new providers enter the market and growing numbers of traditional fund managers expand their product ranges to include ETPs.This proliferation has encouraged asset servicing providers to develop consultation services for fund managers unfamiliar with the ETP market.Gavin Nangle, head of business development at State Street in Dublin, says ETP clients are increasingly looking for value-added services. He likens himself to a matchmaker who can intermediate between ETP sponsors and market makers, easing the burden of building relationships due to State Street’s extensive worldwide network. Along with providing advice to potential ETP sponsors on market practices, State Street has also seen a growing demand for tax services related to ETPs.Mr Nangle says US managers, who are used to dealing with a single currency and single tax model, face a daunting shift when trying to move into Europe, where there are multiple regulators and varying tax arrangements.A key driver of the growth in the European market has been the rapid proliferation of synthetic or swap-based ETPs that use derivatives to track an index rather than investing directly in the constituents of a benchmark.The number of swap-based ETPs available in Europe has risen from just 27 in 2005 to more than 600. This has required asset servicing managers to expand their involvement in swap pricing.State Street already has extensive familiarity with alternative managers and the derivative instruments they use, so that expertise was readily transferred into the ETP market, says Mr Nangle.“State Street runs complex pricing models for OTC products and was able to use that expertise to provide swap pricing in synthetic ETPs.”Shawn McNinch, global head of ETF services for Brown Brothers Harriman, says BBH is seeing “lots of discussions” with potential new entrants that are considering launching passive ETPs and also asking whether active ETPs could fit into their current product offering.BBH has built a consulting services team that helps potential ETF sponsors develop their ideas from the conceptual phase to market, advising on legal requirements, regulations and tax issues as well as navigating the actual launch process.It too offers sponsors help with building relationships with exchanges, and market makers.Mr McNinch says BBH has made substantial investments into its core accounting platform to process swap contracts efficiently, which positions it well to service synthetic ETPs.The increasing use of synthetic ETPs has led BBH to make substantial investments into its core accounting platform to process swap contracts efficiently and to provide reconciliation services with swap counterparties.“It is necessary to have a strong infrastructure to support synthetic ETP structures, particularly if multiple swap counterparties are being used in order to reduce counterparty risk,” says Mr McNinch.As ETPs are low-cost products, reducing the costs associated with asset servicing remains a key focus for industry participants that have invested heavily in technology to drive out inefficiencies.But minimising costs in Europe remains challenging due to variations in clearing and settlement systems and differing regulatory environments that can add to expenses.Asset service providers also say that because ETPs are traded in both a primary and secondary market, additional levels of information and transparency are required compared with a traditional mutual fund.
493;STT;State Street Corp;2010-10-17T07:51:12Z;Managers farm out more activities;;Asset managers are handing out more of their back, mid, and even front-office work to service providers as the industry comes under pressure from increasing regulation, the need to update support technology and to keep costs down in an uncertain environment.“There is a need to continually upgrade technology to keep up with the pace of change. Some asset managers also want to diversify, investing in hedge funds and real estate so stretching support in mid and back office,” says Susan Ebenston, head of global fund services at JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services. As a result “we are seeing growing demand for back and mid-office services”, she adds.Traditionally back-office activity such as fund accounting and custody has made up the bulk of asset servicing providers’ work but “now that is shifting to mid-office outsourcing, which is happening globally”, says Lou Maiuri, head of outsourcing at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing.“New products and ways of distribution are also putting pressure on infrastructure, leading to more outsourcing,” says Jeff Conway, head of State Street investment manager services.During the boom years leading up to 2007, many of the small and mid-size asset managers expanded too fast and are having to rethink their business model. Managers have grown “in size and function” and also have to meet new regulatory as well as technology demands, he says. They have to “shift some of the burden”, Mr Maiuri adds.A recent report* by Fitch Ratings on the pressures facing the European asset management industry says it needs to adopt a more flexible cost structure by outsourcing more activities.Aymeric Poizot, a senior director and author of the report, sees small niche asset managers becoming “leaner and focusing more on managing the front office efficiently”, outsourcing mid-office operations.“It is cheaper for specialist asset managers such as equity or credit houses to outsource all their mid-office activities to a big provider, rather than retain in-house staff,” says Mr Poizot.Handing out such activities means in a few months the headcount is reduced as in-house staff are no longer on the payroll. “It is all driven by the profit and loss account,” he adds.He believes the number of specialist asset managers retaining all services in-house is “getting close to zero” as providers “offer services at competitive prices”.However, he emphasises the need to have a “well-designed financial agreement in place with the contract provider”.He believes outsourcing mid-office operations does not work for big houses where activities are spread across a range of asset classes and operations are more complicated and can take several years to stabilise. Some big houses that outsourced reporting and performance analysis have been unhappy with the process, taking the activity back in-house, he adds.In addition to specialist asset managers, providers are seeing an increase of start-ups – where employees have left big companies – seeking mid-office support. “Start-ups do not want to spend money on mid-office operations and we can do it cheaper,” says Mr Maiuri.Some front-office activities are also being outsourced, such as mandate monitoring to make sure pension funds’ commitments to sustainable investing are being met, and calculating the performance of funds. While such activities are not visible to clients, they are fed back to the asset manager’s front office.The size and effect of the Madoff scandal has also driven more asset managers to outsource their pricing, auditing and accounting as investors and regulators demand more transparency and governance.A batch of pending European Union regulations, such as the alternative investment fund managers directive and Ucits IV, is also pushing asset managers to send compliance tasks out of house, say asset service providers.Not all asset managers are keen to outsource but to maintain operations in house “economies of scale are essential”, says Jeff Conway, head of State Street investment manager services. He agrees with Mr Poizot that smaller players will not be able to extend themselves to handle all their operations in a cost- efficient and effective way.One of the main drawbacks asset managers see in putting operations out of house is loss of control, says Mr Conway.Some of those that have doubts try but “it takes at least a year or so to adjust”, says Ms Ebenston. Some managers also worry about stifling initiative and creativity, whereas she believes outsourcing “forces more discipline” into areas of asset management, particularly the front office.“Once a contract has been signed a fund manager cannot wake up one morning and start a new fund,” she says.Asset managers, like financial services in general, have endured a difficult few years, while asset service providers have benefited from an increase in business.The outlook for asset management is not rosy. so service providers expect the next few years to yield more business. “It is an area of big growth that we expect to continue,” says State Street’s Mr Conway.* European Asset Management: an industry under pressure

495;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Investors still facing hedging dilemma;;To hedge or not to hedge? In our increasingly globalised world, institutional investors are becoming ever more aware that they have a duty to overcome their home bias and invest across borders. But until everywhere else in the world decides to join the euro (an increasingly unlikely prospect), this exposes them to currency risk.They are then faced with the question of whether to hedge that risk. Investors considering whether to hedge a multi-currency portfolio may decide the ups and downs of the multiple exposures will wash out over time, at least when the cost of hedging is factored in, and some academic research backs them up. But only over the long term.Since even the investors with the longest term horizon usually have to manage short-term fluctuations, this puts the question back on the agenda.“The academic research on whether this is a good idea is very variable,” says Pierre Lequeux, head of currency management at Aviva Investors. “There is no specific answer that can be provided, because the risk changes over time. The question is also currency specific.”By way of example, he cites Japanese pension funds before 2007, which found the cost of hedging prohibitive given the large interest rate differential between Japan and the rest of the G7.While this was fine while global markets were relatively stable, “since the financial crisis it has been very painful”.This experience, repeated in varying degrees around the world, has brought currency hedging into the foreground for investors. Many actually had a static currency hedge in place but found it was not sufficient, or in some cases made things worse.“If you go back to the fourth quarter of 2008, when volatility was just enormous, people were astounded by the impact currency volatility could have,” says Mark Hogg, director of foreign exchange product development at RBC Dexia. “If you’re not getting rewarded for the risk, why take it?”The idea of a static currency hedge is that the investor (or their portfolio manager) decides ahead of time what currency ratio should apply across all exposures. A zero coverage means the investor bears all the currency risk, while 100 per cent would mean the entire currency risk was hedged. The latter might seem sensible, but it cuts out any possibility of upside gain if the foreign currencies rise.“In the past, [UK institutional investors] have used static hedges and found that quite frustrating,” says Monica Fan, senior currency product engineer at State Street Global Advisors. In part, she says, the problem is trying to work out what currency ratio will minimise the volatility of a portfolio. “One of the problems is paralysis from over-analysis.”In response to this frustration, SSgA has launched a dynamic currency hedging product that looks at each currency pair in the portfolio separately and manages a hedge on each appropriate to volatility and interest rate differential.Although this is a more resource-intensive option, and therefore may seem pricier, Ms Fan says the benefits significantly outweigh the costs, as it is possible to offer downside protection while allowing the investor to participate in any upside.SSgA is not the only currency manager expecting a shift to dynamic currency hedging – Mr Lequeux’s recent appointment at Aviva Investors was precisely in expectation of growing demand for such products, while James Wood-Collins, chief executive of Record Currency Management, sees a similar trend.“As currency moves up the agenda, we would expect dynamic hedging to be a beneficiary,” says Mr Wood-Collins.The value of currency hedging for a portfolio depends on a number of factors, he says. At the moment, the industry norm is for international fixed income portfolios to be entirely hedged, often by the portfolio managers themselves, since the volatility of the investments is usually dwarfed by the currency volatility.“Because bonds are low volatility, the currency contribution to volatility is significant, so the volatility benefit of hedging is material,” says Mr Wood-Collins. “In equities, the proportional benefit may be less, so there is an important conversation clients should have with managers,” he says, about what level and form of hedging would be most beneficial.The UK, having a solid tradition of overseas investment, has a relatively established history of static currency hedging, although since the financial crisis, institutional investors are looking at alternative approaches.In the US, it is a relatively recent development for investors to look abroad for a significant proportion of their portfolios, so fewer have historically needed currency hedging.This is changing, however, as investors spread their geographical exposure at a time when currency volatility is relatively high and interest rates are relatively low across all developed markets (making the cost of hedging lower).Just because American investors are newer to the game of currency hedging does not mean they are unsophisticated about it, says Mr Wood-Collins.“The awareness of alternatives to passive hedging in the US has been at least as high if not higher than in the UK.”Pooled funds are also open to currency risk, but the manager cannot necessarily decide what the optimum hedge ratio is. One trend seen by Mr Hogg is for funds to offer hedged and unhedged share classes. This means investors can allocate between them to achieve what they feel is the appropriate ratio.“A neutral currency view is a 50 per cent ratio,” he says.
496;STT;State Street Corp;2010-10-03T07:21:42Z;FX markets ride wave of widening appeal;;"T he Bank for International Settlements triennial FX survey, published in early September, revealed that the currency markets, already the largest traded market in the world, had risen to record levels. The leap in average daily volumes from $3,300bn in 2007 to $4,000bn this year was led by an almost 50 per cent increase in spot FX, to $1,500bn per day. reportThe survey also revealed the increasing participation of hedge funds, pension funds and mutual funds, which many see as confirmation of the growing acceptance of foreign exchange as an asset class.Anecdotal data support this trend. In July, RBC Capital Markets published a survey of 102 asset managers – with a total of more than $4,000bn of assets under management – which revealed that 38 per cent say currency tops the list of asset classes they are most likely to move into over the next 12 months, ahead of equities and commodities.According to Monica Fan, senior currency product engineer at State Street Global Advisors, the crisis has led more fund managers to see the market’s potential. First and foremost, currency markets are large and liquid – and they stay open. “With a turnover of about $4,000bn per day, currency markets have about 10 times the turnover in global equities and five times that in US Treasuries,” she says. “The market’s ability to stay open even when there was extreme dislocation elsewhere has led a lot of investors to reassess how FX can be used to hedge valuation and liquidity risk, but also to add additional value.”Contrary to what day-to-day movements may suggest, currencies are less volatile than equities over the long-term, says Nicholas Brooks, head of research and investment strategy at ETF Securities (ETFS). “Annualised average daily volatility of the euro/dollar pair over the past decade, for example, is 140 per cent lower than the volatility in the EuroStoxx 50 over the same period,” he says.Moreover, argues Mr Brooks, currency markets have low correlation to other markets.“During the financial crisis, most risk assets fell sharply and correlations across asset classes increased, but investors who were long ‘safe haven’ currencies or short ‘risk’ currencies generated good returns. Because FX pairs are simply a ratio of one currency to another, FX markets cannot crash in unison with other asset classes, because when one currency falls, by definition, the other must rise.”A fundamental element of the currency market’s structure means it offers good profit opportunities for investors. According to Deutsche Bank, “passive” players – such as corporate treasurers who are looking to hedge currency risk or to facilitate their core business, not to make a profit – account for more than 50 per cent of currency flows. “The flows from passive players have only limited direct sensitivity to broader market and macro factors, so they can serve as counterparts to investment theme-driven flows,” says Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.This huge liquidity pool offers strategic opportunities to implement macro-themes driven by structural factors.According to ETFS, investors taking a long-term view on the commodity boom and looking to benefit from appreciation in the commodity currencies have seen good returns. Those who went long the Australian dollar versus the US dollar, for example, would have seen an 85 per cent gain between January 2002 and June 2008.Similarly, currency markets also work well for taking short-term, tactical views. Spot return data from Bloomberg reveal that an investor who believed the UK’s tough stance on government spending would have a positive effect on the currency, and who went long sterling and short the US dollar, would have seen an 11 per cent gain between May 20 and June 6.So why has it taken so long for fund managers to see the potential of the currency markets?In part, it is because FX has traditionally been viewed not as an opportunity, but as an unwanted side-effect of international equity portfolios.As a result, fund managers have historically turned to specialist overlay managers in order to risk manage currency exposures and reduce volatility – largely to free up risk budget to spend on other assets.“That view has now changed,” says Ms Fan, whose company is one of the world’s largest currency overlay managers, with more than $80bn of currency assets under management for 300 clients. “Managers now realise that pursuing an active currency strategy can go beyond reducing risk and add real value to a portfolio.”Take-up of currency strategies is also being fuelled by the development of new investment vehicles.The size and liquidity of the market lends itself well to vehicles that allow for frequent redemptions, such as mutual funds, exchange traded funds and exchange traded currencies.ETCs enable investors to gain exposure to foreign exchange movements through a listed security, which track currency indices that aim to reflect movements in exchange rates between two currencies, plus exposure to local interest rates.ETFS has more than 50 ETCs, but as an indication of how much appetite the firm believes exists, in June alone it launched 22 ETCs.According to Morningstar, 10 of the 15 mutual funds in its currency category are actively managed, and all but two of the 31 currency ETFs are passive index-trackers, requiring an investor to have some sort of investment thesis.Of the passive strategies, most ETFs are short the US dollar and long a foreign currency or basket of currencies. In the active segment, the ETFs follow a carry strategy, taking long positions in high-yield currencies and short positions in low-yielding currencies.But if fund managers are beginning to invest in currencies, so far the dedicated FX fund market is tiny. According to Lipper, pure currency funds – exploiting arbitrage opportunities, carry interest, momentum or fundamental expectations – only have £5.8bn ($9.1bn) under management, versus £16,940bn under management in all other funds.According to a 2009 survey by Morningstar, active currency overlays exceed €88bn globally, and absolute return strategies exceed €26bn. Ucits absolute return currency strategies are forecast to grow from €5bn in 2009 to about €50bn in 2015, according to surveys by Lipper and Deutsche Bank.Of course, currency funds are just as susceptible to crowded trades or a rush to safety as other assets – and can get caught in the fallout from other trades.In May, for example, currency funds were punished as investors rushed to unwind risk trades in everything from emerging market debt to global financial stocks; funds invested in the euro, the Australian dollar and the Russian rouble were the worst performing, according to analysis from Lipper. The Aussie dollar plummeted 12 per cent between April 30 and May 20, with most of the losses occurring in little more than a week, according to Reuters data.And the structural peculiarities of the market – the large number of non-profit seeking participants – could be less of a winner the bigger the dedicated currency fund space grows, says RBC’s Mr Cole.“Passive participants leave money on the table in the course of their other activities, but the greater the number of specialist fund managers that chase after it, the less there will be to go around,” he says."
497;STT;State Street Corp;2010-09-29T15:35:52Z;State Street appoints new ETF product development chief;Scott Ebner joins from NYSE Euronext;State Street has appointed a new global head of ETF product development as the world’s third largest asset manager steps up its efforts to respond to competition from BlackRock, Vanguard and a host of emerging rivals in the exchange traded funds market.Scott Ebner joins State Street as a managing director and global head of ETF product development from NYSE Euronext, where he was global head of exchange traded products.Based in London, Mr Ebner will report to James Ross, State Street’s global head of ETFs.State Street is the world’s second largest manager of exchange traded funds (behind BlackRock) with more than $200bn in assets worldwide.It runs the world’s two biggest exchange traded products, the $80bn SPDR S&P 500, and the massively popular SPDR Gold Trust, which has assets of $54.3bn.But Mr Ebner faces a battle to reverse State Street’s declining market share in view of ferocious competition from other providers.The SPDR S&P 500 has seen huge outflows of $18.2bn so far this year, according to the National Stock Exchange, as other providers have launched cheaper rival products and US investors have increasingly turned from their domestic stock market to emerging markets to chase returns.In contrast, the SPDR Gold Trust has enjoyed strong cash inflows, $6.7bn so far this year according to the National Stock Exchange, as investors have continued to flock to gold amid concerns about the outlook for the dollar and Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.But the net effect has been a haemorrhaging of cash from State Street’s ETF business with total net outflows of $6.5bn this year.Meanwhile, rivals Vanguard and BlackRock have raked in $23.7bn and $17.1bn in new cash this year.A signal that State Street was preparing its ETF business for a change in direction was provided by Scott Powers, the company’s chief executive in July.In an interview with FTfm, Mr Powers suggested State Street was keen to embrace active ETFs.“To date, ETFs have been dominated by passive investment. We have filed for active ETFs. We think they will pick up traction over time,” said Mr Powers.
498;STT;State Street Corp;2010-09-26T10:13:23Z;SSgA strengthens local presence with key staff;;"State Street Global Advisors plans to deepen its roots in Asia by planting more key executives in the region. The move underscores the importance of foreign managers building a local presence, or strengthening what they have on the ground, if they hope to grow market share in the future.Last week SSgA announced the appointment of Lochiel Crafter to the newly created position of head of investments for Asia-Pacific, based in Sydney. Mr Crafter, formerly chief executive at the $18bn Australian Reward Investment Alliance, previously spent seven years with SSgA, most recently as regional chief investment officer for Asia-Pacific.In his new position, he will oversee the investment teams in Sydney, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore.Mr Crafter’s new title at SSgA reflects an expanded role and a deep commitment by the company to the region, says Bernard Reilly, a senior managing director who oversees SSgA’s Asia-Pacific business .He says SSgA plans to reinforce its leadership as a provider of passive investment products and expand its exchange traded fund line-up. It has recently hired an Asia-
Pacific head of ETFs and two other key senior managers.When it comes to foreign asset managers looking to draw flows from the region, boots – or executives’ wingtips – on the ground are a critical element.“That’s a matter of faith,” says Daniel Enskat, head of global consulting at Strategic Insight. “If you go to a gatekeeper and say, ‘Here’s my junior guy,’ and another firm brings their big guns, forget it. You have to have executives that have resources and contacts. It does not make sense to put your toe in the water.”Asia is an appealing market in terms of growth. In June, Boston-based research firm Cerulli Associates projected growth in assets under management for Asia ex-Japan at 14.5 per cent between 2009 and 2014 to $3,800bn.A slew of foreign managers besides SSgA have been looking to lay the groundwork by building their physical presence now to capture those flows later. BlackRock recently reorganised its global efforts by region, and Vanguard has been building a base from Australia, says Mr Enskat.At the same time, SSgA’s decision to include Japan as part of Mr Crafter’s regional purview marks another ongoing trend. Whereas historically, data and analysis of the industry in the region has been “ex-Japan”, that distinction is dwindling. “The lines of demarcation will become blurry,” says Mr Enskat.Much of the push to remove the ex-Japan tag comes from asset managers based there, such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Nomura and Nikko Asset Management, he says.“They want to build Japanese expertise and export it to the region. They are saying, ‘We are part of Asia.’ It’s a growth opportunity.”SSgA’s Mr Reilly sees China, Japan and Australia as offering strong growth prospects in terms of assets. That is driven by increasing wealth in China, by a push toward defined contribution retirement savings plans in Japan, and in Australia investors have been focusing more on cost, he says. He also points to Korea’s well-developed funds market and the emerging private sector pension plans developing in China.Foreign managers that seek business in the region should remain committed, even when profit margins face pressure, says Mr Enskat. Companies that have begun building bases in the past then pulled back during difficult times have been punished, he says.Long-term commitment may be more challenging than it sounds for some companies. While the growth prospects for the region are great, the tactical execution is challenging.“It’s growing fast, but it’s not as profitable,” says Mr Enskat. Investors are more likely to switch between products more quickly than in the US or even Europe. There are more regulatory regimes to navigate, and there are more languages to contend with when promoting a product, he says.Adding to the challenges for foreign managers, competition is stiff with many firms flocking to the same markets.For its part, SSgA seems to be saturating the region. The group employs about 200 people, with full investment teams in Singapore, Sydney, Hong Kong and Tokyo, in addition to a desk that covers trades from New Zealand to Pakistan. In 2009, SSgA opened a representative office in Shanghai, followed by one in Seoul earlier this year.

499;STT;State Street Corp;2010-09-12T08:36:44Z;Gems could add sparkle to holdings;;Exchange traded funds have proved a runaway success since their creation 20 years ago, but could their future be more sparkling still? Maybe so if the industry succeeds with an initiative to package diamonds in an ETF format.“Can you put diamonds into an ETF? As I have gone around the world, people have asked about this,” says Deborah Fuhr, global head of ETF research at BlackRock. “You would have to source sufficient inventory and store it somewhere, but never say never.”At first glance, the rapidly expanding roster of ETFs available on the world’s bourses – some 2,200 at the last count - would appear to cover just about every conceivable investment need.This year alone has witnessed launches encompassing everything from shipping and mid-cap Brazilian equities to small-cap South Korea stocks and the spread between crude oil and natural gas prices. Products based on fishing, lithium, medical inflation and waste management are among those on the drawing board.But the ever-innovative minds of the financial industry are still dreaming up new products, and investors themselves are clamouring for more investment options.“The US has a lot of product but I still think there are opportunities for expansion in Europe, particularly additional fixed income product,” says Jim Ross, senior managing director at State Street Global Advisors.According to Mr Ross, “people are looking at fixed income as they would equity”. As a result, there is demand for fixed income products that decompose the available universe, as many equity products do. That would mean offering products that target specific points of the yield curve for sovereign, corporate and inflation-protected debt, he says.Alan Miller, senior partner at SCM Private, a London-based wealth manager that builds portfolios from ETFs, makes similar points, arguing there is “much less choice” for corporate bonds in the UK than the US.“In the US there is high yield, municipal, there is a wider choice of corporate bonds. In the UK including or excluding financials is the limit of your choice. I would like to see slightly more segmentation.”Christopher Aldous, chief executive of Evercore Pan Asset, which constructs funds out of ETFs, would welcome a broader range of Asian fixed income products.“There is nothing mainstream that we have come across, such as Asia ex-Japan corporate bonds. It would have been great to have the currency appreciation and the bond income. I wouldn’t mind having the renminbi long term if you could have pure Chinese fixed income exposure,” says Mr Aldous, who would also be keen to see a UK-listed convertible bond ETF. At present the only convertibles ETF is a US-listed State Street offering that has raised just over $300m since launch in April 2009.This is just part of Mr Aldous’s wish-list. “The one area that is very badly served is listed property,” he says. “iShares is the only provider. We have 25-30 per cent exposure in some portfolios, which means we have big holdings of iShares. More providers would keep everyone honest and keep the tracking error as low as possible.”He would also like to see a wider range of currency-hedged equity ETFs, particularly now sterling appears to be on a broadly upward trend, eating into returns for his predominantly UK-based investors.“When you buy the S&P 500 you are buying the index and the US dollar, effectively. What would be great for us is if we could buy the performance of the index but had the built-in currency hedging.”Mr Miller also argues that a wider range of currency-hedged ETFs would be “attractive” and Mr Ross admits SSGA “hears a lot” about the subject, but he says: “The question is do you do that within the product or do you do it yourself outside? You might want to hedge your portfolio rather than hedging each product.”Mr Aldous, many of whose clients are charities, believes there would also be strong demand for a range of geographically based “ethical” or “sustainable” equity ETFs.“We need 10-12 to give people the global exposure they want. That’s a big ask in terms of new products and getting seed capital,” he says.Mr Ross sounds unconvinced about the merits of such a roll-out. “The challenge is getting everyone to agree on a definition,” he says. “My view of ethical or socially responsible might be different to yours. However, I do think there are some products that are interesting when you start talking about sustainable energy.”Similarly, Mr Ross has doubts about Mr Aldous’s desire for a wider range of ETF-based hedge fund strategies – particularly liquid arbitrage strategies. “That is something people are looking at, but getting that flexibility into a US fund structure is challenging,” says Mr Ross.Ms Fuhr also recognises the demand for more currency hedge ETFs and says there are many more leveraged and inverse products in the pipeline, as well as more FX ETFs as investors increasingly view currency as an asset class.But, she adds: “The more usual innovation is about the way it’s packaged. There are not a lot of building blocks for low-cost beta that are missing. People are looking at ways to deliver alpha now.”As for Mr Ross, he foresees a wave of local equity market ETFs aimed at domestic investors, products that would grab fewer headlines than a diamond ETF, but perhaps prove of more use to investors.
500;STT;State Street Corp;2010-09-12T08:36:43Z;Europe has a way to go before it can match US levels;;The shift to fee-based advice in the UK will be a catalyst for increased retail assets in ETFs in Europe, say industry experts, but further regulation and education will need to be in place before Europe is on a par with the US.Retail investors in the US represent about 50 per cent of the ownership of ETFs, whereas in Europe it is less than 10 per cent, according to ETF provider Source.The US retail investor is “famously” self-directed, says Michael John Lytle, director of marketing at Source, while European investors tend to be sold to in one way or another.ETFs do not offer commission to distributors selling them, unlike mutual funds, which has been cited as one of the main reasons why there has not been a broad shift into the vehicles.“In the UK, the Retail Distribution Review (RDR) is a tool that may start to re-engineer the role of ETFs for the retail investor’s portfolio, but the reasons why the US is ahead of Europe in retail use is multi-faceted,” says Mr Lytle.The RDR, to be introduced from 2013, will ban commission payments by asset managers and other product providers to financial advisers. Instead, advisers will have to agree a fee for their services with clients.Mr Lytle says the new rules will “force a degree of pricing transparency on the product so investors start to understand what they are being charged for.“IFAs will no longer be able to build a portfolio using products with hidden charges.”Vin Bhattacharjee, head of EMEA intermediary business at State Street Global Advisors, believes the pace of regulatory change in the UK and Europe will be slow.“In the UK, the RDR will not really kick off until 2013 and there is very little that is happening in Europe,” he says.David Bower, managing director at BlackRock, agrees: “In the rest of Europe there is nothing as concrete on the horizon. There is the Packaged Retail Investment Products initiative, which has comparable elements to the RDR, but that is moving at a slow pace and there is no visibility of the timescale of implementation.”Dan Draper, global head of ETFs at Credit Suisse, says the Mifid legislation (markets in financial instruments directive) in Europe is starting to standardise transparency involving commissions on investment products.“However, we are a long way from having a truly harmonised regime across Europe,” he says.SSgA’s Mr Bhattacharjee says the change that will make the biggest difference in retail usage is how intermediaries position this product. He believes a lot more education is needed.“There is also the issue of how the retail space views synthetic ETFs. I believe they could be reluctant to invest in something they don’t understand,” he says.“It’s not rocket science but it’s easier to explain physically-replicated ETFs than to get into the nuts and bolt of a synthetic product.“Physically-replicated ETFs should do better [in the retail market] because they are easier to explain,” says Mr Bhattacharjee.BlackRock’s Mr Bower believes another stumbling block in Europe for the widespread uptake of ETFs by retail investors is the lack of open fund platforms and product structure.“In the US, distributors are open to products of third-party managers whereas in Europe open architecture is not so prevalent.“Products from European distributors are more wrapper-led, for example, focusing on the tax benefits of life insurance and pension products rather than focusing on the underlying investments that the client is acquiring.”There is also an issue of ease of access in Europe, says Andy Clark, managing director of UK wholesale at HSBC Global Asset Management.“In Europe, buying ETFs can be laborious, having to use a stock broker or online brokerage which charge an extra fee, as opposed to the US, where access is often a bit more seamless.”Martin Thommen, head of wholesale business at UBS Global Asset Management, however, believes the growth of ETFs in Europe will be driven mainly by professional investors and not by retail investors at all.“Retail investors tend to be unhappy with the average investment return, which is what index investing is by its nature, and that’s the main reason why retail investors [do not like passive investing].“Retail investors want the better part of investment result, which is why they are looking for active management.”He does not believe there will be a shift into ETFs as the fee-based advice model grows.
501;STT;State Street Corp;2010-09-12T08:36:43Z;Firms are advised to focus on scale;;"A price war gripping the fast-growing exchange traded fund market in the US may be good news for investors, but what impact is it having on the revenue streams and profit margins of product providers?Since the start of the year, leading brokerage firms such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard have cut the cost of trading in ETFs to zero as they battle to increase market share.Schwab has also cut expense ratios on six of its eight ETFs. Leading ETF providers such as BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors have also cut their expense ratios.As low-cost competition intensifies, the name of the game is scale if firms want to boost revenues and profitability, according to Bradley Kay, associate director, European ETF research at Morningstar.In contrast to the US, there is little price competition in evidence in Europe. The most significant cost-cutting initiative of the past 12 months was Deutsche Bank’s decision to slash the total expense ratio (TER) of its db x-trackers Euro Stoxx 50 ETF to 0 per cent. As recently as during a week in August, Halifax waived commissions for its ETFs and international shares traded online.The reason for the lack of price competition in Europe, says Mr Kay, is that ETFs tend to be run by active managers who are selling their products largely to an existing client base.“This situation won’t change until we get a more sizeable group of adviser-driven retail investors and new institutional investors who do not have those pre-existing relationships with the ETF providers,” says Mr Kay.According to BlackRock data, the average expense ratio across all US ETFs is 33 basis points, while for European ETFs it is 35 basis points.The TER usually includes the asset management, trustee, custody, fund accounting and transfer agency fees as well as index licensing, legal, auditing, printing and postage costs.Collateral fees (charged by synthetic replication ETFs) tend to be included in the TER, except in the case of exchange traded commodities. The cost of buying and selling shares in the ETF will incur brokerage fees that are not included in the TER.The amount of fee income earned by the ETF manager partly depends on how the fund is structured. For instance, a physical replication ETF that buys the underlying securities of the index in accordance with their index weightings will earn a management fee that forms part of the TER. The level of management fee income will depend on the volume of assets under management in the ETF.By contrast, a synthetic replication ETF holds a basket of securities as collateral and uses a total return swap to gain exposure to the performance of the reference index.In addition to management fees, investment bank sponsors of swap-based ETFs in Europe such as Deutsche Bank and Lyxor (a subsidiary of Société Générale) earn transaction fees for writing the swap agreement. They can also make money from lending out the securities in the collateral basket.According to Manooj Mistry, UK head of db x-trackers, the revenue generated from lending out the securities in the swap inventory related to the Eurostoxx 50 ETF is sufficient to cover the costs of the ETF and to allow Deutsche Bank to apply a 0 per cent TER.He says Deutsche Bank gives the majority of the securities lending revenue back to the investor.“Prior to moving the Euro Stoxx 50 ETF to 0 per cent TER, we looked at the performance of the fund.“After fees, it was outperforming the index by about 40 basis points per annum so we are giving 40 basis points of revenue back to the ETF on top of the management fee.”Mr Mistry will not reveal how much profit margin is being made by db x-trackers, pointing out that the ETF business forms “a very small part” of Deutsche Bank’s activities and is not specifically highlighted in the financial reports.He claims the ETF business operates on thin margins, regardless of whether the funds use physical or synthetic replication.“It is low margin but you generate revenues from having large volumes of assets under management and by engaging in securities lending.”Jim Ross, senior managing director at State Street Global Advisors says the ETF business constitutes a “relatively small piece” of State Street Corporation, “so I don’t think what we earn and the margin is material to the bottom line of the company”.Some providers of physical replication ETFs also engage in securities lending to boost revenues.Ben Fulton, managing director of Invesco PowerShares global ETF business, says his firm conducts some securities lending on its Irish-based Nasdaq 100 ETF, “to tighten up the tracking of the index”. All the revenue generated is given to the ETF shareholder.The group is looking at expanding its securities lending activities to other ETFs in its US and European product range “but not at the expense of increasing the risk to
investors”.Morningstar’s Mr Kay says it is difficult to determine the level of profit margin ETF providers are making because there is no such thing as a pure publicly listed ETF company whose balance sheet can be examined for such information.The revenues and expenses generated by ETF providers are invariably wrapped into the overall balance sheet of the sponsoring asset management company or investment bank.WisdomTree, a relatively small US-based player with $7.2bn (£4.7bn, €5.6bn) of ETF assets under management, breaks out to a certain degree in its financial reports the figures for its ETF operations, revealing changes in assets under management, asset inflows and the impact of positive and negative market movement over time.A glance at the company’s financial statements seems to bear out claims that ETF players operate on razor-thin margins. The company, which manages an additional $658m of third-party money against WisdomTree indices, recently reported total revenues of $18m against total expenses of $23.5m during the first six months of 2010, resulting in an operating loss for the period of $5.5m. This compares with total revenues of $8.1m against total expenses of $19.8m for the first half of 2009, meaning an operating loss for the period of $11.6m.Pointing out that WisdomTree generated its first positive cash flow of $200,000 in the second quarter, chief executive Jonathan Steinberg says the goal is to remain cash flow positive and eventually to become net income positive.He denies suggestions that WisdomTree’s margins are razor-thin, but points out that the amount of money the firm is investing in the infrastructure required to scale up its operations, is affecting the bottom-line.He says the business is currently “hovering around a break-even point on a cash-flow basis”, and claims “were we to double our assets we would be highly profitable”.Bruce Lavine, president and chief operating officer, adds: “We are seeing increasing revenue capture on our assets, with basis points income rising to 56 basis points.“Because we are adding some real functionality in the ETF marketplace, hopefully we will earn a better margin over time than the likes of Schwab will earn with its more commoditised, low-fee ETFs.”"
502;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
503;STT;State Street Corp;2010-08-13T21:35:01Z;Hinde Capital attacks gold ETFs;Hedge fund’s criticisms dismissed as misplaced by analysts;Hinde Capital, a London-based gold hedge fund, has mounted a ferocious attack on precious metals exchange traded funds and in particular the largest gold ETF, the SPDR Gold Trust run by State Street.Hinde says precious metals ETFs “should not be owned by serious professional investors” and in a highly provocative paper argues that double counting of gold holdings is “endemic” in the global financial system.Hinde notes that central banks who lease or loan gold to commercial banks continue to report this bullion as part of their official reserves under international accounting standards.But as the banks are allowed to sell the (leased or loaned) bullion into the global financial system, this has led to multiple counting of the gold.Hinde says this gold (which is still owned by the central banks) can then enter ETFs, such as the SPDR Gold Trust, when authorised participants (registered broker-dealers or other large market participants such as investment banks) swap the gold for new units in the ETF.“We see it as highly likely that encumbered (without full ownership rights) gold or leased gold could be in ETF products”, says Ben Davies, chief executive of Hinde Capital: “If we were a major ETF holder, we would demand delivery of our physical bullion before all other investors demanded theirs from either ETFs or the OTC (over-the-counter) market.”Hinde went on to say that a potential conflict of interest exists for the custodian of the SPDR gold, which is the investment bank HSBC, as it runs substantial short positions (bets on gold prices falling) in the derivatives market.In reply, State Street said the gold held in the SPDR Trust was held in allocated accounts (where the bars are individually identified and numbered). A spokesman for State Street said that if a commercial bank had an obligation to a central bank (as part of a lease or loan agreement), then that was a matter for them and did not imply that there was any prior claim on the gold in the SPDR Trust.A senior gold dealer in London said: “There will be gold in the physically backed bullion ETFs that at one time belonged to a central bank. But when a central bank leases or loans gold in the market, it does not require precisely the same bar with its reference number to be returned. ETFs are still the easiest way for private investors to own gold.”
504;STT;State Street Corp;2010-08-11T21:51:13Z;Financial markets: Derivative dilemmas;Reform seeks balance of rules and rewards;Ari Bergmann is putting the finishing touches to a course he will begin teaching at New York University in a few weeks. Yet, in spite of his best efforts, much of the curriculum cannot yet be written. That is because of a big battle that is about to explode, on Wall Street and in the deepest bowels of Washington.Mr Bergmann will teach people ranging from investors to corporate treasurers how to spot financial risks and how to manage them. The tools used to do this are derivatives, which he first traded in the 1980s – contracts whose value is linked to a financial instrument, from the rate of interest paid on US government bonds to the price of oil.The derivatives market is one of the biggest in the world. At the end of last year, contracts with a face value of $636,431bn were swirling around the world’s financial system, according to the Bank of International Settlements. Just 3.4 per cent of the total were traded on exchanges. The rest – $614,674bn worth, equivalent to nearly 10 years of global economic output – were agreed and traded in private markets, under terms struck directly between the buyers and sellers.Over the next year, an entirely new rulebook is to be drawn up for this privately traded part of the financial markets, also called over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. President Barack Obama’s signature on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on July 21 started the countdown. The legislation covers many parts of the financial system. Title seven – the part that deals with derivatives – is “among the most far-reaching and controversial sets of statutory changes” included in the new laws, according to lawyers at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.But whereas in theory the business is about to be revolutionised, in reality any changes will be preceded by bitter haggling over precisely what the rules prescribe– and proscribe. Crucially for banks, investors and the future health of world economies, just how far-reaching the outcome will be depends in large part on the decisions made by the two Washington regulators who will police a market that grew dramatically in recent decades without direct oversight.The two – the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – have increased their staff numbers in anticipation of the rule-writing and their huge extra enforcement duties. For the most part, the rules have to be written by July 2011. These are regulators that usually write just a handful of new rules every year but, thanks to the new legislation, there will be more than 100 definitions and rules to get through. “Many of the key terms in the derivatives legislation are either undefined or are left for the regulators to fill in,” says Cadwalader.The root cause of the financial crisis involved losses on risky US mortgages. The entire global financial system was exposed to these mortgages after hundreds of billions of dollars of complex securities linked to them were sold to investors from Illinois to Iceland. Derivatives were the building blocks for those securities.The degree to which derivatives had created a dangerously interconnected financial system became clear amid the collapse of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG in 2008. A default by one bank at the centre of a tangled web of derivatives contracts could paralyse the entire financial system, because the derivatives could become worthless if the bank writing the contract went under.“In the wake of the recent financial crisis, over-the-counter derivatives have been blamed for increasing systemic risk,” said Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff in a paper earlier this year. “OTC derivatives serve a vital role in financial markets but deficiencies in the market design and infrastructure allowed for misuse of these instruments, exacerbating the recent financial meltdown.”Regulators have swept in to restore confidence in markets before. After the crash of 1929, the SEC was set up to police the equity markets and create structures that would reassure investors the cards were not stacked against them. The CFTC, with its roots in commodity markets, has done the same for exchange-traded futures. Now, the regulators will try to do the same for derivatives markets.“The Wall Street reform bill will for the first time bring comprehensive regulation to the over-the-counter derivatives marketplace,” says Gary Gensler, chairman of the CFTC. The new rules will “lower risk, promote transparency and protect the American public”, he adds.Under the new regulations, the derivatives world will be divided in two. On one side will be those products that are widely used, simple in structure and actively traded: standardised derivatives. Those will be pushed on to clearing houses to make the financial system less vulnerable to the default of a big derivatives dealer.Clearing houses can reduce counterparty and systemic risks by standing in the middle of trades – though there of course remains a risk the clearing house itself may fail. The clearing house has a pool of capital and collects collateral and margin – up-front payments against possible losses. If these resources are not enough to cover a default by a member, the others are supposed to cough up.Cleared derivatives will also have to be traded on electronic systems – although exactly how those systems will be defined, and how quickly and frequently price information has to be made public remains to be resolved. Mr Bergmann, who advises investors on derivatives strategies, says public pricing would reduce the chances that buyers – such as municipalities or small pension funds – would overpay. Customers who pay banks too much would soon know if the value is lower than they thought. If the contracts are centrally cleared, they would have to come up with an extra margin to pay the clearing house as soon as the price falls. “Mispricing of derivatives has often not been discovered until it is a disaster,” says Mr Bergmann. “In theory, with widespread clearing people will know about it before it becomes a disaster.”Once regulators determine what part of the OTC derivatives or swaps markets has to be cleared, the remaining part will also be policed. No one knows what proportion will be uncleared, or what the targets are, although for all derivatives the more heavily regulated exchange-traded futures market provides the likely standard. “Look at the way futures have traded on exchanges,” says Viral Acharya, professor of finance at NYU’s Stern business school. “Similar practices, in one way or another, will be applied to OTC derivatives under new regulations. There will be more capital required, less leverage and less opacity.”How regulators decide the clearing houses should hold the collateral against trades, and the extent to which derivatives users can offset positions against each other, will also be key. Banks have built huge internal clearing systems in recent decades, divisions usually called “prime brokerage”. Through these, big institutional investors or hedge funds can buy and sell all kinds of financial instruments – from bonds to credit derivatives to currency swaps to commodity investments – and offset them against one other. If an investor has to pay for each part of the trade – usually called a “leg” – having to hand over cash for each piece could add up. If the positions are offset, the trade can be done much more cheaply.“We still don’t know what kinds of trades will be profitable or which of our customers will have to change their investment strategies,” says the head of prime brokerage at one big bank.These questions about the costs also mean that the risks of the clearing houses and the business model behind them cannot be properly worked out – leaving investors in limbo. “When we use a clearing house, we have to be able to make a case as to why we think they are financially sound,” says the head of trading at one of the biggest institutional investors. “We cannot determine this until we know what the new rules will be.”There is a lot to play for. According to Tabb Group, the biggest derivatives dealers generate revenues of $40bn a year from the OTC business.As the rules are rewritten there will be much behind-the-scenes jostling as current derivatives big-shots – which include all the Wall Street banks – try to hang on to market share and newcomers try to muscle in. “This is a big business opportunity,” says Larry Tabb, chief executive of Tabb Group.The cast of characters embraces not only big banks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank but exchanges such as CME Group, Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext and Intercontinental Exchange, which want clearing business. It also includes smaller banks and brokers that are trying to expand their derivatives business, for instance Nomura and Jefferies, as well as inter-dealer brokers including Icap, and other financial groups that want to get into clearing or trading, from Tradeweb to State Street to tiny start-up brokerage firms.The outcomes will affect investors, banks and companies that use derivatives extensively for hedging. The end result will also depend on what happens in Europe. “A lot of these things won’t work well if one centre applies rules that are not as strict,” says Mr Arachya.With the answers to the questions about the future shape of the derivatives markets now in the hands of staff and commissioners at the regulators, the CFTC’s Mr Gensler says CFTC and SEC teams have already met five or six times since the legislation was passed. A series of public hearings is expected to be held from September onwards.The potential for turf wars is of concern, as is the possibility of disruption to investment and trading activities. “The enormity of the proposed changes could result in both short-term pain for users of swaps and participants in the derivatives markets generally, and long-term unintended and undesirable changes in the marketplace,” say lawyers at Jones Day. “The extent to which the rulemaking process will provide the necessary clarity will depend in part on how well the CFTC and SEC are able to work together in areas of potentially overlapping jurisdictions.”Whatever the case, the coming months will determine what is ultimately discussed in Mr Bergmann’s course about risks and markets. Not for nothing is the biggest section in his course outline entitled: “Derivatives: weapons of mass destruction or weapons of mass protection?”
505;STT;State Street Corp;2010-08-05T16:50:17Z;iShares ETF inflows surge in July;State Street struggles as investors withdraw from SPDR Gold Trust;BlackRock’s iShares business made a storming start to the second half of the year, winning just under three-quarters of new inflows into US exchange traded funds in July, according to data from the National Stock Exchange.The iShares business pulled in almost $6.9bn in new cash in July, taking inflows this year to $17.6bn, down 17.4 per cent on the same period last year.The data for July should provide some reassurance to investors following BlackRock’s latest results, released in late July, when the world’s largest asset manager reported a disappointing second successive quarter of new business outflows for the group as a whole and warned of more to come.The surge in inflows in July took ETF assets held by iShares to $389.1bn, up 22.6 per cent on the same period a year ago.The iShares Russell 2000 ETF alone drew almost $2bn in new inflows in July as investors rediscovered their enthusiasm for smaller companies.The Russell 2000 index has gained 5.5 per cent so far this year, while the broader S&P 500 is up only 0.7 per cent.But it was Vanguard’s MSCI Emerging Markets ETF which remained the top fund pick for investors, attracting more than $2bn in July and taking total inflows for this ETF this year to more than $9bn.In July, Vanguard pulled in $2.8bn in new cash, taking inflows in the first seven months of the year to $19.9bn, up 56.7 per cent on the same period in 2009.Boosted by these strong cash inflows, Vanguard saw its ETF assets reach $112.9bn at the end of July, up 70 per cent over the past year.Vanguard remains the third largest US ETF provider but it is in hot pursuit of second ranked State Street which has seen its assets rise 24.9 per cent to $190bn over the past year.However, the weakness of State Street’s new cash inflows suggest its ETF business is struggling in the face of competition from iShares and Vanguard.State Street recorded net cash outflows of $462m in July, due largely to investors selling gold, with the SPDR Gold Trust registering outflows of $1.4bn last month.State Street has sunk to tenth place for new cash inflows as it has attracted just $637m so far this year.But US cash inflows for all the other ETF providers were overshadowed by the performance of iShares and Vanguard.Looking at cashflows by sectors shows that fixed income ETFs continue to win the biggest share of investors new cash, drawing $4.6bn in July (48.1 per cent of total inflows).So far this year, fixed income ETFs have drawn just over half (51 per cent) of all the new cash.US stock market ETFs remain relatively unloved as these have attracted substantially less cash than emerging markets, which have become increasingly popular with investors.US equity ETFs have attracted $6.1bn in inflows this year (12.2 per cent of the total) while international equity ETFs have drawn $14.3bn (29 per cent of the total).
506;STT;State Street Corp;2010-07-27T22:12:34Z;Private equity rejects criticism by think-tank;;The private equity industry has hit back at its critics, rebuffing claims from a London think-tank that it has produced disappointing average returns by presenting its own evidence that it has outperformed public markets.The Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation reignited the debate about leveraged buy-outs this week by publishing a report accusing them of producing disappointing returns while charging investors fat fees amid glaring conflicts of interest.In response, the Private Equity Council, a US trade association which represents 13 of the biggest US buy-out groups including Blackstone, KKR, TPG, Carlyle and Apax, on Tuesday said the CSFI report “has at best a tangential relationship to the facts”.It cited a range of performance measures from Cambridge Associates, Thomson Reuters, Preqin and State Street, showing that private equity outperformed public markets over three and five years by an average of 7 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.“The 60-page text’s selective quotations of existing research and ignorance of data that rebut its conclusions do more to perpetuate the myths about the industry than to dispel them,” it said.However, over one year, private equity has underperformed public markets according to most measures and excluding venture capital, it only outperformed them by 1 per cent over three years.On fees, the Private Equity Council denied that buy-out firms had an incentive to maximise leverage, as losses on deals could be subject to “clawbacks” by investors against profits on future deals.“The paper entirely ignores this powerful incentive to promote symmetry in the risk-return trade-off,” the Council said.Objecting to the CSFI report’s claim that the alignment of interest between private equity groups and their investors was weakened by the high fees the groups earn, it argued that the need to raise a future fund was a strong incentive to achieve high returns.“The institutional investor’s ability to refuse to invest in a follow-on fund is a powerful inducement to generate the highest possible risk-adjusted returns,” it said.The Council also defended the use of debt, or leverage in deals.It said: “While leverage plays an obvious role, researchers have been unable to quantify its effect because of difficulty with constructing a ‘mimicking portfolio’ of leveraged public equity.“Since borrowing occurs on the portfolio company level with no cross-collateralisation or guarantees, private equity portfolios can absorb volatility in a way that supposedly comparable leveraged portfolios cannot,” it concluded.
507;STT;State Street Corp;2010-07-20T21:37:37Z;Higher stocks boost BNY Mellon and State Street;Rise in share prices offsets lower fees;Bank of New York Mellon and State Street, the two largest US custodial banks, on Tuesday said higher stock prices had boosted quarterly profits, offsetting low interest rates, which have depressed fees for large parts of their business.The increased profits were primarily due to a year-over-year gain in stock prices, which allowed the banks to charge higher fees in their asset management divisions.Howard Chen, a Credit Suisse analyst, said the results were a “mixed bag,” with stock prices are up year-over-year but down compared with the first quarter and “market and macro conditions remain challenging.”He said that new business and cost controls had been positive for State Street.BNY Mellon reported a profit of $658m, or 54 cents a share, compared with $176m, or 15 cents a share, last year. The previous year included a $236m charge for the repayment of $3bn the bank received from the Treasury’s troubled asset relief programme. Fee revenue rose 2 per cent to $2.56bn, including $13bn in net securities gains.Assets under management grew 13 per cent to $1,047bn as of June 30, compared with the same period a year ago, but declined 5 per cent compared with the end of the first quarter on March 31, as falling equity markets depressed asset values.Credit loss provisions decreased to $20m, compared with $35m in the first quarter. Non performing assets also decreased, but the total allowance for credit losses increased $7m in the period.State Street reported operating profit of $432m, or 87 cents a share, compared with a loss of $3.31bn, or $7.12 a share, the prior year, which included $3.68bn in losses related to purchases of asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities.Total fee revenue increased 12 per cent to $1.7bn, compared with $1.5bn a year ago. Revenue on an operating basis, which totalled $2.2bn in the period, included $50m related to losses on securities investments.Assets under management rose 15 per cent to $1,782bn compared with a year ago, but fell 7.6 per cent during the second quarter as a result of tumbling stock markets.Both companies are aggressively courting new businesses. BNY Mellon recently completed the acquisition of Global Investment Servicing, which provides processing technologies to mutual funds, and is expected to close another acquisition, of BHF’s German asset servicing operations, in August.State Street said its servicing fees increased 20 per cent to $957m, “attributable primarily to new business” and “increases in daily average equity valuations”.The higher stock prices allowed BNY Mellon and State Street, which make money by holding investments and securities for clients, to collect more money for managing client funds in the quarter.
508;STT;State Street Corp;2010-07-18T07:35:57Z;Japanese pensions face trying times;But assets under management have risen more than 20% in the last year;Japanese pension funds face a shrinking pool of assets as an ageing population means they have to pay out more in benefits than they receive in contributions.However, a recent survey carried out by the Japan Pensions Industry Database shows assets under management at managers looking after pension money increased 20.2 per cent in the fiscal year ended March 2010 to Y94,300bn (£697bn, €835bn, $1,070bn) and argues the market has potential to expand further.The database compiles and analyses returns submitted to the Japan Securities Industry Investment Advisors Association (JSIAA) by its member firms.BlackRock Japan knocked domestic rival Sumitomo Trust & Banking from the top spot, as the value of the assets it managed surged to Y18,161bn from just Y1,939bn, thanks to its takeover of Barclays Global Investors last year. BGI, a specialist in passively managed Japanese equities, used to battle with domestic house Diam for the top spot.Sumitomo Trust also increased assets under management to Y15,140bn from Y14,288bn, according to the database.The top 10 positions for pension assets under management were evenly split between domestic and global houses and included Mizuho Trust & Banking, State Street Global Advisors, Nomura Asset Management, Diam and Northern Trust Global Investments.A total of 119 asset managers shared the pension mandates with domestic firms managing a combined Y52,000bn, just ahead of the overseas firms for the first time. It is likely that the growth in assets under management was due to improved investment performance, given the recovery in the markets in 2009 from the wreckage of 2008 during the financial crisis.Japan’s Nikkei 225 hit two 26-year lows in October and March during fiscal 2008, but gained 33 per cent in fiscal 2009.Also, the data show that the number of mandates in issue fell to 5,203 from 5,267. However, Jo McBride, who heads the database and performed the analysis says these figures need to be put into context.“Members’ returns show only mandates held, not the number lost or won,” Ms McBride says. “There is lively turnover in this market, especially with funds looking to increase yield and venturing more into alternatives, and mandates are getting bigger.”Japan is an important market for asset managers as it has the world’s second-largest pool of job-based retirement savings. The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), for instance, is one of the largest in the world with assets of Y122,800bn.There is also increasing debate over whether pension funds should be implementing more aggressive targets for returns as Japan grapples with funding its pension schemes in the face of a declining number of people of working age to pay contributions and fund the benefits.The Japan Pensions Industry Database points out that in 2008, 40 per cent of defined benefit pension schemes started paying out more in benefits than they received in contributions and that from 2012 the situation will worsen for all types of plan, including those paying out lump sums rather than monthly instalments.The GPIF for the first time last year had to pay back more to the welfare ministry, which handles public pensions, than it received in contributions. This fiscal year it estimates it will have to return about Y6,700bn.Indeed, Bank of Japan flow of funds data shows the GPIF and other much smaller public pension funds sold a combined net Y443.2bn in Japanese government bonds in fiscal 2009, the first time in nine years. The sales included Zaito bonds, the proceeds of which are used to make loans to government institutions.Takahiro Mitani, the president of the GPIF, expressed scepticism in a recent interview about the need to raise the pension fund’s return target of 1.1 per cent on a real basis above wage growth to something more aggressive. He said the returns for now were enough, although it was difficult to predict future needs.“The higher the return you aim for naturally the risk you take also increases, so you have an increasing possibility of having a large loss,” Mr Mitani said. “Our asset management currently puts a heavy emphasis on stability.”Mr Mitani pointed out the GPIF, which has 67.5 per cent of its total assets invested in yen bonds, the vast majority of which are JGBs, lost 7.6 per cent during fiscal 2008 when the financial crisis was at its peak. This contrasts with the 24 per cent loss suffered by Calpers, the California Public Employees Retirement System, during the financial year to June 2009.About 19 per cent of the GPIF’s assets are invested overseas, compared with a combined 20 per cent for the pension funds included in the Japan Pensions Industry Database.Ms McBride says pension schemes will increasingly go overseas, “creating opportunities for foreign and domestic money managers equipped to do their business”.
509;STT;State Street Corp;2010-07-11T07:12:02Z;Scott Powers: head of a bright ETF pile looks to go active;SSgA’s Scott Powers says it plans to embrace active ETFs;"Scott Powers, chief executive of State Street Global Advisors, has helped create what must surely be one of the dullest jobs in the world. But he is far from apologetic.“It takes the auditors six months to count the bars,” he says of the $49.4bn (£33bn, €39.3bn) of bullion (as of the end of May) backing the SPDR Gold Trust, SSgA’s hugely successful exchange traded product.“It’s the seventh largest store of gold in the world,” he says of the bars squirrelled away in the London vaults of HSBC, its custodian. The Trust “has gone from $15bn two years ago to $50bn today. It’s a 10-year-old project that has turned into an overnight success”.The glittering success of the Gold Trust has allowed SSgA, the asset management arm of State Street, the US bank, to pose a challenge to BlackRock’s hegemonic iShares brand in the exchange traded product space; with its industry-leading SPDR S&P 500 holding assets of $71.5bn it now boasts the two largest exchange traded vehicles in the world.But Mr Powers is far from resting on his laurels. SSgA may be the third largest asset manager in the world, with $1,900bn under management (as at March 31), but passive investment and low-risk money market funds account for all but $109bn of this.In spite of this, the Boston-based house plans to be among the first to embrace the concept of active ETFs.“To date, ETFs have been dominated by passive investment. We have filed for active ETFs. We think they will pick up traction over time,” says Mr Powers.SSgA has so far only applied for permission to create target-date funds, which rely on active asset allocation decisions, although the underlying equity and fixed income portfolios are passive.Many in the industry believe actively managed ETFs will struggle to go beyond this, given the need for such vehicles to be transparent about holdings, thereby revealing proprietary trading processes and potentially opening funds up to front running.But Mr Powers sees a way around this dilemma – the creation of ETFs that combine a series of active managers, meaning observers would struggle to determine the holdings of any single manager merely by looking at the basket of securities that comprise the ETF.“I don’t think anyone has filed for a basket of active managers, but that’s a logical approach,” he says.Mr Powers argues this approach could work well for funds that have grown so large that the assets are spread between a series of managers, such as Vanguard’s Windsor II fund, which is outsourced to six external asset management companies.“I don’t see why it’s something that can’t work in an ETF format,” he says, arguing this would be advantageous for US investors from a tax standpoint, as well as creating a vehicle that would have intra-day liquidity and could be shorted or leveraged.Mr Powers is grappling with the reality of running an asset manager that is part of a bank at a time when politicians and regulators, not least in State Street’s US homeland, are keen to constrain the activities of the banking sector.He says “the jury is still out” on the ramifications of US regulatory reform, but accepts there may be some “unintended consequences” for the likes of SSgA. He is equivocal about the benefits SSgA receives from its ownership by State Street.“Half of SSgA’s clients have a relationship with the bank. There is a strongly complementary nature. [But] SSgA is a fully independent and autonomous unit in State Street and half of our clients see us as just another fund manager with no ties to our parent.”But Mr Powers is relaxed about the so-called “Volcker rule” of the Dodd-Frank bill, which would limit banks to investing 3 per cent of their risk-weighted capital in hedge and private equity funds.“We anticipate that alternatives will be a bigger part of what our clients want in the future and we invest our own capital in seed money for new strategies,” he says. “But even with this cap we have plenty of headroom to do more than we are doing today. We have less than 1 per cent [of capital] in seed money across all our business.”Nevertheless he does expect to see other banks offload activities such as proprietary trading to raise capital and comply with the ruling, should it become law, and suggests SSgA could be among the potential buyers.“We always look to grow our business, both organically and through less than organic means. State Street is one of the most strongly capitalised banks in the world. We are certainly interested in seeing what comes onto the market. I think we will be open to looking at transactions,” he says.SSgA’s other main line of business is money market funds, where it has $500bn under management. However, this sector has been hit by the extremely low yields available from short-term debt instruments and tighter investment restrictions imposed post the financial crisis, forcing managers to cut fees on many vehicles to avoid net yields turning negative.Mr Powers fears the developed world could be in a “low yield, low rate environment for some time”, meaning more opportunities may now reside in “enhanced” bespoke cash portfolios, which could take a little more risk than money market funds, albeit at the expense of the fixed $1-a-share net asset value funds typically display.“Where we see real growth opportunities is in managing more customised portfolios. We see sophisticated investors [such as sovereign wealth funds] willing to take more risk to get more return.”One alternative for companies disappointed by the returns from cash portfolios and wary of the counterparty risk embedded in bank deposits would be to follow the example of Siemens, the German engineering group, which recently unveiled plans to create its own bank.But Mr Powers is relaxed about that threat, at least in SSgA’s home market. “By becoming a bank holding company you would be regulated by the Fed[eral Reserve],” he says, suggesting few outside the Fed’s ambit would be likely to choose to come within it."
510;STT;State Street Corp;2010-07-08T12:12:39Z;Vanguard leads US battle for ETF cash inflows;Vanguard leads race for investors’ cash;Vanguard emerged as the runaway winner in the battle among US exchange traded fund providers for investors’ cash in the first half of 2010, according to data from the National Stock Exchange.Almost $40bn of new cash was ploughed into US exchange traded products (funds and notes) between January and June of 2010, a record for a first half, and Vanguard managed to capture 43 per cent of this money.Vanguard’s new cash inflows of $17.1bn in the first half of 2010 were up 40 per cent compared with the same period last year.Tom Rampulla, managing director at Vanguard Investments UK, says the inflows represented new money “as far as we can judge”, rather than a re-allocation from existing mutual fund assets.Boosted by these strong cash inflows, Vanguard saw its ETF assets reach $102.7bn at the end of June, up 73.4 per cent over the past year, significantly outperforming BlackRock and State Street, the two biggest US players.BlackRock’s iShares saw its assets increase 24 per cent to $361.7bn, while State Street recorded a 28.8 per cent increase in assets to $184.7bn.iShares gathered $10.7bn in new cash in the first half, down by more than a third (36.3 per cent) compared with the same period last year.But State Street only managed to attract $1.1bn in new cash although this represented a huge improvement on its performance in the first half of 2009 when it saw net outflows of $16.9bn.A big part of Vanguard’s success in winning inflows was down to the popularity of its MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, which saw new cash inflows of just under $7bn, just behind the top performer, the SPDR Gold Trust, which attracted inflows of almost $7.3bn.Earlier this year, Vanguard cut the expenses charged for this fund to compete more directly with its rival, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, and investors have been shifting into the cheaper product as a result. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF had net cash outflows of $1.3bn in the first half, according to the NSE data.Vanguard, which launched its first ETFs in 2000, has been competing fiercely in the escalating price war among US providers, which has seen commission free deals being offered by Fidelity and Charles Schwab.Schwab, a newcomer that launched its first ETF in late 2009, reported new cash inflows of $982m in the first half and has seen its total ETF assets grow to $1.2bn.But Vanguard’s success in attracting inflows was not limited to its emerging markets offering as it had three other products in the top ten for new cash (Vanguard Barclays Total Bond, Vanguard Barclays Short Term Bond, Vanguard Mergent Dividend).“Investors have recognised the impact of cost and tracking error on returns. They have looked at our competitors and seen that the expenses on Vanguard’s bond ETFs are significantly lower and they track their underlying indices extremely well,” says Mr Rampulla.The NSE data shows the stranglehold on assets by the big three providers remains largely intact with their aggregate share of total US ETF assets dropping from 96.8 per cent to 94 per cent over the past year.
511;STT;State Street Corp;2010-07-07T20:48:31Z;Risky assets rally as banking fears ease;Shares bounce as traders turn optimistic on earnings;Wednesday 21:25 BST. Banks and earnings season rode to the rescue of a frightened market as traders turned optimistic about the eurozone financial sector stress tests and after the world’s second biggest custody bank said earnings would beat expectations.Earlier, risky assets dipped following Tuesday’s disappointing US service sector figures, and then news that German manufacturing orders unexpectedly fell in May, the first decline this year.But European banking stocks began to rally in the middle of the session as investors’ hopes grew that the publication of the stress tests of eurozone banks, due later this month, will reduce uncertainty surrounding the sector. US stocks had their best day since May, and rallied for the second day in a row.Further impetus was provided to the bounce after State Street said in pre-market trading that its profits would come in much higher than analysts had forecast – leading some investors to raise broader expectations for the up-coming earnings season.Unsurprisingly, that lead US stocks to rally – considering that at Tuesday’s close the S&P 500 was valuing shares at only 12.3 times expected earnings for 2010. That is lower than the historical average of closer to 15 times, according to David Bianco, head of US equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.“Even during the deflationary US depression and the Japan deflation, the price-to-earnings ratio remained in the mid-teens,” Mr Bianco said.Since many earnings estimates were already projecting less-than-robust growth in consumer spending, an expected bounce in Thursday’s retail sales report – which early indicators, such as Redbook reporting a 3 per cent jump in chain-store sales in June, suggest may be strong – is adding fuel to the fire.The FTSE-All World was up 1.5 per cent, the S&P 500 in New York was higher by 3.1 per cent to 1,060 and the FTSE Global Banks index – which had at one stage recorded a loss of 1.4 per cent – was up 3 per cent.On a further potentially positive note, some analysts are pointing to Agricultural Bank of China’s ability to price its shares at the top of its IPO range, raising $22bn in the process, as a sign of investors’ faith in the Chinese economy. Sceptics, however, will note the peculiarities of the Chinese capital markets.Sceptics will also note that earnings multiples are based on a view of their future growth. While the US economy may not ‘double dip’ in 2010, if the possibility grows that it dips again in 2011, shares’ multiples could easily stay depressed.“The equity market is pretty reliant on having a favourable reaction to earnings,” said Barry Knapp, US portfolio strategist at Deutsche Bank.“Even if this quarter will be good, it’s only a matter of time before 2011 expectations are marked down. If business confidence is impacted by the combination of problems in Europe, the dollar’s strength and maybe even some regulatory changes, it’s certainly possible companies could be cautious and start taking down guidance sooner than expected.”● Europe. Bourses dropped sharply at the open, tracking Wall Street’s late slide from its highs on Tuesday. However, the turnaround in the banking sector drove exchanges into positive territory later in the session. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was up 1.5 per cent, though the FTSE 100 in London under-performed with a gain of 1 per cent as miners proved to be a drag.● Forex. The dollar’s early haven flows have receded and the buck is down 0.2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis, and off by 0.1 per cent versus the euro at $1.2643.In part, the euro’s weakness may be due to some of the details that have come out about the European bank stress tests. The Committee for European Bank Supervisors said 91 banks will be tested, with a 3 percentage point deviation in European GDP growth.It did not contradict the anticipated assumption of a 17 per cent haircut on Greek bonds, which analysts have pointed out is not very stressful at all. The credit default swap market is already pricing in a 60 per cent loss, according to Reuters.“These kind of numbers do not seem particularly robust,” and not enough “that would ease market anxiety. If more people conclude this, the euro may come off,” said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.Meanwhile, it’s not surprising to see bank shares rallying – passing the stress tests can only be good for the banks themselves, at least in the near term. At least it was in the US, when the stress tests prompted a huge rally in shares.“Growth” currencies were originally under pressure, but they too are rallying, leaving the Aussie dollar up 1.6 per cent at $0.8662.● Debt. US Treasuries on Tuesday had delivered their verdict on the US data, dipping back towards multi-month lows even as their stock-trading brethren partied in the next room. However, Wall Street’s bounce on Wednesday is delivering some selling to the complex and the yield on the 10-year note is currently up 6 basis points at 2.98 per cent, despite news that China was not considering selling its vast holding of US debt.Spanish and Portuguese benchmark yields are several basis points higher, despite the latter completing a well-received €762m auction of six-month bills.● Commodities. The sector rallied as risk aversion eased. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index is up 1.6 per cent as metals find their footing. After a volatile session, oil is now up 3.5 per cent at $74.49 a barrel.Gold is up 0.8 per cent at $1,202 an ounce, having bounced off a six-week low of $1,185. The precious metal remains under pressure, however, after China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange said it did not see the need to make the precious metal a significant part of its asset portfolio.● Asia. Softer growth prospects in the US and Europe hit Australian commodity-related stocks, leaving Sydney nursing a loss of 0.5 per cent. Hong Kong lost 1.1 per cent but Shanghai bucked the trend with a 0.5 per cent gain, possibly on relief over the AgBank IPO.
512;STT;State Street Corp;2010-07-07T20:35:37Z;Wall Street rallies on State Street outlook;;"US stocks pushed higher for the second straight session on Wednesday as a positive earnings outlook from State Street boosted financials and outweighed concerns about the forthcoming earnings season.There is a perception that the market is cheap relative to other asset classes and has been oversold over the past two months, said Sean Kraus, chief investment officer at Pasadena-based CitizensTrust.“We’re seeing a dichotomy between those who think the market is cheap – they point to low price-to- earnings multiples – and those who are looking at the slowdown on a macro-economic level,” he said.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 3.1 per cent to 1,060.27, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 2.8 per cent to 10,018.28 and the Nasdaq Composite had risen 3.1 per cent to 2,159.47.The Vix, a measure of market volatility, was down 8.4 per cent to 27.16.State Street, the Boston-based custody bank, rallied 9.9 per cent to $36.63 after pre-announcing a second-quarter operating profit that beat analysts’ estimates. Second-quarter earnings were hurt by a one-off $251m after-tax charge related to its securities lending unit.On an operating basis, the bank expects to report earnings per share of about 93 cents, stronger than average analyst expectations.The announcement provided a boost to the wider financial sector, which led the day’s rally. SunTrust Banks gained 8.2 per cent to $24.48, Fifth Third Bancorpadded 7.3 per cent to $12.92 and Bank of New York Mellon Corp was 6.4 per cent higher at $26.32.Family Dollar was the worst performer in the S&P 500 index as it dropped 8.1 per cent to $36.26 after the discount retailer forecast fiscal year-end profit of up to $2.58 per share, missing the average $2.59 estimate forecast by analysts.“The environment rem-ains challenging for consumers and customers continue to buy close to need,’’ Howard Levine, chief executive, said.AMR Corp, the parent company of American Airlines, was up 5.3 per cent to $6.74 after the company said its June load factor, a measure of the proportion of available seats that are filled, was 86.8 per cent, an increase of 1.6 percentage points from a year earlier. Traffic increased 3.2 per cent during the month.US Airways advanced 15.4 per cent to $9.32 as the airline said its passenger revenue per available seat mile had risen 22 per cent in June.Materials groups recorded a strong performance on Wednesday, led by AK Steel, which added 8.9 per cent to $12.55.United States Steel added 5.7 per cent to $40.39, Steel Dynamics moved 4.4 per cent higher to $14.06 while US-listed shares in ArcelorMittal gained 3.4 per cent to $29.08.AES Corp rallied 10.8 per cent to $9.86 as the Virginia-based power producer said it planned to buy back up to $500m of its own stock.US-listed shares in BP were 4 per cent higher at $33.19 as Tony Hayward, chief executive, visited Abu Dhabi, which is home to a range of sovereign investment vehicles and is one of the oil company’s main partners in the Middle East.The trip comes after the troubled oil company put out feelers to investment entities in the Middle East to gauge their interest in buying the group’s shares following their decline after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.FTI Consulting fell 25.7 per cent to $32.14, after touching its lowest level since February 2007.The provider of forensic accounting in cases such as Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme was downgraded to “market perform” from “outperform” at Oppenheimer and William Blair.EMC Corp, a maker of storage computers, was up 5.2 per cent to $19.11 as the company agreed to buy Greenplum, a privately held provider of data warehousing technology, for an undisclosed amount.NYSE Euronext rose 2 per cent to $27.75 even though the company’s second-
quarter earnings per share estimates were reduced to 59 cents from 64 cents by Ticonderoga Securities.Telecoms stocks were among the session’s laggards. AT&T was up 1.4 per cent to $24.33 and Verizonclimbed 1.5 per cent to $26.52."

514;STT;State Street Corp;2010-07-02T00:08:11Z;Man of the people who champions Wall St;;Consumer activists in Massachusetts tried to present Scott Brown with a BMW on Thursday. They said it suited the senator better, given his pro-Wall Street stance, than the humble man-of-the-people pick-up truck that became an icon on the campaign trail.With the House of Representatives having approved the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform bill on Wednesday night, the fate of the biggest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s now sits in the hands of the Senate and Mr Brown, who has become an unpredictable swing vote in the chamber.Mr Brown became a Republican hero in January when he defeated a weak Democratic candidate for the Massachusetts Senate seat previously occupied by Ted Kennedy. He portrayed himself as an ordinary truck-driving Joe, with the mildly titillating claim to fame of having posed (almost) naked for Cosmopolitan magazine as a law student.Now 50 years old, he has exerted a muscular influence on the Senate ever since his election, which stunned Democrats. The loss of the seat deprived the party of its 60-vote Senate supermajority and threatened to derail healthcare reform, though that was ultimately passed.Immediately after the senator’s election, Barack Obama, US president, announced a harsher approach to Wall Street – there would be a ban on banks’ proprietary trading and they would have to sell off their hedge funds and private equity firms. The White House said this had been planned for weeks and was not a response to Mr Brown’s victory. A month later, Mr Brown was branded a traitor by some conservative acolytes when he broke with his party to vote for a Democratic jobs bill. Then, in May, he joined three Republican moderates in voting for financial reform.Most of his new critics on the left have forgotten that. Mr Brown has spent the past few weeks picking the pockets of Chris Dodd, Democratic Senate banking committee chairman, to extract concessions desired by financial services companies in his state.Boston-based State Street and Fidelity are big names in Massachusetts and the companies have sought changes, according to congressional aides working on reform. But the alterations, which loosen the very restrictions proposed by Mr Obama after Mr Brown’s election, benefit a larger cadre of Wall Street interests.Thanks to Mr Brown, banks will be able to invest up to 3 per cent of their tier one capital in hedge funds and private equity firms. Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve chairman, and Carl Levin, the Democratic senator from Michigan, who pushed for an outright ban, were aghast at the changes, according to people familiar with the talks. But they were prepared to swallow them to get the legislation through Congress.The shock came when it transpired that Mr Brown was still threatening to vote No, citing a $19bn (£13bn) bank fee. Congress reconvened to remove it this week but Mr Brown is holding out on a final decision during a week’s recess. Elizabeth Weyant, a staff lawyer at the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group that tried to deliver the BMW, is a milder critic than the stunt would suggest. “We were so grateful for his vote for the Senate passage of financial reform,” she says. “I think he’s going to do the right thing for Massachusetts consumers and support Wall Street reform.”Robert Byrd, the West Virginia Democratic senator whose death last week complicated the reform vote, once said: “Many new senators come here thinking that they will quickly make their mark on the institution. Soon, however, they learn that it is the institution that makes its mark on them.” Mr Brown has been playing hard politics and quickly making his mark.
515;STT;State Street Corp;2010-06-27T14:14:44Z;Gain in weak markets with ‘minimum variance’;Minimum variance portfolios are good performers in weak markets;Equities present institutions with a paradox: asset allocation models dictate owning them in order to capture their high expected long-run returns, but the actual long run, the past 10 years, has been disastrous for pension funding ratios and endowment cash flows.One possible solution is minimum variance portfolios (MVPs), which performed well during the downturn, but managers are having a hard time convincing potential clients to commit to a limited upside in times of rising markets.Minimum variance portfolios are an invention of quantitative managers, and seek to exploit a quirk in market efficiency – that stocks with low volatility, in the right combinations, produce long-term returns equal to or better than the market.Along the way, they underperform strong markets but shine in weak ones, thus generating much lower volatility and higher Sharpe ratios (a measure that works out the reward per unit of risk) than conventional equity portfolios. Owning MVPs in the short run, however, can be frustrating: for the year ended March 2010, with the MSCI World index up 52 per cent, funds of US-based managers of MPVs fell behind their benchmarks by 15-27 percentage points.In the US, MVPs for global markets are rather new, and offered by Acadian Asset Management, State Street Global Advisors, and Analytic Asset Management. Lazard Asset Management also offers an MVP strategy, managed by two veterans of SSgA.The largest player in the field, and with the longest track record, is Unigestion of Geneva. It introduced an MVP fund for the Swiss market in 1997, followed by versions for the European, global, Japanese, US and emerging markets. The US version has beaten the S&P 500 by an average of about 300 basis points annually since inception in early 2008, with one-third less volatility. Assets in Unigestion’s MVP strategies total about $3bn (£2bn, €2.4bn). (Unigestion does not market to US customers.)To diversify the strategies’ returns, and compensate for the anticipated underperformance in rising markets, most managers add quantitative stock picks to the basic methodology for volatility control. In the case of Acadian Asset Management, for instance, its Global Managed Volatility product earned annualised returns of 1.6 percentage points above the MSCI World index for the two years ended March 2010, while the higher octane Alpha Plus version also came in ahead of the benchmark, by 3.2 percentage points.While a fair amount of empirical evidence shows that the strategies achieve what they set out to – starting 40 years ago, academics have studied the phenomenon as a refutation of the capital asset pricing model – there is less understanding of why they succeed.“The returns of these strategies are intriguing, but I’m looking for the theory that justifies them,” says Jay Kloepfer, director of capital markets and alternatives research at consultant Callan Associates in San Francisco. “I surmise that the focus on volatility captures the characteristics of value-like stocks, so these strategies may be backing into a proxy for value, rather than something radical and new.”Compared with other techniques intended to cut the volatility of equities, MVPs are less complicated, more transparent and cheaper than long-short equity hedge funds, and do not involve the options trading of buy-and-write strategies. Nonetheless they have gathered little in assets: the eVestment Alliance database reports a total for US managers of less than $2bn.Many European plans have bought into the MVP logic, however, and hold 5-8 per cent of assets in MVPs, reports Rumi Masih, head of JPMorgan’s Strategic Investment Advisory Group.Speaking of MVPs’ small client base, Mr Masih says: “I don’t think it’s so much about track records as it is the perspective on investing. MVP managers are saying, in essence, ‘We’re going to select this group of stocks only for their volatility characteristics, and completely ignore the fundamentals’,” he says.Observers also question the value of low-volatility equities in a liability-driven investment (LDI) setting (where some managers have chosen to pitch the products). If the fixed income allocation is being tailored to reduce surplus volatility, why not do the same with equities?“Some people are looking for less volatile styles within their equity allocations,” says Mr Kloepfer of Callan Associates.“MVP is a potential solution to surplus volatility,” says Mr Masih of JPMorgan, “but if you’re worried about a volatile environment, why not just hold an optimised portfolio and go long on volatility with the CBOE Vix? That’s much cheaper than giving up return by holding an MVP, or hedging a portfolio with puts.” Needless to say, JPMorgan has no plans for its own minimum variance entry.

517;STT;State Street Corp;2010-06-17T23:40:17Z;US banks seek co-investment rights;Compromises negotiated on financial reform legislation;"Banks could be permitted to invest in hedge funds alongside customers, in one of several compromises being negotiated to secure votes for financial reform, according to people familiar with talks in the US Congress.Such a change, which has been criticised by Carl Levin, a Democratic senator from Michigan, would allow an institution to make a small capital investment in a hedge fund or private equity firm to complement that of a client.The “Volcker rule”, which prevents banks from proprietary trading, also bars sponsorship and in­vestment in private pools of capital based on the argument that deposit-taking institutions should not be engaged in risky activity.But banks and some clients have told lawmakers that a minimal co-investment would provide “skin in the game” to help ensure that banks acted in the best interests of customers.No final decision has been made, but people involved said the exemption could be agreed to secure the support of Scott Brown, a Republican senator from Massachusetts, who voted in favour of a Senate reform bill last month.“For me it would be a bad mistake; it would move us in the wrong direction,” Mr Levin said on Thursday, but he declined to say whether the issue was a red line for him.Paul Volcker, who lent his name to the restrictions on banks’ relationships with hedge funds, said last week that the move would be a thin end of the wedge – heralding wider seepage between banks and private funds.Congress is in the last few days of a year-long reform effort, with a conference committee, chaired by Barney Frank, trying to merge the Senate bill with a House of Representatives version passed last year.Those crafting the final text have to find language acceptable to at least 60 senators before a vote within two weeks.On the sidelines to a rare public merger process, private talks are under way to find a response to the financial crisis that can be supported by diverse members of both parties.Mr Brown, whose victory in the election to fill the Senate seat of the late Edward Kennedy rocked the Democratic party, enjoys an unusual amount of clout for a freshman senator from the party out of power.Immediately after Mr Brown’s election Mr Obama announced the Volcker Rule in a marked toughening of his approach to Wall Street, widely believed at the time - though since denied by multiple administration officials - to be a response to the Massachussetts defeat.Mr Brown voted in favour of the Senate bill, along with a handful of Republicans, and is crucial to Democrats’ overcoming the final hurdle to getting legislation to President Barack Obama’s desk before July 4.State Street, the Massachusetts-based bank, has lobbied to be allowed the minimal co-investment, a change that would benefit other banks such as Bank of New York Mellon.Banks have argued that the proposed ban on investing in hedge funds would cost them a vital selling point with pension funds and other institutional clients. Without the ability to seed alternative-investment products, they say, they could lose clients to foreign asset managers that could still hold some “skin in the game.”“The proposed ‘Volcker rule’, while aimed at eliminating risky or speculative activity by banks, could negatively impact traditional bank asset management business,” a State Street spokeswoman said.Mr Frank has to satisfy Mr Brown and other moderates to ensure they support the final text. But he also has to satisfy Mr Levin, who wants a tough Volcker rule, Senator Blanche Lincoln, who wants a swaps spin-off rule that is hated by the banks, and Senator Susan Collins, who wants to force banks to adopt better quality capital.There is no straightforward path to the compromise that Mr Frank and Chris Dodd, the Senate banking committee chairman, are expected to deliver. But the tough ban demanded by Mr Levin, supplemented with a form of the derivatives and capital provisions desired by Ms Lincoln and Ms Collins, and a minimal co-investment desired by Mr Brown, is the latest attempt to achieve it."

519;STT;State Street Corp;2010-06-13T08:43:53Z;Ucits III manager of managers for SIG;;Strategic Investments Group is to launch a Ucits III manager of managers fund, investing in separately managed accounts run by hedge fund managers selected by Permal.“This has been created as a result of listening to our institutional clients,” said Thanos Ballos, SIG managing partner. “Everybody’s looking for a regulated, liquid, multi-adviser fund.”The Active Trading Fund will invest in managers seeking absolute returns in liquid markets. It offers weekly liquidity and is fully transparent. It will be administered by State Street, with Deutsche Bank acting as risk manager.Most of the underlying hedge fund managers do not currently run Ucits III funds, although they were all selected as running strategies that easily fit the requirements of the European directive.SIG and Permal rejected the idea of setting up a fund of Ucits funds on the grounds that relatively few hedge fund managers have gone down that path so far, so the investment universe would be too limited.“When we surveyed the universe of Ucits [hedge] funds out there, we found they were not of a standard to meet our requirements,” said Omar Kodmani, senior executive officer at Permal.In addition, managed accounts offer more control to the investor.
520;STT;State Street Corp;2010-06-06T09:50:05Z;Passive management continues to win favour;;"The UK pension market continues to follow the fundamental trends of last year, unhindered by consolidation among asset managers (PDF).The most obvious such trend is the continuing shift from active management to passive, which saw Legal & General Investment Management hold on to its top spot and BlackRock, including the assets brought in with the purchase of Barclays Global Investors, get ready to challenge it.“There’s been a bit of acceleration in that trend in ’09, as people responded to poor performance from active managers in ’08,” says Stephen Birch, head of manager research at consultancy Hymans Robertson.He has stopped predicting an end to these flows. “Every year for the past three or four we’ve said flows into passive can’t continue at this pace, and every year we’ve been wrong.”L&G managed £220.9bn (€264.7bn, $323bn) for UK pension funds at the end of 2009, a jump of one fifth in a year, just slightly more than the rise in the FTSE 100 over the same period.BlackRock has jumped from fifth to second place with £188.9bn, having effectively bought this position with the acquisition of Barclays Global Investors,
second ranked last year.Because of the acquisition and changes in the BlackRock/BGI methodologies for counting UK pension fund assets, last year’s figures are not comparable. Leen Meijaard, head of continental Europe institutional business at BlackRock, says the combined businesses grew by £38.3bn on a comparable basis, or just over 25 per cent. Of this, he attributes £20bn to market movements, with the remaining £18.3bn accounted for by new flows.BlackRock’s positioning has been excellent in terms of the industry trends; the legacy BGI business has not only seen flows into its passive funds but it also won a number of large liability driven investment mandates. The BlackRock side of the business was not a bystander, however, since it picked up significant amounts of assets as pension funds reallocated from equities to bonds.Consultant Towers Watson says the number of bond mandates awarded by its clients worldwide rose by 50 per cent in 2009, accelerating a trend already visible the previous year.Fixed income behemoth Pimco, which has not traditionally been an enormous player among UK pension funds, saw a 30 per cent jump in assets managed for them in 2009, with £12.6bn by the end of the year.Allowing BlackRock to stand in for the erstwhile BGI, the order of the top three is unchanged, with LDI specialist Insight Investment Management tagging along after the two leaders with a little-changed £69.4bn. This seemingly static figure covers as complicated a story as that of BlackRock, because Insight joined the BNY Mellon stable during the year after its parent HBOS merged with Lloyds TSB and decided to offload the asset manager. In the process Insight handed back some £42bn of assets it used to manage for its parent HBOS. This is now managed by Scottish Widows Investment Partnerships.Of that £42bn, around a quarter belonged to pension funds, which explains the outflows from Insight’s pooled funds. These were offset by strong flows into segregated funds, mostly Insight’s speciality liability-driven investment products, which grew by 22.5 per cent.Jon Little, vice-chairman of new parent BNY Mellon Asset Management, is sanguine about these flows, pointing out the new business is significantly higher margin than the in-house money managed for HBOS.The Insight deal triggered a change in the survey results, as BNY Mellon previously lumped all of its managers together but now lists them separately. Three other BNY Mellon companies have increased their UK pension assets, Newton by 12.9 per cent to £19bn, Walter Scott by 28.9 per cent to £2.7bn and Pareto by 6 per cent to £660m.The exception was Mellon Capital Management, a quant hedge fund manager from which UK pension funds withdrew nearly half the assets allocated following poor performance in 2008.Although passive managers have done well, many active managers are bouncing back from a difficult year in 2008. It is noticeable, however, that several of this year’s winners were those that managed to cling on last year without drastic drops. Standard Life, for example, has climbed from eighth to fourth position with a 21.5 per cent jump to £50.3bn, after its assets slipped just 4.4 per cent in 2008, while M&G grew its UK pension fund assets by a third in 2009, after remaining virtually static the previous year.Aberdeen Asset Management was an exception to the rule. Having gained 3.3 per cent in 2008, it lost a fifth of its UK pension fund assets in 2009. The company attributed this to a combination of three factors: poor performance in its fixed income products over 2008; the switch from active to passive; and a switch out of fixed income to equities as the markets recovered.“We didn’t perform that well during 2008 and people either moved to another fixed income active manager or went passive,” says James Thorneley, communications manager.Industry commentators point also to high turnover in Aberdeen’s fixed income team. One head of fixed income, Steve Ilott, left in September 2008 to join Bluecrest, while his successor Gary Bartlett lasted just six months, being eventually replaced by Paul Griffiths, who came on board with the acquisition of the asset management business of Credit Suisse.Both State Street Global Advisors and Hermes Fund Managers continued to lose ground, with SSgA’s UK pension assets slipping 12.5 per cent to £30.9bn and Hermes 10 per cent to £23.9bn. The duo were in fifth and seventh place respectively. AllianceBernstein, which lost more than 40 per cent of its assets in 2008, shed a further 30 per cent in 2009, bringing its total down to £13.2bn."
521;STT;State Street Corp;2010-05-16T14:45:11Z;Kovacevich hits out at Tarp;;The decision by US regulators to force the nation’s nine largest banks to accept $125bn in taxpayer funds during the financial crisis of 2008 did not restore confidence in the banking system, but undermined it, Richard Kovacevich, former chief executive of Wells Fargo, has said.At a time when the US Treasury is touting an expected repayment, at a profit, of $245bn from the troubled asset relief programme, Mr Kovacevich disputes conventional wisdom that the bail-out was a success. “People are high-fiving each other and bragging about restoring health to the banks”, Mr Kovacevich told the Financial Times, adding: “Baloney.”In his first public comments on the matter, Mr Kovacevich said the decision in 2008 to force the nation’s biggest banks, including his own, to accept Tarp funds eroded confidence in the system.The former Wells Fargo chief, who stepped down as chairman at the end of 2009, agrees in principle with the notion of government extending temporary help to some banks but said the programme forced on him and other banks exacerbated the industry’s problems because it did not distinguish between healthy banks and troubled ones.At a hastily called meeting in Washington DC on October 13 2008, then-Treasury secretary Hank Paulson told the heads of nine top banks that they needed to accept government funds.Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo all received $25bn. Bank of America received $15bn, and $10bn was reserved for Merrill Lynch, which had agreed to be acquired by BofA. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley each received $10bn, and Bank of New York/Mellon and State Street received $5bn between them. Mr Kovacevich objected to the programme at the time, saying investors would conclude every bank receiving bail-out funds was in trouble.Mr Kovacevich told the FT that this was borne out by the share price of Wells Fargo and other banks falling almost 80 per cent from the time the programme was announced until early March 2009. Wells Fargo’s stock dropped from $33 per share to $7.80 but has since come back.“Do you know how many innocent shareholders of ours sold at these bottoms?” said Mr Kovacevich. “These are people who are retired, owned Wells Fargo stock for 40 years and depended on it for dividends. “Thousands and thousands of people sold. And who made money? The shorts on the way down, who then went long because they knew it was oversold. Who lost? The retail investor who doesn’t understand how this worked. That’s the calamity of this thing.”

services signings.First-quarter profit was $1.97 per share from $1.70 per share a year earlier, compared with average analyst expectations of $1.93 per share.Procter & Gamble, the consumer products company, shed 0.1 per cent to $63.19 after it said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 9.5 per cent to 48.18 cents per share.Delta Air Lines dropped 0.2 per cent to $13.16 after the airline reported mixed first-quarter results with lower-than-expected revenues but a drop in losses from previous quarters.The largest carrier by passenger numbers lost $256m, or $0.31 per share, in the quarter to March, compared with a $794m, or $0.96, loss in the same period the previous year.Revenues climbed 2.5 per cent to $6.85bn, helped by rising fares, more bag-checking and fuller planes, but fell short of analyst forecasts of $7bn.Coca-Cola lost 1.5 per cent to $54.47 as the soft drinks company reported quarterly results that missed average analyst estimates, hurt by a decline in North American sales volumes. Revenues in the first quarter rose 5 per cent to $7.53bn, but fell short of the analysts’ average estimate of $7.72bn.Health insurer UnitedHealth Group lost 0.8 per cent to $30.98 even after the company posted first-quarter earnings that rose 21 per cent on the same period a year ago, beating analyst estimates. The company said rising Medicare enrolment offset losses in private-sector plans.Regional lenders were also in focus. US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon both beat earnings expectations. US Bancorp was up 2.2 per cent to $28.21, while BNY Mellon, was up slightly to $32.15.PNC Financial, which sold a unit earlier this year to BNY, was up 2.2 per cent to $64.92.But regional depository banks were some of the biggest fallers of the session after lacklustre earnings reports from two companies. State Street fell 4.2 per cent to $45.28 after it said earnings in the first quarter were in line with expectations but revenues disappointed.Smaller rival Northern Trust lost 5.1 per cent to $55.37. Earnings per share were 64 cents, compared to average analyst estimates of 71 cents per share.Motorbike maker Harley-Davidson was one of the top risers in the S&P 500 index as the company jumped 7.3 per cent to $35.17 after posting better-than-expected first-quarter results."
523;STT;State Street Corp;2010-04-11T11:52:34Z;US pension funds play safe with passive;;"US pension funds, which generally increased their weightings to passive, or index-like investments, during the market downturn, are likely to stay parked in passive investments for the foreseeable future as memories of the crisis are still fresh in their minds.While passive investing seemed to be the safe play in 2008 – when most stock picking portfolios tanked – active portfolios have now begun to beat their benchmarks, sometimes by hefty amounts, says one industry observer.“The general trend has reversed,” says Jane Li, manager of investment management and research at multi manager platform operator FundQuest, explaining that active managers tend to outperform their respective benchmarks in bull markets.That does not mean pension plans have taken that statement to heart, however, as there have been a slew of institutions that have recently awarded large sums of money to passive managers.Recent examples include the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation, which handed State Street Global Advisors $1.3bn (£857m, €974m) in passive mandates, as well as the San Jose (Calif.) Police and Fire Department Retirement Plan, which moved more than $250m of active large-cap equities into passive products.And other large state funds are looking to add more passive to their mix, including the $100bn Florida State Board of Administration and the $5bn New Hampshire Retirement
System.Florida, for its part, is considering adding to its already passive-heavy US equity portfolio by taking from traditional active managers as well as its enhanced equity portfolio. The fund, which is also looking at doing the same for its non-US equity allocation, already has a US equity portfolio that allocates over 80 per cent to passive investments.New Hampshire, meanwhile, was recently advised by its institutional consultant, NEPC, to park 100 per cent of its large-cap equity portfolio with passive managers, while allocating 100 per cent of its small and mid-cap portfolios with active managers.And it is not just US pensions going the passive route. The UK’s Royal Dutch Shell pension fund, with $15.9bn in assets, recently chose to scale back its active stakes in favour of increased exposure to passive.This recent trend of pension funds investing with passive managers is a continuation of what has been occurring over the past two years. According to data released by eVestment Alliance and Casey Quirk and Associates, passive funds were the only space that saw positive inflows over the one-year period ending September 30. The paper, which looked into global assets and flows, broke down the groups into four risk categories: index, structured, active and aggressive. Indices took in $109bn over that timeframe, while active funds suffered large outflows. Specifically, structured funds, considered a less risky asset class, had $54bn in outflows, active strategies took a $111bn hit and aggressive products lost $149bn.Despite this news, one Neuberger Berman executive feels a move toward active investing could be around the corner.“One of the things you see happening from institutional investors is a re- examining of their overall asset allocation as they figure out what the proper active/passive [allocation] is,” says Matthew Rubin, director of investment strategy. At this point institutional investors are still in the midst of a post-crisis evaluation, Mr Rubin says. “In the long-term, though, they’ll be back to active,” he concludes.But this frame of mind has not stopped some of the largest asset managers in the world from weighing the possibilities of adding to their passive capabilities.Invesco, for one, recently expressed interest in adding institutional passive strategies to its product mix. Chief financial officer Loren Starr, speaking at a recent financial services conference, said his company was “paying attention” to the positives and negatives of offering such strategies.“[One] area that’s interesting [to us], but is not one that we have historically pursued is [passive indexing],” said Mr Starr. “On the institutional side, we’ve seen a lot of institutional players go to index. I hate to give credit to competitors, but we have to because I think it was an interesting move with [Barclays] and BlackRock to have that capability.UBS Global Asset Management, which already has some in-house passive strategies, is also looking to grow in the passive space. Chief executive John Fraser recently stated that he is looking to bolster his firm’s passive capabilities through acquisition or team lift out.

524;STT;State Street Corp;2010-04-09T12:40:02Z;An asset that still attracts active players;;"The currency thesis is simple. Active currency managers should be able to outperform because the foreign exchange market is highly inefficient owing to activity by central banks and treasury departments that are not trading for profit.Institutional investors have bought the argument that currency is an area where active managers can add value for the better part of the decade. A few years ago many managers were performing well, and demand grew steadily. More recently, performance has been mixed, but those other big attractions of currency – its liquidity and low correlation to other asset classes – have become the focus of
attention.“Investors pick FX as an asset class because they believe they can generate alpha [outperformance], and secondly, because they believe it is new alpha, uncorrelated to other sources of return,” says Elizabeth Para, currency investment strategist at Overlay Asset Management.“It is the world’s largest and deepest market and all those traditional arguments about its inefficiencies remain unchanged. Not all the market activity is profit-maximising, which leaves something on the table for speculators.”The market, however, was badly burned in 2008 when many currency managers lost money, particularly quantitative managers who relied heavily on carry trade strategies – borrowing in low interest currencies and going long in high interest currencies.Carry trade strategies tend to perform well over the long term, but decline rapidly when macro-economic or financial uncertainty is elevated. Managers moved away from carry towards other strategies such as momentum, volatility trading and valuation. The emphasis since has been on passive hedging to protect against adverse changes in exchange rates, driven also by increased currency volatility and nervousness at a time when the international exposure of many investors has never been higher.Collin Crownover, managing director and head of currency management for State Street Global Advisors, says instead of maximising return, investors want to protect on the downside.Jaco Rouw, senior investment manager global FX at ING Investment Management says: “It was quite quiet across the market in 2009. There has not been a big shift from carry to other strategies so much as a general reduction in allocations to alternatives reflecting a more cautious appetite.”Recently managers have been reporting a slight upturn in active mandates. Managed accounts have become more popular, reflecting their advantages in limiting liability. The assets and cash are kept separate from those of other institutions, facilitating transparency and reducing the likelihood of fraud. Management changes can also be quickly implemented. Nigel Rayment, portfolio manager at JPMorgan Chase, believes the segregated stand-alone approach is more appropriate for this asset class as a whole because clients can take a more tailored approach, reflecting their individual risk return objectives, constraints and opportunity sets. Pooled funds are now firmly established as a solution, particularly for small pension schemes that lack governance capacity. Pooled fund vehicles also provide limited liability, compared with investing directly via currency overlays, which can impact cash flows when currencies fluctuate rapidly and payments are required to settle outstanding positions.A flurry of rule-based index products have been launched using investable indices from houses such as Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Deutsche and Citigroup. These are largely stylised investments based on interest rate levels and designed to mimic carry trade strategies. Most of the indices are based on currency futures contracts on certain G10 currencies but their compositions differ markedly.Some smaller investors might prefer these stylised products if they find it difficult to access an active currency manager, and many users are quite active traders themselves. “The problem with these products is that they are sold as static products, unable to adapt to changing conditions,” says Ms Para. “If the market moves against the investor, and that can happen very quickly, the only thing the investor can do is to sell the notes. There is no manager sitting behind it.”The carry trade has also picked up again this year, amid much discussion about its correlation to equity risk premia.“2008 saw currency market losses that largely coincided with the equity markets falls, but these two things can co-trend without being correlated – it doesn’t mean they are interdependent,” argues Ms Para.“The financial crisis was exceptional though, and normally investors are correct to expect uncorrelated returns from their currency strategies. One positive characteristic of currency markets that was proven to be critically important to investors was their liquidity, because investors were able to exit their currency positions and funds; that was not always possible in other alternative strategies.”The Japanese yen is still probably the weakest country-specific currency, compounded by the Japanese policy to keep the yen down to boost exports and dreadful fundamentals around the nation’s balance sheet and demographic trends.Currency specialists are generally more upbeat about the dollar’s prospects short term, than long term, owing to the high level of debt in the US. The euro is expected to weaken against the dollar as the year goes on, but most managers are surprisingly bullish on sterling, notwithstanding the political uncertainty ahead of the general election and the impact of the phasing out of quantitative easing.Some of the best return opportunities are in emerging markets but managers are pretty well split in their views about the attractions and disadvantages of exposure to emerging market currencies. “We trade G7 currencies [only] because we think we have a handle on measuring market risk,” says Chris Cruden, chief executive of Insch. “If you start trading other types, you end up with other types of risk. By adding these currencies we could easily convince ourselves that we were just adding to diversification and potential return. In fact we would only be adding risk.”JPMorgan Chase, by contrast, is promoting a more global approach. “Diversification is the philosophy, across different processes, time-frames and currencies,” says Mr Rayment.“We allocate a good proportion to emerging markets in our unconstrained offering and that will only increase in time. In my view, the opportunity is very great. We look at a basket of 20 currencies and this does produce strong diversification.”At ING Investment Management, Mr Rouw attributes some 50 per cent of the manager’s performance to highly active positioning in certain emerging market currencies. ING takes a diversified approach with theme-driven top-down investment in the G10 and liquid emerging market currencies accounting for another 25 per cent of performance, and carry trade accounting for the remaining 25 per cent.The group view is that their emerging market activity sets them apart – but Mr Rouw says emerging markets are becoming more liquid and their fiscal debt and current account positions are often better than developed markets.There may also be a trend to use local expertise in certain markets. Anton Tabakh, senior analyst, fixed-income instruments at Troika Dialog, the private investment bank in the Commonwealth of Independent States, says: “Our market is relatively small so we see foreign investors looking to invest in currency, and choosing local managers who in many cases have more expertise and a better legal framework to facilitate the process.”"

526;STT;State Street Corp;2010-02-28T08:52:33Z;Asian pensions sector holds huge opportunities;;"For global asset managers eyeing expansion in Asia, the most attractive targets have traditionally been the region’s hordes of retail investors. But managers should not overlook the region’s $747bn (£490bn, €550bn) pension sector, says a new report from Cerulli Associates, which predicts that investable Asia ex-Japan pension assets will grow 55 per cent by 2013 to about $1,150bn.Over the longer term, the sector is expected to present fund managers with an even more significant asset-gathering opportunity.“This is because much of Asia will age dramatically in the next few decades, creating substantial demographic pressure,” Cerulli says.Nearly 20 per cent of Asia’s population is forecast to be over 65 by 2050 – up from just 6.3 per cent in 2005.Governments will have to boost retirement savings and pension fund performance, Cerulli says, providing a growing role for professional fund management and overseas exposure.Many of the world’s biggest asset managers have already established footholds in Asia, winning mandates from institutions such as South Korea’s $225.6bn National Pension Fund. One big attraction is that pension funds have a much lower churn rate than mutual funds offered to retail investors.“We see the pension sector in the region as a hugely significant opportunity,” says Kelly Driscoll, senior managing director in Asia ex-Japan at State Street Global Advisors.Yet the region’s pension sector is not without its challenges.For a start, its profitability is often poor, Cerulli says, especially compared with the retail sector, which is some $300bn-$400bn larger and tends to offer fatter fees and margins.“Profitability will take some time to improve, despite quickening pension reform,” Cerulli says. “But managers must invest time and money now, and shoulder low profitability, if they want to make the most of the Asia ex-Japan pension opportunity.”Cerulli also recommends that global asset managers should target the pension sector as just one element in a wider institutional book as the region’s retirement marketplace is too immature to sustain a standalone strategy.“Firms need to evaluate carefully the state of their business in Asia before committing further resources to expansion in the pension sector, given its developmental stage,”
Cerulli cautions.One of the biggest challenges is that national pension provision across Asia is diverse and fragmented, in terms of geography, regulation, and ease of market access. Each government in the region has a different approach to managing their pension funds, which means that asset managers must come up with separate offerings for each country.“Because a lot of [countries] are evolving or moving to a new system or developing new schemes, there are a lot of uncertainties,” says Ken Yap, head of Asia-Pacific research at Cerulli in Singapore.In addition, industry figures say that many Asian pension funds are more demanding than their counterparts in Europe and the US, in terms of both the quality of service expected and the fees they expect to pay.Besides managing money, global asset managers are often asked to provide training programmes for pension fund employees, especially when a fund is investing in a new asset class for the first time.By and large, Asian pension funds outside of Japan and Australia remain focused on the traditional asset classes of equities and bonds, typically with a bias towards local markets. And when they award mandates to foreign asset managers, it tends to be big global players with a track record in the region.Industry figures believe that over time these pension funds will expand their reach into alternative asset classes and will become more open to business with boutique asset managers.One of the debates among global asset managers is whether to do business across Asia from the financial hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore, or whether to go through the expensive process of establishing domestic operations in each target country.Patrice Conxicoeur, head of institutional business in Asia at HSBC Global Asset Management, believes that having a local presence across Asia provides the group with an edge over many competitors. “We’re a multinational corporation, but in each of those countries we try as much as possible to be a local player,” Mr Conxicoeur says.Competition within the pension sector is getting tougher, he adds. When a large pension fund in the region issues a request for proposal, or RFP, for a global fixed income or equity mandate, he says, the pension fund will often receive more than 50 responses – out of which just two managers would get hired."
527;STT;State Street Corp;2010-02-28T08:27:05Z;SWFs take the passive path;;"Sovereign wealth funds are increasingly embracing passive investment strategies and turning their back on active management, according to figures from State Street Global Advisors.A study of a dozen European, Middle Eastern and Asian SWFs, which all use SSGA for asset management or custody and administration services, found they were operating just 11 active mandates in September 2009, down from 15 in December 2008, while the number of passive or enhanced mandates had risen from 14 to 16.John Nugée, senior managing director in SSGA’s official institutions group, said SWFs had been influenced by the debate in Norway, where detailed analysis of the country’s NKr2,500bn (£277bn, €310bn, $421bn) Government Pension Fund found active management had added little value.“The Norwegian analysis will have been read by others and they are saying ‘we will use active management, but only where we have reason to believe it will add value, not as the default’,” said Mr Nugée.“For sovereign wealth funds to increase the active proportion of their funds something is going to have to change their thinking. The status quo is that the attractions of passive investment have been demonstrated and are chiming with the way an increasing number of SWFs are viewing the world.”The value of equity mandates held by the 12 SWFs rose 64 per cent to $53.1bn between December 2008 and September 2009, outstripping the bounce in markets.However, some funds are thinking more deeply about how these mandates should be structured; one Middle Eastern SWF asked SSGA to construct an equity portfolio inversely correlated to oil prices to act as a hedge against any fall in the value of its oil reserves.Some of the SWFs also issued fixed income mandates for the first time, a factor Mr Nugée attributed to a desire for more liquid investments.According to Mr Nugée, SWFs are also grappling with the thorny issue of whether or not they should engage with their investee companies.Governments are pushing institutional investors to step up engagement in the wake of the financial crisis, but Asian and Middle Eastern SWFs are wary of being seen to be seeking political control of the companies they invest in.“SWFs are in a slightly difficult position,” said Mr Nugée. “Their current stance is one of extreme passivity; not exercising votes or taking up directorships they are entitled to. But they are saying they do accept the comments Sir David Walker [a UK advocate for improved corporate governance] and others are making."
528;STT;State Street Corp;2010-02-28T07:57:05Z;Money funds remain key despite the exodus;;As investor confidence came back in the spring of 2009, money market funds posted enormous outflows. It was not as devastating for the industry as it could have been because the previous year and even 2007 saw huge inflows courtesy of the worst financial crisis in decades. Yet stubbornly low yields and a less frightening stock market have resulted in a continued investor exodus from money markets.In spite of the outflows, money market funds remain important to investors, particularly institutions that have set allocations to cash and liabilities that need to be paid promptly. They are also key for other types of investors as sources of liquidity and low risk in turbulent climates.The outflows themselves have come primarily from American retail investors, while institutions, especially those in Europe, have largely maintained their cash holdings.Kathleen Hughes, head of global liquidity for Europe, Middle East and Africa at JPMorgan Asset Management, describes the situation as a “tale of two continents”, and argues that it is not necessarily a bad thing for her business that investors are putting their cash to work. She says there has been continued interest, predominantly from European institutions, for funds that offer stable, short-term value. “Investors with high allocations to cash, such as hedge funds, retail investors and private groups, have rotated into risk. However, the true institutional investor doesn’t have a lot of options. They have to hold cash,” says Ms Hughes.However, with money market funds effectively offering zero returns, investors in cash are looking at ways they can reduce the cost of parking their assets in money market funds and maximise the returns.Some are opting for cash vehicles offering higher yields, but money market fund managers say promises of high returns in this market should be a red flag. They are reluctant to put a number on what type of yield is appropriate in this environment, but suggest conservative expectations are the way forwards.Matthew Tatnell, manager of liquidity funds at Aviva Investors, says there are few safe ways to increase yields from cash funds in the current environment. “You can put a bit of duration into the fund and some credit risk,” says Mr Tatnell.“Some even have small allocations to floating rate notes, but then this increases the liquidity risk and credit risk, so you have to be aware of that.”Most investors are trimming their expectations for cash returns and refocusing on the risk management aspect of their cash allocations. There is a strong focus on transparency and risk management, whereas a few years ago this would have been an afterthought.Ms Hughes says while JPMAM has always had a risk management system in place, it is only recently that investors have wanted to know everything about it.Mr Tatnell adds that investors are no longer relying on a triple A rating and are demanding full disclosure of a fund’s holdings and strategy.Steve Meier, executive vice-president of State Street Global Advisors and global cash chief investment officer, says: “We’ve all learned painful lessons. There’s no free lunch out there.“When liquidity dries up, it dries up for everyone.”Some managers report a move away from pooled money market funds by institutional investors in favour of segregated accounts.This has been triggered largely by the introduction of tighter investment guidelines drawn up in the wake of the financial crisis.These restrict the maturity profile of investments funds can hold and stipulate greater liquidity so funds can meet redemption requests.Such restrictions reduce the already low returns funds can offer, so investors that do not have immediate liquidity requirements are turning to segregated accounts as a means of maximising returns while managing risk.Additional reporting by Steve Johnson
529;STT;State Street Corp;2010-02-14T10:54:58Z;Asset manager ‘super brands’ are on their way;;Asset manager “super brands” will emerge in Europe under Ucits IV, the revised rules for cross-border funds, according to a report by State Street.As master-feeder structures and fund mergers allow for greater cost-savings, asset manager tie-ups are also likely to become more appealing as a way to make cost-saving synergies, the report finds.“The directive supports the ongoing evolution towards efficiency and will lead to certain large-scale brands emerging,” says William Slattery, country head of Ireland and managing director at State Street.This development is already under way in some parts of Europe. Managers that are “domestic at their core” are beginning to look at potential ways they can expand their brand to other jurisdictions after the directive is rolled out in 2011.“If you look at individual countries, you can see the embryonic formation of some large-scale brands,” he says.Several managers have made such inroads. The tie-up between Crédit Agricole Asset Management and Société Générale Asset Management last year led to the creation of Europe’s third-largest asset manager, Amundi, which has €650bn (£574bn, $894bn) of assets under management.Elsewhere, Deutsche Bank’s acquisition of ailing wealth manager Sal Oppenheim was the third-largest M&A transaction to be completed last year, according to Jefferies & Company.By far the largest transaction, however, was BlackRock’s acquisition of Barclays Global Investors in June. As a result, BlackRock has $3,300bn of assets under management and a significant presence in Europe both in assets and on the ground.Manager acquisitions will continue to be “very attractive” in helping aid efficiencies, says Mr Slattery. “The financial crisis has given impetus to M&A activity and certain managers specialising in or offering certain products. Disposals in certain cases are being encouraged and have played a part in how the market has evolved,” he says.One of the main purposes of Ucits IV is to address some of the inefficiencies that exist in Europe, outlines State Street in its report Ucits IV: The Path to Greater Efficiency.Ucits assets have grown to almost €4,800bn since the first Ucits directive in 1985, and 40 per cent of Ucits funds are sold outside Europe.However, according to research from the European Commission, funds in Europe are, on average, five times smaller than in the US, yet cost around twice as much to manage. More than half (54 per cent) of Ucits funds have assets of less than €50m, meaning most have insufficient scale to justify their cost.Similar inefficiencies were highlighted in separate figures from PwC. According to the consultant, 50 per cent of the top 30 asset management groups in terms of cross-border distribution have existing management companies in four jurisdictions or more.Tim Caverly, executive vice-president at State Street, says: “Those firms that can launch products that differentiate, and those that have strong distribution models, will be the most successful developing their brand.“Some markets, such as Italy, are open to Luxembourg and Dublin funds while others, such as France, still look towards domestic products. Those looking to distribute across Europe will probably keep their products domestic but use offshore centres as a global distribution centre.“We are likely to see firms that are domestic at their core, but want to expand their brand and export it. A lot of what is in Ucits IV will allow them to do that.”Bank of New York Mellon’s £235m acquisition of Insight Investment in the UK last year offers potential for the group to increase its brand in Europe.“Ucits IV will change the structure of the European market,” says Paul Feeney, head of international distribution at BNY Mellon Asset Management.“One of the most important aspects of Ucits IV is the master-feeder proposal and the ability to merge cross-border fund ranges.“At the moment, it’s not ideal that managers have to set up in another country in order to do business there. Ucits IV should slowly start to pull down those walls and we will see more feeder funds being set up, along with greater consolidation of fund ranges.”David Ricketts is a reporter on Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication where this article first appeared
530;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;State Street settles over subprime disclosure;;State Street on Thursday reached a $313m settlement with federal and state regulators over allegations that it misled investors about their exposure to subprime mortgages heading into the credit crisis.The Securities and Exchange Commission had accused the Boston-based bank of providing some investors in its $3bn Limited Duration Bond Fund with more information than others, allowing the better-informed investors to sell their holdings before the fund plunged in value.“State Street sold the most liquid assets in the fund to meet redemption demands, which left the more uninformed clients holding illiquid investments,” said David Bergers, director of the SEC’s Boston regional office, which led the investigation.Mr Bergers said more than 250 investors, including charities and employee retirement plans, lost money as a result of State Street’s alleged misconduct.According to the SEC complaint, which was filed in Boston federal court, State Street initially marketed its Limited Duration Bond Fund, which was launched in 2002, as a safe alternative to a money market fund.Beginning in 2007, the suit contends, State Street sent some investors misleading information about how the turmoil in the subprime market would affect the fund, which by then had invested heavily in bonds backed by first-lien mortgages to high-risk borrowers.The fund failed to disclose such investments or its use of leverage in marketing materials.As a result, many investors believed they had limited exposure to subprime securities.State Street provided more detailed information to its internal advisory groups, which then urged clients, including the group’s pension plan, to liquidate their holdings.Between July and August 2007, State Street raised almost $700m in cash to meet expected investor redemption demands by selling almost all of the fund’s AAA rated bonds, even though such bonds were only a fifth of its asset value at the time.Ronald Logue, State Street chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that the company was committed to working with regulators to resolve their concerns.As part of the settlement, State Street neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing.The company said previous litigation reserves were sufficient to cover the settlement costs. In addition to $50m in fines and disgorgement fees, the costs include $10m each to the Massachusetts secretary of state and the attorney-general, both of which participated in the investigation.The settlement announced on Thursday follows $350m that State Street has already agreed to pay to settle private lawsuits, including one brought by Prudential Financial in 2007, bringing the total amount to $663m.Since the allegations surfaced, a number of high-profile executives have left the company, including the chief North American investment officer and the global head of fixed income.

PNC also said it would sell $3bn of common stock and as much as $2bn of senior notes to pay back federal aid.Jim Palermo, the co-chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon Asset Servicing, said he expects to see other banks make similar deals in the months ahead.“We think there is a fairly high likelihood that this type of consolidation will continue,” Mr Palermo said.Tom McKelvey, the chief operating officer of Capco, a financial consulting firm, said that banks, unlike companies in other industries that outsourced or slimmed down years ago, continued to own too much of the supply chain.“We are talking to a number of our clients about selling large components of their businesses,” he said.Mr McKelvey said that back-office functions such as reconciliation, syndication and settlement activities will increasingly reside with third parties who specialise in those areas, much the way Visa and Mastercard process credit card transactions but do not make loans.He said that only the nation’s six largest banks have scale in syndicated lending, making that an area ripe for divestiture by smaller players.State Street Corporation recently spent $1.87bn to acquire the securities services business of Intesa Sanpaolo, the large Italian banking group.And Citigroup this month sold its technology services division to India’s Wipro for $127m. Other banks that have sold back-office operations in recent years include Fifth Third Bank, Marshall & Ilsley and Synovus.Standard & Poor’s analyst Erik Oja said that in a better economy banks would prefer to keep their back-office operations, because they lessen their dependence on earning money through lending activities. “But in this economy, you are going to see more banks look to sell,” he said.A PNC spokesman pointed out that its sale of the back-office division, which handles processing for financial advisers, fund managers and brokers, was a strategic decision that was not simply motivated by financial concerns.He added that increasing its capital base and repaying Tarp were among the bank’s priorities this year.S&P’s Oja estimates that PNC will be able to repay the bulk of its Tarp funds by the end of this year, saving it $388m beginning in 2011.As a result, he raised his 2011 earnings estimate to $5.24 per share from $5.03 per share.PNC shares were down 1.83 per cent at $54.84 in afternoon trading.
532;STT;State Street Corp;2010-01-31T09:44:28Z;Negative report sparks heated debate;;The use of ETF’s is growing markedly around the world, and institutions have been some of the most enthusiastic investors.However, in recent weeks a report by consultants Towers Watson suggested this enthusiasm was not merited.The report’s main claims were that ETFs had higher fees than traditional passive mandates, offered inferior and more expensive tax structures, and carried excessive counterparty risk. It was also critical of a market that it believes is saturated with too many similar products, rather than fostering innovation.In short, the consultant said: “The vast majority of ETFs are an unattractive long-term investment option for most institutional investors.”The report was immediately rejected by ETF providers, who disputed nearly every word of it. State Street Global Advisors responded with a glowing report on why institutions were increasingly buying ETFs, claiming that tax structures were actually more advantageous via these vehicles.One of the most vehement critics of the report was Hector McNeil, ETF Securities’ managing partner, who pointed out that the report’s main author was senior investment consultant Chris Sutton, who formerly headed iShares Europe.In fact a few years ago, when in the iShares role Mr Sutton said: “We have seen our business grow from strength to strength in the last five months, which is a good indicator that we are providing the right products to investors.”Yet now, despite denying doing so, he has apparently changed his mind. Some providers ask if this is because he now works for a consultantcy that offers services that are undercut by ETFs. Mr Sutton emphasises he is in no way against institutional use of ETFs, and that he is merely arguing that in some situations they are not the optimal vehicle for certain investors.One of his main points concerned cost. Mr Sutton says there are plenty of passive products available that are cheaper than ETFs and have better tax positions for institutions.This claim was rejected by Nizam Hamid, head of sales strategy for iShares Europe. Mr Hamid says total ownership costs with ETFs are lower when one factors in spreads and revenues that ETFs can gain through securities lending.He says: “Passive funds have low expenses, but a lot of those mandates have high costs to go in and out. The ETF management fee may be higher than a passive mandate, but ETF spreads are much lower, so the two counteract each other.“The institutions are big users and they understand the costs. They are not naïve users of the product.”Mr McNeil adds: “An ETF can sell any minute. You might spend more on fees, but don’t forget that if the market moves overnight, you cannot exit until the day after with a passive fund. The only price is NAV.”Indeed, the report also underlined its concerns that securities lending and counterparty risk were problematic. This point generated the most ire from the providers. The report said ETF sponsors had “embedded” large amounts of counterparty risk inside their products through significant levels of stock lending and swap usage. Mr Sutton was not convinced that investors were adequately compensated for taking such risks.Mr McNeil points out that the vast majority of ETFs can be tracked daily and are wholly transparent and based on physical underlying assets. The stock lending that went on in ETFs, he argues, is not different from that of a swap product.He says: “The counterparty risk argument is nonsense. Any fund is governed by the same rules.”However, where there is some consensus on the report is on its arguments over ETFs for long-term investing. Even the providers admit that investors holding on to assets for more than two years would probably be better off choosing a passive fund than an ETF.Mr Hamid says that in any case most institutions are already using ETFs as short-term vehicles, where funds might want to make a small venture into a new region or type of asset.He says: “Once an investor is past 18 months, then the cost-benefit ratio favours a passive mandate. But in a shorter term allocation the cost of ownership is lower with an ETF. The time frame is important.”Towers Watson concedes that in the short term, or for an institution experimenting with a new asset class, an ETF is perhaps the better vehicle, adding that ETFs are useful tools for “transition and exposure management”.
533;STT;State Street Corp;2010-01-31T09:43:40Z;Advisers give sector a boost in Australia;;Exchange traded funds are relatively new for Australian investors and their rapid uptake in the past two years is being driven by their popularity among retail investors and the financial planners who advise them.Institutions have traded ETFs internationally for some time through global platforms, but from 2001 State Street Global Advisors was the only provider of ETFs on the Australian market before being joined by iShares, then owned by Barclays Global Investors, now part of BlackRock, in October 2007.Vanguard is the other provider, having entered the market in May 2009, and speculation surrounds the potential entry of Pimco, perhaps later this year.Since 2007, in particular, ETFs have been embraced by a market that had grown wary of some other listed management investments, most notably the real estate investment trust sector, which slumped 54 per cent in value over 2007 to 2008, according to figures from the Australian Securities Exchange.ASX data on the ETF sector tells an entirely different story. In November 2007, 19 funds had a market capitalisation of A$95m (£53m, €60m, $85m) and by November 2008 the number of funds had grown to 21 and the market capitalisation to A$1.1bn. Growth spiked 161 per cent in 2009, with the market capitalisation at $2.9bn and with 25 funds offered.It was a similar story in the related exchange traded commodity space, with the market capitalisation up 39 per cent over 2009 to A$635m.Although this is strong growth, particularly coming off a market downturn, Robyn Laidlaw, ETF product manager at Vanguard Investments, concedes it is early days yet for ETFs in Australia.She says that while volumes are going up, the number of trades is negligible compared with the Reit sector for example, where investors have long experience with the products. A survey conducted last year for ETC provider ETF Securities found that only 23 per cent of investors surveyed had any knowledge of ETFs.“We are in an awareness phase,” says Ms Laidlaw, who is based in Melbourne. “But awareness is growing and having the three largest providers listing products on the ASX will lead to quite a fast uptake.”Ms Laidlaw says ETFs are popular for their “convenience factor” and their provision of low-cost, day-to-day liquidity in listed index funds delivering “all world exposure”. This makes them attractive and accessible to the “Mum and Dad” investors who are comfortable with trading online.“Having somebody there to buy your investment in a fund from you at any time of the day is significantly attractive to some investors,” says Ms Laidlaw.“And they also give retail investors the ability to transact at institutional type fee levels, for example we offer a US shares ETF that has an annual charge of 9 basis points.”London-based ETF Securities offers five metals-based products on the ASX and is the only provider in the space.One of the funds, for example, offers exposure to palladium, an industrial metal used in catalytic converters for automobiles that has become a China play, given the likely growth of the Chinese car industry.Nigel Phelan, head of Australian sales, says the products listed on the ASX provide exposure by investing in the physical metal rather than in futures or in mining shares.They have proved popular with fund managers, who say ETCs help round out portfolios and deliver liquidity as strategies change. For retail investors, they offer exposure to commodities without having to invest in companies that mine or produce them.While financial advisers have embraced ETFs as a good product for retail clients, not everyone is convinced about their value to institutional investors.
534;STT;State Street Corp;2010-01-31T09:43:40Z;Demand and diversity drive rapid change;;New developments in exchange traded funds are moving at a fast pace as demand from an increasing number and range of investors grows and more and more players break into the market.ETFs were originally focused on stock markets but have widened to include many types of asset, including fixed income, commodities, currencies and real estate, tracking diverse indices.Many providers are reviewing their product pipeline, looking for new vehicles to create as competition sharpens. Among these are fixed income ETFs, which are catching investor interest in an uncertain environment.Until last year there was little demand for fixed income ETFs but interest is “increasing significantly, especially in the US”, says Deborah Fuhr, global head of ETF research and implementation strategy at BlackRock. Globally, investors have more than 80 per cent in equities but only just over 6 per cent in fixed income, “so fixed income has some way to catch up. After the Lehman debacle people moved into fixed income and I think this will increase this year,” she adds.iShares, which was acquired by BlackRock as part of its Barclays Global Investors deal last year, added to its family of corporate bond funds last year, expecting demand to continue to grow this year, says Axel Lomholt, head of product development for Europe at iShares.Lyxor, which launched its first series of corporate bonds last year to meet investor demand, hopes to add gilts and US government bonds in the future, according to Claus Hein, head of Lyxor ETFs for the UK and Nordic regions. State Street Global Advisors is also planning to roll out new fixed income products this year. Would-be newcomer T Rowe Price is also keen to get a slice of the business, aiming to enter the ETF market through a range of active fixed income products following proprietary strategies.An appetite for emerging markets, particularly the Bric countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China – is also driving the manufacture of new vehicles. Mr Hein expects to see more emerging market equity funds, providing investors with “liquid, cheap access”, while Hector McNeil, head of sales and marketing at ETF Securities, believes currencies are a “good liquid way in”. Last year, ETF Securities launched a currency platform to meet a demand Mr McNeil expects to continue.Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which is entering the industry, will be offering ETFs that will try to mirror the performance of emerging markets in Brazil, India, China and South Korea.Providers also see ground- breaking opportunities to roll out products in small Asian markets where currently only local players focus on domestic indices, says Jim Ross, senior managing director at State Street Global Advisors.Ms Fuhr also expects growing demand for alternatives such as commodities, volatility, interest rates, hedge funds and hedge fund replications.At Deutsche Bank, Aram Flores, head of index research in the US, says investor appetite for commodity exchange traded products is being driven by fundamentals such as concern over credit and volatility and by the rapid pace of product innovation. Last year, commodity ETPs grew by 114 per cent with $40bn of net inflows, he adds. Mr Flores expects this growth to continue “to elevate market share of the third biggest ETP asset class in the year to come”.However, the design of good commodity vehicles is not easy, experts say. iShares’ Mr Lomholt believes “the challenge in commodities is to come up with Ucits funds”. Further difficulty occurs because “they are hugely concentrated on energy and can be difficult to engineer”, he says.The rush of new products can be confusing for investors, even for seasoned institutional investors. “With a heightened level of product development, short performance records and fluctuating regulations for some of these product offerings, selecting the best ETFs can be a challenge,” says Mr Ross.Experts agree more innovation can lead to further complexity. Ms Fuhr says: “As newer products come on the market, it is going to be harder to define what an ETF is.”Mr Lomholt says: “A few years ago, we were launching ETFs on FTSE indices that people are familiar with. Now we’re launching them on US high-yield bond indices. This adds a couple more layers of complexity. But we are trying to make complex products simple.”As more players pile into the market, the choice of providers and novelty of vehicles is set to grow. New entrants include active asset managers, banks, hedge funds, discount brokers and start-up providers, particularly pushing into the US. Recently, Goldman Sachs, John Hancock and T Rowe Price have requested permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch active ETFs, following Charles Swab, Pimco and BlackRock last year.Hedge funds are also pushing into the crowded market with Marshall Wace, one of Europe’s biggest hedge funds, launching a publicly listed exchange traded fund to track its flagship Tops fund strategy. This follows the launch last year of the db Hedge Fund Index ETF, based on the performance of 40 or so managers on Deutsche Bank’s managed accounts platform.Experts also expect to see more banks and providers get together because such partnerships provide opportunities for distribution and spreading counterparty risk on swap contracts between two or more banks in a consortium.ETFX, a platform set up between Merrill Lynch, Citi, Rabobank International and ETF Securities, is also looking to develop products for the banks in its consortium and for other banks to use under their own name.“With the platform approach you can use the provider’s products. We have a number of white- label products in the pipeline,” says Mark Weeks, chief executive of ETFX.While the flurry of new entrants is expected to continue this year, some experts believe it will be short-lived as the environment for new players becomes more competitive. “This rush is a prelude before consolidation starts,” says Mr McNeil.
535;STT;State Street Corp;2010-01-31T09:43:39Z;Managers prepare to dabble in ETF waters;;"It may be regarded as an inauspicious sign for any industry that its progenitor was Bear Stearns, the failed investment bank, but the nascent active exchange traded fund industry will be hoping to shrug off this inauspicious start.Active ETFs are designed to bring the joys of active fund management to the erstwhile passive, index-tracking world of the exchange traded fund.The first such attempt in the US, a short-term bond fund managed by Bear Stearns, bit the dust in the spring of 2008 when the bank had to be rescued by JPMorgan. But the fund management industry was never going to let such an inconvenience stand in the way of innovation.Since then, 16 active ETFs have been listed in New York and Toronto, primarily by Invesco PowerShares, Grail Advisors and BetaPro Management, according to figures from BlackRock. But industry heavyweights Pimco and BlackRock’s iShares have also dipped their toes into the active waters, and the likes of State Street Global
Advisors, Vanguard and T Rowe Price have filed applications to join the party.As of the end of 2009 the concept had garnered only $178m of assets, a tiny drop in the vast ETF ocean, but this could change rapidly if the idea of actively managed ETFs gains wide acceptance.Not that everyone believes this is guaranteed. “I’m not convinced they are a great proposal,” says Deborah Fuhr, global head of ETF research at BlackRock. “It’s a model where you are paying [brokerage] fees to get in and get out. Many US mutual funds are no load, so I don’t really think there is any great advantage.”Even Jim Ross, senior managing director at State Street Global Advisors, which two years on is still awaiting regulatory approval for a family of actively managed target date ETFs, says: “I do think [active ETFs] have some attractions, but I don’t think it’s the panacea that some people see it as.”The key problem is that ETFs have to disclose their entire portfolio compositions on a daily basis so that market makers creating new units or cancelling existing ones know what they need to buy or sell.Few active managers are willing to entertain such transparency for fear that other market participants will “front run” them, buying stock in advance and thus moving the price against the fund, or that they will simply copy their investment strategy free of charge.“They have to say ‘here is the portfolio composition file’,” says Ms Fuhr. “If a bank has an order it would trade it in that size and then send it to the custodian.”According to Ms Fuhr, a potential “black box” solution to this problem, which would produce a portfolio of long and short positions that disguises the underlying portfolio but tracks it very closely, has been
developed but remains untested. “From a pure equity standpoint, it’s challenging,” says SSGA’s Mr Ross. “A traditional active equity shop has no interest in being transparent in its stock selection.“It’s maybe OK for the short end of the fixed income curve as you are not really giving away a lot of your investment process, but we have significant capabilities in active equity and active fixed income portfolio management
that we cannot have fully transparent.”It is for this reason that SSGA is, thus far, planning to limit its active ETF range to target date funds that will invest in portfolios of passive equity and fixed income ETFs, albeit in a process that would be actively managed by SSGA’s multi-asset class team.“ETFs are already transparent, so all we are giving away is what the asset
allocation should be,” says Mr Ross.Some houses are more upbeat about the prospects.“If you look at where the bulk of the money is in the asset management world, it’s in actively managed funds,” says Ed McRedmond, senior vice president of institutional and portfolio strategies at Invesco PowerShares. His company has $28m in five active ETFs; four of them equity funds and one fixed income. He adds: “While indexing has been growing, there is still a huge part of the investing world that is looking for active management.“We really view the ETF structure as just a delivery vehicle. Up until now it has been used as a delivery vehicle for passive index products. We want to be able to offer our investment capabilities to clients in any format that may be preferred.”Mr McRedmond argues that any active manager running separate accounts is already disclosing their holdings on a daily basis, although this information is disseminated on a “need to know” basis rather than to the market at large.Further, the danger of front running is minimised by holdings only being disclosed at the end of the day, after the market has closed.Perhaps tellingly, however, while three of PowerShares offerings are sub-
advised by parent Invesco and two by AER Advisors of New Hampshire, none of them are clones of existing mutual funds.This hints at another problem. Few investors will be willing to buy into a recently launched active ETF that is not a clone of a pre-existing mutual fund, and thus does not have a track record.“Most people want some form of history if it really is an active fund,” says Ms Fuhr.Mr Ross adds: “My general view from what I have seen in the US is that [active ETFs] are not getting a lot of traction. They don’t have three-year track records.”Mr McRedmond recognises this dilemma. “We never expected [active ETFs] were going to take off out of the box. We have always believed that they will take time to build up their track record.”A manager offering an active ETF as a new share class of an existing active fund would have to make a payment to Vanguard, which has patented this process, Ms Fuhr says.Nevertheless, optimism remains. Mr Ross says he hopes that SSGA’s active target date ETFs, assuming they do finally win approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, “would hold some cost advantages” over similar mutual fund offerings.Mr Redmond says PowerShares active ETF offerings, which have total expense ratios of 75-80 basis points for the equity funds and 29bps for the bond offering, can be cheaper than similar mutual fund offerings because distribution fees do not have to be built in.He further argues that the portfolio transparency is a boon to investors, particularly in volatile markets, while the ability to trade intraday may be appreciated by some.Opinions are divided as to how fast the concept will develop. Mr Ross says he has “not really heard much about it” outside of the US. “There’s some tyre kicking in Europe, but I’ve not heard anything at all in Asia,” he adds.Ms Fuhr believes “many firms are thinking they should get into this business,” with most of the more obvious passive ETFs strategies already taken.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr McRedmond is most upbeat. “How big will it get? I think it’s a matter of time as people get familiar with the concept. Every year that goes by we will see active ETFs get more and more attention compared to mutual funds.”"
536;STT;State Street Corp;2010-01-31T09:43:39Z;ETFs set fresh records for managed assets;;"The rapid growth the ETF industry has enjoyed over recent years shows little sign of waning, with 2009 proving to be yet another bumper year for the sector.According to figures from BlackRock, assets under management for global ETFs reached $1,032bn (£639bn, €734bn) at the end of December, some 5 per cent above the previous all time high of $982bn registered just a month earlier. European ETFs also fared well, registering a record high of $223bn last year.Behind this success, ETF providers have been battling for a greater share of assets, in what has become an increasingly competitive market, particularly in Europe.BlackRock’s recently acquired iShares division still dwarfs its closest competitor, claiming an impressive 47 per cent share of the global ETF market, while State Street Global Advisors comes in a distant second with a 15 per cent stake.Increased competition in the European market has certainly provided a wake-up call for some of the long-established players. iShares saw its stake in the European market slip by 0.83 per cent at the end of 2009, a minor fall, but an early sign that competitors are slowly chipping away at its stranglehold.Rory Tobin, head of iShares International, is unperturbed and appears to relish the prospect of taking on some of the new
providers.“Although there was a slight dip in European market share, we are happy with the increased competition,” he says.“A number of entrants in Europe struggle to gather assets outside of their own geography, and are clustered around the $3bn-$6bn of assets. Not many go north of that.“Last year we had around $70bn new inflows onto our global ETF platform, and we take that as a significant endorsement of what we are doing in terms of our
product set.”BlackRock’s acquisition of iShares should provide the market leader with a well equipped arsenal to fend off some of the competition, he says.“Where iShares didn’t have much access before, such as with intermediaries and private banks, we hope to work in partnership with BlackRock to position ETFs as a solution to clients in that space. BlackRock’s coverage of financial institutions is also a core capability which BGI did not have before. We hope to have a conversation about ETFs in this area too.”Despite some ETF providers making headway, most notably ETFLab which saw the biggest rise in European market share with a 1.4 percentage point increase, others have seen their market share crumble.Lyxor struggled to maintain its number two position in Europe during 2009. The ETF division of Société Générale registered a 3.7 percentage point drop in market share, according to the BlackRock figures, the largest of any ETF provider.Meanwhile, the success of State Street Global Advisors in the US has been hard to replicate in Europe, and it is unlikely to boast about its number 14 spot in the European order of merit.Bradley Kay, associate director of European ETF research at Morningstar, says: “In Europe there are almost two separate markets: one where people demand transparency and a lack of counterparty exposure in the physical backing, and one where investors want counterparty exposure in order to get greater returns.“Lxyor has suffered because of the emerging competition on the synthetic side.”HSBC was one of the new players to emerge in the ETF market last year when it launched its range of ETF products into Europe in August. Source, the ETF platform backed by Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, has managed to garner a 1.2 per cent market share since its launch last April. UBS Global Asset Management also has plans to launch 21 ETFs in Europe.Loren Fox, senior research analyst at Strategic Insight, says despite increased competition in Europe, the market leader has little to be concerned about. “In the near future, iShares has enough of a lead and product line-up that they are not in danger of losing the number one position.“That said, there are more openings occurring for competitors, particularly because of fragmentation in the European market. Players that are smaller now can grow and new players can still enter the market and shake things up.”The growth potential for the European market could also lead to a dramatic shift in the league table of top players. US ETF assets, which stood at $705bn at the end of 2009, largely due to greater use by retail investors, dwarf the European market, which has just $223bn in comparison.Mr Kay predicts regulatory change in Europe which could lead to greater ETF use among retail investors, could bring assets more in line with the US.“When the new investor base starts to enter ETFs, it will be interesting to see where they flow to,” he says."
537;STT;State Street Corp;2010-01-17T08:32:37Z;ETFs set for growth, analyst says;;Exchange traded products could grow by more than a fifth this year, according to Deutsche Bank analysts.Investment vehicles traded on exchanges, mostly in the form of index-tracking funds, passed the $1,000bn (£616bn, €695bn) mark last month as investors allocated money away from active managers.A research report from Deutsche, the first in a monthly series, sees this trend continuing.“In the event the bullish equity markets continue in 2010, we expect total assets will comfortably reach the $1.3-1.4 trillion territory,” says Christos Costandinides, ETF strategist at Deutsche. In 2009, assets under management in ETPs grew by 43.8 per cent, boosted by a greater than 20 per cent rise in global equities.Even in the event of flat equity markets in the coming year, Deutsche’s analysis expects assets in ETPs to add at least another $200bn in 2010.The report outlines some trends within the market. It expects the current pattern of a small number of global players holding most of the assets to continue as smaller entrants concentrate on niche products. The European market will continue to grow faster than the US, but the American market is still significantly bigger.Currently four providers can be classed as global, says the report, naming BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors, Deutsche Bank itself through db x-trackers, its ETF provider, and Powershares.Deutsche predicts success will be based on providers’ innovation capability, as “a provider’s ability to timely and efficiently create products will play the biggest role in being able to compete”.Increasing numbers of providers will opt for synthetic replication, where index returns are produced by using derivatives, instead of physical replication, where the ETF manager buys the underlying constituents of the index being tracked, says the report.Db x-trackers relies exclusively on this method.
538;STT;State Street Corp;2010-01-11T21:02:13Z;Pay-outs at rescued banks face fresh scrutiny;;Andrew Cuomo, the New York attorney-general, raised the political heat on Wall Street pay on Monday, asking the top US financial institutions that received billions of dollars in public bail-out money for detailed information on bonuses.The requests to the eight banks, the initial recipients of funds from the troubled asset relief programme, are part of a broader inquiry into banks’ compensation policies, which remains a controversial issue.The eight groups – Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo – have all repaid the Tarp funds.Their compensation practices remain under the spotlight, however, because the US financial sector has recovered from the crisis much more quickly than expected and is on course to record billions of dollars in profits. The fourth-quarter reporting season kicks off on Friday with JPMorgan.The request for information on bonuses, which mirrors a similar move made by Mr Cuomo last year, would give him powerful ammunition to “name and shame” banks deemed to have doled out too much money to employees.The banks have until February 8 to provide the data.In the letters, Mr Cuomo asked for information on bonus pools, how they were being allocated and distributed, the breakdown of cash and stock in the rewards, and descriptions of any “claw-back” provisions or any other mechanisms tying pay to performance.Mr Cuomo also asked how the bonus pool would have been affected if the lenders had not received Tarp funding and how much and at what rate they have been lending to consumers and businesses over the past three years. “Many of these banks would not be in the position they are in today if it had not been for the Tarp money,” Mr Cuomo said on Monday. “The banks made a lot of money in some cases only because the taxpayers gave them a lot of money …There are institutions that would have failed if not for the taxpayer.”Banks already disclose the compensation of top executives but Mr Cuomo wants detailed data on other highly paid employees, including star bankers and traders who often earn million-dollar bonuses.Mr Cuomo said bonuses were an effective management tool when based on standards encouraging long-term sustainable growth, “not based on incentives that brought this nation to its knees” or “fictional” short-term profits. “Average Americans are still paying the price for the economic debacle,” he said.Mr Cuomo said he also wanted lenders to identify all compensation consultants they used “ to advise them on what were adequate and fair bonus payments… .. I’m curious to see if that practice has been going on,” he said.BofA said it had yet to receive the letter but would provide a response. The other banks declined to comment or could not be reached.Bonus compliance survey at www.ft.com/globaleconomy
539;STT;State Street Corp;2010-01-10T10:05:43Z;ETF push by GSAM not a threat;;The chief executive of Source, the exchange traded fund platform, has dismissed concerns that Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s US exchange traded fund push is a threat to the platform.Dublin-based Source was set up last year by Goldman Sachs along with Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The European platform offers swap-based ETFs that claim to reduce counterparty risk.The latest move, however, sees Goldman Sachs entering the US ETF market directly.GSAM filed a range of index-based ETFs with the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, at the end of December.Ted Hood, chief executive of Source, says: “It is interesting to see Goldman doing this.“We think it reinforces the notion that ETFs are excellent products, but the overlap between the US market and the European market is pretty minimal because of the different regulatory environments.”GSAM joins the growing ranks of mutual fund providers to enter the ETF arena. Pimco, Vanguard and State Street have all embarked on ventures over the past few months. Some of them are said “to be looking” at Europe next.“A number of active managers are looking at ETFs, and a lot of them will consider launching equivalent products in Europe,” says Fearghal Woods, director of business development at Bank of Ireland Securities Services.The inaugural Goldman ETF will track an index based on the Brazilian, Indian, Chinese and Korean stock markets. The US manager will then seek to launch equity, fixed income and mixed-securities ETFs, covering the US and international markets.Goldman Sachs declined to comment on any potential direct ETF move into Europe.Service providers in Ireland – which has become a hot spot for the administration of ETFs – believe such a move is unlikely.“It is purely a US issue,” says a Dublin-based lawyer. “It would be surprising because they would be competing against themselves,” adds Mr Woods.Mr Hood says a move by GSAM in the growing – but still niche – European ETF market would weigh heavily on competitors.“We are very pleased with the relationship we have with Goldman,” says Mr Hood. “Obviously, nobody wants new competitors coming into their primary market, but clearly that is not the case at the moment.”At the time of launching Source, Goldman Sachs was said to be seeking to buy iShares, the successful ETF arm that belonged to Barclays. iShares is now owned by BlackRock, which acquired Barclays Global Investors last year.Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs’s partner at Source, was reportedly unhappy about the rumours the bank was looking into setting itself up in the ETF market.Hector McNeil, a director at ETF Securities, says: “If Goldman came to Europe, it would put a big question mark on whether Source is working for them.”Eight months on from the launch, Source intends to boost asset growth with an increasing number of products. It has more than 55 ETFs and about $4bn of assets under management.“It is good, but it is slower than they would have liked,” says Mr Woods. “They had hoped to do a bit better.”Last week, the platform launched nine US ETFs covering consumer discretionary, consumer staples, energy, financials, health care, industrials, materials, technology and utilities.These ETFs use the new Standard & Poor’s Selector Sector Capped 20 per cent indices, specifically developed for Source in order to comply with Ucits III diversification rules.Mr Hood says: “US domestic ETFs have enormous assets in the US, but most European investors are not allowed to invest directly into US funds, so having European funds and offering US sector exposure is extremely attractive to those types of investors.”Mr McNeil believes the US ETFs come a bit late in the game. “I think just the availability and liquidity of products have caught up in Europe now. So what you can get in the US you can get here,” he says.Baptiste Aboulian is associate editor of Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared
540;STT;State Street Corp;2010-01-04T09:00:20Z;FXall to buy forex platform from Citi;;FXall, an electronic trading platform for foreign exchange, on Monday said it would buy LavaFX, a rival forex trading platform owned by Citibank.The move is another example of the gradual consolidation of FX electronic trading platforms. In 2007, State Street bought Currenex, a platform that was popular with hedge funds.FXall specialises in providing FX services to active traders, asset managers, corporate treasurers, banks, broker-dealers and prime brokers.Its acquisition of LavaFX will boost the number of its institutional clients by around 200 to 1,000 of the world’s largest hedge funds, banks, broker-dealers, corporate treasurers and asset managers.Tom San Pietro, LavaFX chief executive, would join FXall as head of active trading.Jeff Feig, global head of foreign exchange at Citi, said: “Citi believes a multi-bank platform is best owned by a multi-bank provider, making the sale of LavaFX to FXall the right strategy for its continued growth. Citi will continue to support LavaFX and contribute to its future success as a part of FXall.”Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
541;STT;State Street Corp;2009-12-22T21:31:04Z;State Street buys Intesa unit;;State Street, the world’s third-biggest custody bank, on Tuesday underlined its ambitions to expand out of its US heartland and become the market leader in Europe with the €1.75bn ($2.5bn) cash acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolo’s securities servicing business.The bank’s long-term goal is to build its Asian and European businesses to a level where they generate 50 per cent of total revenues, matching income and profits derived from the US.Jay Hooley, State Street’s chief operating officer who becomes chief executive in March, said: “This is the perfect fit to our strategy.”The acquisition of Intesa’s $500bn under custody makes State Street a leading custody bank in Italy and Europe, taking its non-US revenues to 38 per cent from 35 per cent of the total. Intesa said the unit generated about €300m in revenues and €120m in net income last year.Intesa, one of Italy’s two biggest banks, said the disposal was part of a programme to boost capital ratios by shedding non-core assets after it turned down an offer of government aid earlier this year. Intesa said the capital raised by the sale would add 37 basis points to its core tier one capital ratio, which stood at 7.2 per cent at the end of September.The Intesa acquisition is State Street’s second purchase in Europe in weeks. This month it bought Mourant International Finance Administration which provides custody and administration services for private equity, real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investment funds.Mr Hooley said: “The growth prospects in Asia and Europe will dwarf those in the US.”He expects double-digit growth from Europe over the next five to seven years as a result of changes to the way that funds are sold and distributed to investors, the introduction of new savings and pension vehicles in states such as the UK, and a rising trend to outsource the safekeeping and administration of funds.He said State Street’s priority was to reinstate the dividend but the group would continue to make cash acquisitions as opportunities arose. “We will take advantage of the environment and our strong capital position to advance our strategy.”State Street – which has $13,300bn in assets under custody, a further $4,700bn under administration and manages about $1,700bn in passively managed investment funds – said the deal would be “modestly accretive” to operating earnings in 2010.
542;STT;State Street Corp;2009-12-22T19:59:11Z;Intesa / State Street;;"When a company emphasises the strategic benefits of a deal it is usually a warning to investors that value is about to be destroyed. But not always.Take Intesa Sanpaolo’s sale of its securities custody unit to State Street for €1.75bn. Custody – the unglamorous, low-margin and largely computerised back office business of record keeping, securities processing and lending – is one of the most scalable of all operations. State Street, one of the world’s three biggest firms in the business, administers some €10,000bn of assets.By comparison, the unit Intesa is selling manages one twenty-eighth of that amount, a mere €350bn. It therefore makes sense for Intesa to exit and State Street to buy.The price seems fair. The business earned some €120m last year. Add the €60m of costs that State Street estimates it can save, and the US bank should earn a return on investment of about 10 per cent; quite respectable.As for Intesa, apply the deal’s valuation – equivalent to 0.5% of assets under administration – to the assets that State Street looks after, and the US bank’s market capitalisation would be triple what it is now. That suggests Intesa got a good price.The Italian bank will use the €1.25bn of goodwill released by the sale to strengthen its capital base. Combine that with the recently-agreed sale of its half share in consumer credit company Findomestic to BNP Paribas, and the mooted listing of asset manager Fideuram, and Intesa will probably hit its target of boosting core tier one capital by a percentage point early next year, from about 7.2 per cent now. As for State Street, it already has tier one capital of about 16 per cent.

543;STT;State Street Corp;2009-12-13T23:03:21Z;Dead-end decade for shares likened to 1930s;;Investors have lost heavily on stocks but gained on bonds this decade for the first time since the 1930s.Since January 2000, the S&P 500 has fallen about 25 per cent in nominal terms. With dividends reinvested, the benchmark is still down 11 per cent.By contrast, a Barclays Capital index of Treasury bonds has delivered a total return, including capital gains and interest, of 85 per cent this decade.And an index monitoring 30-year Treasuries, which are sensitive to inflation expectations, has generated a total return of 116 per cent over the past ten years, according to Barclays Capital.The pattern is similar in Europe, where investment in the equivalent indices for UK gilts and European government bonds would have generated total returns of 72 and 71 per cent, respectively, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 equity index is trading 37 per cent below its January 2000 level.Gerald Lucas, senior investment adviser at Deutsche Bank, said: “It has been a lost decade for equities, similar to the 1930s.“Equities started at the top in 2000 and were overvalued relative to Treasury bonds.”Analysts say the starting point of any relative comparison is crucial, but this decade has hit equity investing hard after the bull market of the 1990s.Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Securities, said: “The cult of equity has taken some big knocks, and aside from the two bear markets, the sheer volatility was very hard for buy-and-hold investors to stomach.”Stock prices fell this decade as companies failed to meet the wildly optimistic profit expectations that marked the boom in technology and telecoms stocks that ended in the early months of 2000, leading to sharply reduced interest rates the following year.William Cunningham, global head of credit strategy at State Street Global Advisors, said: “The period of low interest rates in 2001 forestalled the day of reckoning for the consumer, and that set up a much larger consumer debt bubble.”The scale of the damage in US equities is illustrated by the performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which has dropped 46 per cent this decade in nominal terms.Aggressive interest rate cuts and a steady easing of inflation fears have boosted government bonds. Today, the current yield on a 10-year Treasury is about 3.5 per cent. An investor in February 2000 could buy a 10-year note with a coupon of 6.5 per cent.The story for other main equity markets also reflects a similar tale. The FTSE 100 index has dropped 23 per cent in nominal terms, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 trades some 37 per cent below its January 2000 opening level of 1,583.55.Japanese stocks fell for a second consecutive decade. The Nikkei 225 has fallen by nearly half in value since 2000 and is down 77 per cent from its late 1989 peak of 38,915.87.Mr Ruskin said the prospect of bonds, currently at low yields, beating equities in the coming years appeared unlikely unless deflation emerged.
544;STT;State Street Corp;2009-12-06T10:19:15Z;State Street grows with Mourant purchase;;State Street is expanding its alternative investment servicing business through the acquisition of Jersey-based Mourant International Finance Administration, a move that will turn it into the world’s biggest alternative asset services provider.The US-based custodian bank will absorb Mourant’s Europe and Asia focused operations in real estate, hedge funds and private equity.“We think the outsourcing administration market is ripe for growth. And we will become global, which is important for our clients as many are offshore [in these areas],” said Jack Klinck, executive vice president of State Street Alternative Investments.The deal, which adds Mourant’s $170bn (£103bn, €114bn) of assets under administration to State Street’s $420bn, will also “give us scale to have a big revenue stream to put back into the company,” added Mr Klinck.Mr Klinck forecast strong demand for real estate administration as more fund managers and pension funds outsource operations, while State Street is expecting more private equity companies to offload administrative duties. The bank is keen to beef up administration of Ucits hedge funds.Mr Klinck was undaunted by the likely implications of the European Union’s alternatives directive. “We are used to [dealing] with compliance and regulation and we are watching this carefully,” he said.
545;STT;State Street Corp;2009-11-19T20:28:49Z;Short View: Gold rush;;Though it is over 150 years old, Edgar Allan Poe’s The Gold Bug may make a fun gift this season. With the gold price hitting near-daily records, the story about the hunt for a buried treasure after a bite from a gold-coloured bug has topical appeal and is said to be one of the first uses of the description for gold lovers. Other gold-themed gifts might include gold coins or stakes in gold funds, which are surging in popularity.Five years ago, gold funds were also causing ripples of excitement. Investors were, for the first time, able to buy gold via an instrument traded on the stock exchange, avoiding the complications of futures or of deciphering mining company strategies. Offered by the World Gold Council and State Street Securities, the gold exchange-traded fund launched in 2004 has proved a winner. Now with assets of more than $40bn, it has made money every year and, for those investors who took stakes at the beginning, it has made them more than 150 per cent.Gold’s lustre is attracting more followers now. There are still plenty of gold bugs who believe it will always outshine, especially as the value of paper currencies threatens to plunge and inflation looms. Other investors are not driven by doomsday scenarios but see value in gold relative to other assets, from the supply of money to crude oil and equities. Others merely buy into diversification arguments.One recent catalyst pushing gold higher was buying by central banks, such as India’s $6.7bn purchase earlier this month. But, as Ticonderoga analysts point out, State Street’s gold ETF is among the biggest holders of gold in the world. Indeed, ETFs backed by physical gold are now buying the equivalent of more than 20 per cent of new production, nearly double last year’s levels. Wealthy individuals have long supported luxury goods. Their thirst for gold funds might just give a further boost to this precious metal too.John Authers is on sabbaticalwww.ft.com/shortview
546;STT;State Street Corp;2009-11-18T16:41:22Z;International finance: Banks knocking on the door;;Compared with rival financial hubs in the Gulf, the Qatar Financial Centre’s headquarters in Doha seems fairly somnolent, despite the country’s lively economy.More than four years since it was established, international banks prefer to keep most regional staff in places such as Dubai, while Qatar has remained an outpost – albeit an important one.But that is changing. Some banks, which tried to operate a skeleton staff away from their headquarters, have been warned by the centre that they need to meet the terms of their licences by basing staff on the ground.Dubai, with its opulent lifestyle, may be the place of choice for bankers, but with most of the region suffering from the aftershocks of the financial crisis, the continued roar of gas revenue has reinvigorated interest in the Qatari capital, bankers say.Most institutions increasingly realise that suitcase banking from other hubs does not allow them to create the relationships they need to win mandates.The attraction for banks is clear. Standard & Poor’s estimates that, propelled by a rapid expansion of gas production, Qatar’s economy will grow by more than 15 per cent a year in real terms for the next three years.Meanwhile, the value of its annual exports will nearly treble to $114bn by 2014, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.“The implications of the gas wealth are huge. The degree of wealth generation that Qatar is about to experience on a sustained basis is so fundamental that it will unquestionably propel Qatar to be a major financial player on the global economic stage,” says Cyrus Behbehani, chairman of investment banking at Morgan Stanley Middle East.“It is likely that, while a substantial amount of that capital will be destined for domestic use, a significant proportion will be channelled into foreign use by virtue of investment and other mechanisms,” he says.Some of Qatar’s hydrocarbon revenue finds its way out of the country, generating valuable revenue for international banks that advise on these investments, such as stakes in J Sainsbury, Volkswagen-Porsche and Barclays. Bankers also hope Qatar’s benchmark sovereign bond issuance this year will spur more government-related entities to tap the debt markets.So far, Abu Dhabi, another Gulf statelet that has proved relatively resilient, has dominated regional debt sales, but Qatar has become increasingly active.RasGas’s $2.3bn bond, managed by HSBC, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, attracted orders of $18bn and Qatar Telecom’s $1.5bn bond, arranged by Royal Bank of Scotland and managed by Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas, DBS Bank, JPMorgan Securities and RBS, attracted a $13bn order book.“There is still voracious appetite for debt due to the ongoing projects and government plans,” says Kapil Chadda, head of global banking at HSBC in Qatar. “There is increasingly a focus on bonds, as banks are reluctant to lend long term any more.”However, Qatar’s recent second sovereign bond issuance of the year has highlighted a common complaint.The influx of international banks, and the presence of local banks and investment houses, has meant competition is heating up, but business has usually gone to the same banks.“There are a number of international banks that have made an investment in Qatar but are not necessarily seeing a return, and are grumbling about it,” says a Doha-based banker.Nonetheless, international banks that have ambitions in the region cannot afford to ignore the gas-rich peninsula.In addition to outbound advisory work, there are domestic opportunities.While there are few known restructurings in Qatar, the government seems intent on consolidating, and has ordered the merger of companies in which it, directly or indirectly, owns stakes.“There is limited scope for restructurings, as Qatar hasn’t been as badly hit as many other countries, but there is some domestic consolidation going on,” says Mr Chadda.“The government wants companies that can compete internationally.”HSBC Middle East is advising on the merger between Qatar Navigation and Qatar Shipping.Goldman Sachs is advising Barwa Real Estate on its proposed merger with Qatar Real Estate Investment Company, which is being advised by JPMorgan.The rude health of the economy has also spurred the establishment of several local start-ups, such as QInvest, an offshoot of Qatar Islamic Bank.This year it acquired 47 per cent of Panmure Gordon, UK stockbroker and investment bank, and advised Qatari Diar, a state investment fund, on the purchase of the US embassy in London.On the domestic equity side, opportunities remain limited.The stock market is the third-largest in the Gulf – behind Saudi Arabia and Kuwait – but has a capitalisation of only $88bn.Bankers are sceptical whether it will benefit from its rebranding to the Qatar Exchange, in which NYSE Euronext owns a 20 per cent stake, without a regulatory overhaul.Nevertheless, institutions have rushed to knock on the doors of the QFC. Banks such as Credit Suisse, Barclays, Standard Chartered, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs were among the first to be licensed in 2007.Since then, institutions such as UBS, State Street, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Nomura and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ have been licensed.The QFC Tower is full: banks are starting to open offices elsewhere in Doha.“Obviously this is an interesting market for international financial institutions,” says Bassam Yammine, co-chief executive of Credit Suisse in the Middle East.“Qatar is a very important market and will continue to be important for many years to come.”
547;STT;State Street Corp;2009-11-11T23:29:59Z;Microfinance group in CDO scheme;;Deutsche Bank and a major microfinance company are trying to rehabilitate the much-maligned collateralised debt obligation as a means of funnelling money from global capital markets into the pockets of the world’s poorest people.Finca International, a US-based microfinance organisation, is set to announce on Thursday that it has sewn up a $21.2m CDO with the help of Deutsche Bank. Its affiliates in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Azerbaijan plan to leverage that money up another five times before lending it out in $500 chunks to tiny start-ups and would-be entrepreneurs.Its move comes as microfinance institutions search for new ways to access international capital markets amid growing demand and investor interest.CDOs were at the heart of the US subprime mortgage meltdown, spreading risk far and wide via their supposedly safe senior tranches of debt. But Asad Mahmood, managing director of Global Social Investment Funds at Deutsche Bank, said they remained useful structures.“It’s not the CDO that is to blame, it is an instrument. We’re using the CDO to do well, to do good.”By offering some tranches of debt that are protected from the first swathe of losses, Deutsche Bank – which structured, placed and managed the deal – said it was able to tap a new set of conservative investors, such as pension funds, that have fiduciary duties to their clients.Those investors, which include the insurer MetLife, the bank State Street and Hewlett-Packard, will receive a 7.5 per cent fixed rate. Investors in the riskiest slices will get a rate of about 16 per cent.Initially, it was a tough sell. “The atmosphere was pretty bad,” Mr Mahmood said. “You’ve been through the worst economic crisis where things are failing left and right, and you go back to investors as say ‘I’ve got a deal for you: you can invest in Congo!’ ”But the fund ended up being oversubscribed as investors looking to fulfil their social responsibilities were brought on board.“We found a wonderful reception for this product among the subscribers who loved the social aspect, the idea they would be sitting in the comfort of their home in Hamburg or Dallas, Texas or Paris, and their money …would be going to work to help solve the problem of some of the poorest people on earth,” said Rupert Scofield, Finca president and chief executive.It is an interesting time for microfinance. The rapid growth of some institutions is driving them to engage with capital markets in ways some critics have called a betrayal of the original philanthropic nature of the enterprise. The founders of Compartamos, a Mexican microfinance bank that listed on the stock exchange in 2007, attracted such a hail of criticism they issued an open letter to justify their rapid growth and commercialisation.For Finca, raising equity was not an option. Its affiliates were knocking up against their debt-to-equity ratio covenants, but could not raise equity amid the global financial meltdown.
548;STT;State Street Corp;2009-10-20T23:57:29Z;California in $200m State Street legal action;;California has launched a $200m legal action against State Street, accusing the institutional money manager of committing “unconscionable fraud” against Calpers and Calstrs, the largest US pension funds.The complaint accuses Boston-based State Street of illegally overcharging the two pension funds for the costs of executing foreign currency trades since 2001.Calpers, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, and Calstrs, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, were guaranteed the most competitive rates for foreign exchange transactions under its contracts with State Street, the complaint alleges.But Jerry Brown, the California attorney-general, said that State Street “consistently ‘marked-up’ prices using rates far in excess of the interbank rate”.“Over a period of eight years, State Street bankers committed unconscionable fraud by misappropriating millions of dollars that rightfully belonged to California’s public pension funds,” said Mr Brown. “This is just the latest example of how clever financial traders violate laws and rip off the public trust.”Mr Brown estimates that Calpers and Calstrs were overcharged by more than $56m in an eight-year period. California also alleges that State Street employees entered false exchange rates into its electronic databases.California is seeking damages equivalent to three times that sum, civil penalties of $10,000 for each false claim and legal fees.State Street said that it would fight the complaint. “We categorically deny any allegations of wrongdoing and will defend ourselves against any litigation,” it said.Jeffrey Simpton, the deputy attorney-general handling the case, told the Financial Times that evidence came to light after the alleged fraud had been brought to the state’s attention by a whistleblower.The state then subpoenaed State Street for records about trades and the times that they were executed.The information provided by the bank revealed that it had time-stamped trades, despite having previously told California officials that it was unable to supply time-stamp data, said Mr Simpton.“They kept the prices within interbank rate highs and lows,” he said.In an unrelated investigation, Calpers is looking into fees paid to “placement agents”, which help the pension fund invest its money.The fund is investigating $50m in fees that were paid to Alfred Villalobos, a former deputy mayor of Los Angeles. Mr Villalobos, a member of the Calpers board for two years in the mid-1990s, has denied any wrongdoing and pledged to assist Calpers with its investigation.
549;STT;State Street Corp;2009-10-20T23:28:31Z;Upbeat start to US earnings season;;Corporate America issued a string of quarterly earnings results on Tuesday that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, reflecting how big US companies have cut costs faster than revenues have fallen.However, stocks fell as investors focused on the lack of top-line improvement, with the S&P 500 index slipping 0.6 per cent to close at 1,091.06.“A lot of the numbers are not due to revenues but due to cost-cutting, so the market has sold off slightly, regardless of the fact that the results have been good,” said Doreen Mogavero, a floor trader on the New York Stock Exchange.Caterpillar, an industrial bellwether that is the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, exemplified the trend, smashing analysts’ earnings-per-share expectations while suffering dramatic falls in both net profits and revenues.Excluding a one-off tax windfall, the manufacturer reported a net profit of $275m, or 48 cents per share, down from $868m, or $1.39 per share, a year ago – but far above analysts’ average forecasts of 6 cents a share.Sales in the third quarter were $7.3bn, down from $13bn last year – and slightly below average analysts’ forecasts. But Caterpillar said sales had hit a bottom, with Jim Owens, chief executive, citing “signs of improving economic conditions”.Yahoo lifted projections after reporting a tripling of third-quarter profits, helped by the previously reported sale of a small stake in Chinese e-commerce site Alibaba.com and cost cuts.The previously reported sale contributed $98m to the quarterly net of $188m, or 13 cents a share, up from $56.2m, or 4 cents, in the same quarter of 2008. Analysts had expected a net of 7 cents a share. Revenue fell to $1.58bn from $1.79bn, but the drop was less than expected.“Brand spending is starting to happen a little bit more,” said Yahoo’s chief financial officer, Tim Morse.Coca-Cola said falling sales in the US and Europe were offset by double-digit growth in India and China, enabling it to earn $1.9bn, or 81 cents per diluted share, unchanged from last year.Muhtar Kent, chief executive, said: “I think China, India, Brazil – and others like Indonesia, Vietnam, places in the Middle East and Eurasia – are all showing recovery is on the way.”Results at State Street, the institutional money manager, were boosted by job cuts and reductions in dividends and employee bonuses. It reported an 8 per cent rise in net income to $516m.Cost-cutting also helped Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, exceed expectations in spite of lower sales, as some of its most popular drugs lost patent protection. Excluding extraordinary items, it made profits of $3.5bn or 51 cents per share, down from $4.2bn or 62 cents per share a year earlier.Other companies to report better-than-expected results on Tuesday included BlackRock, the asset management group, and Lockheed Martin, the defence contractor.
550;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
551;STT;State Street Corp;2009-09-30T21:25:29Z;ETFs ascendant;;Darwinian analogies are sorely overused in business but they describe perfectly the ascent of exchange-traded funds. Smarter and nimbler than their 70-year-old competitor, traditional mutual funds, they are winning the battle for investors’ savings.ETFs have grown from $1bn 15 years ago to $858bn across 1,768 offerings, but remain dwarfed by traditional funds with $18,150bn in assets across 67,000 products, says Barclays Global Investors. But the trend is clear. ETF inflows were 10 times higher than mutual funds through June, says Strategic Insight. The reasons for the shift are superior versatility, liquidity, tax efficiency and cost. Getting access to mutual fund-dominated bastions such as company retirement plans, including US 401(k)s, could accelerate ETFs’ ascent. Deloitte says that by 2011 US ETF assets will double to $1,000bn or a 10th of US mutual funds.The rise of ETFs is not only a story of a new product cannibalising an antiquated one. It could also herald a reshuffling of asset managers. While new industries are typically more fragmented than mature ones, ETFs are the opposite. About 70 per cent of assets are controlled by three firms – iShares, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard. By contrast, a similar proportion of overall US mutual funds is controlled by 50 companies. That is reflected by the premium price to assets paid for ETF managers such as Blackrock’s purchase of BGI, which controls nearly half the market through iShares. Such dominance is possible because, while all fund management is scalable, large ETFs gain an advantage from their incredible liquidity. Daily turnover of the largest ETF is 10 times more than the largest common stock.More acquisitions should be expected as lumbering fund giants find early ETF movers eating their lunch.

552;STT;State Street Corp;2009-09-13T07:14:01Z;Large and small asset servicers vie to meet challenges;;"There is no question that some custodian banks have come out of the financial crisis in a better position than others, putting their asset servicing businesses in a good position to invest and expand further, making this a good time to take a look at the competitive
landscape.“The story of consolidation within the global custody space probably has not changed over the past year, but the drivers behind this are certainly shifting and we see acceleration in the space,” observes Drew Douglas, global head of custody, HSBC Securities Services. “With upcoming regulatory changes, particularly in Europe, legislators are looking to place further depository and asset restitution liability upon custodian banks. Balance sheets will become more critical as well as one’s ability to invest in underlying core platforms.“The larger custodians will be better positioned than smaller local custodians to meet these challenges and manage/diversify risk. Further transparency on choice and suitability of sub-custodians will also be heightened as these risks become less transferable to underlying agents.”Which firms are most likely to come out on top? Do the big administrators have a new advantage as clients look for security and stability after last year’s ructions, or is there still a role for smaller specialists? Will we see more mega-mergers, or will The Bank of New York/Mellon merger prove to be the culmination of years of that particular evolutionary strand, that has concentrated so much financial firepower in so few hands? Will local and regional players reappraise their commitment to a future in asset services, and decide the investment game is not worth the candle? Will consolidation lead to less competition, bringing with it the threat of poorer service and higher prices, or will it help pave the way to a more efficient industry with different players operating at different levels and providing different services?There is of course no doubting the commitment of the giants of the industry, some of which have been cutting headcounts and reshuffling human resources to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. State Street, one of the biggest, looks slightly leaner and fitter after reducing its workforce by approximately 7 per cent towards the end of 2008. But, says Jay Hooley, president and chief operating officer at State Street, while the bank has lowered the cost base it has also improved customer service levels. “We’ve recalibrated the organisation and got ourselves in fighting shape, and have gained market share in key segments by building products and services,” he says, while conceding a year-on-year fall in revenues.BNY Mellon, now approaching the tail end of its integration, tells a similar story, of winning new business while bolstering productivity. Its pipeline of outsourcing business is made up mostly of new assets being transferred from in-house desks, but also includes assets being transferred from competing providers.Conrad Kozak, chief executive of JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services, says the company has won a number of new mandates over the past six months, all of which are now generating revenues. He adds that after a period of repositioning work and responsibilities between geographies that saw a number of local redundancies, the net global headcount is slightly higher than a year ago.Giles Elliott, global head of product, securities services (transaction banking) at Standard Chartered Bank says that while the number of requests for proposals in the first half of the year was subdued as clients focused on risk management, by the second half of the year, the bank started to see a growing volume, signalling that clients are back reviewing their options.Elsewhere, as the risk reward equation has been rewritten in relation to the return of assets to investors in the event of bankruptcy, the terms of trade have changed, and this will have more of an impact on some market players than others, says Sebastien Danloy, global head of sales and relationship management at Société Générale Securities Services. “Will the providers of asset services continue to accept the same or greater risks at the same price as they have in the past? I very much doubt it. Lehman and Madoff will haunt the industry for years to come.”For some niche players, such as Luxembourg-headquartered Kneip, a service provider to the fund management industry, the financial crisis has proved to be more of an opportunity than a challenge.“The credit crunch has been the biggest booster ever for our business,” says Bob Kneip, chief executive. “Asset managers need to build trust and transparency, and they need help to focus on their core competencies, getting rid of everything that is non-core.”Kneip recently opened an office in London, and plans more, in Germany, France and Hong Kong.For its part, Dublin-based SEI, another independent supplier of administration services, reports growth in excess of 30 per cent over the 18 months from the end of 2007 to June 2009, as it too benefits from the renewed interest in outsourcing.“People who are worried about whether their existing custodians will stay in the business are turning to us,” says David Morrissey, SEI’s director of business development, Europe and Middle East. “We have taken a large volume of business from the larger established custodians.” SEI says the number of investors carrying out due diligence on it has risen six- to eight-fold compared with a year or two ago.The future does, though, hold little cheer in terms of securities services for small local providers in many jurisdictions around the world. Many are expected to disappear from the industry as the sheer weight of the investment needed to keep up with the automation and scale required makes it impossible to carry on."
553;STT;State Street Corp;2009-09-13T07:14:01Z;Risk management rises on the agenda;;The financial crisis has pushed risk management up the agenda for investment firms, bringing it sharply into focus as a distinguishing factor in whether a company survives or not.“Even before the current crisis, we were seeing much more interest in risk as a product,” says Jeanette Patrizio, vice-president of State Street Investment Analytics. “Previously it was a request just for Var [value at risk], but now people are interested in stress-testing etc.”The belief that portfolio risk was all that mattered, and that it could itself be measured by a single number – value at risk – has been shattered. Since Var predicts the likelihood of a given level of loss, assuming the market has a normal distribution of returns, it is utterly useless as a predictor of loss when markets demonstrate abnormal returns, as they did following Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy.“When Var came out, we were never a huge believer. Its magic was that it was one number that came in to measure portfolio risk”, says Rob Goldstein, who oversees BlackRock Solutions, a risk analytics and advisory service, part of BlackRock. “We still have clients using Var, but they’re using it in conjunction with other metrics. There is no magic number.”One such additional measure is “stressed Var”, where a portfolio is tested against a number of historical situations when markets were in crisis. This at least means the portfolio manager and whoever is in charge of risk has a better idea of what might happen in such circumstances, but it is still only a snapshot of the portfolio risk in a particular situation, which may not be the one the portfolio faces in the future.“There is a growing understanding that risk is dynamic,” says Chad Burhance, head of risk at State Street’s International Fund Services. “It’s no news to anyone the last 10 years have demonstrated unprecedented [low] volatility. Investment managers were very happy to be benchmark-relative.“Unfortunately that hasn’t been a very good strategy for investors, particularly those that were liability driven. As a result, we’ve seen a faster movement toward controlling downside risk.”Another lesson the asset management industry has learned is that portfolio or investment risk is not the only danger.“Risk has become a main focus for almost anyone who touches assets in any way, shape or form,” says Mr Goldstein.“After Lehman Brothers, people understand that some of these types of risk that people regarded as ‘back office’ – they could kill you.”The trend for outsourcing these back office functions without taking into account the fact that they are a source of operational risk has caused problems, according to Mr Burhance. “It brings issues of transparency and confidence. “Companies are now starting to look at their so-called enterprise risk – the total picture of risk across a company, including portfolio risk, but also operational, counterparty, and structural risk.“There’s more rigour around how they assess risk,” says Ms Patrizio. More rigour and more senior attention – one major shift in what clients are asking for, she says, is the frequency with which her team is having to prepare reports for the executive board of asset managers.“The decisions need to get taken at a much higher level,” she says.Not only at a much higher level, but based on the far greater amounts and depth of data now available. BlackRock Solutions, which offers the advantage of a huge IT infrastructure platform with data from all of BlackRock’s assets plus a lot of third party clients to provide context, has seen a massive surge in requests for proposal (RFPs) this summer, as asset managers look for ways to ensure they are not caught out again.“The one thing we know is that we don’t know the unknown,” says Mr Goldstein, “but it will need enormous data transparency.“When everyone was concerned the financial world was going to end and asset correlations went to one, the depth of enterprise solutions was found to be insufficient.” Maarten Slendebroek, managing director of BlackRock Solutions in Europe, says: “Var or Monte Carlo simulations – that’s an instant snapshot, but when the shit hits the fan, you want to know what your exposure is. What sounds like the easy stuff is really difficult to organise. It’s all about the underlying data.”Organising access to that data and using analytics that actually add something to the understanding of risk is difficult and costly. According to Mr Goldstein, it may even be “the likely driver of consolidation in the industry. The information processing requirements have gone up dramatically.”While the geeky end of the industry is expanding, the senior executives who run the asset management companies are having to improve their understanding of what these measures of risk mean. This means there is a role for those who can translate to more intelligible vocabulary.“For institutional investors, it’s not just risk mitigation – it’s about knowledge,” says Mr Burhance. “There is a variety of metrics to describe portfolio risk.” It is important, he says, to explain risk in terms people can process. “If you say ‘we have a Var of 5 per cent’, their eyes roll back in their heads.”
554;STT;State Street Corp;2009-09-13T07:14:01Z;Flexibility key to meeting demands for ETFs;;The sales of exchange traded funds have dwarfed those of traditional mutual funds over the past year and experts predict that trend will continue.More and more innovative and esoteric ETFs are being launched every week and custodians and administrators have to be able to provide the flexibility in systems and global resources to cope with the demands of the asset class.Mark Kelley, global head, of the asset gatherers segment at JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services, explains one of the main differences between administration of mutual funds and ETFs is the ability to provide services for intraday trading. “On a traditional fund you calculate the strike price or net asset value once the fund is closed.“ETFs trade throughout the day and you have to constantly calculate and publish what the holdings are and the value of the fund,” he says.However, Mr Kelley says to do this does not necessarily mean new and expensive systems. “It requires the systems that we use to calculate and track assets on traditional funds to be ‘put on steroids’ and be able to do it throughout the day.”Marty Dobbins, senior vice president and managing director at State Street in Luxembourg, believes administrators and custodians need to have global operations, then they can benefit from differences in time zones.For example, he says, if an ETF needs to be distributed early in the morning out to the exchanges in Europe, the administrator will do preparatory work in North America.“Firms can leverage the ETF experience they have globally, if there is a global system that allows a shared service model. We think the key is having the flexibility to meet the time zone needs and a flexible platform that meets reporting needs. That is where we have seen the investment in our systems pay off,” he says.The biggest differentiator between ETF service providers, according to Tony O’Brien, offshore business development manager at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, is how they manage client relationships.“We try to foster a can-do attitude, every new ETF client we come across tends to have a new or innovative twist in what is a fairly established product, because the asset class is evolving so quickly.“Our differentiator is the willingness to sit down with clients and take their ideas, come up with solutions to problems that clients may not even have realised they will encounter, and put a back office and administrative solution around it,” he says.One idea that service providers do not agree on is cost. Frederic Perard, head of global fund services at BNP Paribas Securities Services, says because ETFs are cheap passive products, asset managers are looking for low-cost back office solutions.He says administrators need to have the full range of services: custody, fund administration and middle office. “This is where it makes a difference to clients. Not all [service providers] can accommodate this because it comes down to size and capacity,” says Mr Perard.BNY Mellon’s Mr O’Brien does not agree. The difference in cost for an ETF and a comparable mutual fund can be quite large, he says, but it is because there are few investment decisions to make.“Where it does become expensive at the custody level is when ETFs are tracking indices in emerging markets or assets that are difficult to settle,” he says.ETF providers are also adding further complexities to the back and middle office by launching products that use synthetic methods to track indices.ETFs have evolved over a number of years from simple fully replicated funds to synthetic swap-based funds, says State Street’s Mr Dobbins. Fully replicated ETFs, like those favoured by BGI’s iShares, provide the return of the index they track by holding the securities in that index.Synthetic ETFs use derivative instruments such as swaps to replicate the index. This method, favoured by providers such as Lyxor, means a fund needs to have a lot of collateral and uses swap counterparties.“For a synthetic ETF there is a lot more reporting needed on collateral and performance of the fund. Whereas with the fully replicated ETF you aren’t using derivatives, you are using securities that are housed on the accounting and custody systems,” says Mr Dobbins.Mr O’Brien points also to the explosion of exchange traded products (ETPs) in recent years. “We have seen a lot of providers come to the market with ETPs structured as special purpose vehicles, that issue debt to the capital markets,” he says.These types of products give investors the chance to invest in a fund that they would not be able to under Ucits regulations, such as physical gold or commodities and add further complications to custody and administration.“We have been working with our clients on these products to make sure they are fully collateralised because the regulations are not the same as Ucits. We have to be able to give clients security that we are providing the right solution for their product,” he says.
555;STT;State Street Corp;2009-09-02T18:01:48Z;China’s volatility remains a local affair;;Only a few weeks ago, it seemed that China’s insular equity markets were leading other stocks round the world. Some analysts in Europe even said China’s Shanghai Composite index was now the first price they searched for at the start of their trading day.Yet, evidence is growing that rather than showing greater correlation with other markets, Shanghai’s Composite index is acting more independently.As Chinese equities have crashed 21 per cent since August 4, other markets in the developed and developing world have either risen or traded sideways. The UK’s FTSE 100 is up 3 per cent since August 4, the Brazilian Bovespa is down a meagre 0.5 per cent, Russia’s RTS has fallen 1.3 per cent and India’s BSE Sensex is down 2 per cent.It could therefore be argued that the Shanghai Composite’s recent swoon is not even a portent for other emerging market equities, let alone those of more developed economies.This is because the index reflects trading on China’s A-share market, which is largely limited to Chinese nationals and dominated by small investors.The composition of the market is not only different from stock trading in Brazil, India or Russia, but even China’s H share market, based in Hong Kong.George Hoguet, senior portfolio manager and strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston, says: “It’s a different class of investors. What’s driving the A-share market is retail Chinese investors, by and large.”Fraser Howie, the Singapore-based author of Privatising China who closely follows the Shanghai market, adds: “China’s market has the mentality of a retail investor, which is very speculative. The shares are much more volatile.”This is not to say that other markets, particularly the Brics – Brazil, Russia and India as well as China – are divorced from the changes in sentiment towards the Chinese economy. For it is growing more powerfully than any other big nation, and is an important barometer for the rest of the world. As a huge consumer of commodities, China has a big influence on Russia’s RTS, which is almost entirely made up of oil and gas stocks, and the Bovespa in Brazil, where commodity exports to China have risen steadily.Shahin Vallee, emerging market strategist at BNP Paribas, says: “China’s economy is very important, but other markets only follow Shanghai’s stocks when they are moving for economic reasons, not when it goes down on a whim from retail investors.”Nigel Rendell, senior emerging market strategist at RBC Capital Markets, agrees: “The Chinese markets will have to fall a lot further because of real worries about the economy before it hits other markets. Then you could get into a situation where emerging market investors …have to sell to cover their losses.”But in such a scenario, Mr Hoguet expects the Chinese would put a floor beneath the market. “I don’t believe the Chinese market will impact other emerging equity markets. If there’s a significant collapse in the market, the Chinese authorities will intervene.”
556;STT;State Street Corp;2009-08-18T16:16:50Z;Short View: Indexers ascendant;;Denis Healey, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer, likened an attack from his successor, Sir Geoffrey Howe, to “being savaged by a dead sheep”.The same fate seems to have befallen active equity fund managers.For decades, retail savers have invested in stocks via mutual funds that are actively managed to try to beat an index. The funds hold about 100 stocks, and can raise or lower their cash holdings, but cannot bet on stocks to go down by selling them short.This model has, it appears, been savaged by a flock of sheep.Index investing, which cuts costs by replicating an index rather than trying to beat it, has been gaining in popularity.Active managers argued that they could raise cash, or move to defensive stocks, in a downturn. Passive funds would track their index over the edge of the cliff.But active managers, in aggregate, failed to do better than their indices in 2008.Numbers from Financial Research of Boston suggest active funds have lost money as a result. The 25 biggest US fund groups saw their assets fall 21.6 per cent in the 12 months to June.But Vanguard (-13.4 per cent), Barclays Global Investors (-2.7 per cent), and State Street Global Advisors (-0.7 per cent), all big passive investors, were less damaged. Assets grew at Pimco, best known for bonds.American Funds and Fidelity, two big active equity managers, both saw their assets decline 28.2 per cent.Diversified US equity funds rose 18 per cent in the year to August 13, Lipper says – far ahead of the S&P 500’s gain of 12.1 per cent. Global active funds have also beaten their benchmarks.It looks as though 2008 confirmed the case for index investing in consumers’ minds.

557;STT;State Street Corp;2009-08-12T23:26:47Z;John Paulson bets on BofA with 2% stake;;John Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made billions of dollars betting against subprime mortgages and shorting bank stocks during the past two years, has bought close to 2 per cent of Bank of America in what appears to be a strong endorsement of a bellwether financial institution.The price of BofA stock nearly doubled in the second quarter – when Mr Paulson purchased 168m shares – making the billionaire investor’s holding in the bank worth $2.2bn as of June 30, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday.Shares in BofA, which is the recipient of $45bn of government aid, closed on Wednesday at $15.93, up 8 cents. In after-hours trading – following the disclosure of Mr Paulson’s purchase – BofA shares were up 3.3 per cent at $16.46.A spokesman for Mr Paulson declined to comment on the BofA purchase, but the size of the stake makes Mr Paulson the fourth-largest shareholder in the North Carolina bank.Mr Paulson has also been accumulating shares of other financial stocks. In the second quarter, he bought 2m shares of Goldman Sachs and 7m shares of JPMorgan Chase, as well as 35m shares of Regions Financial, 17m shares of Capital One Financial, 12m of Marshall & Ilsley, 5m shares of Fifth Third, and smaller amounts of State Street and SunTrust. Mr Paulson was also part of the consortium of financiers who acquired IndyMac several months ago.One analyst, who did not want to be named, said Mr Paulson had probably acquired his stake while BofA stock was below $10 per share. “He liked it at $9, but does he like it at $16, or $40?” the analyst said.Mr Paulson’s newly found interest in financial stocks comes on the heels of a profitable short bet last year against the Royal Bank of Scotland, from which he is said to have made more than £300m ($495m).According to earlier regulatory filings, Mr Paulson made a series of bets on bank stocks in late 2008, buying 83.5m shares of Wachovia while it was under agreement to be bought by Wells Fargo, and 15m shares of Merrill Lynch, which had reached an agreement to be acquired by BofA.BofA had no comment on Mr Paulson’s investment.
558;STT;State Street Corp;2009-08-10T20:47:39Z;Strong dollar takes toll on metals groups;;US stocks drifted from last week’s highs on Monday, with investors looking to bank profits even as several experts gave a relatively bullish analysis for equities.Analysts at Citigroup said they expected companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index to earn more in 2010 than they had previously forecast.This followed suggestions over the weekend from Laura Tyson, an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, and Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, that the recession may be ending.But sellers were in the ascendency on Monday as investors looked to take advantage of the recent four-week rally and pull money off the table.The S&P and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 0.3 per cent down at 1,007.10 and 9,337.95 respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.4 per cent to 1,992.24.Investors were also betting that stocks could be set for a sharper tumble, with futures for the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility, trading higher than the index itself.“There is an idea that people are buying short-dated S&P volatility options in anticipation of a sell-off,” said Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital.Cyclical sectors, which led the buying last week, were the steepest fallers, with industrial, retail and materials stocks all lagging behind the market.Metals producers were among the hardest hit as investors bought the dollar, betting that the unexpected dip in unemployment announced last week could signal that the US will recover ahead of other economies.The currency’s strength hampered metals prices and shares in companies that produce them. US Steel lost 2.3 per cent to $43.85, while rival AK Steel dropped 4.7 per cent to $20.31.It was also a disappointing day for retailers, many of which will announce their results this week.Electronics retailer Best Buy fell 5.3 per cent to $37.66 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the shares, warning increased competition could hamper the company’s growth.Other retailers also declined ahead of earnings announcements later in the week. Macy’s dropped 4.8 per cent to $15.23 and Kohl’s gave up 1.8 per cent to $52.53.“I don’t think there is going to be much new information from retailers’ results,” said Mr Knapp.“They are likely to show very little top line growth, and investors are waiting now to see what happens during the back-to-school season.”But McDonald’s provided some optimism on consumer spending after it announced stronger July sales than analysts had been expecting, helped by the success of the company’s recent McCafé coffee offering. Its shares climbed 1.9 per cent to $56.27.The financial sector was mixed, with volumes much lower than they were last week.Citigroup rose 2.3 per cent to $3.94, outperforming other banks and building on last week’s stellar performance, during which its shares rose more than 20 per cent.Bank of America also found gains, rising 1.6 per cent to $16.68, but Wells Fargo dropped 0.4 per cent to $28.64.Meanwhile Freddie Mac, the mortgage provider rescued by the government last year, surged 128.4 per cent to $1.69 after it reported its first profit in two years and said it would not need to seek more government aid in the foreseeable future.State Street then triggered a dip in the sector during the afternoon after saying the amount of money it has set aside to cover legal claims coming from subprime losses may not be enough.The stock and sector dropped on the news, with some appearing to misinterpret the words as meaning the money manager was increasing its subprime loss reserve.Both then recovered much of that ground, but remained lower for the day. State Street closed 2.4 per cent down at $52.57.“A lot of the names that have done extremely well have gone back a bit, which looks like a normal profit-taking day,” said Jeff Mortimer, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab. “That is a healthy pause for the markets.”
559;STT;State Street Corp;2009-07-30T20:46:13Z;Tarp banks award billions in bonuses;;Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, which lost $55bn in 2008, between them paid 1,400 employees bonuses of $1m or more each, according to a New York state report, released on Thursday, on banks propped up with taxpayer funds.The study, compiled by Andrew Cuomo, New York attorney-general, showed that JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which both finished in the black last year, paid the most million-dollar bonuses - 1,626 and 953, respectively.However, the totals at a profitable bank such as Goldman were nearly matched by two of the year’s biggest losers on Wall Street. Citi, which suffered a $27.7bn loss, paid million-dollar bonuses to 738 employees. Merrill, which lost $27.6bn, paid 696 bonuses of $1m or more.“There is no clear rhyme or reason to the way banks compensate and reward their employees,” Mr Cuomo said. “Compensation for bank employees has become unmoored from the banks’ financial performance.”Representative Edolphus Towns, head of the House committee on government oversight and reform, pledged to hold hearings in September on the matter, suggesting the controversy over bankers’ bonuses is likely to continue later this year.Earlier, Mr Cuomo had detailed the number of million-dollar bonus payments made at Merrill in the last days of 2008, before it was acquired by Bank of America. In his new report, sent to Mr Towns’ committee, Mr Cuomo detailed the number and size of bonuses at eight other banks that received billions from the federal troubled asset relief programme fund last October.JPMorgan, which earned $5.6bn in 2008, set aside a total of $8.7bn for bonuses. The report shows that JPMorgan paid out bonuses in excess of $3m to more than 200 employees The bank received $25bn in Tarp funds last year and paid the money back last month.At Goldman, the bonus pool last year was $4.8bn, more than twice the $2.3bn it earned for the year. Goldman paid $3m or more to 212 employees. The bank paid back $10bn in Tarp funds last month.Citigroup set aside $5.3bn for its bonus pool, and paid bonuses of $3m or more to 124 employees. Like Bank of America, Citigroup received a total of $45bn in Tarp funds in 2008 and has recently converted some of that funding into common equity.BofA paid bonuses of $3m to 28 employees and million-dollar bonuses to 172. The Charlotte, North Carolina, bank reported a profit of $4bn in 2008 and set aside $3.3bn for bonuses.Morgan Stanley earned $1.7bn last year and set aside $4.5bn for bonus payments. The firm paid bonuses of $3m to 101 employees and million-dollar bonuses to 428. Morgan Stanley received $10bn in Tarp funds last year, and paid back the money in June.Among the other banks in Mr Cuomo’s report, Bank of New York Mellon paid 74 million-dolllar bonuses, Wells Fargo paid 62 and State Street paid 44.
560;STT;State Street Corp;2009-07-26T09:19:19Z;BNY Mellon urged to make acquisition;;BNY Mellon must acquire another asset management house if it is to compete effectively with State Street and the new BlackRock/BGI monolith, according to independent research group CreditSights.The research firm also names Legg Mason as an ideal target.It says the US house would benefit from buying a manager that specialises in equities because it has “a lower proportion of equity assets under management than its peers”.BNY Mellon, which was itself linked to a possible bid for BGI, has €50bn (£43bn, 71bn) of European retail assets under management.In a report entitled Scale Acquisitions, CreditSights says: “We believe the company (BNY) could look to address the gap in its product mix by acquiring an asset manager with equity products, and we believe Legg Mason is the most attractive target.”Legg Mason’s stock, it says, has underperformed (-53 per cent) the asset management sector, which has itself declined by 37 per cent during the past 12 months.“Largely due to the asset manager’s performance during the current cycle, BNY Mellon could improve its earnings by almost 15 per cent by acquiring Legg,” says David Hendler from CreditSights.Legg Mason’s net outflows were $30bn for the quarter ending June 30, 30 per cent lower than in the first quarter and 61 per cent lower than in the fourth quarter of 2008.BNY Mellon says it does not comment on “market rumour and speculation” and refused to answer questions on any potential tie-up with Legg Mason, but Ronald O’Hanley, the company’s chief executive, said earlier this year the group was on an acquisition drive, and he hoped to add to BNY Mellon’s 18 fund management boutiques.“From a distribution perspective we would like to add to our business and Asia is something we are especially interested in looking at. Now is not a bad time to make additions because valuations are so cheap,” he said.BNY Mellon is said to be one of three remaining contenders to buy Nikko, the Japanese asset management unit of Citigroup, although Sumitomo Trust and Banking is in pole position. Nikko Asset Management is Japan’s third-largest fund manager with around $90bn of assets under management. It is expected to be sold for more than $1bn.On the general topic of mergers and acquisitions, Jamie Brookes, global head of asset management communications at BNY Mellon, said in May the group was “often linked with potential M&A deals and receives a lot of interest from parties wanting to sell their businesses”.CreditSights says: “We note there were media reports that BNY Mellon was interested in acquiring BGI but seemed to have bid less than BlackRock was willing to pay. We believe BGI should have fetched between $7.5bn and $10.5bn, which is considerably lower than the $13.5bn BlackRock paid for the unit.“Given that more actively managed fund companies sold for premiums of 2 per cent and an index fund is a lower-margin business, we believe a price tag of 50 basis points to 70 basis points of assets under management is more suitable in this case.”BGI was eventually priced at 89 basis points.BlackRock will pay $6.6bn in cash and the rest in shares for BGI, with Barclays taking a stake of almost 20 per cent in the merged company. The UK bank’s chairman Bob Diamond and chief executive John Varley will both sit on the board of the new group, to be called BlackRock Global Investors.The transaction is expected to be finalised in the fourth quarter of this year. At close, BlackRock will have more than 9,000 employees in 24 countries.The BlackRock/BGI tie-up will create an asset management powerhouse with about $2,700bn of assets under management.

Currently, its only exposure to hedge funds is a £200m investment in replication strategies operated by State Street and Switzerland’s Partners Group.But the scheme will be selective in the funds it invests in. “We want to see them have a majority independent board,” said Emily Porter, portfolio manager, absolute return strategies.“[Independent directors] should be quite active, not just names on the board. We should be able to have a relationship with them. We think it is a developing focus across the industry.”The scheme will also restrict itself to investing only in hedge funds that feature on transparency platforms, such as those operated by Measurisk and RiskMetrics, which analyse the risk profiles of funds.“We have to have the ability to aggregate risk across sectors,” said Mike Powell, head of alternative assets. “Managers are a lot more willing to move onto these platforms than they have been in the past. It’s a happy compromise for the investors and manager.”
562;STT;State Street Corp;2009-07-05T08:25:05Z;Hedge fund clones grow in appeal;;Pioneers of hedge fund replication are reporting rising interest as investors consider returning to the asset class but remain wary of the underlying industry’s poor record on liquidity and transparency and its sky-high fees.State Street Global Advisors said its Premia clone had doubled in size to $400m (£244m, €285m) in the past year and that it was in final stage discussions with several more institutions.“Investors are reassessing their exposure to hedge funds. Once they re-emphasise their commitment there will be a huge amount of searches and I think hedge fund replication will account for a large part of the pool,” said Michael Arone, head of EMEA product engineering at SSGA.Andrew Lo, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and manager of two replication funds operated by AlphaSimplex, added: “We are also seeing a pick-up in interest. [The replication industry] has done what it said it would do in terms of tracking the broad-based performance of hedge funds.”Replication strategies are designed to produce the investment returns of the broad hedge fund industry, without having to invest in the funds themselves.Most strategies involve taking long and short positions in a dynamic basket of liquid assets, such as equity futures, Treasury bonds and currencies, to attempt to recreate the positioning of the underlying industry. Fees are significantly lower at 50-100 basis points a year.Meaningful performance data is starting to emerge for a number of products launched in 2006 and 2007 and the concept appears robust – in spite of a failure to follow hedge funds all the way down during the annus horribilis of 2008.Mike Powell, head of alternative assets at the UK’s Universities Superannuation Scheme, which has invested £200m in hedge fund clones, said: “In aggregate they have outperformed the hedge fund indices since inception.“Generally they did very well last year because they did not suffer from the illiquidity issues.“This year they are slightly lagging the individual managers, it takes a while to catch up with changing allocations.“We still feel that replication has a role to play in providing us with cheap, liquid exposure.”Yoni Epelbaum, managing director of equity derivatives at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said of Merrill’s Factor Index: “It has had a 90 per cent correlation with the HFR global returns index.”Replication strategies had previously struggled to raise assets, with investors wary of anything to do with hedge funds or innovative “black box” structures during last year’s turmoil.A source at one bank admitted: “We are nowhere near where we thought we would be.“Going through the fiduciary committees, the consultants, getting through the guards, that’s a tough slog.” But there are indications that clones now tick many of the boxes institutional investors are focusing on.“Clients need transparency and liquidity, they do not like lock-ups or want high fees. We have daily liquidity, full transparency and avoid single manager risk,” said Mr Arone.Tim Jennings, an executive director at JPMorgan, which has almost $1bn in its Alternative Beta Index, said: “We are seeing interest across institutional investors. They are saying ‘maybe I can’t find the next Renaissance, maybe I’ll just get the hedge fund beta, then I don’t have the Madoff issues.’. It’s a much safer way to play.”
563;STT;State Street Corp;2009-06-30T01:22:40Z;State Street mutual fund could face charges;;State Street disclosed on Monday that it had received a “Wells notice” from the Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating that the US regulator was preparing to bring charges against the custodial bank’s mutual fund operation for its foray into risky mortgage-backed bonds in 2007 and before.The SEC’s notice is the latest in a series of probes into whether State Street adequately disclosed to investors the risks associated with funds invested in bonds backed by subprime mortgages.William Galvin, Massachusetts’ top securities regulator, said in April that he was looking into State Street’s disclosures surrounding investments made by pension funds.Prudential Financial filed a suit against State Street in October 2007, seeking $80m to recoup losses sustained when two of the bank’s funds plunged in value with the collapse of the real estate bubble.One of the funds at issue is State Street’s Limited Duration Bond Fund, which was promoted to investors as an “enhanced cash” vehicle, designed to enhance the stability of rock solid investments with greater returns but without significantly adding risk.During the summer of 2007, the $1.4bn fund lost 37 per cent of its value, according to the Boston Globe. That sparked a lawsuit filed by the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, based in Dubuque, Iowa, which claimed it had lost $1m on the investment.In January 2008, William Hunt, head of State Street Global Advisors, stepped down.The bank also announced that it had set aside $625m to settle litigation arising from the implosion of the “enhanced cash” fund and other funds.In February of this year, State Street announced that it had paid $417m in settlements involving the funds.The fact that the SEC has issued a “Wells notice”, which allows State Street one last opportunity to dissuade members of the SEC’s enforcement division from seeking permission from the agency’s five commissioners to take action, suggests State Street is reluctant to cut a deal with the agency, says Richard Bove, an analyst with Rochdale Securities.“Two years after the fact, the SEC has concluded that State Street should be fined for improper sales practices”, says Mr Bove. “It appears they’ll go to court”.Mr Bove does not think the SEC’s action will have a significant impact on State Street’s business, which rebounded from the bad publicity surrounding the funds’ plunge in value two years ago.

566;STT;State Street Corp;2009-06-09T08:15:50Z;BlackRock nears $13bn BGI deal;;BlackRock looks set to seal the acquisition of Barclays Global Investors and become the world’s biggest money manager by Wednesday, according to people close to the talks.The US group plans to pay Barclays $12bn-$13bn (£7.5bn-£8.1bn) for BGI – half in cash and half in shares – to create a group with more than $3,000bn in assets under management, half as much again as nearest rivals such as State Street, Allianz and Fidelity.Bank insiders said the proceeds would boost Barclays’ 7 per cent tier one capital ratio – a measure of its balance sheet strength – by more than 1 percentage point, and bring it nearer to the expectations of the Financial Services Authority.Shares in Barclays rose 2 per cent to 289.2p in early London trading on Tuesday.Analysts said the BlackRock deal, as proposed, would be preferable to Barclays’ earlier plan to sell only iShares, the exchange-traded funds business of BGI.Sandy Chen at Panmure Gordon said: “This is a better deal all round. However, it does mean that Barclays, without BGI, will be more exposed to the earnings volatility of its investment banking operations”.Regulators have been more focused recently on immediate capital strength rather than future earnings stability. BGI carries a goodwill valuation in Barclays’ books of only £1.5bn. The gain on any sale would flow straight through to the bank’s capital ratios.The planned structure of the deal implies a hefty price for the 20 per cent stake that Barclays will take in BlackRock, a premium of about 40 per cent to the money manager’s current share price, although the stock has only a small free float.The deal would also see a clutch of Middle East investors buy a stake of 12-15 per cent in the US group. Sovereign wealth funds, including the Kuwait Investment Authority and the Qatar Investment Authority, would likely contribute close to $3bn in aggregate, with no one fund taking a stake larger than 4.9 per cent.The funds’ willingness to participate in the current climate reflects the strength of the relationship between these funds and Larry Fink, BlackRock’s founder and chief executive.In a brief statement on Monday, Barclays confirmed its talks with BlackRock and “a number of parties”.Additional reporting by Deborah Brewster in New York
567;STT;State Street Corp;2009-06-07T08:46:37Z;Plunging assets cast gloom over UK pensions;;Woe has been widespread for the respondents to FTfm’s annual pension survey. A drop of more than 25 per cent in assets managed for UK pension funds was needed to stand out from the crowd, while just four companies managed to grow their assets.The order of the top three, Legal & General Investment Management, Barclays Global Investors and Insight Investment Management, is unchanged, but the gap between the two exponents of passive investment and Insight has narrowed significantly.L&G’s 11.6 per cent and BGI’s 15.5 per cent drops in assets are not flattering, but in the context of plunging global markets, they do not necessarily point to client redemptions.“Active management has delivered poor performance in the last 12 months,” says Stephen Birch, head of manager research at consultant Hymans Robertson. “Asset flows have been to passive mandates and I see no reason why that trend would be broken.”Many active managers have seen their assets fall further, with most attributing the losses directly to market declines. Variations in outcome are as much down to the level of exposure to different markets as to over or underperformance, they say.“This last year the changes [in assets under management] are due to what sort of manager you are,” says Mark Miller, head of UK distribution at Fidelity International, which ended 2008 with a third less in UK pensions assets than it started with.Virtually the whole of this decline was due to market movements, says Mr Miller, adding that Fidelity had seen significant inflows in the second half of 2008, with the trend continuing this year. Fidelity’s ranking on the table was little changed as it slipped one place from 17th to 18th.Further up the table, there was more movement, as State Street Global Advisors slipped to sixth from fourth place, due to a 30 per cent drop in assets, while Hermes and BlackRock overtook it. Aberdeen Asset Management soared from 13th to seventh place on the back of a 3.3 per cent gain in assets.Just two other companies besides Aberdeen and Insight posted gains in assets: M&G looked virtually the same at the end of 2008 as it did a year earlier, while Invesco Perpetual scraped a gain of 7.5 per cent. Despite this, its ranking slipped a place to 24th, due to the inclusion of three new survey respondents, M&G, F&C and Threadneedle. Their presence was offset by the failure of Capital International and Legg Mason to respond to the survey.The active managers’ losses were mostly expected, as their poor investment performance or high profile mandate losses have been covered and commented on in the press throughout the year. Many are now busy putting the past behind them and counting their blessings.“We’ve had a tough year, but we’re pretty bullish,” says a spokesman for AllianceBernstein, which lost 40 per cent of its UK pension assets. The official, who preferred not to be named, says most of the decline was due to poor investment performance.Although AllianceBernstein does manage bonds, most of its international mandates are in global equities, in which its value strategy was hammered last year“We’re confident our strategies will recover as fundamentals drive the market again, not emotion,” says AllianceBernstein. The company, which aspires “to create the most trusted investment firm in the world” has already launched new strategies, including a global credit fund and a Talf opportunity programme, to take advantage of investment opportunities arising from the US Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility.AllianceBernstein is not alone in its positive attitude. “Active managers are talking very bullishly and excitedly about the opportunities available at the moment,” says Mr Birch. “The cynic says ‘They would say that, wouldn’t they?’, but they weren’t saying it nearly so loudly two years ago.”A more volatile market with lower overall returns does mean, in theory at least, there is more scope for active managers to add value by finding stocks likely to outperform, says Mr Birch.However bullish the managers may be they will have seen revenues plunge in line with assets.“The industry has tried to get away from there being a one-to-one link [between assets and revenues] with performance fees, but on the whole it is still there,” says Mr Birch, but this need not spell disaster.“In most instances this is a sufficiently high margin business for them to withstand losses [of assets] without becoming loss-making.”One eyebrow-raising result is that of Goldman Sachs Asset Management , which saw its assets from UK pension funds almost halve. Looking more closely, this loss was concentrated in the segregated mandates, since its pooled funds were only a third lower over the year.This is likely due to the well-publicised decision in April 2008 of the Mineworkers’ Pension Scheme to end its global equities mandate with GSAM.The mineworkers’ business was GSAM’s original foothold in the European asset management industry and its loss had a £4.5bn (€5.1bn, $7.2bn) impact on the company’s assets under management in 2008, according to an insider.UBS Global Asset Management posted significant losses for the second year in a row, which will have added to the misery for its parent bank UBS. The Swiss bank has suffered from a sea of troubles in the past year, with reputational and financial damage due to exposure to Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. The bank recently announced nearly 9,000 job cuts, but is reportedly planning to hang on to its asset management division.
568;STT;State Street Corp;2009-06-01T01:32:38Z;Asset manager hits back in lawsuit;;The market turmoil of 2007 and 2008 helped to trigger a host of lawsuits against many asset managers. Some are fighting back, and their tactics could offer a model for other firms responding to claims over subprime losses.The one to watch is State Street, whose investment arm, State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), is a defendant in at least six pending lawsuits in the US relating to active fixed income funds that suffered deep losses in 2007.In at least one case, State Street has filed counterclaims against the plan trustees pressing the litigation, turning many allegations around on the original plaintiffs. That case was first brought in 2007 by trustees for three pension sponsors – Unisystems, Nashua Corp and the Andover Companies – who accuse SSgA of breaching its fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (Erisa) by allegedly mismanaging certain bond funds and misrepresenting their risk. The two sides have traded volleys over State Street’s counterclaims.In the first counterclaim, State Street asks for contribution and indemnification, a common legal manoeuvre in Erisa lawsuits that would shift some or all of the blame for alleged market losses to the trustees and away from SSgA.The second counterclaim is more unusual: State Street accuses the trustees of breaching their own fiduciary duties by remaining invested in SSgA’s active fixed income funds. The firm is seeking damages on behalf of the pension plans.Attorneys for the trustees call both counterclaims “gross distortions” in memoranda, filed in March and April, supporting a motion to dismiss.“After more than a year of litigation, SSgA has adopted a new approach for dealing with the aftermath of its botched fixed income strategies – ‘blame the victim,’” writes attorney Derek Loeser, of the firm Keller Rohrback, in a recent memorandum on behalf of the class action plaintiffs.The multi-pronged approach to counterclaims is unusual but not unique. Nationwide Financial Services filed similar counterclaims in a lawsuit over mutual fund revenue-sharing payments. Those counterclaims were dismissed in August 2008, but for reasons that would likely not apply to the State Street case.Attorneys say Erisa cases are often driven by the details of the client relationships, making it difficult to speculate on the outcome of the State Street lawsuits.The size of the losses in 2007 and 2008 may force some managers to defend themselves more aggressively than in the past.“If the amounts at issue were smaller, a manager might be willing to make a payment to preserve the goodwill of its clients,” says Patty Cain, a partner and chair of the employee benefit and executive compensation practice group at the law firm Neal, Gerber & Eisenberg. “The amounts at issue here are too large to allow that to happen.”The roster of plaintiffs across the six pending lawsuits covers the spectrum of institutional investors, including pensions of all stripes as well as foundations, endowments and profit-sharing plans.Separately, but with similar claims, Prudential Financial is also suing State Street on behalf of numerous retirement plans. A Prudential spokeswoman says litigation is still ongoing.So far, State Street has paid out two-thirds of the assets of a $625m legal reserve fund, set up in late 2007.State Street declined to comment on the lawsuits. Attorneys for the plaintiffs in all six cases did not respond to interview requests. Only a few settling parties have been made public so far. The company made a settlement with the state of Alaska for about $6m in late 2007 and the town of Ridgefield, Conn. for about $1m in late 2008.The class action complaint from Unisystems, Nashua and Andover notes that the state of Alaska received 50 per cent of the assets it lost from investments in the SSgA daily government and corporate bond fund between June 30 and August 28, 2007.The complaint also quotes an October 16, 2007, exchange between Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo and State Street chairman and chief executive Ron Logue over the potential damages.Mr Mayo noted that State Street’s actively managed funds dealing with subprime securities dropped from $8bn to $3bn in three months.“So, does that mean your potential legal exposure is $5bn, and if it isn’t, can you size potential risk?” Mr Mayo asked during a conference call. Mr Logue replied that estimating risk is “a difficult thing to do”.Scott Johnson is a reporter with FundFire, a Financial Times publication
569;STT;State Street Corp;2009-05-31T17:56:56Z;Product popularity stirs competition;;"The exchange traded funds provider, iShares, a division, for the time being, of the UK’s Barclays, has bestrode the world of ETFs like a colossus in recent years.Yet its crown has begun to slip of late. In the two years to March 2009, iShares saw its European market share slip from 48.7 to 38.3 per cent, according to data from Barclays Global Investors. In the larger US market it fell from a commanding 60.7 per cent to a still impressive 52.7 per cent in the same period, with its assets under management also sliding by $33.4bn (£22bn, €25bn) to $226.7bn as tumbling asset prices outweighed net inflows.The fall in iShares’ market share is due to its disproportionate exposure to equities, which have suffered worse than most asset classes in the financial crisis. But as much as any other factor, it has been driven by intensifying competition in a product whose time has come.Aside from iShares, the ETF industry remains fragmented; no other provider appears in the top dozen ETFs, ranked by assets under management, in the US and Europe, according to BGI’s comprehensive database. The bulk of ETF providers seem happy to concentrate on their own market.“Many of the US companies that move into the European marketplace are boutique or midsize players,” says Murat Ünal, founder of Funds@Work, a Frankfurt-based consultancy. He cites Invesco Powershares, which has developed a niche in fundamental, rather than market cap-weighted, indices “where demand is not as big as on the traditional pure index side”.Even a provider with a deep-pocketed parent such as State Street Global Advisors, comfortably number two in the US with a 22.4 per cent market share, can only claim number 14 spot in Europe with 0.7 per cent.“State Street has products in Europe but their effort for Europe has been very limited. They have not had a significant sales force helping to sell or market the product,” says Deborah Fuhr, global head of ETF research and implementation strategy at Barclays Global Investors.Jan Altmann of 4asset-management, another Frankfurt consultancy, adds: “State Street have been a dominant player in the US for quite some time but they are not too popular in Europe. They have a very limited product range.”European players may be keeping a closer eye on Vanguard, which has expanded its US market share to
10.3 per cent and has opened a beachhead in London.One factor that has deterred a number of European players from expanding across the Atlantic is their partial reliance on their parent’s distribution channels.Deutsche Bank’s ETF section, db x-trackers, which has grabbed 18.1 per cent of the European market even though it launched its first ETF in January 2007, “has a captive audience to some degree”, says Mr Ünal, due to the bank’s strong position.Similarly, ETFlab has benefited from its relationship with parent Deka, owned by Germany’s network of savings banks, as have Commerzbank’s ETF arm and Xact Fonder, owned by Sweden’s Handelsbanken.Deutsche’s dbx has also been at the forefront of the development of fixed income and money market ETFs, an area that has not been savaged as badly as equities.Mr Altmann says: “dbx are very innovative. They are working systematically on their approach from both Frankfurt and London and the money market product has attracted a lot of money”. European players specialising in synthetic, rather than physical, replication of the underlying assets, also face a barrier in expanding into the US, which does not permit the synthetic approach.Having said that, Mr Ünal argues that even European investors are demanding greater transparency, hurting the likes of Crédit Agricole and Lxyor Asset Management, the ETF arm of Société Générale, whose European market share has slipped 3.6 points to 22.1 per cent in the past two years, but is still second only to iShares. “With the demand for products that are more transparent, Lyxor went the other way and introduced more leveraged ETFs, more active ETFs where the underlying issue is not so transparent,” says Mr Ünal.“It’s very difficult for investors to know what lies behind these products and there is issuer risk embedded in derivatives and swaps. In central Europe you will not find any institutional investors that would not ask for the underlying strategies.” Ms Fuhr adds: “Pension plans and private banks have always had concerns about the use of any derivatives.”Some of the smaller players have had widely deviating fortunes. Zurich Cantonal Bank has seen its European market share surge from 0.35 per cent two years ago to 3.3 per cent, almost entirely due to its hugely popular gold ETF.However, Ms Fuhr says Northern Trust and Spa ETF have exited the sector after failing to build critical mass while Powershares, which has seen its US market share slip from 6.3 to 4.9 per cent in the past two years, recently closed 19 ETFs, most of them its Rafi fundamental products. “I don’t think they have the level of uptake that they expected and the performance has not been above the standard indices,” she says.Attention will now turn to how iShares will fare in different hands, and how successful Source, the new ETF platform backed by Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, will prove.Mr Altmann believes CVC Capital Partners, the private equity group leading the chase for iShares, would be a “perfect” owner for it to pick up third-party business.“There is no conflict of interest, for example when you are a French bank and you don’t want to sell SocGen’s products. It could open up some new doors for iShares,” he says.As for Source, the portents do not look good. Ms Fuhr says that the new outfit, which will use swaps from its three parent counterparties, is out of step with the zeitgeist. Mr Altmann had bigger doubts. “Their products are more expensive than the existing ones and their product range is currently quite similar, so why should you buy them?”"
570;STT;State Street Corp;2009-05-31T17:55:49Z;Active ETFs: a little excitement could go a long way;;"Actively managed exchange traded funds have been on the market for more than a year but industry experts say it is too soon to tell whether they are ultimately going to be successful.Not only have these products been launched during the worst stock market downturn in a generation but, with only one year’s documented net asset flows and performance data, actively managed ETFs need more time to prove themselves, Rob Ivanoff, who covers ETFs for Financial Research Corporation, says.“They’ve only been on the market for one year and that’s not enough time for institutions to have fully adopted [the products],” he says, adding that three years is an industry standard benchmark. “Everyone is in wait-and-see mode.”ETFs, baskets of securities designed to track indices and trade like stocks, have been one of the most popular investment vehicles in recent years. Assets held within US ETFs today stand at $482bn, according to the Investment Company Institute, the industry body. That figure is a 16 per cent decline from a year ago but a 111 per cent increase from 2005.Actively managed ETFs have long been considered the Holy Grail of the industry. And, while many fund companies are in the process of launching active ETFs – State Street Global Advisors, Vanguard, Pimco and Barclays, among them – so far only a handful of companies have managed to bring them to market.Last month, for instance, Grail Advisors, the San Francisco-based firm, introduced its American Beacon Large Cap Value ETF, which is managed by three companies: Brandywine Global Investment Management; Hotchkis and Wiley Capital Management; and Metropolitan West Capital Management.The new Grail ETF is the first in a series of planned active offerings by the company. A second offering – an international equity ETF – is on track to begin trading later this year.In April last year, Invesco Powershares introduced a line of several active ETFs. The Alpha Q invests in a portfolio of 50 Nasdaq-listed securities, and the Alpha Multi-Cap is benchmarked to the S&P 500. Both the Active Mega-Cap and the Active Low Duration Fund are sub-advised by Invesco using quantitative models. The Active Mega-Cap invests in blue chip, large-capitalisation companies while the Active Low Duration Fund invests in a portfolio of US government and corporate debt securities.Powershares’ active funds have about $18m in assets as of end of March, according to FRC. “The response has been tepid,” says Mr Ivanoff. “They haven’t gathered net flows but the economic conditions aren’t great. We’re seeing outflows all around. They have $18m in total but it’s still something – especially when many funds are shutting down. I am a big optimist on actively managed ETFs.”He is not alone. Nearly half of all financial advisers believe the future is bright for actively managed ETFs. According to a survey last year by FRC, 48 per cent of financial advisers thought the products would gain traction and replace actively managed mutual funds in some client accounts.“ETFs have a lot of benefits [over mutual funds]: lower costs, greater tax efficiency, greater transparency, and liquidity,” says David D’Amico, president of Braver Wealth Management, the Boston-based money management firm.True, actively managed ETFs have slightly higher costs and are less tax-
efficient because of the trades but it is still a compelling model, he says. “Now, it’s all about performance. You have to have a track record and that’s going to take one, two, or three years to establish. There will be some ETFs that prove their ability to add alpha, and those will garner assets, and there will be some that don’t,” he says.Transparency issues will remain a difficult hurdle for active ETFs, say industry experts. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator, requires ETFs to disclose their holdings every day, whereas mutual funds are required to disclose theirs every six months.But active managers do not want to divulge their holdings for fear of being frontrun by the market. The issue is that hedge funds would see when an ETF buys a given stock and then start buying that stock on the theory that the ETF would continue to add the stock to its portfolio in the days and weeks ahead. This would, in turn, drive up the price the ETF pays for its shares.“As currently designed with what you can do in an active ETF, everything has to be fully transparent,” says Jim Ross, senior managing director of State Street Global Advisers. “There’s some good to that and there are some challenges to that.”In the future, mutual fund companies may introduce a “sister version” of their most popular actively managed funds in an ETF format. Some experts – including Richard Ferri, author of The ETF Book: All You Need to Know About Exchange Traded Funds – says that, until fund companies launch funds with well-known mangers, active ETFs will not gain much traction.“They are not even on the radar screen yet,” he says. “The problem is there have been no brand name managers. You need a big manager and that might cause people to get excited. Right now, there is no excitement.”"
571;STT;State Street Corp;2009-05-19T08:06:01Z;Repaying Tarp;US Treasury faces another unwelcome burden;"Bouncers usually restrict access into a club, not man the exits. Yet, the US Treasury – having made a show of limiting troubled asset relief programme funds to “healthy” banks – must now attempt to control a stampede for the doors. State Street on Monday became the latest large recipient to state its intention to repay the government, announcing a $1.45bn equity raising and an offering of debt not guaranteed by taxpayers. Its shares shrugged off the impending dilution to rally 8.5 per cent.Consolidation of the custody bank’s conduits helped rouse investors. A mark-to-market hit of $3.7bn is a price worth paying to alleviate uncertainty, especially as a portion of the writedowns will flow back to earnings should the assets continue to pay out. In any case, with the KBW Banks index more than double its early March low, it makes sense for banks to raise money now, whether or not they wish (or will be allowed) to pay back their public debts.The markets’ mood music indicates that wriggling free of Washington’s shackles for now trumps any earnings erosion to come from pricier capital. The powers that be, then, singularly failed to avoid creating a stigma linked to government support. The congressional brouhaha over executive compensation no doubt was key, both in motivating management to seek an early exit from the Tarp club and in cementing investors’ perception of a competitive disadvantage in hanging round too long.Managing the paybacks, now likely to happen in batches of banks, is another unwelcome burden for the Treasury. But repayments are also unhelpful to its goal of supporting lending. As more banks clear the requisite hurdles, pressure will increase on those remaining. That means greater temptation to show strength at any cost – such as Citi’s pricey offer of unguaranteed debt last week – or to exit Tarp prematurely. Somebody call security.State Street has begun selling $1.5bn in stock and will sell at least $500m in senior debt as part of the financial services group’s plan to repay money received under the US’s troubled asset relief programme.It is the latest in the big round of capital-raising by financial institutions following the Treasury-administered “stress tests”.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

572;STT;State Street Corp;2009-05-18T20:33:29Z;US stocks rally on retail hopes;;"US stocks rebounded on Monday following their first bruising week since the rally began in March as encouraging results from Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, raised hopes the economy would soon reach a bottom.Lowe’s, which is particularly sensitive to the housing market, easily beat analysts’ profit expectations, in spite of falling sales.The company also raised its outlook for the year as Robert Niblock, chief executive, boosted sentiment, saying: “We have seen consumer confidence improve [and] housing turnover show signs of a bottom.” Its shares rose 8.1 per cent to $19.94.Shares in rival, Home Depot, due to report on Tuesday, also performed well, rising 6.6 per cent to $26.02.Wal-Mart also picked up after Barron’s investment magazine said the stock was cheap, pointing out the company bought 19m of its own shares in the last quarter.Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal said the supermarket chain would revamp its electronics lines to attract customers who used to shop at the now- bankrupt Circuit City. Wal-Mart’s shares gained 3.7 per cent to $49.92.The optimism came after the market sold off last week following data showing retail sales fell in April.It helped the benchmark S&P 500 index advance back above 900 and into positove territory for the year, climbing 3 per cent to 909.71 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.9 per cent to 8,504.08 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained
3.1 per cent to 1,732.36.Meanwhile, Mr Niblock’s words on housing were supported by a survey showing confidence among US homebuilders increased to its highest in eight months.The growing optimism helped Lennar, the homebuilder, outpeform most of the S&P, up 13.7 per cent to $10.02.The company was further boosted by an upgrade from Citigroup, which cited improved liquidity following a recent debt sale.Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital, said: “Housing demand is beginning to respond to lower rates and off-the-chart affordability. But it is not clear whether this will mitigate what might happen later this year as people default on their loans.”Banking stocks also fared well amid the economic optimism after Goldman Sachs named Bank of America as a “conviction buy”. Goldman said BofA had made good progress on raising capital and had enjoyed a “solid” quarter in its mortgage and capital markets businesses.Meanwhile, Citigroup raised its full-year earnings outlook for the company to include what it made by selling its stake in China Construction Bank.Although Citi said BofA’s recent share issue meant 2010 earnings would be lower than previously thought, its analysts also commented that the bank may have already raised $4bn of the $17bn hoped for, suggesting the market is responding well to the increased supply.BofA’s shares rose 9.9 per cent to $11.73.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which are almost certain to be among the first banks to be allowed to repay government loans, rose 6.5 per cent to $143.15 6.7 per cent to $37.26, respectively.Even State Street, the fund manager, rose, in spite of announcing that it would issue $1.5bn of new stock as it looked to repay government bail-out money. The company also said its full-year operating profit would be below analysts’ predictions as it took a $3.7bn write­down after moving items on to its balance sheet.But the stock gained amid the wider buying, picking up 8.5 per cent to $41.79.State Street was the latest company to have recently issued shares, a trend that Nick Kalivas, analyst at MF Global, said was not encouraging. He said: “Capital-raising hints that profit growth may not be strong enough to facilitate business needs.”But Ben Warwick, chief investment officer at Sovereign Wealth Management, said: “The market seems to be absorbing the extra equity well. It looks like there is enough demand to soak up the additional supply.”Investors continued to bet on the immediate survival of MGM Mirage, the casino operator.They sent the shares 14 per cent up to $8.74 after JPMorgan upgraded the stock, saying bankruptcy was “off the table for two years, if not longer”."
573;STT;State Street Corp;2009-05-18T17:47:26Z;State Street begins stock sale;;"State Street has begun selling $1.5bn in stock and will sell at least $500m in senior debt as part of the financial services group’s plan to repay money received under the US’s troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).It is the latest in the big round of capital-raising by financial institutions following the
Treasury-administered “stress tests”.Some are hoping repay to Tarp money and others are raising capital because they have been told they need to.State Street, which was one of 19 financial institutions to receive money under the Tarp, is among those that were told it did not need more capital. State Street had the ability to weather “more adverse economic conditions”, the Treasury said.However, Tarp repayment conditions require that the institution shows it is able to raise capital independently.Goldman Sachs and Northern Trust are among others that have raised capital in hope of gaining approval to begin paying back their Tarp money.Bank of America, one of those that needed to raise capital, is believed to have raised $3bn to $4bn over the past 10 days by selling more than 250m new shares through an ATM, or “at the market” operation, according to a report issued on Sunday by Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup analyst. Goldman Sachs upgraded BofA to “buy” on Monday, estimating that its capital raising was 50 per cent complete.State Street also said on Monday it had taken a loss of $3.7bn after marking down the value of assets held in investment vehicles called conduits. State Street would take the conduits, which were held off its balance sheet and are now valued at $16.6bn, on to its balance sheet, the company said. Under the Basel II banking accord, that move would have been necessary by January next year.State Street is the world’s third-biggest custody bank and the world’s largest asset manager. Custody banks hold stocks and bonds in safekeeping and arrange settlements.It said that as a result of its conduit writedown, it estimated that operating earnings for the current year would be between $4.25 and $4.50 a share – higher than expected, after a one-time writedown to be taken in the second quarter.The news pushed State Street shares 8 per cent higher to $41 by noon in New York on Monday. The shares have halved in value over the past year."
574;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

576;STT;State Street Corp;2009-04-26T16:15:40Z;Hedge funds move to outsource processing;;"A lot has changed for hedge funds in the past year. The collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers alerted investors to the importance of counterparty risk, while the revelation that Bernard Madoff had made away with up to $50bn (£35bn, €38bn) in a giant Ponzi scheme thrust the importance of administrators and custodians into the spotlight as guardians of investors’ interest.In the US in particular, where many hedge funds have been self-administered without
question, the effect has been striking for hedge fund administrators and custodians.“The old system seemed to work pretty well as long as assets grew,” says Jack Klinck, head of global investment product services at State Street. “But now investors are really nervous. There’s a tremendous focus on ‘who’s your counterparty?’”Mr Klinck expects to see a number of large US hedge funds, which have until now done all their administration in-house, outsource this function in order to reassure their clients. “Self-administered hedge funds are looking like outliers now. They’re having to break their operating model.”The pressure for this change is coming from investors, according to David Aldrich, head of global investment services at Bank of New York Mellon. “They have institutional investors coming in saying ‘We want a known, credible fund administrator so if something goes wrong, we can sue them – and there’s some balance sheet behind that name’.”Mr Klinck concurs: “We’re getting questionnaires from the hedge funds’ clients. They’re doing site visits and due diligence – they want to come in and kick the tyres.”But giving away control of an internal process does not come easy to some hedge funds, used to playing everything close to their chests. Mr Aldrich says although investors are demanding some involvement of an independent administrator, the larger hedge funds are still not giving everything away.“Some want a parallel process,” he says. In effect, they allow an independent administrator to run the numbers in order to satisfy client demand, but keep on doing the work in-house as well.“They believe they understand the assets better than anyone else,” says Mr Aldrich. “The cost of doing this, while it is in the millions of dollars, is not material to their business.” He adds that even if a hedge fund were happy to outsource entirely “it’s not that easy to switch off all the accounting for $1bn”.However reluctant the hedge fund, however complicated the outsourcing operation, it seems a foregone conclusion that the vast majority of US hedge funds will move to some form of independent administration.“It’s not easy, but the alternative is a bleak one,” says Chris Adams, global product head for alternative funds at BNP Paribas Securities Services. “I wouldn’t want to be the person facing the trustees saying ‘it’s too difficult’.”Although European hedge funds have never had a tradition of self-administration, this does not mean they are unaffected by the events of the past year. They are also being scrutinised over the creditworthiness of their custodian, with implications for those
custodians.“We have a service model that’s now very much in demand,” says Mr Klinck. “We’ve gathered a lot of assets, although that’s against a lot of redemptions.“We see this as an opportunity to increase our market share. It’s about flexing our muscles a bit and taking market share from some of our weaker competitors.”Bank of New York Mellon is also licking its lips at the prospect of picking off some of the less solid competition. Mr Aldrich predicts the industry will see consolidation in the next few years, having grown at unsustainable rates for a while. “In the past, everything only went up. Profitability was there, assets were there, revenues were there. But when the value of assets falls by 40 per cent, what happens to the hedge fund administrators?“They’re struggling with the reality and perhaps looking for a white knight.” Mr Aldrich would like to see BNY Mellon in that role, but “it’s a question of timing”.He makes it clear the object of consolidation is likely to be the middle rank of administrators. Boutique HFAs, if they survive, will continue to serve a useful function for the smaller hedge funds whose business would be unprofitable for the larger companies.The industry may shift in other areas as well – there have been developments in the relationship between prime brokers and custodians, says Mr Aldrich."
577;STT;State Street Corp;2009-04-21T20:39:42Z;Financials rise as Geithner calms bank fears;;US stocks rebounded on Tuesday as Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, allayed fears over the health of the banking industry.Mr Geithner told a congressional panel that “the vast majority” of banks had more capital than needed, which encouraged buyers to enter the market after Monday’s bruising sell-off, during which the financial sector dropped 11 per cent.Citigroup picked up 10.2 per cent to $3.24, helped by comments from its chief executive Vikram Pandit that it would “repay every dollar” of bail-out money. Bank of America, which fell nearly 25 per cent on Monday following warnings in its results about deteriorating credit conditions, gained 9.2 per cent to $8.76.US Bancorp was another significant riser, jumping 20.9 per cent to $19.27 after making better profits than expected.State Street reported operating earnings marginally ahead of estimates as mark-to-market losses declined following a change in accounting standards from the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Its shares gained 17.9 per cent to $36.15.Lincoln National, the health insurer, surged after Bank of America recommended investors buy its stock and Reuters reported it would sell its Delaware Investments asset management unit. Its shares rose 20.3 per cent to $10.56.This helped the benchmark S&P 500 index rise 2.1 per cent to 850.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index gained 1.6 per cent to 7,969.56 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.2 per cent to 1,643.85.The overall rise in the financial sector masked falls from some companies as they missed earnings estimates, however.Keycorp, the Ohio-based bank, cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent per share as it reported its fourth straight quarterly loss. Its shares fell 4.7 per cent to $7.05.Bank of New York Mellon also cut its dividend, reducing it to 9 cents per share, after feeling the effects of falling global stock markets, which put potential customers off investing with the bank. Its stock lost 0.2 per cent to $27.98.“Much of Monday’s trade was technical, with short-sellers betting that the six week rally could not continue. A lot of the most bearish estimates were factored in to the share price already,“ said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The Nasdaq’s gains came as IBMand Texas Instruments announced better earnings than predicted.IBM climbed 1.9 per cent to $102.31 after surprisingly good earnings.This helped Microsoft which gained 1.9 per cent to $18.97. Oracle, which on Monday announced a deal to buy Sun Microsystems, a former IBM target, also rose, gaining 3.8 per cent to $19.53.Texas beat expectations and raised its forecast for full-year profits gave up its early gains, following other chip makers downwards, and fell 1.2 per cent to $17.11.Some of the biggest Dow components added to the morning’s flurry of corporate news. Caterpillar reported earnings ahead of predictions, helping its shares gain 3 per cent to $31.39 even though this equated to a loss once the cost of making redundancies had been factored in.AK Steel offered further strength to the industrial sector as lower costs helped it report a narrower loss than Wall Street had expected. Its shares jumped 13.8 per cent to $11.66.Du Pont also gained as it reported earnings in line with estimates. Even though the chemical maker cut its full-year outlook, predicting further weakening of demand, its shares picked up 4.9 per cent to $28.06.Merger partners in the drug industry Merck and Schering-Plough both fell after Merck missed estimates for its first-quarter earnings. Schering’s earnings came in ahead of expectations, but both companies declined as Merck cut its full-year outlook. Merck lost 6.7 per cent to $23.54 while Schering Plough gave up 4.1 per cent to $22.11.Coca-Cola lost initial gains after reporting earnings in line with estimates. Investors worried about disappointing sales numbers though, sending its shares down 2.8 per cent to $43.09.“Today’s moves are a confluence of bargain hunting, Geithner’s comments assuaging fears over banks and short-covering after yesterday’s falls,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.
578;STT;State Street Corp;2009-04-21T18:47:19Z;US custody banks hit by profits slump;;The fall in global markets during the past year has hit first-quarter profits at three large US custody banks and at BlackRock, the largest publicly traded fund manager.Custody banks hold stocks and bonds in safekeeping, and are responsible for settlement when they change hands.State Street, a custody bank but also the world’s largest asset manager after overtaking Barclays Global Investors following the sale of BGI’s iShares unit, saw profit fall 9 per cent to $476m.Assets under management fell 29 per cent to $2,000bn, while assets under custody fell 24 per cent to $11,300bn.Ron Logue, chief executive, warned that profits were likely to be down by at least 12 per cent in the coming year, indicating the worst was not over.Bank of New York Mellon cut its dividend to 9 cents a share, from 24 cents, saying that this would save $700m a year and help the bank quickly repay the $3bn it received under the government’s troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).BNY Mellon, which also has a large asset management division, said its profits fell 57 per cent to $322m.Rob Kelly, chief executive, said that “it feels like we’re at, or close to, the bottom” of the economic cycle, although he said loan losses could continue for some time.Northern Trust’s profits fell 58 per cent to $162m after its assets under management declined by 33 per cent – to $522bn – and assets under custody dropped by 29 per cent to $2,800bn.However, in the 2008 quarter it received $244m in proceeds from the initial public offering of Visa. Excluding that, its quarterly profit drop was 30 per cent. Northern Trust reiterated that it too wants to return its $1.6bn in Tarp money.Asset management firms almost never make a loss, because their revenue is derived from a fee on the money they manage. The 40 per cent drop in the Standard & Poor’s index compared with the same quarter last year has caused management fees to plunge.BlackRock’s profits fell 65 per cent to $84m. The drop was partly because of a loss of $153m from its co-investments and seed investments in its own funds.BlackRock attracted $138bn in new money in the 12 months to the end of March but its assets under management fell 6 per cent to $1,280bn, as a result of market falls. The drop was still much lower than other asset managers.
579;STT;State Street Corp;2009-04-17T19:14:14Z;Institutional investors in equities spotlight;;The main issue for global equity investors is whether the current rally is not simply a classic bear market correction, but the start of a new bullish trend.On Friday, equities were on course for their sixth consecutive weekly gain. A glance at leading equity benchmarks reveals that many have experienced a substantial rebound after hitting their lows in early March. The S&P 500 has rallied 28 per cent, while the technology-laden Nasdaq has risen 31 per cent.In Japan, the Nikkei 225 has climbed 26 per cent, while Hong Kong has jumped 38 per cent. In Europe the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index has posted a rise of 24 per cent, outpacing London’s FTSE 100, which has gained 16 per cent.Gains of more than 20 per cent suggest that investors believe a bottom has been reached in valuations and that there is more to the buying than just bearish investors closing out their short sales by buying back targeted stocks. Short interest peaked in March when stocks plunged. To some observers, the recent rally amid low trading volume is easily explained.In an interview with the Financial Times this week, Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, said the rally had been driven by short-term traders trying to take advantage of high volatility and not by large institutional or other long-term investors.“The real money investors [institutional and other long-term investors] are still waiting,” he said. “They want to make sure that what we saw in March is real. And I think once they are convinced you will know it. The market will have a totally different tone to it.”But that view is countered by State Street, a leading custodian bank which tracks equity flows closely.“Institutional investors are backing this rally,” says the trust bank in its latest research. “The belle of the ball is the US,” it notes, highlighting the fact that the US institutional equity inflows that it measures are near their highest levels in 12 years.Brad Durham, managing director at Emerging Portfolio Fund Research, says that since March 11, there has been an inflow of $3bn into US equity funds, excluding exchange-traded funds.Mr Durham adds that ETFs have seen significant outflows in the past six weeks, which suggests short covering as these were actively used to bet on the market falling in price earlier this year.With official interest rates set by central banks near zero in many countries, long-term investors fear there is a penalty for staying in cash and not investing in either equities or high quality corporate bonds. “We believe that investor excessive liquidity is playing a role,” say equity analysts at JPMorgan.Amid evidence that hedge fund redemptions are slowing, the bank says some funds “are deploying the sizeable cash cushions amassed in the past six months”.Given the extent of the rally, the tug-of-war between fear of risk and greed is becoming heightened. Plenty of risk aversion remains in the system with yields on short-dated government paper stuck at low levels.That said, there is also a sense that investment managers, who had fled to the safety and low yields of government bonds, are starting to worry that they may miss out on an equity rally that has the capacity to extend much further.“All at once, when the all-clear sounds, we are going to see investors ramp up their risk appetites,” says Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at Sterling Stamos. Ahead of that all-clear signal ringing out, investors still need to gauge the potential impact of US banking stress tests (set for release in early May) and further retrenching by consumers as the unemployment rate rises.“Massive amounts of government stimulus and the economy’s own natural healing powers may well be in the process of creating a bottom for the recession,” says Gordon Fowler, chief investment officer at Glenmede.Equity bulls argue that stocks should rally well ahead of the broad economy bottoming, as the market prices in a recovery.For his part, Mr Niederauer cautions that trading volumes have not risen above levels that would indicate that investors had regained confidence in market fundamentals. “I think we’re waiting for another rally, in my opinion, in around June and July,” he said.Meanwhile, flows into US equities are also facing competition, according to State Street. It says flows into emerging markets are running at their highest level since June 2007. Since hitting lows in early March, stocks in Brazil have risen 26 per cent, China has rallied 21 per cent, while Russia has surged 44 per cent.State Street says: “The cross-border equity flows of institutional investors suggest they are convinced that the US, UK and emerging markets will recover faster from the economic slump than the euro area.”Although European equity markets have rebounded strongly in recent weeks, State Street says: “The euro area stands aloof, ignored and neglected by institutional investors. Cross-border equity flows into the euro area have barely budged.” It concludes: “The euro area is an exception to what is a broad-based recovery in cross-border equity flows and risk appetite.”
580;STT;State Street Corp;2009-04-05T07:44:27Z;Rethink underway as some securities lending suspended;;The practice by big investors of lending the securities they hold to other market participants went unremarked for years.Then the credit crunch arrived, money market funds ran into problems, investment banks went bust, and short sellers making use of borrowed stock were vilified.In fact, securities lending turned out to be riskier than many lenders had appreciated, from both a business and a reputational point of view.Investors have reacted by reviewing their lending programmes to make sure the return justifies the risks, making adjustments to limit the risks, and in some cases switching lending agencies to make sure there is someone solid there if anything else goes wrong.Some have suspended lending activities, while a few have withdrawn completely. State Street, for example, says 10-15 per cent of its clients have terminated or suspended programmes while another 10 per cent have made big changes.Chris Angell, principal at Mercer Sentinel, says: “A fair proportion [of clients] have hung in there. But at the extreme, some want out. You have to divide reactions between pension funds and others who lend through agency programmes that use cash collateral and those that don’t.”This is the big issue to have come out of the credit crisis for securities lending. When stocks are lent, lenders get collateral in the shape of securities or cash they can call on if the lent securities are not returned. Cash collateral is the norm in the US while non-cash predominates in Europe.The former has the potential to offer a higher return through reinvestment, usually in commingled money market funds run by custodian banks acting for lenders. Some of these funds have suffered well-documented problems from the early days of the credit crunch because of exposure to mortgage backed securities and other toxic assets.“Some cash collateral pools were invested in all the horrors and had to impose restrictions on [lenders] getting money out and ask the client to share the losses,” says Mr Angell. The reinvestment risk is generally the lender’s, he adds, as the lending agent does not indemnify against losses.“If they really want out they are going to crystallise some substantial losses, so most are negotiating a progressive withdrawal.”This is in contrast to the experience of lenders in non-cash collateral programmes. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September it was a common problem that stock on loan was not available for return on the due date. “But the collateral arrangements worked well and most pension funds were made whole quickly – under a fortnight,” says Mr Angell.“Because the collateral is marked to market on a daily basis and the haircut [the percentage that is subtracted from the par value of assets being held as collateral] was significant, the agents got it right so there was enough collateral to deal with the volatility. And where there wasn’t enough the agent stood behind and made the client whole, as they should.”He says Mercer Sentinel has been advising its clients to review the risk/return trade-offs in their lending programmes and the basis on which they are run. “We have not advised blanket withdrawals from lending, but would probably advise a new client not to lend.”When it comes to advising on lending agents, Mr Angell says programmes vary significantly, even among the major custodians. HSBC, for example, does not do cash collateral programmes, while those that do vary in their approach to running such programmes.Northern Trust mostly use commingled pools for cash reinvestment and has had to deal with losses. Northern Trust is being sued over 401k losses related to securities lending, it was reported last week.JPMorgan runs customised accounts rather than pooled funds and according to Paul Wilson, global head of sales for securities lending at JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services, “has always been conservative in its management of cash collateral”. The firm is “really committed to separately managed accounts”, and he is “delighted others are committed to commingled pools because it is a point of real differentiation”.Lending agents such as HSBC that have stuck to non-cash collateral programmes are concerned that the reputation of the securities lending business has been damaged by the losses suffered by lenders in some cash collateral programmes. Some say agents running such programmes suffer a conflict of interests, as they collect a share of the net profits from cash reinvestment programmes but do not share the losses.There is a fear that all lending agents have been “tarred with the same brush” as one put it, whether they run cash collateral programmes or not.Supply of stock available for lending has fallen by up to 30 per cent since Lehman Brothers went bust according to some, although Data Explorers puts the reduction at about 13 per cent globally. Demand has also fallen due to deleveraging and restrictions that were, and in some countries still are, in place on shorting.Chris Taylor, head of securities finance for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street, says demand has fallen by a half to three-quarters and is back at levels typical of 2003-05.Mr Wilson of JPMorgan says the revenue outlook from securities lending “looks less positive than in the past”, but has grown in importance because it is a source of return.
581;STT;State Street Corp;2009-04-05T07:31:37Z;Collateral management: Concerns over risks sharpens the focus;;In normal times, collateral management is one of the more humdrum corners of the global financial systems, quietly humming away in the background while fortunes are made and lost in more exciting arenas.Of course, these are far from normal times, and the disasters befalling such giants of the financial jungle as Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and AIG have put counterparty risk, and hence collateral management, under unprecedented scrutiny.Stories abound of hedge funds, once perceived as the weakest link in the financial chain, shunning the services of the prime brokerage arms of big banks, those erstwhile bastions of fiscal probity, as they search for a safe haven for their assets.Yet the business of managing collateral – assets such as cash, bonds and equities held to cover price movements in outstanding derivatives contracts – has been expanding rapidly for a number of years.State Street estimates that the total value of assets held as collateral rose 60 per cent to $2,100bn (£1,460bn, €1,589bn) last year, having expanded at a compound annual growth rate of 35 per cent since 2000, when it was a mere $200bn. It attributes this dramatic expansion to rapid growth in usage of over-the-counter derivatives as well as concerns over counterparty risk.However, it is very much the latter that is driving growth today as asset managers scramble to tighten up their procedures so as to be less exposed to potential losses from an uncollateralised in-the-money derivative contract if a counterparty was to go under.“Counterparty risk is a critical concern and collateral management has always been a very effective tool for addressing counterparty risk,” says Kirit Bhatia, global head of sales for collateral management at JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services.More regular posting of collateral is an obvious way to stop unfunded exposures from building up. “In the past, counterparty risk and the collateral that was attached to that was monitored on a monthly or weekly basis. Now everyone is looking for solutions on a daily basis,” says Joerg Ambrosius of State Street.Chris Sier, director at Alpha Financial Markets Consulting, sees a similar pattern. “Collateral management is the key issue out there and you should be doing that on a daily basis, or even intraday for some derivatives,” he says.Before Lehman “a lot of managers were doing monthly or weekly collateral calculations and often allowed their counterparty [ie. their broker] to do both the reporting and calculations”, he adds.However, with at least one bank believed to have inflated valuations of its derivative contracts to strengthen its balance sheet, “people have wised up that you can’t rely on the counterparty”. says Mr Sier, with a more bilateral process in which both parties calculate their own valuations increasingly becoming the norm.While some asset managers are outsourcing this function to an independent valuer, such as Market Partners, SuperDerivatives or OTC Valuations, those with strong in-house quantitative management teams are increasingly calculating the value of their own OTC derivatives.As well as a trend towards more frequent collateralisation, Mr Sier is also seeing evidence of lower thresholds, the minimum amount a derivative has to move from its original price before collateral has to be posted, a process that is being spurred as much by heightened levels of market volatility as concerns over counterparty risk.What is more uncertain is the range of assets that will ultimately be deemed acceptable as collateral.According to State Street, cash, the most liquid of assets, has come to dominate the market in recent years, representing 78 per cent of all collateral posted in 2008. However, Mr Ambrosius says that figure is starting to fall, as “cash is a scarce resource these days”. He sees a move towards government bonds.Mr Bhatia also sees greater use of government paper, but in addition believes equities will play a greater role in collateralisation, despite the “haircut” – the percentage that is subtracted from the par value of assets being held as collateral – typically having doubled from 5 to 10 per cent.“For many participants, equity collateralisation is preferable. Equities are more easily liquidated than many forms of fixed income,” he says. “People are tightening up their risk parameters and there is much more emphasis on being able to liquidate quickly.”Even within the cash sphere change is afoot. Some asset managers that had insisted on full cash collateralisation still lost money last year because this cash was re-invested in everything from asset-backed paper to Lehman debt – a disastrous policy in hindsight. Safety first is now the order of the day.“Reinvestment is very conservative these days. We use triple A money market funds,” says Mr Ambrosius. “There is a trend towards the highest quality and highest liquidity. Clients would rather give up some return to be in more secure assets.”Despite these piecemeal improvements, some would like to see a more coherent and universal model emerge.Mr Sier is among them, calling for the development of a central clearing hub for OTC derivatives, with this universal clearer conducting the valuations, thereby setting the de facto price for the wider market. In essence it would become a quasi exchange.“I think it needs government or regulatory input because everyone is interested in their own proprietary models. Central clearing has to be the answer. It won’t happen overnight, it will be one instrument at a time,” he saysMr Ambrosius supports the central clearing concept, but sees a lot more work to be done in the meantime. “[Central clearing] would be the optimal solution. In theory, it would make a lot of sense, but the question is, is that going to come and how quickly? The need is today.”
582;STT;State Street Corp;2009-04-02T16:25:26Z;View of the Day: Rethinking reserves;;Investors should not dismiss the importance of the recent proposal by Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, to create a new international reserve currency and make greater use of IMF special drawing rights, says George Hoguet, global investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.“The political and structural impediments to such a plan appear to suggest that implementation is years away. But it confirms that China will rapidly play an increasingly vocal and influential role in international monetary affairs and that the terms of discourse will never be the same.”Mr Hoguet notes that China’s reserves stand at nearly $2,000bn, enough to buy 10 per cent of the companies in the FTSE World Index. He says China has no interest in undermining an already destabilised world economy and will proceed cautiously – but may promote the creation of a market in SDR-denominated assets.“The events of the past 18 months confirm that many investors and corporate managements have limited ability to envisage ‘the unthinkable’,” he says.“The ‘exorbitant privilege’ the US enjoys, through the global reserve currency status of the dollar, will not end soon – but clearly a fault line is opening. Rather than reduce international exposure, investors should consider a strategic plan for China and further diversify in the face of growing monetary uncertainty.”
583;STT;State Street Corp;2009-03-23T21:34:54Z;Financial sector leads charge on Wall Street;;"US stocks made their biggest surge since October on Monday, putting the benchmark S&P 500 index above 800 points for the first time in more than a month.Financial stocks led the way on the back of details of the plan from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, to clear toxic assets from banks’ balance sheets.Banks were some of the highest risers, as Mr Geithner moved to allay fears that participating in the plan might have an effect on future pay structures.Citigrouprose 19.5 per cent to $3.13, Bank of America gained 26 per cent to $7.80 and Wells Fargorose 23.9 per cent to $17.33.Other financial companies also performed well. Insurers Prudentialand Lincoln National rose 26.5 per cent to $21.11 and 32.7 per cent to $9.70 respectively, while State Street, the asset manager, gained 21.4 per cent to $29.97.“There is a lot more detail in Mr Geithner’s latest plan,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford. “Investors believe this plan, at least initially, is the most viable possible one for cleaning up the banks. The most serious problem will be the pricing of assets, but for now, the equities market is relieved just to see some detail.”But Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said: “This is something that could have ended this much, much earlier, but now it’s just a mild positive.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 7.1 per cent up at 822.92 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.8 per cent to 7,775.86 points, while the Nasdaq Composite index gained 6.8 per cent to 1,555.77 points.The last time the S&P gained as much was on the back of a cut in interest rates from the Federal Reserve last year. Financial stocks staged their biggest rally since November.President Barack Obama also helped calm nerves on Wall Street when he sounded less than positive about a bill passed by the House of Representatives on Friday to impose a 90 per cent tax on the bonuses of high earners at bailed-out banks. Mr Obama said the government needed to find ways of reacting “that are both legal, that are constitutional”, fuelling hopes he may veto it if it passes the Senate.“The movement to tax the bonus of Tarp [troubled asset relief programme] players has put a cloud over the financial industry, and risks slowing the recovery of the financial sector and economy,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Energy stocks rose, following the oil price, which reached new highs for the year. Chevrongained 6.9 per cent to $69.15 and Exxon Mobil rose 6.7 per cent to $70.53.Investors also took confidence from better figures on sales of existing homes in February. They had been expected to fall, but rose by 5 per cent on the previous month.Homebuilders were some of the best-performing stocks on the S&P. Lennar rose
20.4 per cent to $9.76, whileKB Homepicked up 15.4 per cent to $12.98.Steel companies helped the industrial sector rise more than most after Citi said macroeconomic conditions pointed to a better future. Citi wrote: “The manufacturing downturn is no longer accelerating at this point, and upside opportunity outweighs downside risk in our opinion.”Nucor, one of the country’s largest steelmakers, rose 7.3 per cent to $40.20, while AK Steel picked up 14.3 per cent to $7.90 and US Steelrose 12 per cent to $22.08.General Electric also boosted the sector after Moody’s cut its rating by two notches, but gave it a stable outlook. Investors
had expected worse and the company’s shares rose 9.3 per cent to $10.43.Intelrose 5.9 per cent to $15.52 after the company said it would overhaul its pay structure, with no rise to executives’ pay.There was also good news for consumer companies as luxury jeweller Tiffany gained 15.5 per cent to $23.37 after its earnings beat analysts’ expectations in spite of a 34 per cent fall in sales in its flagship Manhattan store for the past quarter.Walgreen, the pharmacy chain, also beat expectations, with reduced profits coming from reorganisation costs rather than falling sales. Its shares advanced
9.4 per cent to $26.58."
584;STT;State Street Corp;2009-03-22T22:56:39Z;More job losses at money managers;;US money managers are preparing another round of job losses, and are seeking to cut costs even further as investor redemptions show no signs of slowing.Capital Group, the parent of one of the largest managers, American Funds, has told employees in an internal memo that it will eliminate more jobs, its third round of cuts in the past six months. The latest move is part of a cost-cutting plan that includes a freeze on pay rises, Capital said. It has already cut close to 600 people, or 6 per cent of its staff. Prior to the current crisis, the group had only cut jobs once in its 78-year history.The memo said: “Given the continuing business decline, deeper cost-cutting measures will need to be pursued. Unfortunately, these will include the elimination of jobs across many groups.”Almost all fund companies have cut jobs in the past six months, and they are taking the unusual step of cutting fund managers as well as back office and support staff. Money managers have typically had a drop in assets under management of more than a third during the downturn, as a result of both heavy investor redemptions and performance losses.Fidelity late last year said it would cut 7 per cent of staff, or more than 3,000 people. Franklin Templeton, MFS, BlackRock, AllianceBernstein, State Street, Legg Mason, Janus and Putnam are among others that have reduced staff numbers.Even Pimco, one of few firms to have had an increase in assets under management, has cut jobs in London and Munich.The pressure on smaller companies is greater, as they lack the scale to absorb large cash outflows. Boston Company Asset Management lost 89 staff, almost a third of its employees, after its assets under management fell by half. The group, which manages the Dreyfus funds, is part of BNY Mellon.Pay freezes have become another common tactic to combat shrinking revenues. Of the 25 largest fund companies, only nine have attracted net new money to their stock and bond funds in the 12 months to February, Morningstar said.Hedge funds, which were a huge source of job growth in the financial sector during the past six years, have contracted sharply. Close to 1,500 hedge funds, a record 15 per cent of the total, closed last year, according to Hedge Fund Research, and liquidations have continued.
585;STT;State Street Corp;2009-03-01T12:07:45Z;Alarm at derivatives trades;;The volume of over-the-counter derivatives trades is threatening to overwhelm legacy clearing and settlement systems, according to State Street.The global custodian bank warned that “significant investment” was needed to confirm, process and manage the risk of derivatives, which in many cases are still being serviced using technology designed to handle traditional equity and fixed income transactions. “It is crucial that the sell-side community, the financial services industry and regulators work together to develop new approaches to processing and servicing these complex transactions,” said Jay Hooley, president and chief operating officer of State Street.Although trading volumes of some derivatives have fallen in the past year as the activity of hedge funds and investment bank proprietary trading desks has fallen, the notional value of outstanding OTC derivatives tripled to $596,000bn (£417,420bn, €470,340bn) between 2003 and 2007, according to the Bank for International Settlements.Martin Higgs, European derivatives manager at State Street, said he believed some asset managers had been forced to compensate unit holders for losses caused by inaccurate confirmation of OTC derivative trades.According to Mr Higgs, many of the problems stem from bottlenecks in the drawing up of ISDA [International Swaps and Derivatives Association] confirmations, the legal documents that are created, often manually, to support each OTC derivative transaction.“Some organisations have backlogs of thousands of trades, or may have a one-month delay,” he said. As a result, discrepancies between the confirmations produced by two counterparties may not be noticed in time for the contract to be unwound.Rather than pass on potential losses from these mis-recorded trades to end investors, asset managers are instead taking the hit to avoid incurring the wrath of regulators, Mr Higgs believed.In addition, many buy-side houses are still relying on their investment bank counterparties to provide mark-to-market pricing of their derivatives, said Mr Higgs, potentially leading to inaccurate pricing.“The sell-side has an incentive not to give the right answer. They have a direct interest in what the value is because it is probably driving their bonus,” said Mr Higgs.
586;STT;State Street Corp;2009-02-17T16:01:44Z;View of the Day: The yen is heading for a fall;;The yen is overvalued and its status as a “safe haven” currency is likely to come under scrutiny, says Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets.He argues that analysts typically fall back on either current account positions or, better still, net foreign asset positions as a guide to which currencies should perform in times of heightened risk aversion.“The rationale is that investors respond to reduced risk appetite by cutting their exposure to international investments,” Mr Metcalfe says.This theory appears to be supported by the fact that Japan has one of the largest surpluses on its net foreign asset position – and therefore the biggest potential for repatriation flows – and the yen has appreciated strongly.But Mr Metcalfe points out the Japanese are not repatriating. “Indeed, quite the reverse. Money is flowing out of Japan into foreign bonds and, more unusually, foreign equity markets too. This implies it has been the perception of – or potential for – repatriation that has drawn investors into bets that the yen will rise.”He says both speculative and institutional investors now hold significant long positions in the yen.“The question is whether investors will hang on to these bets, as the reality is that the yen is overbought and overvalued and Japan’s economy is sinking fast. It has the potential to be a safe haven, but the reality may prove different if Japanese investors keep buying foreign assets.”

Investors appeared to welcome the group’s aggressive attempts to increase its capital by slashing its dividend and bonus payments.Moody’s rallied 4.8 per cent to $23.19 on better- than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, although the group forecast full-year profit below existing estimates.Credit card groups received a boost after Visa and Mastercard also unveiled better-than-expected earnings. They rallied 9.4 per cent to $53.74 and 14.1 per cent to $159.84, respectively.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 1.6 per cent at 845.85 to remain within a 65-point intraday trading range that it has not left in the last week. Traders said the market has struggled to find momentum in part because of the uncertainty over the new administration’s plans to deal with the stricken banking sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 8,063.07 and the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 2.1 per cent to 1,546.24.Retail stocks held up relatively well in spite of largely downbeat January sales figures. Overall, same-store sales declined by an average of 1.8 per cent last month, according to Thomson Reuters data, which although glum was nevertheless better than the 2.3 per cent drop that had been expected.Consumer staples – which had led the market lower in the previous session, when the latest batch of glum corporate earnings took in erstwhile defensive food companies – took comfort from Wal-Mart’s sales figures.Shares in the world’s largest retailer rallied 4.6 per cent to $48.56 after the group disclosed that same-store sales rose 2.1 per cent in January, better than expected.However, the gains were limited as the group said it would only issue quarterly rather than monthly sales guidance because of the volatile trading environment.Elsewhere in retail, Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Brands enjoyed particularly positive market reaction to their figures, up 10 per cent to $19.98 and 6.9 per cent to $8.40, respectively.The leading indices opened lower after US Department of Labor data showed unemployment benefits unexpectedly jumped last week to a fresh 26-year high. Initial jobless claims increased to 626,000 from an upwardly revised figure of 591,000 the previous week.Investors will keep a close eye on the much-anticipated non-farm payroll report due for release on Friday.Elsewhere, homebuilders did well, up 5.4 per cent overall, helped by Senate approval of expanded tax credit plans for home buyers.Better-than-expected fourth-quarter results from Cigna, up 18.7 per cent to $21.39, gave the health insurance sector a boost.Meanwhile, technology came under early pressure following results from network equipment maker Cisco. Although headline earnings for the latest quarter were better than expected, investors focused on a forecast that was well below expectations.Dell lost 3.7 per cent to $9.43 after JPMorgan downgraded its recommendation on the stock to “underweight”.However, the sector rallied with the wider market and finished 2.2 per cent higher. Cisco closed up 3.2 per cent to $16.35 in volatile trade.The material and energy sectors were the best performing of the day, helped by strength in commodity markets. They rose 2.6 and 2.7 per cent, respectively.
590;STT;State Street Corp;2009-02-05T15:05:29Z;State Street slashes dividend and bonuses;;State Street on Thursday said it would slash its dividend and cut bonuses for its top executives in an effort to raise capital.The big custody bank will reduce its quarterly shareholder dividend to 1 cent a share from 24 cents. It also lowered its forecast for 2009, reflecting a grim market outlook.“These are extraordinary times that require swift action,” Ronald Logue, State Street’s chief executive, said in a statement.Bonuses will be cut for the five top executives and reduced by 50 per cent for the rest of the company. State Street’s moves are intended to increase “organic capital growth” and to reduce the size of its balance sheet, which has been hit by bond losses and the costs of propping up its investment funds.Last month State Street, the world’s biggest institutional money manager, raised fresh fears about the US financial sector after reporting a 71 per cent drop in quarterly net profits. Its share price fell by more than half in a day.In December the bank announced that it would cut 1,700 jobs, or 6 per cent of its workforce. It took fourth-quarter charges from the cuts and from shoring up its stable value funds totalling more than $450m.On Thursday the Boston-based bank revised its 2008 earnings up to $4.30 a share from $3.89 a share. However it projects 2009 operating revenue to decline by 8 to 12 per cent from the year before and operating profits to fall by 12 to 16 per cent.In recent months, State Street has been the subject of takeover speculation on Wall Street. The list of acquirers thought to be interested in its attractive deposit base includes Goldman Sachs, US Bancorp and Bank of New York.Shares of State Street rose 1.70 per cent to $24.54 in early trading on Thursday.

financial crisis.Wells Fargo leapt 30.9 per cent to $21.19 as investors overlooked its first quarterly loss since 2001 and focused instead on the disclosure that it would not seek additional capital from the government’s troubled asset relief programme and that it would maintain its quarterly dividend.Regional lenders also did well, up 14.3 per cent overall. Among custodian banks, State Street leapt 31.4 per cent to $25.77.“We’ve had all that public chatter about possibly nationalising banks . . . that would totally destroy the equity,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital. “What the market wants is less uncertainty every day [and] it seems like we’re solidifying on a good bank / bad bank approach.”Insurers were key winners after a group of state insurance regulators endorsed industry proposals to ease capital requirements.MetLife and Lincoln National jumped 20.2 per cent to $33.27 and 21.8 per cent to $20.64, respectively.Financials dominated the leaderboard as the benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 3.4 per cent at 874.09, leaving it more than 16 per cent away from an 11-year low it hit in November.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.5 per cent higher at 8,375.45 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 3.6 per cent stronger at 1,558.34.The market hit session highs after the Federal Reserve indicated it was ready to push ahead with the unconventional move to buy long-term Treasuries.During the morning, the S&P rose above its 50-day moving average – a key technical level – for the first time in nearly three weeks.The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 6 per cent to hit its lowest level since the first full week of the year.The S&P had already enjoyed a three-day winning streak, only the third such run of gains since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, according to Bespoke Investment Group.Financials have been the key winners. The sector overall has climbed 28.1 per cent since hitting its lowest level since 1995 last week.Outside the financial sector on Wednesday, most stocks enjoyed more modest, but nevertheless strong, gains.Technology rallied 3.7 per cent overall, given a boost from better-than-expected figures from Yahoo and Sun Microsystems. Shares in the search group and server manufacturer jumped 7.9 per cent to $12.24 and 21.8 per cent to $4.86, respectively.Most earnings continued to be downbeat. Boeing, among the most high-profile, edged 0.1 per cent higher to $43.24 despite worse-than-expected figures. Bulls have argued that the market has stopped reacting adversely to bad news.Negative earnings surprises – when companies miss forecasts – are now at a 10-year high, according to Merrill Lynch.Still, Richard Bernstein, strategist, wrote: “Investors do not seem to realise that credit problems so far have largely manifested themselves in traditional ‘early cycle’ sectors…and seem unaware of the risks to mid- and late-cycle sectors [such as energy, industrials, materials and technology].”Telecoms was the worst performing sector and spent much of the session in the red in the wake of a fall in profit at AT&T, which dipped 0.1 per cent to $25.91 Still, by the wider sector found positive territory, up 1.3 per cent overall.Verizon, which fell 3.3 per cent in the previous session as the group’s fourth-quarter profit trailed some expectations, recovered 3.2 per cent to $30.92 after Citigroup reiterated its “buy” recommendation on the stock, highlighting opportunities in its wireless division.Energy stocks, up 2.3 per cent, tracked the oil price higher. Defensive sectors underperformed as investor risk appetite returned. Healthcare, consumer
staples and utilities rose 1.3 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively."
592;STT;State Street Corp;2009-01-21T21:43:30Z;Banking stocks lead Wall Street recovery;;Banking stocks led a strong recovery on Wall Street on Wednesday after a raft of earnings, some not as dire as feared, attracted bargain hunters back to the battered sector.Financial institutions that have endured epic falls in recent sessions made a comeback during the market’s best performance in more than a month, which recovered much of the heavy inauguration-day losses.Custodian banks did well after coming under particularly heavy selling pressure in the previous session in the wake of bleak earnings and unrealised losses from State Street. The sector received a boost from better-than-expected fourth-quarter from Northern Trust, which leapt 30.9 per cent to $57.51.“To think all the banks are in the same abyss…that’s not necessarily the case,” said Christopher Colarik, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment. “But whether this is a bounce that’s going to have legs in really the question.”State Street, whose shares more than halved in the previous session, recovered 14.6 per cent to $17.07.PNC Financial Services jumped 37.1 per cent to $30.16 as investors were relieved that it was not seeking yet more capital.Even US Bancorp, whose 65 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profit was even worse than expected, found positive territory.The shares closed up 4.9 per cent to $16.09 even though the figures prompted Standard & Poor’s to downgrade its view to ‘sell’ and warned the group would need to cut its dividend.Financials, up 14.6 per cent overall, dominated the leaderboard. Citigroup, which sank 40 per cent last week and 20 per cent in the previous session, bounced 31.1 per cent to $3.67. JPMorgan climbed 25.1 per cent to $22.63 and Bank of America31 per cent to $6.68.Trading in the wider market was volatile and the benchmark S&P 500 index briefly entered negative territory during the morning.But the S&P 500 closed up 4.4 per cent at 840.25 after a strong rally into the close. That was back above a nadir reached last month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 3.5 per cent higher at 8,228.10 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 4.6 per cent stronger at 1,507.07.Still, some observers questioned the view that the new administration would help the equity market maintain momentum.Edward Kerschner, chief investment strategist at Citi Global Wealth Management, wrote in a report: “While high expectations have, historically, mostly been associated with poor equity performance in the post-election year, low expectations [for example, for Clinton and the two Bush presidencies] have mostly been associated with good performance.”Technology was the best-performing sector outside financials, up 5.4 per cent overall on unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter results from IBM. The stock advanced 11.5 per cent to $91.42, helped by a full-year outlook that topped expectations.Other earnings were due for release after the market closed, including Apple, up 5.9 per cent to $82.83.Meanwhile, the energy sector received a boost as oil prices rallied.Retailers and homebuilders came under pressure throughout the day, but although the two sectors underperformed the market, they nevertheless finished higher overall in the broad based rally.Homebuilders ended 2.1 per cent stronger in spite of more gloomy data for the sector. A preliminary reading of the National Association of Home Builders’s index, which measures industry sentiment, fell in January to the lowest level since the gauge was created 24 years ago.Bucking the upward trend in retail, Coach lost 7.3 per cent to $14.72 after the handbag maker disclosed a fall in second-quarter profit.Wal-Mart fell 2.8 percent to $49.14 after Credit Suisse cut its view of the world’s largest retailer from “outperform” to “neutral”.“Even Wal-Mart is not immune to the economic slowdown,” wrote Michael Exstein, analyst. “The incremental benefit it realized from consumer trade down in 2008 might not repeat itself in 2009.”Airlines also ignored the positive momentum as the volatile oil price hurt earnings.AMR and UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, both disclosed a fourth quarter loss and the shares dropped 23.7 per cent to $7.98 and 6.1 per cent to $10.91, respectively.
593;STT;State Street Corp;2009-01-21T20:03:55Z;Nationalisation is not a panacea;;Four months is a very long time in financial markets.In mid-September, as the credit crisis swirled around Wall Street, I wrote a column recommending that Hank Paulson, the former US Treasury secretary, refrain from bailing out Lehman Brothers. He did indeed let the investment bank go under, and the rest is history.Looking back, I still think Lehman should have been allowed to fail, but I was wrong not to grasp that it had to be done in an orderly way. Once the chances of a private sector takeover were exhausted, intervention was required to prevent chaos.Now we are back where we started, this time with large commercial banks instead of Wall Street brokers.Both the UK and US governments face pressure not merely to bail out these banks, which they have already attempted, but to nationalise them. This episode of nerves broke out after investors were told by Royal Bank of Scotland on Monday that it faces a £28bn (€30bn, $40bn) loss for 2008.Share prices in UK high street banks have fallen so sharply – leaving RBS with a market capitalisation of about £4bn and Barclays worth £6bn – that some financiers and politicians are calling for the UK government to end the uncertainty and take them into public ownership.There have been similar calls in the US, after Citigroup and Bank of Americadisclosed big write-downs and large banks including State Street appeared not to have enough equity to ride out a big recession. It is now extremely hard for such institutions to raise common equity, which is what they need, on stock markets or by private placement.Unlike in the Lehman case, I do not think governments should allow big banks that are cornerstones of their economies to go under. If the UK government has to follow the example of the Irish government in the case of Anglo Irish Bank and take over at least one big bank, so be it.But I do not believe any country should be eager to nationalise its banks, except in extremis.My argument for letting Lehman go was that the US government, if it kept stepping in to rescue investment banks, would strain its finances and could face currency weakness.In fact, those problems struck home most painfully in the UK. Gordon Brown, the prime minister, won plaudits from the world in October for intervening more radically and expensively than the US to bail out banks. Three months later, Mr Brown faces the triple threat of a banking, currency and fiscal crisis.The lesson is that, while dramatic interventions are satisfying at the time, they do not necessarily solve matters. Nationalisation could be needed, but it is not a panacea.There are arguments for it, beyond the moral hazard point that it hurts shareholders for allowing dangerous risk-taking. Some were advanced by Willem Buiter on his FT.com blog last week and by John McFall and Jon Moulton on this page on Tuesday.Probably the best is that it provides clear backing for financial institutions that struggling economies depend on to keep lending. There is a danger that privately owned banks with weak balance sheets “have enough capital to stay on their feet and stumble around a bit” but are afraid of doing the job, as Professor Buiter put it.Furthermore, if a government thinks it will eventually have to nationalise, there are merits in getting on with it. Japan took until 1998 to inject public funds into its banks during its 1990s crisis, while Sweden achieved more by briskly insisting on banks writing off their equity and recapitalising them.The fact remains that governments are bad owners for banks, as anyone who has followed the history of Germany’s regional state-owned banks can attest. They are heavily conflicted because, although politicians like to castigate bankers for risk-taking, they also push them to lend freely in order to make the voters happy.More specifically, the costs of a full public recapitalisation of banks in the US or UK, in addition to the public ring-fencing of their troubled assets into state-controlled “bad banks”, would be enormous.This is particularly true of the US, which cannot just acquire a few large banks, like the UK or Sweden, and be satisfied that it has dealt with most of the banking market.The plan being mulled by Barack Obama’s new administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to corral bad assets into a vehicle like the Resolution Trust Corporation, which took Savings and Loan assets in 1989, could cost $1,000bn.Then consider that the top 10 US banks, which are now regarded as short of capital, have equity of about $800bn. Nationalisation of only these banks, complete with recapitalisation, could bring the bill to the taxpayer to more than $2,000bn, which puts the $350bn left in the Treasury’s $700bn troubled assets relief programme into a very sobering perspective.Prof Buiter argues that one clear benefit of nationalisation is that it would eliminate the uncertainty over how to value troubled assets taken from the balance sheets of banks. Any government that owned both “good bank” and “bad bank” could value them as it wished.In practice, that would only be true if the entire global banking system, complete with all mortgage and asset-backed securities, were nationalised. Sweden could value Swedish property loans as it saw fit in the 1990s, but global finance has taken that luxury away.If the British banking market in particular continues with its relentless decline, Mr Brown may have no choice but, in traditional Labour party style, to seize the UK economy’s commanding heights. But, if the prime minister becomes banker-in-chief, his problems will just be beginning.john.gapper@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/johngapperRead and post comments at John Gapper’s blog

That provided the biggest drag on the Hang Seng, which closed 2.9 per cent lower at 12,583.63, an eight-week low, while the sub index of mainland Chinese shares traded in the territory fell 3.9 per cent to 6,730.82.China Life was in focus after announcing that its net profit last year was probably 50 per cent lower than 2007. Shares in the company lost 7.5 per cent to HK$20.30, the second-biggest drag on the Hang Seng. Angang Steel lost 12.9 per cent to HK$6.90 after disappointing earnings.The Nikkei 225 dropped to a seven-week low, losing 2 per cent to 7,901.64. The market has lost 10.8 per cent so far this year. The broader Topix fell 2.2 per cent to 787.15.The yen strengthened overnight against the dollar, once more weighing on exporter stocks. Canon lost 2.2 per cent to Y2,725 and Sony fell 1.8 per cent to Y1,989. The electronics company is likely to announce details of its restructuring plan on Thursday.Nissan fell 5.5 per cent to Y309 and Mazda dropped 5 per cent to Y152. A local report said the automaker was planning on asking for government help to pay about 10,000 employees’ wages at a couple of its plants in Japan.Sumitomo Mitsui Financial fell 5.4 per cent to Y3,340, while Mizuho Financial dropped 4.8 per cent to Y217 and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial dropped 3.8 per cent to Y483.Dowa Holdings shares dropped 9.8 per cent to Y276 after the zinc and copper smelter revised its earnings forecast to an Y18bn loss and halved its dividend forecast.Nippon Steel dropped 2.1 per cent to Y278 following data showing that steel production declined 28 per cent in December from a year earlier.In one bright spot for the markets, D-Ram makers in Taiwan and Japan’s Elpida gained following reports that consolidation talks were ongoing. Elpida gained 2.3 per cent to Y545, while Taiwan’s Promos gained 6.3 per cent to T$1.51, and Powerchip rose 7 per cent to T$3.07.In Korea, the Kospi dropped 2.1 per cent to 1,103.61.

595;STT;State Street Corp;2009-01-21T08:55:26Z;Banking rout raises new fears on Wall Street;;"The Obama administration on Tuesday came under immediate pressure to rescue the battered financial sector as bank stocks plunged amid growing fears over their capital needs.The S&P Financials index lost 16.7 per cent, leading a 5.3 per cent retreat in the overall stock market. Among leading banks, Citigroup fell 20 per cent to $2.80, its lowest level since the 1998 merger that created the company; Wells Fargo lost 24 per cent; and Bank of America plunged 29 per cent.State Street, a custody bank that had been seen as relatively unaffected by the financial crisis, fell nearly 60 per cent after it reported higher-than-expected unrealised losses on investments and a 71 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profits.Mounting writedowns and provisions have put the banks at the mercy of government policy at a time when the policy framework is both uncertain and shifting in a more aggressive direction.Some investors fear the clean-up process - probably involving an “aggregator bank” to take on toxic assets - could be prove highly intrusive. Future injections of public capital are likely to come with tough restrictions on dividends and lending mandates. The government could decide to take common stock rather than prefered stock, diluting existing equityholders.“Investors are deeply concerned that the US government might follow the lead of the UK and come in with a rescue package that hurts shareholders by wiping out companies’ shares,” one senior banker said.Banking shares in the UK continued to slide on Wednesday after the government’s decision to pump billions of dollars into Royal Bank of Scotland. The move – which came after RBS reported the biggest loss in UK corporate history – reawakened talk that the US government might come to Citi’s rescue for the third time in three months.In the currency markets, sterling was hit hard by fears over the health of the UK banking system, touching a record low on Tuesday against the Japanese yen of Y125.25, and a seven-year low against the dollar of $1.386."
596;STT;State Street Corp;2009-01-20T21:45:49Z;US banks push financials to 14-year low;;More spectacular declines in US bank shares pushed the financial sector to its lowest level since 1995 during what was easily Wall Street’s worst ever inauguration day sell-off.The benchmark S&P 500 index dived beneath a nadir reached last month, a key support level, leaving it only 7 per cent away from an 11-year low hit in November.“The feeling is, ‘When’s it going to stop?’” said John Brady, head of hedge fund sales at MF Global, who said much of the selling was being driven by continued fears of outright nationalisation of key financial institutions.A slew of further analyst warnings of widening losses from bad loans, higher writedowns and dividend cuts sent the S&P 500 financials index down 16.7 per cent.Citigroup, down more than 40 per cent last week when the group disclosed a break-up plan, tumbled a further 20 per cent to $2.80 as several analysts widened their loss forecasts.Meredith Whitney of Oppenheimer said the group’s “core problem is that it simply doesn’t make money in any of its businesses except Smith Barney, which it is in the process of selling.”Jason Goldberg, analyst at Barclays, warned: “While its split into separate entities should help cosmetics, it doesn’t alter its risk profile.”Wells Fargo, which has yet to disclose fourth-quarter earnings, lost 23.8 per cent to $14.23 after FBR analysts became the latest to warn of higher credit losses and the threat of a dividend cut.“We would continue to avoid the shares until its balance sheet is better capitalised,” said the analysts, who noted Wells Fargo was the only one of the largest four banking stocks to trade above tangible book value.Bank of America, which also dropped by more than 40 per cent last week, shed a further 29 per cent to $5.10, while JPMorganChase lost 20.7 per cent to $18.09.A 71 per cent drop in fourth quarter profit and the scale of unrealised losses on investments at State Street, down 59 per cent to $14.89, spurred a sell-off in the custodian bank sector. Bank of New York Mellon sank 17.3 per cent to $19.Regional banks, too, did badly in the wake of results from Regions Financial, whose shares were pushed 24.2 per cent lower to $4.60 by a worse-than-expected fourth-quarter loss. PNC Financial Services was among the heaviest hit, down 41.4 per cent to $22.The S&P opened lower and sold off sharply throughout the session to close 5.3 per cent down at 805.22. The benchmark index lost 2.7 per cent after President Obama was sworn in at midday.The heaviest previous inauguration day sell-off was that of Lyndon B Johnson in 1963, when the S&P shed 2.8 per cent following the assassination of John F Kennedy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 4 per cent weaker at 7,949.09, below the psychologically significant 8,000 level, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 5.8 per cent lower at 1,440.86. The Vix, referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, leapt 23.9 per cent.Although the heaviest losses were among financials, which lost 8.8 per cent overall, several other sectors came under substanital selling pressure.The market’s sharp decline came in spite of hopes that the new president’s plan for a fresh stimulus package would give a boost to corporate earnings, particularly in the industrial and commodity sectors.Alcoa was among the heaviest hit blue chips outside the financial sector, down 11.5 per cent at $8.35 while materials lost 5.6 per cent overall. Industrials dropped 5 per cent.In addition to concern over the health of financial institutions, investors were also fearful over the prospect for corporate results in other sectors as fourth-quarter earnings season gets into full swing.Johnson & Johnson fell 1.2 per cent to $56.75 despite results that were slightly ahead of analyst expectations. The health care products group posted a 14 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profit but forecast flat earnings for 2009.Chipmakers came under heavy selling pressure ahead of results from International Business Machines, off 3.5 per cent to $81.98.Defensive sectors, although firmly in the red, outperformed as investors sought safety.

597;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
598;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;State Street stokes bank fears;;"State Street raised fresh fears about the US financial sector on Tuesday after the big custody bank reported a 71 per cent drop in quarterly net profits and its share price halved.Investors were rattled by a surge in unrealised losses on State Street’s investments, which raised speculation that the bank might need to raise more capital.Net unrealised losses on State Street’s investments rose to $6.3bn at December 31, almost twice the level of three months before.This helped drive net income in the fourth quarter down to $65m, or 15 cents a share, compared with $223m, or 57 cents, in the same period during the previous year.State Street, which is also one of the world’s biggest asset managers, last month announced that it would cut 1,700 jobs, or 6 per cent of its workforce. It took fourth-quarter charges from the cuts and from shoring up its stable value funds totalling more than $450m.The quarterly results were worse than analysts had expected, even though the Boston-based bank tried to brace investors last week. It warned in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday that it would take a $78m charge on its earnings and that it was facing $5.5bn in unrealised losses on portfolio investment securities.In particular, the bank warned that if it consolidated its off-
balance-sheet vehicles, which might be required if new accounting standards are put into effect, State Street could sustain an additional $3.6bn in losses.“The degree of change in un­realised marks on and off balance sheet was surprising,” said Andrew Marquardt, bank analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton.Shares of State Street sank by 60 per cent to close at $14.89 in New York. The results hit other financial shares, with NorthernTrust falling 14 per cent to $43.93 and Bank of New York Mellon shedding 17 per cent to $19.00.Ronald Logue, State Street chief executive, said on Tuesday he had no plans to raise new capital.In recent months, State Street has been the subject of takeover speculation on Wall Street. The list of acquirers thought to be interested in State Street’s attractive deposit base includes Goldman Sachs, US Bancorp and Bank of New York."
599;STT;State Street Corp;2009-01-18T21:34:31Z;Dutch outfit aiming at UK fiduciary mandates;;"It is not unusual for foreign asset managers to alight on UK shores. Most of the successes in institutional investing of the last decade have come from abroad: State Street Global Advisors, Pimco, Goldman Sachs, Western Asset Management. Then there are UK teams funded by foreign banks, such as Mirabaud, or acquired, such as Newton.Rare is the arrival of a commercial outfit directly backed by foreign pension schemes. But last October, Mn Services of the Netherlands set up a London office to win fiduciary mandates from pension funds in Britain.Fiduciary is a misnomer: it does not mean taking legal responsibility from trustees or investment councils. It does signify responsibility for producing an asset-liability model; setting strategic and tactical asset allocation; selecting and monitoring managers. Mn Services also administers most of the records of its current clients’ members. Fiduciary management might be likened to the role of executive management in a company, with trustees defined as non-executive directors. Although Mn Services has gathered most of its assets from its two Dutch metalworkers’ pension fund owner-clients, PMT and PME, it does have several other clients, including two UK schemes worth more than £500m (€557m, $728m).Can this bridgehead in the UK be grown? Perhaps the best news for fiduciary managers came in the same month Mn Services arrived. The £4bn in retirement assets of British merchant seamen was mandated to Watson Wyatt on a quasi-fiduciary basis. It was the biggest such win of its kind in the UK market. Watsons, however, enjoyed a long-standing relationship as consultant to the merchant navy schemes. Mn Services, by contrast, is hardly known outside the Netherlands.Roland van den Brink, member of the executive board at Mn Services, sees two selling-points of his company: “Ten years ago most Dutch funds were managed in-house,” he says. “The governance issue is what you do when performance is not so good.” For Mn Services, by separating pensions management into a separate company, the board can manage this relationship better. Several of the largest extant funds in the UK have done this, for example, Aerion for the British Gas pension scheme.Second, Mr Van den Brink expects to form relationships with funds that can make Mn Services their home. “We don’t just want to push product or outperformance. We want to align interest as much as possible so funds feel secure with us.”It is a fair claim that an organisation that has only been legally independent of its pension fund parent for seven years will better be able to “cocoon” other pension fund clients than an inveterate commercial player.In spite of the claims of kinship, however, Mn Services will doubtless have to prove it can deliver on performance. Here there are two roots to examine. PME may be the junior partner but some of the visionary names in Dutch pension fund management have worked there: Philip Menco, now at the paper industry plan, saw to hedge against the US dollar in 2001. Patrick Groenendijk, at the transport fund, introduced interest rate hedging in 2004. Paul van Gent, chief investment officer at multi-manager Corestone, pioneered specialisms such as buying life settlements and investing in China. Kees van Ardenne, Mn’s latter head of external manager selection now heads a similar function at top-performing plan, Blue Sky Group.The unusually high calibre brought gains: despite inheriting a poor external balanced manager, the internal team managed to reformulate the plan to achieve a 10-year information ratio of almost 1.What has PMT realised in the same period? Over 10 years to the end of 2007, PMT’s annualised return was 7.8 per cent while PME achieved 7.6 per cent. So PMT has had its fair share of bright minds too, including Jan Bertus Molenkamp now at Kempen in Amsterdam. Chief investment officer, Wouter Pelser is highly regarded internally and externally. Diversification into global real estate, private equity, emerging market debt and hedge funds has brought PMT fractionally higher gains than PME, albeit at a riskier pace, giving an information ratio of 0.93.Mr Van den Brink admits these strategies have tended to wash away together in the last half of 2008; to the point where he hesitates even to use the word “diversification”. Mn Services saw the storm coming and cut riskier assets earlier, as well as focusing on operational risks such as collateral. But its clients have still lost. Mr Van den Brink’s call is to campaign for the easing of funding regulations on pension schemes. If they cannot provide liquidity to business today, there may not be a sponsor for pension schemes in the future. In these strange times, a pensions professional arrives in the UK prioritising the short-term over the long-term view."
600;STT;State Street Corp;2009-01-06T19:31:12Z;UK pension funds gain from drop in sterling;;Sterling’s steep slide during the past year has been a boon to UK pension funds, cushioning the blow from heavy losses in equity markets, according to preliminary figures for 2008 from State Street, the US-based bank.Initial estimates from a closely followed performance measurement service, run by State Street’s WM subsidiary, show that British pension trustees are, on average, looking at negative returns of about 13 per cent for 2008.That is well below the 30 per cent fall in the UK stock market and 40 per cent declines in equities in the US, Japan and Europe.“The currency effect was enormous, to put it mildly,” said Graham Wood, senior consultant at WM.During the past year, sterling fell 24 per cent against the euro, 28 per cent against the dollar and about 40 per cent against the yen. In local currency terms, the gains on foreign exchange were able to offset much of the losses on various asset classes.“In 2008, UK bonds were holding up pretty well but if you had international bonds, you got another 20 to 30 per cent [benefit from the currency effect],” said Mr Wood.However, he noted that while foreign exchange movements had offered salvation to UK pension funds last year, they had had the opposite effect in prior years as sterling rose strongly.“It illustrates the double-edged sword that currency can be,” said Mr Wood.Within the universe of funds whose returns are measured by WM, equities account for half the assets – 22 per cent UK-based and 28 per cent overseas.A further 33 per cent is in bonds, mainly UK conventional and index-linked bonds, and 7 per cent in property.A further 6 per cent is invested in so-called alternative classes such as hedge funds, while 4 per cent is held in cash.Among asset classes, WM noted that while turmoil in international financial markets had proved deadly for equities, investments in government bonds were positive. UK government bonds returned 13 per cent and those buying government bonds of other currencies saw an additional boost.Index-linked bonds, which offer protection against inflation, showed low positive returns of 4 per cent, as they suffered from the declining prospects for inflation.Property, an asset class that has attracted increased pension fund investment in recent years, recorded negative returns of 21 per cent.Commodities, another asset class that pension funds have embraced as an alternative, rose sharply in the first half of the year but then declined equally sharply in the second half of 2008 as the global economy slowed.
601;STT;State Street Corp;2009-01-04T18:27:40Z;US investor gloom deepens in December;;Global institutional investor confidence fell sharply in December with pessimism rising particularly sharply among North American investors.Confidence fell to 48 points from 54 in November according to the State Street Investor Index, which measures investor risk appetite or confidence based on sentiment towards equities. The higher the level of equity in a portfolio, the stronger the confidence measure.“Since October 31, our quantitative measures show that institutional investors have been deleveraging roughly two out of every three days, with North American investors leading the way,” said Paul O’Connell, associate director at State Street.But some of the gloom was dispelled by Asian investors who bucked the trend as their confidence level rose to 86 points from 82.“Asia has not seen the same sort of drawdowns as the US and Europe. Investors expect there will be some [economic] growth in China in the coming year, although not at the same rate as in previous years,” said Mr O’Connell.European investors were slightly less pessimistic than their North American counterparts but still suffered a dip in the measure of confidence from 72 points in November to 67.North American investor confidence dropped from 45 to 30.After heavy market falls in October, global investors paused in November but resumed their selling of equities in December. Institutional investors were concerned recent fiscal policy moves would not be enough to forestall deflation, Mr O’Connell reckoned.“The last time we saw such big declines as those of the past three months was in 1998 when hedge fund Long Term Capital Management collapsed,” he said.
602;STT;State Street Corp;2008-12-26T21:29:19Z;Finance workers wary as downturn hits Boston;;Gabriel Ruiz, who runs Boston Red Dogs, a set of kiosks that sell hot dogs, sodas and Italian sausages on the cusp of the city’s financial district, has never seen such a lacklustre lunchtime rush.The queues to his stall at lunchtime used to snake around the corner of Washington Street but not lately. “I’ve been on this street for 18 years and this is the first year that I am not sure if I am going to operate in January, February and March,” said Mr Ruiz, who owns four pushcarts in Downtown Crossing and the Boston Common. “I’ve lost a lot of regular customers to job cuts in the area.”Because most of Boston’s financial companies are asset managers and private equity firms, rather than investment and commercial banks, they were considered somewhat protected from the impact of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the fire sale of Merrill Lynch in September.But as the credit crisis deepens and turmoil in the stock market continues, Boston’s financial district has become vulnerable.Revenue at many of the city’s biggest employers has declined and massive layoffs have been announced. Not only have their assets fallen dramatically, but investors have rebalanced their portfolios away from equity funds – which tend to have higher fees – and toward fixed income and money market funds, which tend to have lower fees.Earlier this month, Boston’s crown jewels, State Street, the world’s largest money manager for institutions, and Fidelity, the world’s biggest mutual fund group, both announced big cuts. Fidelity said it would shed 3,000 jobs by the first quarter, and State Street said it planned to cut 1,700 jobs, or 6 per cent of its workforce.“To a certain degree Boston has been a little more insulated,” said Luis Fleites, vice-president at Financial Research Corporation. “New York got hit so hard and so quick. Thousands of jobs just got undone. But [job losses] are starting to happen in Boston now.”Other Boston-based financial companies have made similar announcements. Last month, MFS Investment Management said it would eliminate 90 jobs, or 5 per cent of its workforce, and Putnam Investments cut 47 jobs, about 2 per cent of its workforce.“The city is moving from a sense of apprehension, to the aura that New York City is experiencing,” said Mr Fleites.Overall, the financial sector in the city is projected to lose 16,300 jobs between the second quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2011, according to figures from the New England Economic Partnership, a non-profit forecasting group. Jobs in industries that support the sector such as consulting and law are also likely to be lost, in addition to those jobs of thousands of other people who serve the financial district.Burt Greenwald, a mutual fund industry consultant, said that the cuts were inevitable. In the past four months, the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index has lost nearly 40 per cent. “In a period when most of the large asset management firms have lost 30-50 per cent of their assets in the past year – and more if they had a higher concentration in equities – you have to make readjustments,” he said.The number of financial services jobs in the state peaked in the second quarter of 2007 at 224,400, according to figures from NEEP.Some industry experts, however, believe that the city might profit from a brain drain from Wall Street, where tens of thousands of high-paying jobs have already vanished, according to James Ho, a finance professor at Brandeis University’s International Business School, located just outside the city.“That is the opportunity from the Boston standpoint,” he said. “Wall Street has changed, and employment on Wall Street is going to be less than it was.”
603;STT;State Street Corp;2008-12-21T18:26:24Z;Boston braces itself for the worst;;"The mood in Boston’s financial district these days is unmistakably downbeat. Assets at the city’s fund management companies have declined by as much as 50 per cent over the past few months, bringing with it a precipitous drop in revenue. Many firms have announced lay-offs. And bonuses for workers who remain are projected to be down as much as 50 per cent this year, according to estimates by compensation consultants.“There’s a palpable uncertainty about employment,” says Robert Reitano, a finance professor at Brandeis University’s International Business School, located just outside the city. “People are worried about whether they will be laid off as companies continue to downsize.”The extent to which the global financial crisis will alter Boston’s fund management landscape is not yet clear, but experts are already predicting a new wave of consolidation in the mutual fund industry, as well as the city benefiting, at least temporarily, from the Wall Street fallout by becoming a magnet for talent.Because Boston is a mutual fund town – unlike New York, a centre of investment and commercial banking, Boston’s financial companies are mainly asset managers and private equity firms – the city was thought to be somewhat insulated from the impact of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the firesale of Merrill Lynch in September.But as the credit crisis has deepened and turmoil in the stock market continues, the city’s mutual fund managers are hurting. In the past four months, the S&P 500 Index has lost nearly 40 per cent of it value.“It’s a fee-based business to be sure,” says Prof Reitano. “Inevitably, as the markets have a down cycle, so too will an industry with asset based revenues.”These fund managers are also suffering as investors rebalance their portfolios away from equity funds, according to Prof Reitano. “There’s the double effect,” he says. “One: total assets are down; and two: there are redistributions from higher fee-based businesses – like equity funds and international equity funds – toward lower fee-based businesses such as fixed income funds and money market funds.”Last month, the city’s financial behemoths – State Street the world’s largest money manager for institutions, and Fidelity, the world’s biggest mutual fund group – both announced lay-offs.Fidelity said it would cut 3,000 of it 44,400 employees by the first quarter of 2009 and State Street said it planned to shed 1,700 jobs, or 6 per cent of its workforce.Other Boston-based financial companies have made similar announcements. MFS Investment Management, for instance, said it would eliminate 90 jobs, or 5 per cent of its workforce, and Putnam Investments slashed 47 jobs, or about 2 per cent of its staff, including 12 portfolio managers.Luis Fleites, vice-president at the Financial Research Corporation in Boston, says the jobs picture will likely deteriorate. “It will just get worse when Bank of America announces cuts from its acquisition of Merrill Lynch.”.Overall, the financial sector is projected to lose 16,300 jobs between the second quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2011, according to figures from the New England Economic Partnership, a non-profit forecasting group.The number of financial services jobs in the state peaked in the second quarter of 2007 at 224,400, with the bulk of those jobs located in Greater Boston, according to NEEP.Some investment professionals contend that consolidation is likely. The last big wave of consolidation in the mutual fund industry occurred in 2005 with mega-mergers between Citigroup and Legg Mason; and BlackRock and Merrill Lynch.This time around, consolidation will happen at both the fund level and the company level, according to James Ho, also a finance professor at Brandeis University’s business school. “Within a fund company, if there’s a fund that gets too small, it may be merged into an existing fund,” he says.Last month Putnam, for instance, said it was merging six smaller funds that collectively hold about $2bn (£1.3bn, €1.5bn) in assets into six larger funds that are similar in investment style.By that same token, smaller companies – if their profitability falls off – may get swallowed by bigger groups. Prof Ho sees fund companies with assets of less than $50bn as the most vulnerable. These companies are more likely to merge or get bought in an effort to realise cost savings from the burden of compliance, legal and distribution expensesMany of the Boston-based managers are more likely to make acquisitions than to be targeted, according to Prof Ho.“A lot of those companies are subsidiaries of larger companies,” he says, noting, for example, that Putnam is owned by Canada’s Great-West Lifeco and MFS is owned by Sun Life Financial, based in Toronto. “Those are likely to acquire than to be acquired, unless the parent company needs to monetise their investment.”There could, however, be potential opportunities for Boston in the aftermath of the collapse of Wall Street. The take-over of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America could result in a disbursal of investment banking from New York to other US financial centres.Burt Greenwald, a mutual fund industry consultant based in Philadelphia, says in future there will not be as many “concentrations of investment management in a limited number of geographical locations”.“The technology has changed,” he says. “Concessions are made because the technology is so good, not just in operations but in portfolio management. Physical location becomes less important, and some of the financial centres will become more spread out.”Similarly, Wall Street’s implosion could be an opening for Boston in the war for talent. The city might profit from a brain drain from Wall Street, where tens of thousands of high-paying jobs have already vanished. Those who worked as research analysts and traders at investments banks have skills that are readily applicable to asset management.“This has happened before and there is no doubt that it will happen again,” says Prof Reitano, at Brandeis. “Wall Street is a tremendous magnet for high-end talent in up markets and it’s a distributor of high-end talent in down markets. Sure some of that talent will come up here.”He dismissed the notion that it will have long-lasting effect. “It’s a cycle, not a permanent gain for the city.”"
604;STT;State Street Corp;2008-12-21T18:02:28Z;Managers prepare for rough ride in year ahead;;The asset management industry took a beating this year amid the fallout from the credit crunch. Nervous investors ran for cover from volatile markets leaving fund managers facing floods of redemptions, declining assets under management and shrinking share prices. (PDF)Many asset managers expect the year ahead to be a struggle to survive in an ongoing bear market and a deepening recession.“The fund management industry has quite a few firms that haven’t seen anything like this in their history. I think this year is going to be a year of survival for many of the mid and smaller size firms,” says Steve Potter, president of Northern Trust Global Investments.He also believes there will be fewer larger institutional players as banks continue to merge and sell off their asset management arms to focus on core business and raise capital. The shape of the asset management landscape is already changing. BNP Paribas recently took over Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch financial group, and this month saw a management buy-out of Lehman Brothers’ investment management operations, including Neuberger Berman.Consolidators will be those with the firepower to make acquisitions. Northern Trust will be one of these, although not in the next six months, says Mr Potter. Several houses, including Neptune Asset Management, have been circling around New Star, one of the most recent casualties, which fell into the hands of its banks this month after agreeing a debt for equity swap.State Street, which has taken $2bn (£1.3bn, €1.4bn) of public money as part of the US Treasury’s recapitalisation of the nation’s battered banking system, is also ready to snap up operations of European rivals weakened by the credit crunch.Further tough times ahead call for fresh thinking from asset managers and investors. The current bear market has shown some investment approaches have not worked as well as expected.In a recent roundtable of fund managers looking back on the past year, the consensus was that diversification had not delivered the promised returns in 2008 but the strategy was not dead.Before the credit crunch, investors were encouraged to diversify from traditional investments in favour of alternative assets including commodities, hedge funds and real estate, but many got their fingers burned as returns plunged.“Diversification has not worked but it is not as bad as the alternative, which is focusing on equities. In future investors will have to make sure it is the right sort of diversification,” says Andrew Dyson, managing director and head of institutional business for Europe, Middle East and Africa at BlackRock.A move to diversify from domestic holdings in portfolios to a wider international approach may be of benefit in the coming year, says Rick Lacaille, global chief investment officer of State Street Global Advisors.The bear market has also shown a number of complex products, including some hedge funds, have performed badly, driving risk-averse investors towards simpler more transparent products. The key question many investors are asking is “will I get my money back?”.Anne Richards, chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management, agrees investors will put simplicity and transparency at the top of the check-list in the year ahead. “Simplicity is the new smart. It is not only simplicity in products but also in an organisational sense, through using a straightforward business model,” she says.“So much of our industry has been focused on business as usual but it is necessary to make new checks such as exposure to counterparty risk, banking covenants, reading the small print and asking the right questions.” A more lateral approach to thinking about risk is called for, she adds.Concern about lack of transparency, counterparty risk, liquidity and the use of derivatives and structured products has triggered growing investor interest in exchange traded funds.In the first 11 months of the year average global daily ETF trading volumes hit $117bn, a rise of 94 per cent from the same period in 2007, according to Barclays Global Investors. BGI expects assets under management will exceed $1,000bn in 2009, up from $633bn now.Fund fees are also expected to come under further pressure next year as investors measure performance against charges and negotiate reductions. Annual management fees have risen steadily from 1.3 per cent in 1994 to 1.6 per cent now for European cross-border equity funds, says Ed Moisson, director of fiduciary operations at Lipper.Paul Trickett, head of European investment consulting at Watson Wyatt, says hedge fund fees could fall as much as 20 per cent, while traditional asset management fees could drop between 10 and 20 per cent.Another issue for the industry will be to show adequate risk management procedures are in place, particularly following the alleged $50bn fraud by financier Bernard Madoff that took in money from some of the biggest names in the industry.The fallout is expected to erode investor trust in the asset management community, as well as among hedge fund managers. However, mutual funds could potentially benefit from a perception they are relatively immune from fraud. Given the financial climate and such a breakdown of trust, investors are likely to head for asset managers they perceive will be best at managing risk in all its forms.Covenant risk will also come under greater scrutiny by pension fund trustees as pension assets plunge and deficits rise. The collapse of Lehman Brothers did much to shatter the notion of a safe sponsoring employer. “Trustees must get employers to come to the table to discuss deficit funding in the year ahead and discuss what the liability risk is,” says Richard Owen, head of business development for UK and Ireland at State Street Global Advisors. Despite the gloomy outlook asset managers have survived earlier downturns. “The industry tends to act like an accordion at times and new firms will be cropping up,” says Northern Trust’s Mr Potter. But that may not happen just yet.Additional reporting by Steve Johnson

606;STT;State Street Corp;2008-12-14T18:39:12Z;Serial acquirer with bright outlook;;"Participants in today’s troubled global asset management industry probably need reassuring thoughts to remind themselves that it remains, in theory at least, a structural growth industry with bright prospects.Industry veteran Nigel Wightman, chairman and chief executive of London-listed Titanium Asset Management, is doubtless not alone in clinging to thoughts of the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.“In places like the US and UK people are saving more. Where is that going to go? And arguably the worse things get, the more people have to save,” he reasons, alluding to the more conservative behaviour economic downturns beget.“The notion that your property is your savings fund has gone,” Mr Wightman adds, and while risk aversion may be restricting many savers to nothing more exciting than cash
at present “returns on cash in the next couple of years will either be low or negligible.“So [the money] sits there for a while and gradually, as confidence gets restored, it slips into other assets. My guess is it goes first to fixed income, then blue-chip
equities.”Mr Wightman, whose 30-year career has included stints at State Street Global Advisors and NM Rothschild, where he was head of both Asia-Pacific and fixed income, is putting his optimism to use as he scours the market for acquisition opportunities.Titanium floated on London’s Alternative Investment Market in June 2007 with the raison d’être of building a business via acquisition and consolidation.To date it has vacuumed up three houses; Wood Asset Management, Sovereign Advisers and National Investment Services, and is due to complete on a fourth, Boyd Watterson Asset
Management, an 80-year-old outfit based in Cleveland, Ohio, at the end of this month.Assets under management were $5.7bn (£3.8bn, €4.4bn) as at September 30, down from $6.1bn at the end of June, although the Boyd Watterson deal should add another $3bn or so to the pile.Assuming that deal goes ahead as planned, Titanium’s cash pile, some $120m at launch, will be down to $22m, but Mr Wightman asserts that more ammunition is available.“We are a serial acquirer of small- to medium-sized businesses. There is scope to raise more money,” he says. The existing shareholder base is led by Clal Finance, part of an Israeli conglomerate, and Wellington Management, a Boston-based asset manager.Perhaps unsurprisingly, given Mr Wightman’s view that fixed income will be the first asset class to recover, the acquisitions thus far have had a distinct bias towards bond investing, although that may change in the future.The fact that all four are based in the US is more a reflection of the opportunity set than any innate preference.“There are plenty more asset management companies in our space [Assets under management of $1bn-$5bn] in the US than elsewhere,” Mr Wightman says.“It’s not hard to find people who have a position in a regional market but are interested in being part of a bigger firm. On the [European] continent it is very bank dominated. In the UK there are non bank-owned fund management businesses but they tend to be bigger.”Mr Wightman says there were plenty of would-be sellers even before the deterioration in markets. “There are plenty of asset management businesses that get to a certain size through organic growth but don’t have the internal resources to move to another level, or they are looking for a liquidity event; a partner or owner is looking to retire.“The idea behind Titanium was to bring together a number of such businesses and run the whole thing on an integrated basis.”Titanium, which claims to be one of the few consolidators that look to take a 100 per cent stake in each business, rather than a partial stake, centralises functions such as operations, IT and distribution – offering regional players the chance to secure business in each other’s backyards – although it concedes it has yet to see any great benefit from this, given the difficult selling conditions since its launch, a drought Mr Wightman fears may last another two years as far as retail investors go.“People like their independence but, in order to be competitive, there are lots of things that it’s hard to afford for a small independent firm. The biggest is
distribution.”However, owners can retain upside exposure by striking a cash and paper deal, giving them stock in Titanium.Mr Wightman says he is yet to see any uptick in forced sellers, although he expects this to happen, and is wary of getting too carried away with the opportunities on offer. “The value of businesses has fallen, but so has their worth,” he says.In spite of this, Mr Wightman says Titanium “continues to have discussions” about potential acquisitions and “would certainly be interested in businesses
that complement what we have”.But hedge fund operators are not on the agenda. “We have been approached by brokers to hedge funds but there is specific risk, their model depends on performance fees,” he says.“My sense is there are plenty of opportunities in that world at the moment, there are lots of businesses that are struggling, but we will continue not to look at hedge funds.”"

609;STT;State Street Corp;2008-11-29T01:12:43Z;Eating out in Boston;;"Banking provided the unusual connection between an extraordinary 19th-century restaurant in Boston, Massachusetts and the current price of lobster, now at its lowest for a decade.At Locke-Ober, close to the city’s financial district, an old friend and a former banker said his first visit there was 30 years ago as a trainee. “It was part of an initiation process conducted by a senior banker at the time. Those of us who caught his eye were all brought here to see whether we could handle the two martinis he always had before lunch and not be talking too loudly by the end of the meal.”That was part of banking, and several other professions, then. And if that ritual has now changed, happily, Locke-Ober, at least physically, certainly has not.Opened in 1875 and named after its founders, the interior is one of the most beautiful I have been in. Obvious comparisons would be a London club or a New York steak house since the predominant material is dark, intricately carved wood which features everywhere from the facade to the two dispensing areas, one a bar on the far wall, the other once used for dispensing food, although now mainly used for storing glasses. Along it are gleaming silver serving dishes complete with lids on pulleys, connected to hot plates underneath so they can be used as chafing dishes to serve buffets and parties. The ladles to accompany them were stolen soon after the restaurant was restored in 2001.The restoration was undertaken (somewhat incongruously as Locke-Ober had not welcomed female diners for many years) by Lydia Shire, one of Boston’s most characterful chefs, who saw the physical beauty that lay beneath what must have been multiple layers of cigar and cigarette smoke accumulated over the decades.Shire has introduced her more eclectic style of cooking while sensibly holding on to the more classic dishes that have beguiled Boston’s male diners over the years. We began with half-dozen sparklingly fresh East Coast oysters; a Caesar salad (that came with a health warning because of the raw egg); and a dish described as JFK’s lobster stew. Served in a large copper pot, this was a slightly thinner version of a lobster bisque with more lobster in the bottom than would normally be served as a main course in a European restaurant.Equally fascinating were the prices of these three dishes: $14 for the salad, $16 for the oysters and $18 for the lobster stew, an indication not just of how relatively inexpensive oysters and lobsters are in this city but also the price insensitivity of the ubiquitous, and highly profitable, Caesar salad. Main courses included a vast rack of Colorado lamb with sweet potatoes; a fillet of Scottish salmon with potatoes intriguingly cooked in a smoked haddock sauce; and a fillet of lemon sole that looked somewhat forlorn on the plate but was cleverly matched with a chimichurri sauce, the Argentine sauce normally served with beef. The almond macaroons, served as a $6 dessert, are simply the best I have encountered, but the wine list could be improved.I left Locke-Ober in a daze, a combination of jet lag, the building and location (down a less-than-salubrious alley) and the fact that the restaurant was so quiet, due, I learnt as we passed the bar, to a football match being played as we ate. The following day, to confirm that I had in fact been there, I returned, not to eat or drink, but simply to soak up the atmosphere of an exceptional restaurant. It had not been a dream.Equally fascinating, though considerably more modern, was the position I found myself in the following evening standing next to Jasper White in the heart of his lobster kitchen at the branch of his enormous Summer Shack across the Charles river in Cambridge. White was the leader of the chefs in Boston in the early 1980s who improved the style of the city’s cooking; today he concentrates on his popular Summer Shacks and the wholesale fish business he has built up to supply them.He has also focused on cooking the perfect lobster. In front of the main kitchen, White stands in a semi-enclosed area that houses two vast steaming kettles, each capable of cooking 50 lobsters. To one side are stored two more kettles full of uncooked lobsters which are lifted by a series of pulleys to the cooking area when necessary. This is a system that White has not only created but also patented. The setting of this “lobster laboratory” means he can stand there cooking with a full view of his restaurant, fully aware of how much pleasure he, his staff and his lobsters give to “the many families who come here, roll up their sleeves and have a good time”.It came as somewhat of a shock, therefore, for White to tell me that every lobster eater in his restaurants and beyond is benefiting from the recent failure of the Icelandic banks.“Lobsters today”, White said, “are the cheapest they have been for the past 10 years and this is entirely due to the current banking crisis. Although everyone thinks of lobsters as coming from Maine, about 60 per cent are caught in the even colder waters off Canada. Most are caught in the autumn and frozen but this year the lobster fishing companies have not been able to secure the cash from either the Icelandic or American banks that have invariably financed this holding process in the past. So the fishermen have had no option other than to sell the lobsters that they have landed for the best possible price – which has obviously been steadily going down – cut back on their fishing, or leave the lobsters in the sea until next year. I’m buying hard-shell lobsters at around $5 a lb, half the price they were a year ago.”It was time for me to leave. As I did so I noticed the blue sign painted on the steel beam above the kitchen that declared, whatever bankers may do, “FOOD IS LOVE”.nicholas.lander@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/lander…………DetailsLocke-Ober, 3 Winter Place, Boston, tel: +1 617-542 1340; www.lockeober.com

610;STT;State Street Corp;2008-11-16T17:27:39Z;Lehman default sharpens focus on counterparty risk;;The Friday before Lehman Brothers filed for default, Barclays Global Investors had planned an emergency training drill, but rather than pretending the building was on fire, the asset manager’s risk officers were going to simulate a major default by one of its counterparties.On the day, they decided to postpone the practice run, thinking correctly they would be better off keeping their powder dry for the real thing, which followed at the weekend.Since then, many asset managers and most of their clients have paid more attention to counterparty risk.One of the main tasks Rick Lacaille will take on in the new position as global chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors is to co-ordinate an overview of counterparties.The aim is to ensure SSgA has a single evaluation of the trading and research capabilities of its counterparties across all asset classes, to add depth to analysis of its business-wide report of counterparty risk positions.Elsewhere, investors are asking for reassurance that their manager is being careful. “We’ve had a lot of discussions with clients about counterparty diversification,” says Andrew Welch, who heads up the institutional business at Insight Investment.In recent years, Insight has been a strong advocate and practitioner of liability-driven investment for pension funds, an approach that relies heavily on bespoke derivatives to manage inflation and interest rate risk.Each derivative transaction involves counterparty risk, so Insight had already invested heavily in systems to manage this, but they had never been put to the test.“Before Lehman, a shot had never been fired in anger,” says Mr Welch, “so we were pleased the controls and processes have worked.”Risk officers at other asset managers are even seeing a silver lining in recent events. “The benefit of the recent turmoil is that our existing requests for IT improvements to the system have now been given a higher priority for resource allocation,” says Laura Schramm, head of risk at Gartmore.At the moment, Gartmore, well known as a hedge fund manager, relies on Excel and macro processes to manage its counterparty risk. The operational challenge of looking at this daily on a business-wide level is significant, involving large numbers of contracts with different counterparties, each potentially changing in value every day.Since most institutional asset managers will use collateral to mitigate counterparty risk, someone has to make sure the derivative instruments are valued regularly and the amount of collateral adjusted to suit the value.If an asset manager holds collateral, the damage done when a counterparty goes bust is limited to the gap between the collateral held and the market price of replacing the defaulted deal.Most fund managers demand collateral in cash or sovereign bonds and many will even insist on a significant margin (in BGI’s case 10 per cent) above the value of the derivative. This margin is intended to cover any potential transaction costs or losses arising from market movements between the last valuation of a derivative before default and its replacement.One way asset managers may have tripped up in counterparty risk management was failing to value derivatives often enough. Since the value of derivatives would very likely fall in the run-up to a default, collateral that was sufficient a week or even a fortnight before might turn out to be inadequate when the event occurs.Daily valuation imposes a considerable operational burden, explains Max Verheijen, head of structuring at Cardano, a pensions investment manager and consultancy. “To reduce that burden, many managers only looked at collateral twice a month. We’ve seen that come down to once a week or even daily.”Although collateral management has always been an important part of the process for Cardano, he explains it is not the first line of defence for counterparty risk.“We have focused on counterparty selection,” he explains. “Up to the last year, we would have argued that the credit rating was a good indicator, but things move so quickly now that we don’t use them.”Paying attention to the creditworthiness of the counterparties certainly paid off for Cardano – because it had had questions about Lehman’s status for some time prior to the default, it had no trades on its books against the investment bank at the time it filed for bankruptcy.Another way in which Cardano differs from many mainstream managers is that it sees no need for business-wide monitoring of counterparty risk, preferring to look at it on a client level. “Why would you look at it overall? You cannot net positions across clients,” says Mr Verheijen.At Insight, although the exposure to counterparties is reported in aggregate to the counterparty credit risk committee, the purpose of this is purely to keep the committee on top of what challenges it might face.“In the days leading up to Lehman, people were concerned about more than one US investment bank,” says Mr Welch. “We needed to worry about what’s coming next.” Although it might be useful to have a view of the counterparty exposure across the business, he points out that trying to set an optimal distribution among counterparties for the business could conflict with the requirement to provide best execution for each client separately.The larger asset managers are less concerned with this, as they feel the size of their business means individual mandates can be accommodated without compromising counterparty risk management.“BGI is a global firm and many of our lines of business are run globally,” says Sue Beckett, head of risk at BGI Europe. “We like to be able to see across BGI where our risks are.”
611;STT;State Street Corp;2008-11-09T18:14:10Z;Veteran bank ready to ride out the storm;;"State Street may have been around since 1792 but this year must surely rank as one of the strangest in its rich and varied history. (PDF)Last month the Boston-based bank said it would take $2bn (£1.2bn, €1.5bn) of public money as part of the US Treasury’s $250bn recapitalisation of the nation’s battered banking system.Now, just weeks later, this infusion of taxpayers’ money looks set to be used to help State Street snap up the operations of European rivals weakened by the ongoing credit crunch.Jay Hooley, who was this summer promoted to president and chief operating officer of State Street and informal heir apparent to chairman and chief executive Ron Logue, has a simple solution to the conundrum as to how a participant in an unprecedented bank bail-out can be strong enough to lead industry consolidation – State Street simply did not need the money.“We view ourselves as well capitalised. The US approach was to inject capital into the strong institutions. From our standpoint it was the right thing to do. We were encouraged to participate and we gladly accepted the opportunity to help out for the greater good,” said Mr Hooley, who hoped the fact that nine “healthy” organisations have taken $125bn of Treasury money would encourage smaller banks to take the other $125bn available.The $2bn, a 10th of State Street’s market capitalisation, raised its tier 1 capital ratio from 16 per cent to 18.8 per cent, adding to its firepower at a time when others may be keen to sell.“As we pass through the first phase [of the crisis] there will be acquisition opportunities for the healthy organisations. We have a very good track record of acquisition and consolidation of administration activity,” says Mr Hooley, who alluded to the $4.5bn purchase of Investors Bank & Trust in 2007.“We have demonstrated to ourselves and our shareholders that we are pretty successful in acquisitions and roll up strategies.”In particular, State Street is keen to expand its European custody operation. “There are still quite a few custodians in the European market,” says Mr Hooley. “There are six to 10 subscale global custodians attached to banks. Given that the crisis is centred on the banking world there is a likelihood there will be opportunities for us to consolidate the European custody business. We are looking at opportunities at the moment.”Mr Hooley also sees “interesting opportunities” in both electronic trading, following on from State Street’s $564m acquisition of the Currenex foreign exchange platform last year, and asset management, where “we are keeping our eyes open for attractive opportunities”.State Street appears positioned to ride out the capital markets storm better than many of its peers. It reported net income of $477m in the third quarter of 2008, against $358m in the period last year, as the market turmoil pushed up trading volumes.In spite of reporting a 7.9 per cent fall in assets under custody to $14,000bn, it said trading fees rose 13 per cent to $363m.However, assets under management fell 11 per cent to $1,700bn, depressing fees by 13 per cent.Its share price has fallen 39.9 per cent since the start of the crisis in August 2007, outstripping the 35.3 per cent slide in the S&P 500
but better than the performance of the broader banking and asset management
sectors.“I think we are positioned to be a beneficiary,” says Mr Hooley, who believes State Street’s size and relative stability will be a particular boon in the field of money market funds where assets have flowed to institutions deemed strong enough to bail out their funds in the event they lose money, or “break the buck”. Mr Hooley claims State Street has not had to take such a course of action, but adds: “The asset class will gravitate around size, scale and sophisticated credit analysis. Money funds are likely to consolidate to larger players.”He argues that larger, more stable organisations will also vacuum up assets on the custody side as the issue of counterparty risk moves up the agenda.Furthermore, he claims clients are increasingly moving beyond a simple custody model to a full outsourcing suite, encompassing administration and middle office activities as well, with $6,000bn of assets now serviced in this latter format.“As things get more turbulent, the organisations that we are working with put additional work with us.”Overall, Mr Hooley believes the “growth engines” of the asset management industry have been “slightly changed” by the turmoil of the past 15 months, “but not dramatically”. He remains optimistic about the “oversized growth potential” of China and the Middle East, where State Street recently opened an office in Doha, the Qatari capital, to complement its presence in Dubai.Opportunities also remain in eastern Europe, despite the economic travails of some countries in the region. The bank’s asset servicing arm now employs 250
people in the Polish city of Krakow, with capacity to raise that figure to 1,000.Mr Hooley not only lauds the quality of the Polish workforce, but also the prospects for further expansion. “Both the Polish pension and fund markets have got some pretty good size and growth, so it is also a way into the Polish domestic market,” he says.He believes the market for retail investors, traditionally more skittish than their institutional peers, will be altered most radically by the crisis, with the industry needing to re-think its offerings to lure many individuals back to the fray.“I think it is likely some products will emerge that will provide some
downside support and less upside,” says Mr Hooley, who foresees a greater role for insurance companies and with-profits funds, something State Street will not be participating in, unless of course its path takes another strange twist."
612;STT;State Street Corp;2008-11-09T18:11:00Z;Analysts regain managers’ faith;;Earnings forecasts for pan-European equity markets are finally starting to look credible in the eyes of the continent’s fund managers.FTfm reported in September that asset managers had completely lost faith in the forecasts of sell-side analysts – buying into sectors analysts were downgrading and selling those they were upgrading – a level of disconnect unseen for more than a decade.However, data from State Street Global Markets suggest the correlation between changes in consensus sell-side earnings forecasts and institutional investment flows, as measured by its custody operations, is now back towards historic highs.In the past six weeks the sell-side analyst community has downgraded earnings forecasts for energy, capital goods and consumer durables and institutional investors have withdrawn money from these sectors.In contrast, institutional money has flowed into the sectors where analysts are becoming more bullish, such as food retailers, household products, food and telecoms.The analysis suggests the earnings estimates of sell-side bottom-up analysts are now being trusted once again. “It takes [analysts] a while to catch up with what is going on. But earnings forecasts are now believable,” said Andrew Capon of State Street. Forecasts for the MSCI Europe index suggest earnings growth of 8.7 per cent in 2009, down from a forecast of 13.4 per cent in mid-September.
613;STT;State Street Corp;2008-10-30T14:21:51Z;Outsourcing: Seeking a bigger share of a fastgrowing global market;;Scotland has already benefited from the trend towards outsourcing, with the financial services sector attracting thousands of well-paid jobs.The country has been particularly successful in the relatively new industry of asset servicing. US banks such as State Street and Citi have chosen it as a base from which they offer European fund managers a variety of services – including investment accounting, performance measurement and treasury functions.But how will this process fare during the economic downturn that has engulfed the sector?A recent report by the Management Consultancies Association, based on a survey of members of the British Bankers’ Association, predicted the credit crunch would drive a new wave of outsourcing and offshoring in financial services as cash became tighter.Fiona Czerniawska, author of the report, said the credit crunch was a wake-up call for the financial services sector.“Many institutions which have so far ignored the benefits of outsourcing are being forced to revisit it because of financial constraints and liquidity problems,” she said. “Often they have failed to integrate and are still lumbering under a weight of legacy systems and processes and carrying both unnecessary variable cost and balance sheet assets.”The report said outsourcing tended to be counter-cyclical: in good times, companies might not see it as a priority, in spite of the cost benefits available.“The credit crunch has driven people who previously weren’t bothered to dust off their plans and have a look at it again,” says Bill Mew of IBM. “Financial constraints and liquidity problems have been driving all forms of outsourcing.”Outsourcing has developed over the years from companies farming out responsibility for their IT systems, to the outsourcing of routine business processes – such as claims processing for insurers – to knowledge process outsourcing, which provides services that involve high-value decision-making, such as calculating net asset values or doing equity research for fund managers.Andrew Rigby, who last year became a partner with Brodies, the Edinburgh law firm, believes Scotland could add billions of pounds to its output by using its expertise to capture more of the fast-growing global market for business process outsourcing, forecast to be worth $323bn by 2011.“We only need to capture a small share of that global market to make a real difference to our bottom line,” says Mr Rigby, who has spent most of his career in London, specialising in information technology and outsourcing.Mr Rigby says that with the proposed merger of HBOS and Lloyds TSB, and potentially thousands of job losses on the horizon, Scotland needed to develop an industry which would ensure that talent did not fade away.Global volatility is changing the face of how the financial services industry would look in Scotland, and Mr Rigby says he has already seen evidence that the number of outsourcing deals by banks was increasing.“Many banks in the City of London will be looking to reduce costs. Support services such as equity research and credit risk management could easily be moved to Scotland,” he says.“Why pay huge accommodation costs in the City or Canary Wharf when you could be paying up to 50 per cent less in Scotland?”Mr Rigby is behind a new think tank, called the Outsourcing Hub Initiative, which has brought together business leaders, academics and economic development officials to consider how Scotland could benefit from its strengths in financial services, life sciences and energy to develop its capabilities.He says a list of the top 30 up-and-coming countries for offshore services included Argentina, Brazil, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Romania – but not Scotland.“There is no reason why Scotland cannot position itself as a good base for outsourcing,” says Mr Rigby. “In the central belt, communications are very good, there is a large workforce and good universities – we should try to bring everyone together and encourage international companies to set up outsourcing centres.“The idea is that not only do we service existing companies in Scotland, but we start to provide services globally.”Mr Rigby has called on the Scottish government to encourage urgently the development of an outsourcing industry by helping global outsourcing companies to settle in Scotland, making money available to help entrepreneurs to establish outsourcing businesses and setting up an Outsourcing Centre of Excellence, bringing together the public and private sectors and the academic community.“As outsourcing will become the norm in the financial services sector, there is a danger that Scotland will lose out by not having an outsourcing industry,” he says.“Even Scottish financial companies that want to outsource in Scotland would find it difficult to find companies that have the skill and experience. These potential services, in the absence of a Scottish-based industry, might inevitably go elsewhere.”
614;STT;State Street Corp;2008-10-17T20:44:04Z;Wall Street ends in red in volatile session;;A wild week for Wall Street stocks that saw their biggest gain since the Depression and worst sell-off since 1987 drew to a close with another highly volatile session that ended in the red.Relatively upbeat earnings and a further easing of strain in money markets failed in the end to outweigh a fresh batch of gloomy economic data and renewed concerns over the health of some financial institutions.The market swung between gains of as much as 4 per cent and losses that hit 2.9 per cent as last month’s options and futures expired.Big name financials including Metlife and State Street endured heavy losses towards Friday’s close and finished down 9.2 per cent at $31.14 and 9.6 per cent at $40.76 respectively.Housebuilders, home furnishers and real estate services were among the key losers on Friday from grim construction and building permit data. DR Horton, CB Richard Ellis and Leggett & Platt were among the biggest drags on the market, down 8.3 per cent at $6.77, 4.8 per cent at $6.32 and 12.3 per cent at $16.29, respectively.The S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent at 940.56 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,711.29 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.4 per cent at 8,852.22 points.Yet the benchmark S&P still finished the week up 4.6 per cent – its biggest gain since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 – with the Nasdaq up 3.7 per cent and the Dow 4.7 per cent higher.In each session, an overwhelming number of trades took place in the final few minutes of trading, which traders put down in part to a wave of fund redemptions.Defensive names were among the favourites as investors dipped their toes back into the market after stocks’ worst weekly sell-off since the Depression. Wal-Mart gained 5.5 per cent over the week to $53.77. Healthcare topped the sectoral leaderboard, up 8.8 per cent. St Jude Medical, which gained 13.9 per cent to $37.03, helped sentiment with well received results.Financials climbed 5.8 per cent over the week, lifted by the fresh $250bn plan to shore up US banks. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – among the biggest institutions in which the government is set to buy equity stakes – advanced 11.4 per cent to $23.24, 28.7 per cent to $114.30 and 5.5 per cent to $14.88 respectively.Amid plenty of third-quarter earnings, PepsiCo was one of the relatively small number of companies to undershoot analyst forecasts. The shares fell 6.8 per cent over the week to $53.88.Figures from Coca-Cola, up 6.5 per cent to $44.20 over the week, were better received. So too were those from Intel and Peabody Energy, which gained 2 per cent to $15.50 and 11.8 per cent to $32.03 over the week.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history. However, it finished the week down 1.2 per cent at 69.45.Technology stocks were down after three companies in the sector reported better than expected results after the bell on Thursday.Google rose 5.5 per cent to $372.54 after the internet search group’s profits surpassed Wall Street forecasts. Eric Schmidt, chief executive, warned of “uncharted territory” due to the financial crisis. Advanced Micro Devices and IBM added 2.2 per cent to $4.21 and lost 0.8 per cent at $90.78 after both surprised Wall Street with third-quarter earnings ahead of expectations.Aerospace and defence stocks fell after Honeywell trimmed its guidance for the rest of the year. The diversified manufacturer, off 5 per cent to $29.37, did so even after it became the latest company to overshoot quarterly earnings forecasts.Caterpillar fell 7.2 per cent to $39.32 after Credit Suisse cut its price target from $66 to $46 while Potash eased 0.4 per cent to $74.43 after Citigroup cut its price target.
615;STT;State Street Corp;2008-10-15T21:24:28Z;US shares plummet again on recession fears;;US stocks plunged yet again on Wednesday on fresh concerns that the vast government intervention in the financial system may not be enough to stem the credit crisis.Fears also persisted that it had in any case come too late to prevent severe and long-lasting recession. Retailers Nordstrom, Macy’s and Bed, Bath & Beyond suffered some of the heaviest falls in the fall-out from grim retail sales data, down 12.4 per cent to $16.54, 17.5 per cent to $8.66 and 11 per cent to $23.89 respectively.In spite of better-than-exexpected corporate earnings in the sector, financials slumped 9 per cent overall.Citigroup and Morgan Stanley – which bounced 21.2 per cent and 16.5 respectively in the previous session – retreated 12.8 per cent to $16.23 and 16.3 per cent to $18.13 after Oppenheimer warned that the government’s bank rescue was not a “panacea’’ for all ills.The major indices opened lower and sold off sharply towards the close, a hallmark of recent slumps that traders put down, in part, to another wave of mutual fund redemptions. The S&P 500 closed down 9 per cent at 907.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 7.9 per cent down at 8,577.91 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 8.5 per cent lower at 1,628.33.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up 24.8 per cent to 68.78, a figure that indicates severe distress.The bloody retreat over the past two sessions erased virtually all of the gains from Monday, itself the biggest rise since the Depression.Energy and materials were the biggest laggards, down 15.5 and 12.1 per cent respectively, on mounting concerns of a global slowdown. US Steel sank 17.7 per cent to $38.82.“There can be no doubt now that the economy is in recession,” said Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics. “It will be there a while.”Financials took scant comfort from JPMorgan Chase, which fell 5.5 per cent to $38.49, even after its earnings exceeded expectations. Wells Fargo which also did better than forecast, held on to gains for much of the session but closed down 0.5 per cent at $33.35.State Street, one of nine institutions in which the government will take an equity stake, sank 17.4 per cent to $46.83 after the group warned of unrealised off-balance sheet losses.Elsewhere, Coca-Cola was the only stock in the Dow to find positive territory, up 1.1 per cent to $44.21 after the soft drinks group’s quarterly profit compared favourably with a glum outlook from PepsiCo the previous day. PepsiCo lost a further 5.8 per cent to $51.25 after a 11.9 per cent slide in the previous session.Intel’s relatively well received results failed to boost Dell, which lost 10.65 per cent to $12.58.
616;STT;State Street Corp;2008-10-15T18:40:23Z;Three big US banks unveil $2.6bn in profits;;Three of the nine big banks due to receive capital injections from the US government reported total third-quarter profits of more than $2.6bn on Wednesday, highlighting the different needs of companies receiving assistance under the rescue plan.Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, which are to receive $25bn each in government funds, said they earned $1.64bn and $527m, respectively, during the period, while State Street, which is to receive $2bn in federal money, put its net profit at $477m.Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive, said his bank did not need the capital injection and acknowledged that the Treasury plan might benefit weaker competitors more. But he said JPMorgan did not want to stand in the way of an initiative that benefited the banking system as a whole.“The plan may well have asymmetrical benefits …but what is good for the system is good for JPMorgan,” he said. “The Treasury plan and all of the things they have done recently, is very powerful stuff that will eventually help to unclog the system.”Mr Dimon said money markets and other frozen parts of the financial system could start to thaw, adding: “You will see some easing in certain critical areas in the next couple of weeks.”JPMorgan’s profits were down 84 per cent from $3.4bn in the same quarter of last year. Earnings at Wells fell 24 per cent, but rose 33 per cent at State Street.Michael Cavanagh, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, warned that future earnings would remain under pressure due to the deteriorating financial health of US consumers and “recessionary conditions”.“Times ahead are going to be tough,” he said.Howard Atkins, Wells chief financial officer, said his bank intended to raise $20bn in equity from private sources to finance its pending acquisition of Wachovia.Under the government’s $250bn capital-injection plan, about half the money will go to nine banks seen as central to the financial system. In addition to JPMorgan, Wells and State Street, they are Bank of America, Merrill Lynch (now being acquired by BofA), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of New York Mellon.Experts say it was important for big banks to join at once to avoid potential “stigma” problems for companies receiving government funds.
617;STT;State Street Corp;2008-10-15T18:40:23Z;Trading fees lift profits at State Street;;"State Street, the big US custody bank, saw its net profit rise by a third in the latest quarter as volatile markets resulted in higher trading fees, but its shares dropped sharply as the bank’s investment losses rose.State Street, which is also one of the world’s biggest asset managers, is one of nine banks in which the Federal government will take equity stakes.The bank said on Wednesday it would issue $2bn of senior preferred shares to the Treasury, along with warrants to buy common stock with a market price of about $300m.The bank said its net income rose to $477m in the three months ended September 30, compared with $358m in the same quarter the previous year.That included 28 cents a share for losses on loan collateral from Lehman Brothers, which last month filed for bankruptcy.New York Stock Exchange trading volumes rose by more than a third in the quarter, which meant that State Street’s mutual fund and hedge fund clients did more trading and consequently higher record-
keeping and trading fees.State Street’s assets under custody fell by 7.9 per cent year-on-year to $14,000bn, yet its trading fees rose by 13 per cent to $363m.The bank’s shares dropped by more than 12 per cent after the earnings were announced.State Street’s asset management arm, State Street Global, fared poorly.Assets under management fell by 11 per cent to $1,700bn during the quarter, and asset management fees dropped by 13 per cent to $266m, compared with the same quarter the previous year.Between the second and third quarters, losses on State Street Global’s investments rose by 50 per cent
to $3.3bn, with losses from commercial paper, or conduits, rising four-fold to $2.1bn.The group said it held $7.8bn in commercial paper issued by conduits, and of this, $1.6bn was covered by the Federal government’s new fund to buy commercial paper.Revenue rose by 24 per cent to $2.8bn, and costs rose by 14 per cent to $1.9bn.Excluding one-off revenue gains, operating revenue increased by 12 per cent to $2.5bn.The return on shareholders’ equity was 13.6 per cent, down compared with 12.6 per cent in the same quarter the previous year.The drop was mostly because the bank raised new capital in June this year, it said.Ron Logue, the chairman and chief executive, said that the issuance of another $2bn in preferred shares to the government would be “minimally dilutive” to shareholders.He added that State Street had been chosen by the US Treasury to manage some of the assets for its mortgage-backed securities portfolio, under the Troubled Asset Relief Programme (Tarp), and the bank would also service the government’s commercial paper funding facility."
618;STT;State Street Corp;2008-10-14T23:48:39Z;US injection lifts confidence;;"The world banking system showed signs of pulling back from the brink of disaster on Tuesday with a tangible easing of stress in credit markets as the US government unveiled a historic rescue plan for its banks.The plan included $250bn for bank recapitalisation and a sovereign guarantee for new bank debt – the most sweeping government intervention in the US financial sector since the Great Depression.“Government owning a stake in any private US company is objectionable to most Americans, me included,” said Hank Paulson, US Treasury secretary. “Yet the alternative of leaving businesses and consumers without access to financing is totally unacceptable.”Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, said even the massive intervention announced on Tuesday may not be the final word. “Our strategy will continue to evolve and be refined as we adapt to new developments and the inevitable setbacks.”He added: “We will not step down until we have achieved our goals of repairing and reforming our financial system, and thereby restoring prosperity.”Investors signalled growing confidence that the biggest US banks would survive the crisis. The cost of buying insurance against defaults by some big US banks fell by record amounts, while remaining above normal levels.Interbank loan rates starting on Wednesday also eased, though modestly, while the yield on safe short-term US Treasuries moved higher, as risk appetite improved.However, the stock market failed to build on its historic rally on Monday amid concerns that the financial rescue might have come too late to prevent a deep recession. The S&P 500 fell 0.53 per cent. The head of a leading financial firm told the FT: “I still expect a severe recession, but this may be enough to unclog the financial system.”As part of the plan, the government will inject half the total, $125bn, into nine banks – Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street.Under the government’s take-it-or-leave-it offer, Bank of America (including Merrill Lynch, which it is acquiring), JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, will each get $25bn in government funds, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley $10bn each, and Bank of New York Mellon and State Street between $2bn and $3bn each.In return, the US government will take non-voting preference shares paying 5 per cent interest, stepping up to 9 per cent after five years, and will also take warrants for common stock equal to 15 per cent of its preference share investment.All institutions will get cash on the same terms, and the cost of securing loan guarantees will also be the same for stronger and weaker banks. Banks taking
government equity will be subject to some mild executive pay constraints.However, they will be able to carry on paying dividends, unlike in the UK, although they will not be able to increase them.All other US financial institutions eligible for the plan have to decide by November 14 whether to participate on these terms.US legislators were broadly supportive of the move, even though it marked a radical shift from the original focus of the $700bn US rescue plan signed into law this month, which was sold as a troubled asset purchase plan.The US announcement followed similar moves by the UK and by European governments. Equity markets in Europe continued their advance on Tuesday. The FTSE 100 and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 closed up 3.2 and 3.1 per cent, respectively.The dollar, which fell sharply on Monday, declined further."
619;STT;State Street Corp;2008-10-14T20:09:53Z;US forced to follow the European bandwagon;;The US bank rescue plan is in broad terms the same plan invented by the UK a week ago and adopted by other European nations on Monday: a recapitalisation scheme coupled with loan guarantees for banks and expanded deposit insurance.This looked unlikely as recently as the weekend, when the US government hoped to pursue a slightly different mix of policies, including implicit guarantees and direct funding of financial institutions through Federal Reserve purchases of commercial paper – short-term, unsecured corporate debt – in place of loan guarantees.However, once bank loan guarantees spread across Europe, the US had no choice but to follow suit, in spite of concerns among senior policymakers that this could speed the collapse of the large non-bank financial sector that competes with its lenders.Indeed, some experts think the US has de facto accepted the transformation of its complex and diverse financial system into one based on a relatively small number of universal banks on the European model.By putting in government capital before the entire banking system was in ruins – sooner than in most previous financial crises around the world – policymakers hope to engineer a more rapid turnround.The terms of the US recapitalisation plan are much more favourable to the banks and their shareholders than the UK proposal. The US terms favour weak banks by establishing the same terms for all, regardless of capital strength.Experts say getting the core group of top banks to sign up immediately for half the $250bn (£143bn, €183bn) was essential. It removed uncertainty over their share prices: dealt with the “co-ordination” problem, avoiding destabilising swings in relative capital strength: and the “stigma” problem, reluctance to go to the government for help for fear that this would be taken as a sign of weakness.Most importantly, it mitigated the risk that the $250bn would be too widely spread across the vast US financial sector to make a real difference to the core financial institutions.Still, questions remain as to whether $250bn will be enough. Relative to the size of capital injections elsewhere and scale of the US financial system, the fund is arguably on the small side.At the same time diverting at least $250bn away from the $700bn fund created to finance the purchase of toxic assets raises doubts over the effectiveness of that programme.The US Treasury can transfer assets from bank balance sheets to the government balance sheet at a smaller scale.The focus of the rescue effort is now the recapitalisation and loan guarantee plan. In effect the US has decided to circle the wagons around a core group of nine banks – Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BNY Mellon and State Street. These banks will not be allowed to fail, and the US government will rely on them to provide the bedrock of ongoing lending in the economy, while trying to avoid any of them gaining dominant market share. But in taking extreme measures to ensure the core banks will live, the authorities are abandoning the vast non-bank financial sector to its fate. The Fed will try to offset the enormous competitive advantage gained by banks by buying commercial paper from non-bank financial firms such as GE Capital. However, this will not come close to balancing the full benefits of the guarantees for the banks, provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.The non-bank financial sector in the US is already under even more severe stress than its banks. Analysts fear Tuesday’s announcement of sovereign aid for banks could intensify the non-bank collapse, unless more steps are taken to aid the non-banks in the coming days.Contraction of the non-banks could lead to more distressed sales of assets and firms, scrambles for bank licences and an accelerated shift of both assets and liabilities into the sector. The problem is that if the core banks are not only to fill the hole left by their losses and reduce their leverage but also absorb a wave of assets coming into the banking system from the wider financial system, they will need a lot more than their half-share of the $250bn in government capital.The US plan will only suffice if it succeeds in crowding in large amounts of private capital. If not, many multiples of the $250bn may be needed.
620;STT;State Street Corp;2008-10-14T11:28:46Z;Commitment to asset management in question;;The tale of Spain’s investment fund industry is one of dwindling size and increasing withdrawals.Equity and bond investment funds have never caught on in the way they have, say, in the UK and more than half the investment products sold in Spain are money market funds or structured capital-guaranteed products. In size, it ranks a long way behind the UK, France and Germany.The pressure on the industry has mounted in the past year, say analysts. Market falls have taken their toll on funds under management. In addition, increasing numbers of retail investors have taken their money out of fixed income and equity funds to reinvest in bank deposits.In part, the outflows are the result of growing disillusion and risk-aversion among investors amid current market turmoil.But Spanish banks, which dominate the sale and distribution of mutual funds to private investors and have historically accounted for over half the mutual fund market, have encouraged the switch, too.Until recently Santander and BBVA, Spain’s largest banks, each represented close to a quarter of all fund sales. The top 10 fund management groups in Spain account for 72 per cent of the market and are backed by a branch network through which they can sell investment products, says Lipper Feri, the data provider.But now these banks are looking for ways to boost their capital ratios and close the gap between loans funded by borrowing from other banks and those backed by their deposits. Some have made concerted efforts to lure depositors offering high rates of interest to persuade fund investors to switch out of equity and bond funds.The pace of investors’ switching out of mutual funds, and the role of parent banks in encouraging it, has prompted the Spanish regulators to write to banks warning them of the potential conflicts of interest.However, analysts at Morgan Stanley believe it will continue: “We see continued outflows as banks cannibalise retail funds to help plug the $4bn funding gap”.This is having long-lasting effects on the industry, it adds. “The war for deposits has fundamentally changed the opportunity set for international retail asset managers in Europe whilst the net present value of captive managers (especially in Italy and Spain) has been materially impaired”.The knock-on effect of these mammoth outflows from the collective investment funds is hits to the revenues and profits of banks’ asset management divisions. In some cases, this has forced parent banks to reassess their commitment to these.Juan Manuel Vicente, head of research in Spain for Lipper Feri says Santander has been among the worst hit. Its market share of mutual fund sales has fallen from about 25 per cent to 20 per cent in the past year.As a result, this summer, Santander said it was putting its asset management business, which has about €130bn ($178bn) in funds under management, on the block. The group revealed a 16 per cent drop in first-half revenues. The bank said its asset management arm had been impacted “by a greater focus on deposits”.A price tag of about €2.5bn has been mooted and JP Morgan, Franklin Templeton or State Street have been cited as the most likely buyers. The residual question is over whether a deal would include an agreement to continue to distribute investment funds through the bank’s 13,500 outlets.Santander may not be the only bank to take this route, say analysts.Morgan Stanley warns: “Expect sustained outflows for another year in European retail mutual funds as the war for deposits bites: risk aversion is being reinforced by an intense war for deposits …Meanwhile, structured notes remain an ongoing source of competition [to managers of bonds and equity funds]. We think this is most bearish, not only for independent asset managers, but very bearish for some captives – especially in Spanish and Italian banks.”The downside for the banks is that prices of asset management businesses have more than halved in the past year and buyers are increasingly nervous about committing themselves to deals.Even if short-term market turmoil eases, there are long-term difficulties integrating businesses whose assets are fund managers who can walk off at any time. And it is notoriously hard to value the in-house distribution arrangements that bank-owned asset managers have with their parent.“Large-ticket M&A [in the sector] has fallen away,” says Morgan Stanley. The gulf between the price asked by banks and the price offered by buyers is “simply too wide”. More deals may complete in 2009 but only when expectations have fallen and the reality of the crunch has set in, it says. Activity may pick up next year. However, it says valuations may well remain depressed. “Valuations may remain below the historical about 9-11 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.”
621;STT;State Street Corp;2008-10-05T20:03:07Z;Pensions stop lending stock amid short selling debate;;"Short selling and the securities lending it relies upon have moved from the mundane to the controversial in a matter of weeks (PDF).For years, stock lending has acted as a lubricant, oiling the wheels of markets and providing a modest boost to the revenues of asset managers and pension funds in the process.But now, amid populist fury over the actions of short sellers who may, or may not, have contributed to the collapse in confidence in swathes of the US and European banking systems, some asset owners are reassessing their lending activities.Calstrs and Calpers, the two heavyweight California public pension schemes, New York State’s Common Retirement Fund and Dutch peer APG have temporarily suspended the lending of some of their financial stocks.Vanguard, the $1,300bn (£730bn, €925bn) US fund manager and the Strathclyde pension fund, the UK’s largest local authority scheme, have gone further, temporarily shutting down their entire securities lending programmes.“Lending is a very marginal source of income for us so if there is any perceived increase in risk because of the connection between lending and short selling it could be self-defeating for us to lend,” says Richard McIndoe, head of pensions at the Strathclyde scheme, who says the £9bn fund earned £1m to £1.5m from lending stock last year.“It doesn’t take much of an increase in market risk to completely outweigh the income from it.”APG, the Dutch government and education sector fund, says it earned €130m for its €217bn portfolio from stock lending in 2007. It says the aim of its partial suspension of lending is to “discourage short sellers” and “contribute to more stable financial markets”.The UK’s Investment Management Association has advised its members to “consider carefully the implications of any participation in the lending of stocks in UK banks”, bearing in mind the need for an orderly market and the risk to clients’ interests “should lent stock be used against them”.Richard Saunders, chief executive, said he believed asset managers had reined back their stock lending operations in the wake of the IMA’s call.However, the global fund management industry is almost unanimous in agreeing that, in normal circumstances, stock lending is a good thing and should continue.“If you don’t have stock lending you won’t have a stock market. The liquidity will dry up and there will be no incentive to buy or sell stock. If you look at markets that don’t have it, such as India and China, their stock markets have wild swings,” says a leading figure from a large custodian bank which lends stock on behalf of its clients. (Dispiritingly few industry participants were willing to defend the practice of stock lending on the record – a sure fire way of guaranteeing the industry loses the debate in the court of public opinion).Stock lending developed in the 1970s, but really took off after the financial market liberalisation of the 1980s that made the process more tax efficient. It has now become a multi-billion dollar business. State Street, a custodian bank, says it generated $352m from stock lending in the second quarter of 2008; with custodians typically keeping just 15 per cent of the revenues, this would imply income of $2bn for asset managers, insurance companies and pension funds.Figures from Data Explorers and Spitalfields Advisors, two research companies, suggest that lending fees are typically 20-40 basis points for most markets, but markedly lower in the US where supply tends to massively outweigh demand. In the final quarter of last year the utilisation rate, the proportion of time available stock actually spent on loan, was 16 per cent.Not all of this lent stock is used to short stocks. Borrowing occurs for a variety of reasons, such as allowing dividends to be paid to institutions with the lowest tax rates, providing liquidity to market makers and meeting the collateral needs of brokers. More controversially, activist investors can use borrowed stock to increase their voting rights.“Stock lending is much more important than short selling. In western Europe and North America lending is very widespread. In emerging markets in general it is more patchy,” says David Rule, chief executive of the International Securities Lending Association.“The main benefit for lenders is income at what can be low risk. You can take high quality collateral such as government bonds with a margin in your favour and you can stipulate return of stock on demand. There is no reason not to do it if you are comfortable with the risk you are taking.”However, the process is not entirely risk free. Lehman Brothers was a big borrower of stock shortly before it collapsed, although it is not believed that many lenders lost money; they were instead able to sell the collateral, typically cash or government paper worth about 105 per cent of the lent stock, and buy the equities back without incurring a loss. “The feedback I’m getting is that most people didn’t lose money,” says Mr Rule.However, some stock lenders did lose money when their collateral was invested in structured investment vehicles (SIVs) operated by major banks, many of which collapsed at the start of the credit crunch. Cash is today more likely to be invested
in money market funds.Mr Rule, one of many in the industry who does not believe short sellers are able to affect share prices for anything more than a few hours, even argues asset owners that do not lend stock are not acting in their fiduciary duty to their investors.Strathclyde’s Mr McIndoe disagrees, stating: “If it was a bigger income stream, maybe I would take the fiduciary point. I think my major fiduciary duty is to protect the value of our holdings.”"

The rally came even though money markets remained under unprecedented strain – as they have been for the past two weeks – while the latest housing data showed there was little economic respite in sight.Homebuilders, routed in the previous session, recovered slightly. KB Home rose 1.8 per cent to $19.68 while Pulte Homes inched up 0.6 per cent at $13.97.The S&P 500 closed up 5.3 per cent at 1,164.73, albeit in light volume because of a holiday and the end of the quarter. The gain nevertheless left the benchmark down 9.2 per cent during a month in which the American financial sector was drastically reshaped.The Nasdaq Composite Index was 5 per cent higher at 2,082.33, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent at 10,850.66.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 15.6 per cent on Tuesday, although at 39.45 it continued to indicate extremely elevated levels of distress.Investors expect Congress to pass the $700bn troubled asset relief programme in some form later this week.“The market thinks there’s going to be a solution,” Steve Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investments, said. He added, however: “I wouldn’t read too much into this . . . This is an environment in which information is unavailable. Period.”Regional banking stocks were among the biggest winners from a 13.1 per cent rally in financials. National City, which sank 63.3 per cent on Monday, rose 28.7 per cent to $1.75.Sovereign Bancorp rose 69.5 per cent to $3.95 a share. Fox-Pitt Kelton raised its recommendation on the stock from “in-line” to “outperform”.Regions Financial jumped 16.4 per cent to $9.60. Fifth Third, down 43.6 per cent in the previous session, added 30.6 per cent at $11.90.Custodian banks, normally seen as among the safest banking stocks but which sustained heavy losses in the previous session, also rebounded. State Street added 29.3 per cent to $56.88 and Bank of New York Mellon 23 per cent to $32.58.The index of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list, compiled by Bloomberg, rose 8 per cent, just above the level set when the ban was introduced earlier in the month.Hartford Financial Services was a notable outlier from the rally after Fitch warned that the insurer’s exposure to credit markets could result in ratings downgrades. Down 11.7 per cent in the previous session, it fell another 18 per cent on Tuesday to close at $40.99.Technology stocks, among the worst hit in the previous session’s rout, also made modest gains.Microsoft, whose chief executive Steve Ballmer warned that no company was immune to the global financial crisis, climbed 6.7 per cent at $26.69. Intel rose 8.5 per cent to $18.73 after Piper Jaffray upgraded its recommendation on the semiconductor manufacturer from “neutral” to “buy”.Google, which fell below $400 on Monday for the first time in two years, fell another 10.4 per cent at $341.43 after a last-minute slump. Apple, whose 17.9 per cent sell-off was described by Goldman Sachs as “overdone”, recovered 8 per cent to $113.66.The SEC’s plan to release guidance on fair value accounting, which emerged late in the session, also helped sentiment.“Every little indication that the authorities are willing to compromise and accommodate the market is helpful,” said Pran Tiku, president of Peak Financial Management.Automotive stocks, which suffered declines in the previous session even after Congress voted to fund $25bn of government low-interest loans to help the sector, recovered in spite of oil’s near $5-a-barrel rise. General Motors and Ford rose 11.1 per cent to $9.45, and 24.7 per cent to $5.20, respectively.Among the non-financials to benefit, Dr Pepper Snapple – spun off by Cadbury earlier this year – climbed 9.1 per cent to $26.48.

Hong Kong shares dropped as much as 6.1 per cent, the Nikkei in Japan lost 5.0 per cent, and Taiwan, which had been closed on Monday, lost as much as 6.7 per cent. However losses narrowed as the day progressed and Hong Kong, for example, closed with a 0.8 per cent gain. In India, the Sensex was 2.4 per cent higher by mid afternoon in Mumbai at 12,891.82South Korea and Taiwan temporarily banned short selling and Hong Kong’s regulator reminded investors that it would punish aggressive shorting.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index had fallen 3.4 per cent to 107.57 by early evening in Tokyo, extending the drop of 4.9 per cent it made over the previous five days. September looks as thought it will be the regional benchmark’s worst month since for 18 years.“There’s a massive crisis of confidence,” said Khiem Do, head of multi-asset at Baring Asset Management in Hong Kong. “I’m buying today. I love to buy when there’s panic. It’s the time to get companies with good long-term prospects cheaply.” He said the MSCI Asia Pacific index was trading at a bargain valuation of around 10.5 times earnings.Asian investors took their cue from the US markets, where the S&P 500 fell 8.8 per cent, its worst day since falling 20.5 per cent on October 19, 1987. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 7 per cent, close to the 7.3 per cent it fell when markets reopened after the September 11 attacks on the US in 2001.Oil fell by more than 10 per cent overnight. Nymex light sweet crude was trading at $96.42 a barrel by late afternoon in Singapore.The yen rose as investors returned money to Japan which they had borrowed there cheaply to deposit in other countries such as Australia with much higher interest rates. It reached Y103.54 to the dollar before weakening by more than one per cent beyond Y104.80.The South Korean won, however, hit Won1,230 to the dollar, its weakest for nearly five and a half years before strengthening slightly to Won1,206.75.Banks fell across the Asia-Pacific region, and so did exporters as investors worried about the prospects for the US economy, their biggest market.Among Japan’s big banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, which on Monday bought a 20 per cent stake in Morgan Stanley, fell as much as 7.0 per cent, although it closed 4.7 per cent lower at Y893.

Bank Of East Asia fell by 2.0 per cent to HK$24.00 and China Merchants Bank fell by 2.8 per cent to HK$18.22. But Wing Lung Bank rose by 6.2 per cent to HK$155.10 as China Merchants completed its purchase of Wing Lung.The oil producer Cnooc fell by 1.7 per cent to HK$8.85 but mainland refiners rose as cheaper crude helps them to improve margins as Beijing controls the price of petrol and other refined products. PetroChina rose by 1.0 per cent to HK$8.00 and Sinopec gained 2.4 per cent to HK$6.03.However BYD, the battery maker, rose for the second day running after the billionaire investor Warren Buffett took a 10 per cent stake on Monday. BYD rose by 7.9 per cent to HK$12.84.Australia suffered twice over: financial companies followed their peers around the world, and resource and energy producers were also hit by the fall in the price of crude and declining metals. The S&P/ASX 200 index ended 4.3 per cent lower at 4,600.50, a 21-month closing low.BHP Billiton, the world’s largest miner and a big oil producer, fell by 9.5 per cent to A$31.00 and Rio Tinto fell by 11.5 per cent to A$84.50.Fortescue Metals, an iron ore miner, fell by 16.8 per cent to A$4.66 on worries about declining global demand.Among the big banks, National Australia Bank fell by 5.6 per cent to A$24.26 and St George Bank fell by 6.8 per cent to A$28.60.Financial companies that depended on cheap credit to buy infrastructure and other assets also fell sharply.

625;STT;State Street Corp;2008-09-25T22:02:42Z;Songbird Estates;;Hardy’s Darkling Thrush, in blast-beruffled plume, chose to fling his soul upon the growing gloom. London’s Songbird Estates, owner of most of the Canary Wharf district, tried to unleash some ecstatic sounds of its own on Thursday, announcing results to the end of June.Yes, tumbling property prices eroded the value of the group’s investment portfolio by about 10 per cent. But underlying profits soared, thanks to some big sign-ons from State Street, KPMG and Bear Stearns (as was). Vacancy rates actually fell. Occupiers are bound to leases about twice as long as the sector average. Rental payments from Lehman Brothers, a big tenant, are insured for four years by, erm, AIG. JPMorgan still seems keen to move in. And future supply is relatively tight. As a developer, the company is cautious: it typically builds up to the first floor, then waits for anchor tenants waving chequebooks.But Songbird’s perch is still precarious. It is highly geared – net borrowings/assets give it about a 66 per cent loan-to-value ratio, versus the sector range of between 40 and 55 per cent. And, in spite of efforts to diversify, it is still heavily skewed towards benighted financials and their hangers-on.The company is already a tough sell. With a small free float, it has lagged behind the UK real estate sector by a third this year. As the B-shares listed on Aim carry only an eighth of a vote, it is a stock to own for income – over the past three years it has returned double Thursday’s share price in dividends – rather than influence.The current 30 per cent discount to net asset value may look tempting. But the shares will probably fall further, dragged down by the more irresponsible City of London. Seven million sq ft of new space is due for completion by 2010, of which 5.5m is currently unlet.

626;STT;State Street Corp;2008-09-19T22:08:17Z;TGIF;;Last week felt like the 1929 Wall Street crash investors have only read about in books: plummeting stocks, vapourised companies, end-of-the-world headlines. Each day brought something even more extraordinary than the last. How do you top Thursday when the share price of the brain-numbingly dull State Street halved in three hours? Easy. You wake up the next morning to learn that shorting financial shares has been banned, the US government wants to buy all toxic assets and banks are rallying by up to 30 per cent. That three banks – Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and HBOS – were wiped off the planet earlier in the week seems like a dull memory. And remember AIG?But following the mother of all bounces on Friday, the week was not as bad as all that in the end. By the closing bell most European equity markets were down less than 2 per cent. Some markets, such as the US, Hong Kong and Japan were more or less flat. Russia, which at times felt like a full-scale train wreck – prompting the regulator to shut down trading for two days – was derailed only 3.5 per cent. Even the hurly-burly foreign exchange markets ended the week roughly where they had started.Sure, there were some scarily wild gyrations along the way. Most banks lost between a fifth and a quarter of their value before finishing flat. Ditto for currencies: for example, after starting at about Y108, the dollar made a round trip of Y8 in three days. More bonkers still, the yields on three-month Treasuries collapsed from 80 basis points to zero and back again.Buy-and-hold investors, therefore, should have shuffled off to Friday evening drinks thirsty, but relatively unscathed (provided they did not work at a bank that was consigned to history). Some day-traders and hedge funds, however, will be battered by the events of this week. Still, the belief that bankers hurled themselves out of windows in 1929 is a myth.

627;STT;State Street Corp;2008-09-18T20:47:46Z;US stocks surge in late trade;;The prospect of the creation of a Resolution Trust Corporation-style plan to deal with the turmoil in financial markets led stocks to their biggest rally in nearly six years late in the session.A violent swing in financials reversed the rout of the previous day as investors responded positively to the prospect of a Treasury plan similar to that which helped bring an end to the savings-and-loans crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s.Earlier in the session, the market fell as much as 2 per cent, as concerns lingered over the short-term funding of financial institutions even after a liquidity boost from central banks.Yet stocks later rebounded on the possibility that US authorities might follow their British counterparts by banning the short-selling of financial stocks. A second wave of buying came towards the end of the day.Marc Pado, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the move could help liquidity, without which several “firms are dead in the water”. He added “shorts would be really hung out to dry” ahead of quadruple witching tomorrow, the day on which contracts for stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures expire.Wild fluctuations in Cit Group illustrated that of the wider market. At one point down 36.1 per cent, the stock closed up 49.7 per cent at $10.70.It emerged that Morgan Stanley was in preliminary merger talks with Wachovia, the troubled regional lender, which soared 59 per cent to $14.50. Yet some analysts questioned the logic of such a deal.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the two independent US investment banks still standing, remained in focus.They rose 3.7 per cent at $22.55 and fell 5.7 per cent at $108.00, respectively, as bid talk surrounded the former.In the previous session, they lost 24.2 per cent and 13.9 per cent, respectively, as the cost to insure against default of their debt rose.HSBC, China’s Citic Group and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp were among names that various reports said were also interested in acquiring some or all of Morgan Stanley.Washington Mutual was among the biggest gainers, up 48.8 per cent to $2.99, amid reports that the fourth largest US bank was looking to be sold. The previous day WaMu said it would prop up its money market funds to prevent losses on a Lehman Brothers-issued debt.By the close, markets had rebounded. The S&P 500 was up 4.3 per cent at 1,206.51 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 3.9 per cent at 11,019.69. The Nasdaq Composite rose 4.8 per cent at 2199.10.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 8 per cent to 33.10 after rising as much as 16.4 per cent.General Electric rebounded to 7.4 per cent at $24.79 paring its loss for the week to 7.3 per cent. That came even after Deutsche Bank cut its target price on the world’s third largest company, whose financial arm accounts for about half its business, from $33 to $28.It said: “While it may be easy to attack speculators and short-sellers for these movements, the reality is that unless CDS [credit default swap] spreads quickly normalise, then the cost of financing GE capital . . . could rise sharply.”Custodian banks, which garner revenue from lending stock on behalf of their clients to cover short trades, suffered in the wake of SEC regulations. The new rules are designed to crack down on so-called “naked” short-sellers who do not even borrow shares before selling them.In spite of the positive momentum, State Street endured one of the biggest declines on the S&P 500, down 8.9 per cent to $59. Northern Trust and Bank of New York Mellon fell 6.7 per cent and4.6 per cent, respectively.In the previous session, the market once again slumped amid what has emerged as one of the most extraordinary series of developments in financial history.“How many more disasters and how much more bad news can the world’s economy take in a week?” asked David Buik of BGC Partners.Tobias Levkovich, equity strategist at Citigroup, wrote in a note to clients: “Investors are stunned and seem resigned to further losses . . . Fear seems to be overtaking any rational discourse with the credit crunch slipping into crisis proportions.”.
628;STT;State Street Corp;2008-09-18T20:31:46Z;Putnam closes $12bn fund;;"Putnam Investments, one of the oldest US money managers, on Thursday closed its $12bn prime money market fund because of a spike in redemption requests from clients as the crisis sweeping the world’s financial markets spread to traditional money managers and custodian banks.Putnam took the action as shares of several of the world’s largest custodian banks, including State Street and Chicago-based Northern Trust, plunged on concerns about the impact of new short-selling rules and the stress in money market funds on their business models. State Street fell as much as 55 per cent in New York trading.The custodian banks house trillions of dollars in assets; State Street has $15,300bn in assets under custody on behalf of mutual funds, pension funds and other clients. The banks also operate the world’s largest ­securities lending programmes, which facilitate short-selling.The board of Putnam Funds said it had voted to close the Putnam Prime Money Market Fund and distribute all fund assets. The fund is aimed at institutional clients and has a minimum investment of $10m.The company said the action was not related to the portfolio’s credit quality but was instead a reaction to market-wide liquidity issues and pointed out that it had no exposure to the securities of Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual or AIG at the parent-company level.The fund’s net asset value calculated on Tuesday was $1 per share. Money market mutual fund companies are scrambling to calm fears among clients after the Reserve Fund, the first-ever money market fund, “broke the buck”, falling below par value of $1 per share on Tuesday.The fund experienced redemption pressure on Wednesday. The serious constraints on liquidity in money market instruments created the risk that in order to process redemptions, the fund would realise losses in selling its portfolio securities.Custodian banks feed the borrowing needs of hedge funds. The US Securities and Exchange Commission may require hedge funds to disclose their short-sale positions and plans to subpoena the funds’ records in an effort to stem market turmoil. The impact of these rules on the securities lending programmes of custodian banks remains unclear, but investors sold heavily yesterday.Shares in State Street were down 16.8 per cent at $53.90 in late trading. Northern Trust shares rallied after being down most of the day to finish up 5.5 per cent, while shares in Bank of New York Mellon fell 6 per cent."
629;STT;State Street Corp;2008-09-18T18:52:45Z;The Short View: Money market funds;;There are no one-way bets in markets – but occasionally the government can create some.Thursday’s huge co-ordinated intervention by central banks only lifted global stocks for a few hours.And rushing for safety itself involved big market-timing risks. Take gold. It provided a profit amid the panic of the past two days, but the timing had to be perfect: gold rose $112 in barely 12 hours, and during the following four hours it fell $38. It is not a one-way bet.Another clear-cut bet was on money-market funds, which offer a slightly better version of a deposit account, for slightly higher risk, by investing in low-risk bonds. The news that holdings of Lehman Brothers had forced one fund into a loss, from $1 to 97 cents, triggered an exodus from the funds.This is not rational. Money market funds are still, even after Lehman, much safer than most alternatives. Their downside is limited.But one bet seems certain. Following Lehman and AIG, we know that creditors may be saved but shareholders will not. So the government, perversely, has turned short-selling the shares of an investment bank into a one-way bet.Hence rules to force short-sellers to locate stock to borrow before they make a sale, which will drastically reduce the overall level of short-selling, are irrelevant. If a bet against the equity of Morgan Stanley (down 22 per cent in hours on Thursday) is safe, short-sellers will do the necessary paperwork.Add the money fund panic to the clampdown on shorting, and you get Thursday’s sell-off in custodian banks led by State Street. They long ago ceased to take any great credit risk and instead make fees for administering funds.But State Street’s nice earners include running money market funds and securities lending (to short-sellers). And so on Thursday, incredibly, at one point its shares fell as much as 55 per cent.john.authers@ft.comForum: Disucss John Authers’ Short View
630;STT;State Street Corp;2008-09-14T21:22:08Z;‘Magic formula’ defies all the rules;;"The efficient market hypothesis states that it is impossible to consistently outperform the market by using any information that the market already knows, except through outrageous serendipity. PDFThe growing band of converts to the concept of “minimum variance” equity portfolios would beg to differ from this statement.Geneva-based Unigestion, which was an early minimum variance pioneer, claims its European strategy has outperformed the wider market by more than 4 percentage points a year since 1999, with a five-year rolling per annum return of 13.36 per cent, against 8.90 per cent for the DJ Euro Stoxx 600 total return index and 8.66 per cent for the MSCI Europe on a total return basis.The sister US strategy, launched on January 31 this year, has the unusual distinction of being in positive territory, returning 3.1 per cent as of the end of August, while the S&P 500 total return index fell 5.7 per cent.Others are starting to take interest. State Street Global Advisors plans to launch a US minimum variance product later this month, joining adherents such as Acadian Asset Management, Axa Rosenberg and Robeco. In April, MSCI Barra launched a benchmark index.So, have these houses stumbled on the holy grail of an investment technique that breaks the efficient market hypothesis asunder – fatally undermining passive strategies based on market capitalisation weighted indices in the process?Interest in minimum variance portfolios was kick-started by research by Professor Robert Haugen, a US academic, who in 1995 claimed that a US equity portfolio designed to minimise total risk achieved an absolute return, as well as a risk-adjusted return, above that of the S&P 500.More recent studies appear to confirm the persistence of this apparent anomaly. Andrew Ang, finance professor at New York’s Columbia University, who in 2006 crunched US stock market data from the preceding 37 years, found that stocks with “low idiosyncratic volatility” tended to exhibit relatively high returns, a pattern that held in every decade.Patrick Bloomfield, partner and actuary at consultant Hymans Robertson, says: “Simplistically, any product that can provide the same level of return with a lower risk exposure has to be attractive; it’s a fund management equivalent of turning lead into gold.”The minimum variance technique aims to construct portfolios of stocks that are uncorrelated to each other, just as much as being “low variance” or low beta in their own right.In practice, managers will use filters to optimise their portfolios, although critics argue this layer of complexity is largely designed to justify their fees, which can be 1.5 per cent a year for retail investors, for what is essentially a passive strategy.Unigestion, for instance, strips out illiquid stocks and those with credit difficulties. MSCI’s Global Minimum Volatility index has constraints on the weighting of each stock, sector and country relative to benchmark.Frank Nielsen, executive director of MSCI Barra, says the strategy, backtested to 1995, would have outperformed the MSCI World index in absolute terms, with 30 per cent lower volatility and a Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return, of 0.67, versus 0.45 for the index.He envisages growing interest in such “managed volatility” strategies from pension funds and insurance companies, given the increasing need for mark-to-market accounting, and says MSCI Barra is “in discussions” with providers of exchange traded funds keen to replicate its new index.“There’s a lot of people talking about it,” says Churchill Franklin, executive vice-president of Boston-based Acadian, which has $233m (£133m, €167m) in two minimum variance-style strategies, who believes the market correction has made sophisticated investors think about risk as well as return.Jean-François Hirschel of Unigestion, which manages $3bn in its minimum variance strategies, says the concept is “gaining traction”, with “a lot of money coming in” for its US fund. Unigestion has one UK pension fund on board and says it is in discussions with a large Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund.However, the uptake may be dependent on market conditions. Minimum variance strategies tend to outperform in relative terms in bear markets, but can undershoot in thematically driven bull markets.""We underperform in a market driven by one thing, such as the bubble in technology. Because the model is looking for low correlation it will stay away from a sector where there is high correlation. 1999 was our worst year,” says Mr Hirschel. “We will do well in a down market because there is usually a lot of diversification then. A good way to make money is not to lose money.”As a result minimum variance portfolios tend to have high tracking error, often as much as 8 to 10 per cent. Further, some critics dismiss minimum variance as just another fundamental strategy benefiting from the outperformance of value and small cap stocks noted by many studies.Lionel Martellini, professor of finance at the Edhec Business School in Nice, believes the strategy has its merits. “We have a massive amount of evidence that minimum variance portfolios outperform market cap benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis. In terms of raw performance they also perform quite well compared to market-cap weighted portfolios.”However, according to Prof Martellini, even minimum variance can be beaten in terms of raw performance and Sharpe ratio in a disarmingly childlike manner – equally weighting every stock in a given universe.“Naive diversification works better than sophisticated diversification, it works better than modern portfolio theory. It’s interesting and perhaps a little bit sad.“But minimum variance portfolios have never been designed to have good Sharpe ratios. It’s about minimising volatility,” – the one area in which they trump naive equally weighted indices, says Prof Martellini."
631;STT;State Street Corp;2008-09-14T21:04:52Z;Data cast doubt on sell-side research;;"Fund managers are paying less attention to the recommendations of European sell-side bank analysts than at any time in the past decade, according to research from State Street Global Markets PDF.The data coincide with figures from Bloomberg suggesting that the accuracy of earnings forecasts made by US sell-side analysts has fallen to its lowest level for at least 16 years.The dire diagnosis comes at a crucial time for the research sector with budgets starting to come under pressure. “There have certainly been some lay-offs. What I have been hearing on the Street is that this is the next shoe to drop; the ranks of the sell-side analysts will be the next to be hit,” said Stephen Horan of the CFA Institute, which trains financial analysts.State Street found the pattern of analyst upgrades or downgrades matched the institutional investment flows identified by its custody operations in just two of the 11 MSCI Europe sectors; healthcare and industrials where both analysts and asset managers are
positive.However, for every other sector, institutional investors are either withdrawing money despite analyst upgrades outnumbering downgrades, or are increasing their investment in sectors analysts are gloomy about. “The buy-side and the sell-side disagree to such extent that when fund managers receive recommendations they then tell their traders to do exactly the opposite,” said Andrew Capon of State Street Global Markets. “For many sectors there is a complete bifurcation between flows and sell-side earnings forecasts.”Combined with the Bloomberg data, which indicated that earnings estimates from analysts proved accurate for just 6.7 per cent of S&P 500 companies in the second quarter, down from a high of 30 per cent in 2000 and the lowest since such records began in 1992, the figures raise doubts over the value of sell-side research.Lucy Macdonald, chief investment officer, global equities at RCM, which has been poaching sell-side analysts to bolster its in-house research team, feared banks were losing much of their best talent.“There is a lot of instability because commission levels are coming down and there is more cost pressure. This pressure means it is a less attractive place for high quality analysts to work; they have gone to the buy-side, where there is space to think more long-term, or to hedge funds,” said Ms Macdonald, who estimated that commission payments in Europe had virtually halved in the past three years.Steve Kelly, global head of Thomson Reuters Extel, which surveys the European analyst sector, saw this trend continuing. “Even since June the amount of commission that people are paying is being reduced from a number of conversations we are having. Fund managers are coming under more pressure from the ultimate asset owners, and that just feeds through.” Mr Kelly said analyst numbers had fallen year-on-year since 2002.Mr Capon argued that the apparent decline in the accuracy of sell-side earnings forecasts was largely driven by the economic cycle. “I think it’s more to do with the market environment,” he said. “The guys that are doing stock specific research are rushing to downgrade but they can’t get there quick enough. It happens in turning points in markets.”The head of European investment research at a major bank, which is still forecasting double-digit earnings growth in 2009, accepted this argument.“We are at a turning point and at the bottom analysts are quite bad at taking this on board,” he said. “Analysts tend to stick quite closely to companies’ guidance so until the companies start to see demand falling analysts tend not to.”He accepted that analysts want to maintain good relationships with the companies they cover; this year’s Extel survey identified corporate access as the service the buy-side most prizes from brokers."
632;STT;State Street Corp;2008-09-07T19:30:34Z;Conversations open door on new ideas;;"“Will this make our client more productive?” This is the first question Nadine Chakar, chief executive of BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, wants her team to ask itself when it comes up with a new product idea. The second is: “What is the damage to our end-client, and to their client if we get it wrong?”This considered approach helps explain why innovation in the asset servicing industry happens at glacial speed since the numbers involved and the responsibility are huge and the consequences of getting it wrong could be dire.Nevertheless, innovation does occur, largely in response to changes and demand from the asset managers and asset owners. An example is pooling, the development of structures that allow multi-national companies running pension funds in a number of countries to pool the assets of these funds in order to achieve economies of scale and implement more complex and more efficient investment strategies.Northern Trust has built a reputation for leading the field in pension pooling. It offers its clients facilities based on legal structures in Luxembourg and Dublin, traditional centres of such innovation, and now in the Netherlands.“We’ve been leading the way in terms of different fund structures,” says Peter Cherecwich, head of institutional strategy and product development at Northern Trust.Next the asset service provider will look to provide structures allowing clients to include US-based pension assets in their pooled pension funds – as recently declared acceptable by the US Department of Labor.“We make it available in different structures and then we make it available in different markets,” he says. “That’s how our innovation happens.”There are some murmurs of dissent from Northern Trust’s competitors at the concept that it was the first to offer pooling structures: given that the industry has been discussing the possibility for more than a decade and the co-
operation of various regulators was indispensable, it is impossible to pin down a single innovation and say: “This is the very first step to pooling and one particular company was responsible.”In asset servicing, innovation is driven by conversations with clients, the asset owners and managers. “Ideas percolate through discussions with clients,” says Mr Cherecwich. “It’s rare that we sit in a room on our own and come up with an idea that no one’s heard of.”Tim Caverley, head of State Street’s investment services business in Europe, agrees. “We’re tied at the hip [to our client], so it’s important to understand where they’re going.”New investment strategies and instruments allowed under the European fund structure, Ucits III, have required significant investment from the asset service providers to keep up with both complexity and volume, says Mr Caverly. Over-the-counter derivatives, bespoke financial contracts, are now used by almost all asset managers and owners, so service providers need to offer support for these complex products.State Street has recently built up a specialist centre of expertise for dealing with OTC derivatives.OTC derivatives are generally seen as one of the major drivers of change and innovation in the industry. “The level of complexity has increased sharply because of the use of OTC derivatives,” agrees Fréderic Pérard, head of global fund services at BNP Paribas Securities Services. “Accurate and transparent reporting of the underlying assets is getting very difficult.”Particularly after recent events in global financial markets, the demand for independent pricing of these instruments has been growing. This is traditionally an area of expertise for boutique hedge fund administrators that have the experience and the intellectual capital to manage this highly complex business but maybe lack the scale to handle large amounts of assets, as has now become necessary.“Most of the big players have acquired alternative companies,” says Mr Pérard. “Everybody is investing in platforms to support OTC derivatives.” He sees the need for the buy-side’s technology to become more sophisticated, more nimble; more like the sell-side, in fact. “Now platforms are required that are very close to the sell-side. Now we are looking at using investment banks’ platforms,” says Mr Pérard. “The first one to do that will definitely be the winner.”As well as keeping up with the new investment types used by fund managers (commodities and property funds are also mentioned, not fondly, by asset service providers as offering significant challenges), the back office has to find ways to use what it already has better to support its clients.“We’ve got oodles and oodles of data,” says Ms Chakar. “The question is, how do you give it to a pension trustee in a form that reassures them they have full control and oversight?” Managing the form of reporting, how to slice and dice the vast amount of data a fund administrator or global custodian has, can be a key differentiator for an asset service provider.The other key challenge, all players are agreed, is supporting clients globally. Northern Trust’s Mr Cherecwich puts it like this: “We have a global model. Production needs to happen on a continuous basis; we have centres in different time zones so they can hand the book over to each other. But client service needs to be local.”“All of a sudden, this is really a global market,” says Mr Caverly of State Street, which has opened a service centre in Hong Kong to build capacity in both another time zone and another, important, language. “We want to offer local service with global scale.”For the moment, keeping up with the exploding demands of clients is sufficient innovation for the asset service providers."
633;STT;State Street Corp;2008-09-07T19:24:41Z;IT solutions go best with people interaction;;"The received wisdom in the investment industry seems to be that the increasing penetration of technology throughout asset managers and their service providers automatically translates to a disintermediation of the human element. This, say custodians, is not necessarily the case. Rather, according to Michael Walsh, SVP investor services, UKMEA, at State Street, it is a means of enabling more meaningful conversations with clients as markets and products become more complex.“Going back five years, every UK pension scheme was equities oriented, now they’ve moved into bonds and derivatives,” he says. “To deal with that complexity you have to have the IT to support it, otherwise you do have to throw bodies at it, and you won’t have the dialogue with the customer.”Asset managers’ preoccupations are not generally with the minutiae of processing but with expansion into new products and markets. “We have to have people they can talk to about that,” Mr Walsh says.“If you’re buried in the detail of processing things with bodies, and manual processes, you’re not going to have a very interesting conversation or add value to that customer’s real challenge, which is to grow their business in a complex world.“You have to have knowledgeable people allied to technology. One or the other is not good enough. Technology enables you to have the time to discuss with the customers, move them beyond the scale challenge to how are they going to service their customers.”This is particularly valid as service providers move up the value chain, away from simply providing back office functions towards the middle and front office. The trend towards outsourcing functions and systems to custodians continues, as managers facing more complex mandates and increased regulatory scrutiny demand more frequent risk reporting, analytics and compliance tools.“When you get to the front end, that’s where you’ve got to have people who are able to talk about investment strategies and be knowledgeable about risk and reporting; technology only gets you so far,” Mr Walsh says. “At the back end there’s a certain amount of human touch and interaction, but the further you go up the middle office and front office, the more and more people come into play. But IT is the ticket to the game, because if you can’t give the analysis, you can’t have the discussion.”And that discussion needs to be ongoing, according to Dan Wywoda, head of core product management at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing. The potential is there for a technology dependent service to slide into a low or no-touch relationship between service provider and client. The “touch” has to be engineered into the process, and is beneficial for both parties.BNY Mellon offers an information delivery tool to its clients, and regularly updates and upgrades it. However, Mr Wywoda says, clients often struggled to keep up with the changes to the tool. To remedy this, the company created a “health check” team, whose role would be to enter into a continued dialogue with the client, to educate them about the tool’s uses and to get feedback to help develop it
further.“It ended up paying huge dividends for us in getting the clients to use some of the functionality, to recognise that we’re continuing to invest in that space, that they can leverage it, and that it’s their challenge to give us some ideas for the next generation of improvements,” Mr Wywoda says. “It could be no touch, where we just give them that information delivery tool. But we’ve found that we’ve had to modify our operating model to have people that are healthcare specialists to create that high touch.”Increasingly, asset owners and managers need to fall back on their custodian’s information platforms as they come under ever more scrutiny from auditors, risk officers and accounting boards. “Sometimes there is a hesitancy for a client to use, say, our online tool,” Mr Wywoda says. “And one of the functions we highlight to them is that if they use our tool, they’ll be able to demonstrate to their auditors or their compliance people or their risk people all the controls that go with their instruction.”Clients are slowly being convinced that the ability to leverage a custodian’s technology to provide audit trails and demonstrate controls, rather than making annual trips to the filing cabinet, is worthwhile. “It’s kind of changed the mentality of the client to say, that on top of getting out the fax business, they can use it to demonstrate their own competencies as an organisation, whether it be a pension scheme or a charity or an insurance company,” Mr Wywoda says.A further challenge, which is probably bigger than the rest, according to Simon Walker, deputy head of global custody product management at BNP Paribas Security Services, is making all of the systems appear seamless to the client. “You might have five [systems], you’ve probably got 50, but it’s the challenge to create the sense that it’s one product providing the data,” he says. “The cliché of the business is that it’s delivery of information, and I think that’s where the balance has to come . . . I think even if you had the best front end system, it’s not as though the client is just a computer, the client’s got people in their office and they want to speak to people.”"
634;STT;State Street Corp;2008-09-07T19:23:46Z;The sector stays aloft in a risky climate;;"If there is one phrase that recurs time and again in discussing the asset services world and comparing it with a year ago, it is “a flight to quality”. It is a form of words more usually associated with the investment management side of the equation, but has become ever more important over the past 12 months to those servicing that industry as the fallout from the credit crisis has continued to spread.“The credit and liquidity crunch that we have all faced have made counterparty risk more important in recent months,” says Jay Hooley, president and chief operating officer at State Street in Boston. “There has been a flight to quality as investment managers and hedge funds look to the safety and soundness of their counterparties. We have seen increased demand from hedge funds to act as custodian for their assets, as concerns grow about their prime brokers.”Jacques-Philippe Marson, president and chief executive officer at BNP Paribas Securities Services in Paris, says his bank’s AA+ credit rating is a key criterion in attracting new business.The safety and soundness elements go beyond the creditworthiness of a counterparty. There has also been a flight to quality from an operational point of view, adds Tim Keaney, co-chief executive at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing: “The past 12 months have spawned a number of interesting challenges for us that have raised the bar for our industry,” he says. “We all face new and more complex demands from clients, and operational excellence has become a prime requirement for new mandates alongside flexibility and price.”Liquidity, too, is a major factor, where counterparties are concerned, making the availability of credit a major issue in the industry.“We are being approached by clients who are having difficult conversations with some of their existing providers of liquidity,” says Satvinder Singh, head of Citi’s direct custody and clearing business in Europe, Middle East and Africa.The renewed focus on risk and risk management is highlighted, and welcomed, by Philippe Carrel, the
Geneva-based executive vice-president in charge of business development for Thomson Reuters. “Risk is being reviewed from scratch,” he says. Value at risk, which had a faithful following for a decade or so in financial services as a way of identifying and measuring risk, and allocating capital to that risk, “has had its day in the sun and is now obsolete”, Mr Carrel declares.He says people are leaving their ivory towers, accepting that things have changed, and that the answers to life, the universe and everything do not lie in obscure economic models.Risk management needs to become an everyday task, rather than an extension of the audit function. The new environment has brought into the limelight a method he tentatively describes as valuation risk, a common sense and pro-active approach to measuring market risk and credit risk together.“Market risk and credit risk are very closely linked,” says Mr Carrel. “The way the market has evolved, your market risk becomes my credit risk, and this has funding implications. A single miscalculation can affect confidence, sending funding costs through the roof.”There is more, of course, to asset services than just numbers and systems, although the numbers are large, the systems increasingly sophisticated, and inter-operability between multilateral trading facilities, central counterparties, custodians and central securities depositories also high on the list of priorities.People still matter in an industry where there remains a strong emphasis on “high-touch” contact with clients. “People and talent underpin everything in this industry,” says Citi’s Mr Singh. “We need to attract, retain and nurture it.”A looming lack of talent in the traditional centres does not bode well, he says, and could lead to an increase in the outsourcing and offshoring by asset servicers of certain functions in the processing chain.Part of Citi’s own solution to the talent problem has been to open for business in Belfast – a move that has been much more successful than it had expected.The likelihood of a renewed wave of consolidation – as smaller players decide to exit asset servicing rather than invest in the technology they will need – is another key
theme that industry participants expect to see develop further.“We are prepared for more opportunities to make acquisitions or forge partnerships to fuel growth in the US and elsewhere,” says Jim Palermo, co-chief executive at BNY Mellon, which is still in the throes of its post-merger integration.“As an asset servicer you establish very close relationships with clients, often talking to them several times a day.Clients want to maintain those kinds of intensive relationships, but that commitment requires significant resources,” says Mr Palermo.“A catalyst of change could be the current economic downturn. We don’t know how long it will last, but if you can’t weather it, you are unlikely to maintain a market presence.” he says.“So over the next six to 18 months we expect some providers to exit and those franchises to become available.”In Asia, market liberalisation, the growth of the mutual fund industry, and the greying population all augur well for the custody and fund administration business over the next few decades, says Neil Daswani, global head securities services at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore.“A number of international asset management companies and insurance majors are entering the Asian arena,” says Mr Daswani. “These new entrants do not want to invest in large armies of people and are prepared to outsource non-core functions such as custody, fund administration and transfer agency.”The future does look bright, then, at least for some, and the final word, for now, goes to Tim Howell, global head of HSBC Securities Services, pondering the reckoning that many expect to see.“Asset services has developed very much along the lines I predicted a year ago, in this very spot, albeit much more rapidly than anyone could have expected at that time,” he says.“Today we have a much more grown-up business, in which people are playing more to their individual strengths than has been the case in the past.“Our industry is not only very profitable but also has much more growth left in it. People cannot afford, though, to spend hundreds of millions of dollars only to find they’re a loser three years later.”"

636;STT;State Street Corp;2008-08-31T18:42:31Z;Climate changing in favour of SRI;;"The traditional view of an investment approach that takes account of environmental, social and governance issues has been one of compromise: conscience-
burdened investors having to forgo returns for the warm inner feeling that their investments were not being used to manufacture
weapons.But things have changed: investors no longer worry about settling for lower returns in order to satisfy their scruples.Fund management style has evolved so that investors – in particular pension funds – are moving away from blocking out companies involved in certain industries and are looking to engage with them instead.The largest growth area for this kind of investing has been climate change funds. The increasing acceptance that the environment is under threat from human activity has also meant more general socially responsible investment funds have attracted greater interest.Lord Stern’s 2006 report for the UK government into the economics of climate change predicted the value of low-carbon energy markets would be $500bn (£271bn, €340bn) by 2050, so it is no wonder many funds are seeing the green light.Emma Howard Boyd, head of SRI and governance at Jupiter, says the company’s green fund managers believe they are “currently seeing the most interesting juncture in 20 years in terms of green investing”, despite economic volatility. She says this is due to attractive valuations and a huge uplift in activity and interest.According to Ms Howard Boyd there are three key drivers for this: governments taking more action, consumers demanding sustainable products and businesses looking to exploit this opportunity. She says this triumvirate is positively engaged, resulting in a virtuous
circle.William Page, chair of State Street Global Advisor’s socially responsible investment team, has been keeping his eye on international agreements on climate change quotas such as the Bali roadmap. He believes they could directly affect investments.“Potential legislation may include incentives for the development of environmentally sustainable products and services across the economy. Not only is there a need to respond to and combat the effects of climate change, there is also a need
to adapt,” he says. “We believe demand will increase for services that, for example, enable better agricultural yields and more efficient management of natural resources. Legislation will soon require carbon dioxide emissions to carry a defined price. With CO2 recognised as an internalised cost to doing business, companies with greater CO2 emissions will be penalised.”The recognised need to tackle climate change has
led to the launch of funds focused on investing in green technology. Craig Mackenzie, director of the Carbon Benchmarking Project at Edinburgh University and an ESG consultant for Hymans Robertson, describes the buzz being generated around two such funds – from BlackRock and Pictet Asset Management – as being similar to the dotcom boom.“Lots of pension funds are really interested,” he says. “One attraction for those funds is there is no muddying the waters with ethics. There is no ethical judgment involved.”Pension funds looking to invest ethically have often found themselves in a legal minefield. The ruling in the Cowan v Scargill case of 1985 has been widely seen as setting a precedent that pen
sion funds should invest solely for the purpose of getting the best returns for members rather than taking an ethical stance.This view was challenged by a report on behalf of the United Nations in 2005 by lawyers Freshfield Bruckhaus Deringer, which suggested that failing to take ESG issues into account might constitute a breach of fiduciary duties. However, this has not been tested in court and Cowan v Scargill continues to act as a powerful deterrent.But investors can get around this by using positive engagement rather than negative screening, according to Tim Currell, head of sustainable investment and corporate governance at Hewitt,. “Where SRI would usually exclude tobacco stocks because it would seem immoral, an ESG approach would take a view on the litigation risk when assessing whether or not to invest,” he says.Mr Currell believes green investment is now less about trying to change the world, and more about seeing how the encompassing green agenda will affect investments.“Climate change is the biggest issue of the moment,” he says, “only a fool would think about investing without considering the impact.”Owen Walker is assistant editor at Pensions Management.

637;STT;State Street Corp;2008-08-22T19:55:56Z;Long view: Strategic short-sellers not the root of all evil;;Last month, as world stock markets degenerated into panic, it was time to round up the usual suspects. US regulators announced a crackdown on short-sellers.It is hard not to be cynical about this. Short-sellers are an easy and inviting political target. By borrowing stock and selling it, they hope to make a profit by buying it back at a lower price.Companies naturally dislike investors who bet on their share price to go down. But the activity is legal, and helps keep the market efficient. If the shorts are right, and a company is overvalued, its price will come down in time regardless. By publishing their own analysis, they can stop damaging misvaluations from persisting.But it looks as though the cynicism may have been a little misguided this time. The proportion of shares on the New York Stock Exchange sold short has risen significantly, from 3.3 to 4.86 per cent, since the abandonment last July of a rule that shares could only be shorted when their last move had been upwards (the so-called “uptick rule”). This made it easier to make speculative attacks, forcing down the price of troubled companies.Circumstantial evidence suggests that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s clampdown on “naked” shorting (where shares are sold even if they have not been borrowed first) did affect the market.The announcement came in the middle of New York trading on July 15. It was followed by a rally. For the US market, that moment still marks a bottom.The ban on naked shorts covered 19 stocks, including the big investment banks and the mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They were considered strategically important.In the ensuing days, the market value of the 19 rose 30 per cent, according to Barclays Capital. Once the ban was lifted on August 12, they dropped once more.A number of well-known hedge fund managers had made very public criticisms of the agencies and the broker-dealers, proclaiming that they were short. They were under “attack”.Further, if the rally was not caused by short-sellers struggling to buy back stock, it is hard to see what did cause it. Trading volumes were thin, and conventional money managers were not selling financial stocks.State Street, one of the largest players in custody, the business of holding the securities bought and sold by investment institutions, keeps data on how its clients are moving money.These fund managers are generally not allowed to sell stocks short, and do not use leverage. They are referred to in the Wall Street argot as “real money”.According to State Street, these big players stopped selling financial stocks early this year. Indeed, institutions have been buying financials globally all year, and “the pace of buying has picked up recently,” according to State Street’s Saul Henry.Some of this will reflect taking up the huge volume of new shares that the financials have issued as they try to raise new capital. But State Street is currently seeing net inflows to financial shares that account for about 0.75 per cent of the total market value of global financials every day.So the precipitate “sell-off” that saw bank stocks fall by about 40 per cent in a matter of weeks on both sides of the Atlantic, in fact occurred in spite of heavy aggregate buying by real money.Hedge fund data also suggest that the July panic and reversal were driven by short-sellers. The sector is not transparent, but it looks as though hedge funds had a terrible time in July. Indexes show that they suffered severe losses.But even if July’s collapse in financial shares did owe much to short-sellers, this does not mean that the recovery since then is robust. It has been achieved on thin trading volume in the dog days of summer, while credit conditions worsen and the money market grows tighter.Even as the oil price, a critical factor in depressing share prices earlier in the summer, returned to levels it had not seen since April, share prices remained far below the levels they set back then.And much of the big institutional money has moved into financials for bad reasons. Generally, it is either attempting to match an index, or hugging closely to it as a benchmark. When the price of the financials in their portfolio falls, they often find that they need to buy financials just to get back to their benchmark.This is not necessarily a good investment idea. In many ways it is a brainless but institutionalised defence against aggressive behaviour by short-sellers.A further problem is that the market may have sold off indiscriminately in July, but it now seems to be much more discriminating.By this week, the prices of Fannie and Freddie were lower than they were at the worst of the panic, even as many financials were higher. Indeed, they had almost returned to their lows even before the ban on naked shorts was lifted.This reflects a considered judgment that the agencies will find it hard, in current US mortgage market conditions, to raise the capital they need from the stock market. And it cannot be blamed on short-sellers.
638;STT;State Street Corp;2008-07-20T20:59:06Z;Dublin shrugs off downturn blues;;There is little talk of gloom and doom in Dublin’s International Financial Services Centre. Confidence remains undimmed despite a probable Irish recession this year, as well as possible threats to the IFSC’s dominance as a global asset servicing centre from hungrier, lower-cost destinations such as Poland.Indeed, many in the country’s $2,200bn (£1,099bn, €1,387bn) asset servicing sector quietly welcome the country’s economic slowdown. To an extent, it provides an antidote to the biggest problem Ireland has faced as a fund administration base: escalating costs and a skills shortage that was itself fuelling further labour costs.It means players such as State Street will face less competition for talent from domestic facing players, such as the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, and from the country’s now emasculated property and construction sectors.Willie Slattery, managing director of State Street International, says: “I have no interest in seeing people being hurt but the objective fact is the Irish slowdown is creating a more competitive labour market, which helps people such as ourselves who trade internationally.”Having gained a significant Irish presence with its acquisition of Deutsche Bank’s custody arm in 2002, State Street is Ireland’s largest player in the fund administration sector, with $630bn in funds under administration ($315bn of which is hedge fund money) and 2,200 employees in the republic.Mr Slattery, a former regulator at the Irish central bank, says the Boston-based group’s business is still growing in Ireland despite the downturn. “We’re still seeing good solid demand, especially from customers in Asia and the Middle East, including fund management groups and sovereign wealth funds,” he says.Rob Richardson, chief executive of Pioneer Investments, which manages assets of €120bn from Dublin (including €7bn-worth of hedge funds) says: “Internationally focused businesses such as State Street and ourselves are almost immune to the economic slowdown in Ireland. We’re not selling to Ireland, we’re selling all over the world.“Everyone obviously has their eye on the markets and on the credit crunch. But there are signs that mutual fund sales – for example sales of 401k retirement plans in the US – are holding up relatively well.”Before it was launched in 1987, the IFSC formed part of the dilapidated docklands district said to have been so run-down it was avoided by even the city’s rats. Today, however, the area plays host to a cosmopolitan array of financial services players including State Street, BNY Mellon, Citi, JPMorgan, and BNP Paribas.Dublin has effectively come from nowhere to become a strong challenger to Luxembourg as Europe’s biggest asset servicing centre. It has done this by becoming the home of choice for many Ucits funds, Europe’s leading domicile for money market funds and the largest administration centre for exchange traded funds in Europe. According to the Global Financial Centre’s Index published by the City of London, Dublin is the world’s 13th best financial centre and 10th for fund managementSo how has this been achieved in the 21 years of the IFSC’s existence? A number of positive factors have fuelled Dublin’s growth, notably Ireland’s position as a member of both the European Union and the eurozone, its use of English, the strong supply of well-educated graduates (at least until recently) and the country’s legal framework.However, regulation and tax were probably more critical to the IFSC’s success than anything. The financial regulator, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, is seen as combining robustness with responsiveness, and industry players welcome the efficiency of the regulatory approval process. The IFSRA can afford to be accommodating and attuned to innovations partly because of the lack of a significant indigenous fund management sector. Mr Slattery says: “Here in Ireland we understand the benefit of having an appropriately pitched regulatory regime.”Low taxes have also played a big part in Dublin’s success. From the IFSC’s launch in 1987 until 2004-05, firms based there paid corporation tax at just 10 per cent. Although this has now risen to the standard 12.5 per cent, it still compares favourably with the 28 per cent levied in the UK and the EU average of 33 per cent.The biggest pressure, however, remains cost, which is why the current economic slowdown comes as a welcome respite. Some investment administration specialists, including Citi, have quietly been shifting some of their more menial processing work from Ireland to lower-cost destinations, including eastern Europe, India and South Africa, and this trend is expected to grow. However, people in Ireland’s asset servicing industry argue this will free up capacity to take on higher value and so-called “middle-office” functions.Mr Slattery says: “A lot of what we do is pretty complex stuff and our customers have extremely high expectations where service is concerned. Therefore, I don’t think that obtaining the skills in low-cost locations and managing your client expectations exclusively from servicing in low-cost jurisdictions is going to strike the right balance.”
639;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
640;STT;State Street Corp;2008-07-18T20:59:35Z;Overview: Equities rally as risk appetite recovers;;Reassuring results from leading investment banks and a dramatic slide in oil prices helped fuel a strong recovery in investor risk appetite this week, driving US and European equity markets higher and helping the dollar rally off a record low against the euro.The week began on an inauspicious note as the US government’s rescue plan for mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac failed to alleviate concerns about the wider financial sector – particularly after the failure of regional US bank IndyMac.But a series of better than expected earnings from US banks – including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo – laid the groundwork for a dramatic turnround in sentiment.At the same time, oil prices plunged – with US light crude at one point down more than $18 from last Friday’s record high of $147.27 a barrel, as a rise in US inventories suggested that demand was weakening.In New York on Friday, front-month West Texas Intermediate settled at $128.88, down more than 11 per cent over the week.“The pullback in crude is becoming more meaningful,” said Dominic Wilson, strategist at Goldman Sachs. “Given both the direct pressure on growth and the impact on the market’s inflation worries, it is unsurprising that the relief here is helping to act as a circuit-breaker.”The effect on equity markets of the slide in crude and the rally in financials was dramatic. In New York on Friday, the S&P 500 index had notched a weekly rise of 1.7 per cent, having fallen to its lowest level since November 2005 on Tuesday.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 3.4 per cent over the week while the FTSE 100 in London climbed 1.9 per cent.Asian markets were less sanguine, however. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average fell 1.8 per cent – its sixth successive weekly decline, while Hong Kong lost 1.4 per cent.There were even steeper falls in Asian emerging markets. Bangkok shed 9 per cent and Jakarta fell 6 per cent.According to State Street Global Markets, institutions have begun buying developed market equities for their relative safe haven status and selling emerging markets.“Developed markets are now cheap compared to their history,” said Jeremy Armitage, head of research at State Street. “Emerging markets are still relatively expensive.“The changing appetite for emerging markets may also reflect the perception that the credit crisis has now been eclipsed by a greater threat, namely inflation.”Indeed, central banks in Thailand, Mexico, the Philippines and Turkey raised interest rates this week to ward off mounting inflationary pressures.Chinese inflation fears returned to the spotlight as data showed consumer price inflation moderating for a second successive month but producer prices rising at a worryingly sharp rate.There were also concerns about a slowdown in Chinese economic growth in the second quarter.Inflation worries also came to the fore elsewhere. Headline prices in the US rose at their highest annual rate for 17 years last month, even as Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke warned of intensifying pressures on prices and “significant” downside risks to growth.The annual rate of eurozone consumer price inflation in June was confirmed at 4 per cent while prices in the UK last month rose by 3.8 per cent year-on-year. Both figures were well above the European Central Bank’s and Bank of England’s inflation targets.Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon cautioned: “Even if oil prices were to descend further from here, inflation data would remind us that inflationary pressures are not about to recede as inherent lags make their impact.”Credit markets had a far less volatile week than equity markets, with spreads in Europe and the US narrowing only slightly over the week.Henrik Arnt, credit strategist at Danske Bank, said the more stable tone was due to the realisation that lawmakers are willing to put out the safety net under systemically important institutions.“This is likely to benefit bondholders whereas shareholders could still get hurt,” Mr Arnt said.Government bond prices swung sharply, as safe-haven buying at the start of the week gave way to selling in favour of equity markets. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury had risen 16 basis points over the week to 4.10 per cent late on Friday, although the yield on the 10-year German Bund slipped 2bp to 4.58 per cent. UK Gilts suffered their biggest weekly drop for a month on concerns that inflation was accelerating and the Treasury might increase borrowing.In the currency markets, the dollar fell to a record low against the euro of $1.6038 before rallying in line with US equity markets. The yen was a major faller as the improvement in risk appetite undermined the low-yielding Japanese currency.
641;STT;State Street Corp;2008-07-15T20:49:28Z;Wall Street dominated by volatile trading;;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below 11,000 for the first time since February 2006 on Tuesday as fears about the financial sector, a dramatic fall in oil prices and news that the SEC planned to limit short-selling played against one another.The volatile day began in typically gloomy fashion with financials under particular pressure after a number of analyst downgrades, a banking-led sell-off in European and Asian markets and some poor results.Meredith Whitney, an analyst at Oppenheimer, downgraded Wachovia from “perform” to “underperform” slashing her full year 2008 and 2009 estimates and warned that the outlook for equity shareholders was “bleak”.Analysts at Barclays Capital said: “The likely need for additional capital to replace expected future losses is putting significant pressure on bank equities broadly . . . In many cases, the equities are down 40-60 per cent over the prior three months. This amounts to a shadow run on several banks.” Still, financials pared early losses as investors bought back into some of the stocks most heavily sold on Monday. By late-
afternoon the sector was down 3 per cent, having bounced off losses of as much as 5.7 per cent.Washington Mutual shares rallied 11.8 per cent to $3.61 after it said it was “well capitalised”. First Horizon, meanwhile, jumped 17 per cent to $5.89 after it reported second-quarter results largely in line with expectations and announced a new chief executive.State Street made ground, rising 7.1 per cent to $59.65 after posting big profit and revenue jumps in the second-quarter.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also pared losses, but only briefly, after Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said his agency would limit short-sales in the shares of the two government-sponsored entities and brokerage firms.The pair slumped 27.3 per cent to $7.07 and 26 per cent to $5.26. Wachovia cut its losses to 7.7 per cent at $9.08 after a spokesperson said it was “fundamentally strong”.Broader markets trimmed losses as oil prices dropped more than $6. The moves helped consumer discretionary stocks to advance in spite of new data showing that retail sales barely budged in June despite the tailwind of massive government rebate stimulus.The consumer discretionary sector rose 0.3 per cent and led by the likes of Hasbro and General Motors which added 6 per cent to $37.05 and 4.9 per cent to $9.84 respectively. GM also said it would undertake a radical restructuring plan, boosting the stocks.Some deal news also lifted sentiment. Sprint Nextel shares surged 9.4 per cent to $9.04 after reports that South Korea’s SK Telecom was in talks to buy the wireless company.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 1.1 per cent at 1,214.89 points – its lowest level since November 2005. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 10,961.80 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 2,215.71 points.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: ”It feels like the craziest day ever . . . The volatility index showed some real fear in the morning. But then oil sold off which calmed some people and brought buyers back into the market.”New data from the Labor Department showed that the cost of raw materials for producers continues to rise although core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel, moderated somewhat in June. Such costs are clearly taking their toll. Kimberly-Clark issued a profit warning blaming rising energy and distribution costs. The shares fell 6.5 per cent to $55.01.Eaton, the diversified engineering company, also declined 6.8 per cent to $74.47 after the company said 2008 profit would be lower than it previously projected because of rising oil prices. The industrials sector fell 1.8 per cent.Energy stocks were the biggest fallers, following oil prices lower. ExxonMobil dropped 3.8 per cent to $82.19, Chevron lost 3.6 per cent to $89.42 ConocoPhillips slid 4.1 per cent to $84.82. The sector has now lost 2.9 per cent over the year to date.Healthcare was the leading gainer and the only sector to hold positive territory consistently, climbing 1.3 per cent thanks to some decent earnings news from Johnson & Johnson and Genentech. The pair rose 1.9 per cent to $67.70 and 5.1 per cent to $79.25 respectively."
642;STT;State Street Corp;2008-07-06T16:36:34Z;Assets retreat as alpha disappears;;During the first half of this decade, the investment world tempered its collective expectations of long-run returns after the technology bubble burst. And US pension sponsors gained a new appreciation of their plans’ risks, and the challenge in meeting future required returns. For many, the new perspective led them to move into higher-risk alternative assets, but sponsors still had to address the performance of their largest asset class – US equities.Many found a solution in upgrading their passive equity holdings to dependable “enhanced” equity index funds. Several years of solid performance attracted crowds of investors, but enhanced strategies could not withstand the market swings in 2007 and 2008. Now a number of prominent sponsors are backing away, taking many billions with them.Engineered to wring modest and consistent excess returns through systematic, repeatable methods, enhanced index strategies offered alpha-hungry sponsors a compelling, low-cost alternative to passive indexing. One type invests in the index’s stocks, quantitatively reshuffling the weights (the largest are run by Barclays Global Investors, Goldman Sachs and State Street Global Advisors), while the other buys a market return with futures, and adds a layer of alpha from the credit markets (leaders by size, if not performance, are Pimco, BlackRock and Western Asset Management).For the three, five and 10 years ended December 2005, for instance, the median S&P 500 enhanced index fund posted annualised excess returns between 90 and 100 basis points, while incurring tracking error of about 1.50 per cent. It also stood up well against conventional large-cap US active management, garnering nearly as much excess return with one-third the tracking error, but at half the fees.Natural candidates for enhanced indexing were giant state pension funds, many of which had stuck to completely passive equities, lest their allocations swamp active managers’ portfolio capacity. The $82bn (£41bn, €52bn)-worth Washington State Investment Board, for example, took on about $3bn of US enhanced equity index funds in 2005, choosing three managers so as to diversify on style. The $248bn-worth Calpers hired six managers between late 2004 and early 2007, who were managing assets of $1.4bn at March 2008. By 2007, enhanced index funds made up 17 per cent of large plan portfolios, up from 7 per cent in 2001, according to Greenwich Associates.With high returns and no apparent capacity limits, managers saw assets in their category grow from $50bn in 2000 to $300bn in 2005. The graph below plots growth in managed assets in S&P 500-based enhanced strategies against the median performance of the 120 or so products in the group. Enhanced funds on other US equity indexes, such as the Russell 1000 and 3000, made up another $100bn or so in assets, for a total industry size of about $420bn at its peak in mid-year 2007.Imagine the disappointment, then, to sponsors, managers and consultants alike when the steady alpha of enhanced index funds disappeared in mid-2007. For the year ended March 2008, only one-fourth of S&P 500-based strategies beat the benchmark, and the median fund fell short by 96bp. The bottom quartile came at least 2.5 per cent behind the index, and Wamco’s large US Index Plus strategy trailed by 15 percentage points.Many of the stock-based strategies had a value tilt, and were caught in the sell-off in August 2007, and the capitulation of financial stocks that continues today, says David Kovacs, head of quantitative strategies at Turner Investment Partners, near Philadelphia.Returns of the synthetic bond-style strategies also collapsed in early 2007, as premiums for taking credit risk disappeared.The graph also shows assets starting to leave after returns fell off: in late 2007, Calpers’ board moved to reclaim much of the $1.4bn at its US enhanced managers, to be turned over to its successful internal indexing operation, and reallocated to its international and activist investing programmes.At the $39bn Teachers’ Retirement System of Illinois, 4 per cent of plan assets were reallocated to passive equities after the termination of one of the fund’s three enhanced managers. And the Massachusetts Public Retirement Investment Trust has terminated one of its three managers, although executive director Michael Travaglini attributed the move to organisational changes, rather than disappointing performance. EVestment Alliance tallies show that from June 2007 to March 2008, total assets in enhanced strategies have dropped by as much as $100bn, to $310bn. With about 11 per cent due to market losses, managers are likely to have seen liquidations of about 15 per cent of assets in just three quarters.Even if enhanced managers are able to patch up their performance in the future, the group may still be in for a few rough years. Due to the low tracking error design, incumbent managers are unlikely to make up the lost alpha quickly, even in the event of a rally.“Clients in the products with the worst performance are staying put for now,” reports a senior consultant at a leading firm. “A few clients with quant products have added another manager, and split the money to improve diversification, but most have done nothing so far, because it would be so expensive to liquidate the portfolios.”He adds: “In the past, we’ve supported US large-cap enhanced indexing as a good alternative to passive. But we’ll be reviewing our position in light of the recent unexpectedly high volatility, and I expect it will be some time before we come to any conclusions.”

644;STT;State Street Corp;2008-06-11T22:00:41Z;Taxing time for Lisbon’s supporters;;The lampposts in Dublin’s financial district are adorned with three different posters from three different organisations all proclaiming the same warning: Ireland will lose its right to set its own tax rate if voters today sign up to the Lisbon treaty.Taxes have remained at the centre of the country’s seven-week referendum campaign to ratify the European Union’s reform treaty, with No campaigners claiming that Ireland’s low corporation tax regime is under threat. A threat that has gained currency in spite of denials from the European Commission, experts at the Irish Institute of Taxation and every large political party and business group.Tax, like neutrality and abortion in previous referendums, has emerged as a symbol of Ireland’s special identity in Europe.Both sides are in favour of low corporate taxes to woo foreign investors. The issue has been whether the Lisbon treaty undermines the existing regime – or, as the No camp has refined its argument, whether signing the treaty would tie Ireland’s hands in the future if other member states push towards some form of EU-wide harmonisation of tax rates.“Undoubtedly it’s the biggest issue on the establishment’s mind in our dealings with the EU,” Willie Slattery, executive vice president and country head of State Street, a funds administrator, says.It is certainly a populist concern.Michael Ryan, tax partner at lawyers McCann FitzGerald, says: “If you were to ask people what issues that are affected by Europe are the most important, they would say tax. It’s been an easy issue to raise for the No camp.”But, he says: “What I’ve been surprised at is the people who have expressed concerns on the tax issue.” He says it has been cited as a reason to vote No by those on the left, who might normally be thought to be in favour of higher taxes for business.He believes it shows there is a recognition – even in these communities – of the importance of low business taxes to Ireland’s economic success.Ireland’s corporate tax take was €6.4bn ($10bn, £5bn) last year, representing a little less than half total tax revenues. Only Luxembourg of the EU 27 depends more on corporate taxes.In Germany the contribution is about 5 per cent of total tax take, in France 6 per cent and in the UK 9 per cent. Brendan Butler, director of EU and International affairs at Ibec, the Irish employers organisation, has spent much of the campaign on radio and television rebutting the No claims.He acknowledges that the No camp has successfully portrayed the debate “as if all the other 26 members are against Ireland”.But he points out that three member states have rates lower than Ireland’s 12.5 per cent and another nine countries have rates of less than 20 per cent.In the short term a No vote would have no effect on existing foreign investors. “They don’t necessarily look to see how we have voted in whatever treaty. What they are interested in is the tax regime, the wider business regime. They tend to be forward looking,” Mr Ryan says.But it would create some uncertainty for investors thinking of expanding or setting up in Ireland for the first time.Even the No camp has had to concede Ireland’s veto on tax matters is unaffected by Lisbon.Where they have sown doubts is over a proposal under consideration at the Commission for a common consolidated corporate tax base, which might be discussed during the French EU presidency in the second half of the year. This would affect the way profits are allocated and, thus, where the tax is paid, and could have a big impact on small exporting countries such as Ireland.Separately, there is the existing treaty provision whereby a group of at least nine member states – with approval from the commission – could agree a common tax regime on their own. Irish experts believe it would not only be administratively complex but would require the wholesale renegotiation of double taxation treaties between those inside and outside the bloc.Tax officials and business leaders say none of this is directly affected by Thursday’s vote.But Mr Slattery says: “There is no doubt there is a significant agenda in Europe and that gravely concerns us in Ireland.”
645;STT;State Street Corp;2008-06-01T07:20:07Z;Big boys try not to notice new kids;;Barclays Global Investors, which was among the first to launch indexed funds, set its sights early on exchange traded funds and has become the dominant force in the vital US market, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the global total.BGI’s US market share started rising again in the past year, after being pushed back by competitors. State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) – the huge asset management unit of State Street bank that launched the first ETF – had been breathing down BGI’s neck, but it has slipped back in the past year. BGI now holds more than half the $560bn (£284bn, €358bn) US market.In a low-margin business such as ETFs, scale is almost everything, and BGI has leveraged its advantage there for all it is worth. The group is already the largest money manager in the world, with $2,000bn in assets. Its iShares business, which manages its ETFs, has more than $320bn in assets under management in the US, with 159 ETFs.The first ETF was marketed by SSgA in 1993, and it remains the biggest, with more than $80bn. Its technical name is the Standard & Poor’s Deposit Receipt – it tracks the S&P 500 – but it is commonly known as Spider. However, it was BGI – the asset management unit of Barclays bank – that heavily developed the market after it identifed ETFs as a way to get into the US asset management business.Almost every fund group in the US has launched ETFs, although many may not last. In recent months, several dozen ETFs have been withdrawn, although most were from IndexIQ and Claymore.It is not surprising that the US market has attracted so many participants. ETFs have risen sharply to account for 7 per cent of mutual fund assets, up from 3 per cent five years ago, according to Financial Research Corporation. They are among the few sectors of the market that are growing.But the market remains highly concentrated, with the most successful participants tending to be either the giants such as BGI and SSgA, or niche players with a speciality, such as active ETF providers Wisdom Tree and PowerShares.Also, the big funds tend to dominate. Of last year’s $142bn inflows into ETFs, more than $30bn went to SSgA’s Spider. The 10 biggest ETFs represent close to half the industry, says Financial Research Corporation.SSgA, the second largest player with 23 per cent share, has suffered net outflows of close to $12bn in the first four months of the year. Many of the group’s bond funds have attracted negative publicity after they ran into trouble as a result of subprime mortage-related investments.However, SSgA still has plans for several new ETFs, including a family of actively managed ones.Many industry participants have been anxiously watching the debut of Vanguard, the indexing giant which entered the ETF market relatively recently.Vanguard has already developed a strong presence with about 8 per cent of the market. Its inflows in the first four months of the year were $7.3bn, compared with BGI’s $2bn.Wisdom Tree has made its name with a family of fundamentally managed ETFs, and is working hard to enter new investing areas.Last month it launched, with Dreyfus, the first ETFs for currency income, offering investors a chance to get yields from five currencies. Wisdom Tree said the currency ETFs had taken in $130m in assets just a week after launching.PowerShares, a unit of Invesco, recently received regulatory approval for an actively managed ETF, pushing this sector of the market into the spotlight.However, BGI remains the industry force to beat, although it says it is relatively unconcerned about competitors, since the products are growing so rapidly.Mike Latham, who heads BGI’s US ETF business, says: “Eight years ago, we had no mutual fund assets, now we are the fourth biggest mutual fund group in the US.“The market is extremely strong and getting stronger. More than 90 per cent of our ETFs increased assets last year. Demand from advisers remains high.”Over the next three to five years BGI expects to launch 20 to 40 new ETFs a year, he says. The group is also planning an actively managed ETF, although Mr Latham thinks this sector of the market will be “a slow build”.He reports that demand is broadly based, but waxes and wanes. “The time for each one comes and goes, according to investor sentiment,” he says.Last year, international ETFs were strong, and this year flows started going into fixed income, he says.BGI is launching a big advertising campaign aimed at what Mr Latham calls “phase two” of its ETF push.“Phase one was educate, educate, educate. Now we think there is a message to be got out there about investing,” he says.
646;STT;State Street Corp;2008-06-01T07:20:06Z;Time to take stock of the diffferent ways to replicate indices;;"Exchange traded funds have come a long way since they first appeared in the US in the early 1990s.Providers have added fresh indices from around the world, asset classes other than equities, fundamentally weighted indices and the ability to short and use leverage. They have also developed various ways of replicating indices.The first method was full replication. As the name suggests, this means buying every stock in an index.It is ideal for tracking large liquid indices such as the S&P 500 and FTSE 100, where ETFs can quickly buy and sell all the stocks, says John Tucker, vice-president and head of US equity markets in the global structured products group at State Street Global Advisors.Such funds should match the performance of the underlying index minus the management fee, transaction costs and stamp duty.The charges can be reduced by generating fees from stock lending. Axel Lomholt, head of ETF products at iShares, says the company’s MSCI Turkey ETF generates 1-2 per cent a year from stock lending, for example.As ETFs expanded to cover broader and less liquid indices, it became harder to buy and sell all the stocks quickly and cheaply.A further barrier to full replication in emerging markets comes in the form of restrictions on foreign ownership of certain stocks and some tax constraints. To get round these limitations, ETF providers developed partial replication.Under this approach, ETFs hold a proportion of the underlying index, such as 60 to 75 per cent of the stocks in MSCI World.ETFs seek to retain the overall characteristics of the index, and thus its performance, and avoid taking sector bets, says Manooj Mistry, head of db X-trackers in
the UK.Tracking error can potentially be greater than under full replication. But, Mr Lomholt says, partial replication may reduce transaction costs because fewer of the smaller and less liquid stocks are held. These are prone to come and go from an index and be the subject of corporate actions, potentially increasing transaction costs.Alternatively, ETFs can access overseas shares through an American depositary receipt (ADR) or global depositary receipt (GDR).Mr Tucker warns that the performance of ADRs and GDRs can differ from the share price of the overseas stock in the short term. “If a fund buys a GDR in London of a South Korean company, for example, the GDR may be subject to news flow while the South Korean exchange is closed.”Mr Lomholt says ETFs can combine both full and partial replication. An ETF may buy 80 per cent of an index, comprising the largest and most liquid stocks, for example. It can then partially replicate the remaining 20 per cent of the index.A further method is synthetic replication. A provider enters a swap agreement with an investment bank, under which the bankpromises to deliver the performance of the underlying index in exchange for a fee. Mr Mistry says the responsibility for replicating the underlying index is effectively transferred from the ETF provider to the investment bank.Dan Draper, global head of ETFs at Lyxor, says such synthetic replication should match the returns of the index minus any fees.Swaps have the advantage of not being subject to stamp duty and the transaction costs of buying and selling stocks, says Tim Mitchell, head of investing institutions at Invesco PowerShares.The cost of swaps varies over time, says Mr Tucker. If an ETF wants to take a long position on the Russell 2000 index and there is a lot of demand for short positions, for example, the swap will be cheap. “But the cost can change quickly if demand for short positions falls away,” he adds.The use of derivatives has enabled ETFs to short indices and provide leverage. It has also provided access to alternative asset classes, such as commodities and
currencies.William Rhind, head of UK sales at ETF Securities, says there are two ways to replicate commodity indices. One is to buy the physical commodity. This can provide exact replication of returns minus the charge for holding the commodity and management fees, says Mr Rhind.Funds can also buy futures contracts. These are bought on margin and the capital not used can generate interest for investors, says Mr Rhind.In the US, there are restrictions on the use of swaps by ETFs. As a result, structured notes and exchange traded notes (ETNs) are used to replicate commodity indices in particular. These are debt instruments that promise to pay the return of an index minus a fee.Their structure means Investors in ETNs and ETFs are exposed to potential counterparty risk. Mr Draper says the counterparty risk is limited to a maximum of 10 per cent of the ETF for Ucits III funds."

649;STT;State Street Corp;2008-05-11T20:23:14Z;Saving the funding level;;"Few investment professionals have been bold enough to view the subprime saga as an opportunity, yet for Peter Moon, chief investment officer at the £30bn (€38bn, $58bn) University Superannuation Scheme (USS), the credit crisis is a misnomer.Responsible for the defined benefit (DB) pensions of the UK’s higher education and university staff, Mr Moon claims his team of in-house investment professionals were well prepared for the turmoil that has plagued the markets since summer last year.Believing the markets to be “abnormal” in the period up to March 2007, USS went bearish in May last year and, supported by a strong cash flow of between £1bn (€1.3bn, $1.9bn) and £1.25bn, the scheme rode out the worst of the recent downturn. “A crunch isn’t actually the right word, unless a crunch takes three or four years to normalise itself,” Mr Moon says. “We believe our cash position will give us a golden opportunity as credit markets return to normal.”In terms of measuring the success of this early evasive action, USS is still waiting for the final results of its triennial valuation but Mr Moon believes the scheme’s funding level has moved little from the 91 per cent it reported in March 2007.While the UK’s pension funds have long been looking at diversifying their portfolios into alternative assets, few have allocated more than a cursory 3 per cent. In a typically pioneering move, USS recently announced its intention to move 20 per cent of its holdings to alternative asset classes, consequently reducing its hefty 80 per cent allocation to UK and overseas equities.Mr Moon says: “Having 80 per cent of your eggs in one basket is quite a percentage; by moving to 20 per cent alternatives we will reduce risk and volatility.”The move received trustee approval last month and Mr Moon hopes it will allow for greater access to outperformance: “There will be some attempt to gain alpha but it’s hard to get hold of. We will invest a fair chunk of that 20 per cent in alpha generating assets.”In addition to the typical private equity and hedge fund considerations, USS has examined other alternative asset classes, including volatility trades, forestry and commodities. The latter was dismissed for failing to proffer high enough returns, but USS was one of the first pension funds to invest in a hedge fund replication strategy, awarding $200m (£100m) to State Street Global Advisors in March this year.Continuing its pioneering approach, USS remains committed to socially responsible investment (SRI). The scheme is one of the driving forces behind the Enhanced Analytics Initiative, a project to encourage analysts to include SRI issues in their research, and is a member of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change. More recently, it has engaged with its private equity fund managers on the issue of ethical investment.Mr Moon says: “We have been presenting our view on responsible investment to the private equity world. They have started to think it is an important issue that they hadn’t really thought about before.”USS’s attitude to SRI is driven primarily by a belief that climate change poses the biggest threat to the scheme’s financial well being. “Our investment challenges are climate change and the ability to predict what is going to happen in a world where the climate will certainly change,” says Mr Moon.“Further, the rich countries have benefited enormously from globalisation up to now and we will have to adapt to situations that are less beneficial for us. This will have an impact on our investment policy.”Costs are another issue for USS. In spite of the plan’s size and the fact it has made savings of £7-8m through an unbundling strategy, separating payments for trading and research, Mr Moon resents the fee structures common among active managers, and is critical of the performance targets fund managers claim to deliver.“We don’t mind paying fees, and high fees, as long as we get some enhanced performance over and above the market,” he says. “But if it is bog standard management then you should pay little or no fees.”He adds: “I’ve been around a long time and you don’t get performance of 2 or 3 per cent above the index over the long term, however good you are. It is outrageous that the City, of which I have been a part for the past 35 years, can expect a real return on assets maybe of 4 to 6 per cent and charge half of that to pay itself.”Further, the recent Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levies have added to the burden. Mr Moon explains: “Our healthy funding position and strong Dun & Bradstreet scores mean that on any risk-based criteria we should be paying very little. We’ve been quite successful in negotiating on that, but our concern has been on the scheme-based levy, which is likely to be £3-3.5m.”In spite of these cost concerns, and with the looming impact of improved longevity, USS is unwavering in its support of DB as the future of the USS scheme. Mr Moon continues to actively encourage USS employers to seek out new members and concludes: “DB provides excellent benefits and remains the ideal vehicle for retirement saving.”"
650;STT;State Street Corp;2008-05-04T19:10:20Z;Debt instruments – fool’s gold or remedy to a slump?;;"Money does not grow on trees, but many investment banks are betting investment opportunities just might. State Street Global Advisors, Deutsche Bank and Barclays are just some of the institutions backing their bets with a bumper crop of commodity-based exchange traded notes and funds.There are now 60 commodities-linked US funds and notes tracked by Financial Research Corporation, although only nine have records stretching back more than two years. In Europe, over 100 exchange traded commodities are on offer, mostly from London-based ETF Securities.The first such products tracked commodities indices broadly, but recent months have brought a wave of far more focused offerings, giving investors exposure to everything from crude oil to soyabeans to lean hogs and cattle.The question remains, however, whether such a narrowly focused product makes sense for a retail investor. While it is still early in the game, investor excitement about such products has not quite matched the industry’s.There are a lot of new products on offer. Half of all exchange-traded product launches in the US this year have been commodities or currency-linked, says Jeffrey Ptak, director of exchange-traded securities analysis at Morningstar in Chicago.Unlike funds, exchange-traded notes are essentially debt instruments, whereas exchange-traded funds represent a stake in the commodities themselves. With ETFs, the challenge is obtaining up-to-the-minute pricing. ETNs, on the other hand, are unsecured debt, which poses credit risk. Still, each offers exposure to corners of the market previously too expensive, or too limited for investors to touch.“For the average investor, these products have really opened up the doors for diversifying in new areas,” says Tom Lydon, a financial adviser in Newport Beach, California and editor of ETFTrends.com.The newest generation to hit the market involves corporate leverage, offering greater upside return but also significant downside risk. In London, ETF Securities in March unveiled a series of 33 leveraged exchange traded commodity products based on indices tracking, among other things, coffee, corn, wheat and zinc.On the New York Stock Exchange Arca platform, Deutsche Bank in February rolled out Gold Double Short and Gold Double Long ETNs. In April, the company added four more leveraged ETNs, offering long, double long, short and double shorting of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Optimum Yield Agriculture Index.“As many bulls as there are, there are also a handful of bears who demand short products,” says Kevin Rich, a managing director with Deutsche Bank Global Markets Investment Products.What remains to be seen is whether these specialised sector products truly are a portfolio-boosting antidote to flat equity markets, or just the latest version of old-fashioned fool’s gold.“Investors should recognise these are volatile markets and understand these markets before they invest,” says Mr Rich.Anthony Ogorek, a registered investment adviser and principal of Ogorek Wealth Management in Williamsville, New York warns: “People need to understand there is no central bank setting the prices of these commodities.”The only parties guaranteed to get rich from these products are the banks that sponsor them, he says.That is because the risk to the banks to roll out new products is negligible, says Morningstar’s Mr Ptak.In most cases, the product is coming from a bank or
partner to a bank already trading in the underlying commodities. Besides the risk of the underlying indices, investors must also consider the potential risk of the bank underwriting the note.Simply because the bank behind the note is a big name, does not mean the product is guaranteed, says Jason Cole, managing director of Abacus Wealth Partners in Philadelphia. “Given the credit crunch, you don’t want to run into a situation where you have illiquidity.”While some commodity exposure is important, investors are much better off in products linked to broader commodities indices or more common products, advisers and analyst agree.In fact, gold and oil rule the top five exchange traded commodities products, according to data from Financial Research Corporation. And, as with the broader exchange traded product arena, the companies with the longest records and strongest reputations dominate.The largest commodities-based exchange traded fund is State Street Global Advisors’ $19.3bn (£9.8bn, €12.4bn) StreetTracks Gold ETF, which saw $590m in new money in March.That is followed by: State Street’s $4.7bn Select Sector Energy SPDR; Barclays’ $3.2bn iShares Silver Trust; the $2.2bn PowerShares Commodity Index, which is sponsored by Deutche Bank Commodity Services; and Barclay’s iShares Goldman Sachs Natural Resources Index, which held $2.2bn as of the end of March, according to FRC.Even Barclays has yet to attract significant assets to its specialised commodities ETNs, which are marketed under the iPath brand and were introduced in October. As of the end of March, the copper, nickel, and energy products had $11m, $7m and $7m, respectively.Perhaps that is because these products cater to hedge fund managers and other professional traders looking to make surgical strikes, without moving into cash, says Owen Concannon, director of managed accounts and alternatives at FRC. “You have to remember these products are accessible to anyone, but certainly not marketed to everyone,” he says.Hannah Glover is a reporter on Ignites, an FT publication"
651;STT;State Street Corp;2008-05-02T23:09:14Z;ING to buy CitiStreet in $900m deal;;Citigroup and State Street said on Friday they would sell their retirement benefits servicing joint venture to ING Group for $900m in cash.CitiStreet, formed as a 50:50 joint venture in 2000, offers administrative and record-keeping services for 12m participants in 16,000 retirement plans in the US and Australia.The move comes as Citigroup, under Vikram Pandit, chief executive, is attempting to slash its $61.6bn cost base by up to 20 per cent, in part by selling non-core businesses.The effort is part of Mr Pandit’s strategy to return Citi to profitability following two quarters of multi-billion-dollar losses driven by writedowns on mortgage-related assets and leveraged loans.Mr Pandit has rebuffed calls for a large-scale break-up of Citi but has said he would focus the bank more on its core consumer, investment banking and capital markets businesses.In announcing the sale on Friday, Charles Johnston, president of Citi Global Wealth Management, said CitiStreet was an industry leader but “retirement plan record-keeping and administrative services are not strategic priorities for us”.ING, the Dutch financial services company, said the acquisition would make it the third-largest defined-contribution benefits manager in the US after Fidelity and TIAA-Cref.ING said it would have $351bn in assets under management and assets under administration following the transaction. ING plans to fund the purchase from existing resources and expects CitiStreet to add to earnings by 2010.Kathleen Murphy, chief executive of ING’s US wealth management business, said in an interview that Citi-Street would dramatically increase the bank’s benefits servicing footprint in the US by adding large clients to its group of small to mid-size organisations.CitiStreet was a more strategic asset for Citigroup when it owned its own asset management business and could populate retirement plans with its own funds. Citi sold its asset management business to Legg Mason in 2005.Analysts praised the decision by Citi to shed the business, and the bank’s shares gained 1.54 per cent to close at $26.39.Separately, Citigroup said in a regulatory filing on Friday that nearly all outside investors would be withdrawing their money from a multi-strategy hedge fund managed by Old Lane Partners, Mr Pandit’s old firm, which was acquired by Citigroup in 2007. They were given the opportunity to withdraw their money after a number of executives were promoted to other positions within the company.Lazard advised ING, and Goldman Sachs advised State Street. Citi was advised by its own institutional clients group.
652;STT;State Street Corp;2008-04-20T21:05:31Z;Greens see red over US funds;;Some US fund firms are green only in patches. They oppose nearly all shareholder resolutions to take action on climate change, despite aggressive investment in climate-related business activities.Morgan Stanley and State Street Global Advisors were singled out for criticism of their “inconsistent behaviour” by Ceres, a grouping of investors with an environmental purpose.Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, said: “More mutual fund firms are waking up to the broad financial realities of climate change, but very few are integrating this awareness across all of their business activities, including proxy voting policies.”She warned that climate change could become as serious a financial issue as subprime mortgages: “Investors should be scrubbing their portfolios for climate risks just as they’re now scrubbing them for hidden subprime risks. Mutual funds that are ignoring climate resolutions aimed at boosting corporate disclosure of climate risks are failing in their fiduciary responsibilities and failing their customers.” Ceres found that some asset managers, such as Goldman Sachs, supported many climate resolutions outright, and others, such as Fidelity and Janus, abstained on most or all resolutions after opposing them in the past.Attitudes were changing slowly, according to Ceres, which found mutual funds voted against 65 per cent of environmental proposals last year, compared to 78 per cent in 2004. The funds abstained on 24 per cent of proposals in 2007, against 12 per cent in 2004.In Europe, asset managers appear more conscious of the need to consider environmental risks. Leading European investors that are signatories to the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change statement say the environment is increasingly a core investment issue.According to an IIGCC report, 90 per cent of asset manager signatories engage with companies to encourage improved reporting on climate change and to consider regulatory risks.More than 80 per cent of pension funds and other asset owners encourage their managers to exercise voting rights on climate change issues. However only 30 per cent of asset owners formally integrate climate change in their processes for appointing and evaluating fund managers.

afternoon bank and brokerage stocks had recovered thanks to a rare spot of good news from a pair of regional banks.Regions Financial, the biggest bank in Alabama, and M&T Bank, part-owned by Berkshire Hathaway, said gains from selling their stakes in Visa and increased fee income had enhanced first-quarter results.Regions shares rose 8.4 per cent to $20.12 while M&T added 6.3 per cent to $85.86, pushing broader indices into the black.That news helped offset revelations that State Street, the money manager for institutions, could be forced to bail out a number of mortgage-backed debt funds, or “conduits”, that have already incurred $1.49bn in unrealised mark-to-market losses. State Street fell 9.9 per cent to $69.23 after rising as much as 4 per cent earlier in the day after the company had reported a 69 per cent increase in first-quarter earnings.“If you are looking to see if we have turned a corner with financials, then the answer is probably no,” said Thomas Nyheim vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust. “They are going to keep coming out with mixed numbers, but it seems to be priced into the market.”The financials sector was among the leading gainers in the broader S&P 500, with the financials index up 1.1 per cent, snapping a five-day losing streak.Throughout the day the markets struggled to find a clear direction as investors were hit with a raft of conflicting data including reports showing rising inflation, stabilising manufacturing activity in New York state and a slightly more optimistic outlook among homebuilders.By the close, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,334.44.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 2,286.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also added 0.5 per cent, to 12,362.47.Still, the S&P 500 has fallen in four out of the past six sessions, as a string of disappointing first-quarter earnings results from the likes of Wachovia, and expectations of worse to come, weighed on investor confidence.Markets started on Tuesday in a positive mood after better-than-expected results from healthcare sector bellwether Johnson & Johnson.The group’s profits jumped in the first quarter, breaking the run of bad earnings news from major US corporations that has undermined sentiment in the past two weeks.But the results left investors largely unmoved once trading began and the shares fell 0.1 per cent to $65.65 while an index of healthcare stocks fell 0.2 per cent.Technology companies also suffered after a series of earnings downgrades by analysts worried that a slowdown will hit profits. An index of technology stocks shed as much as 0.9 per cent before rallying towards the close.Computer component makers EMC and Emulex led the fallers, dropping 3.2 per cent to $14.17 and 6.3 per cent to $12.74 respectively after Citigroup downgraded the stocks.Cisco and IBM also lost ground, falling 0.9 per cent to $23.11 and 0.1 per cent to $117.17 respectively.First-quarter results from Intel, the leading semiconductor manufacturer and industry bellwether, should help reassure investors spooked by disappointing results from arch-rival AMD last week however. Intel said profits fell 12 per cent to $1.44bn but first quarter sales rose 9.3 per cent to $9.67bn. The shares fell 0.9 per cent to $20.75 in after-hours trading.Record oil prices and buoyant commodity prices lifted oil producers, material stocks and wider indices. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips added 1.2 per cent to $90.80 and 1.8 per cent to $81.24 respectively.Airline companies, however, fared poorly as analysts and investors worried that rising fuel costs would eat up any benefits from recent moves to consolidate the industry.Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines jumped in pre-market trading after they agreed to a $3.63bn merger, but by the close Delta shares were down 12.6 per cent to $9.66. Northwest fell 8.4 per cent to $10.28."

655;STT;State Street Corp;2008-03-20T20:14:34Z;Cloned’ strategies offer investors better options;;"Private investors looking to increase their exposure to hedge funds are likely to have more options in the coming years thanks to the efforts of academics.Replication strategies are being used to create a suite of products which intend to replicate mechanically the returns of major hedge fund strategies. And Professors William Fung and Narayan Naik of the London Business School and David Hsieh of Duke University are advising investment banks and asset managers how to go about it.The idea behind synthetic hedge funds is that – in theory – the high returns offered by hedge funds are due more to the performance of the underlying assets in which they are invested than the skills of well-paid managers.The prospect of cloning hedge fund strategies offers investors the opportunity to invest without paying standard fees of 2 per cent a year for management and 20 per cent for performance. It also offers investors the chance to invest in funds which are more liquid and less opaque and do not require long lock-up periods. Lastly, synthetic hedge funds are attractive alternatives to funds of hedge funds, which look increasingly expensive in a bear market as they carry a double layer of fees.“Managers at investment banks have started asking the question why does someone have to pay a 2 per cent fixed fee and a 20 per cent performance fee to access hedge fund strategies which depend largely on the movements of underlying assets,” says Prof Naik. “The advantage of these funds is they have lower fixed fees, greater liquidity and more transparency.”Investment banks have scrambled to launch hedge fund clones in the past 18 months, with Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, State Street and Deutsche Bank among those seeking to provide hedge fund replication models which offer cheap, generic hedge fund returns.The primary way banks tend to go about this is by setting up algorithm-based indices which intend to match the returns of the main hedge fund indices such as the CSFB/Tremont Index and the HFRX index. Indices gain exposure to a range of underlying hedge fund assets such as the US dollar, the Russell 2000 Index and the S&P 500 through futures contracts and options.These indices tend to vary in transparency, according to Hsieh. Merrill Lynch’s Factor Index, for example, publicises its allocations for its index components, which include the S&P 500, the US dollar index and one month libor (interbank lending) rates. Goldman Sachs Absolute Return Tracker index is a proprietary and partly discretionary non-transparent index, meanwhile.The products are still largely the domain of institutional investors – with pension funds in particular expressing an interest
in hedge-fund replication models.Last month, State Street Global Advisors launched multi-asset products, which offer UK institutional investors, the opportunity to gain exposure to a variety of asset classes, including hedge funds. The offering includes a hedge fund replication instrument, the SSgA Premia strategy, which is based on research and ongoing analysis by Narayan Naik of LBS.But private banks now offer retail clients the opportunity to invest in structured products offered by banks by pooling funds. And there are a handful of listed replication funds available to private investors which offer exposure to traditional hedge fund strategies.Blue White’s Alternative Beta fund, a Sivac listed in Luxembourg, for example – which launched in May last year – replicates the market exposures of the best performing hedge funds, mimicking directional equity strategies, relative value arbitrage and tactical trading strategies in a single fund. All investments are made in liquid-exchange-traded instruments such as futures contracts, exchange-traded funds and options.And Jaako Karki, chief executive of Blue White Alternative Investments Limited, claims the fund is superior to tracking products set up by investment banks as it excludes exposure to sub-par trading strategies.“We don’t include below-average managers. Why should you replicate an index which includes good, bad, dead and ugly funds?” questions Karki, a former professor at London Business school.While proponents believe replication could revolutionise hedge fund investing in the way that index tracking shook up the traditional fund management world a generation ago, many argue that the market for hedge fund replication models should be avoided until it is tested in the long-term.A problem yet to be resolved is the fact that systems which copycat hedge fund strategies will always “lag” behind managers who are investing in real-time.“As soon as the programme figures out what position a hedge fund manager is in, they may be out of it,” explains Ravi Bulchandani, head of alternative investments at Barclays Wealth. “Current state of research suggests there is still a bit of a gap in terms of what you can achieve using replication strategies in terms of return.”As a result, some wealth advisers are hesitant to encourage clients to look into these sorts of products.“I don’t think this field has developed to the point where you can say you can get true replication,” concludes Pablo Balan, head of quantitative analysis at Coutts.“We have a strong team of analysts looking at the hedge fund space. We have established relationships with some of the best managers out there and we think we are more than compensated for the fees we are getting charged by picking the right hedge fund strategies and managers.”Replication strategies have yet to attract large sums of money, with some $500m-$600m estimated to be held by Merrill, Goldman, Deutsche and Societe Generale, as well as $700m managed by Partners Group, a Swiss alternative assets specialist, and perhaps a similar sum in over-the-counter derivatives."

657;STT;State Street Corp;2008-01-17T19:36:34Z;Index trackers;;Why bother with the needle when you can buy the haystack? Institutional investors are piling into funds that track indices. Legal & General, the UK’s largest provider, enjoyed a whopping 155 per cent surge in new business last year. State Street Global Advisors and Barclays Global Investors also report big inflows.In part, the influx is a symptom of reduced risk appetites. L&G’s existing tracker clients more than doubled their exposure last year, while many new clients sought to counterbalance riskier bets elsewhere – allocations to hedge funds, or high-conviction sector or country calls. But recent inflows may also reflect a more fundamental realisation that many notionally active funds are in fact closet trackers, charging big fees for stock-picking and trade execution in exchange for returns barely above the benchmark.So it is not surprising that clients are uprooting inactive portions of active portfolios in search of lower fees. Over the long term, passive funds will almost always beat their active brethren. The relentless arithmetic of lower expenses means that £100 invested in the median index tracker five years ago would be worth roughly £200 after fees today, versus £196 in the active retail unit trust sector, according to Morningstar and Bank of New York Mellon.Of course, indexing has its drawbacks. The appeal of cheap tracking naturally wanes in a prolonged bear market. Most equity index trackers will leave investors overweight in certain sectors, such as natural resources, banks and telecoms. Index shake-ups, forcing managers to ditch depressed stocks and pay up for inflated ones, can also eat away returns. And recent asset accumulation by tracker funds may have been flattered by jumpy institutions “parking” money while they seek out new active managers.But while index funds will rarely be the best performers, they will never be the worst. In uncertain conditions, that looks attractive.Read and post comments on this Lex
658;STT;State Street Corp;2008-01-16T01:51:08Z;Legg Mason to shore up capital;;Legg Mason, the US fund management company, has joined the rush to shore up capital, selling $1.25bn in convertible senior notes to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm.KKR, which will be a minority investor, will take a seat on the board of Legg as part of the deal.Legg will use up to $200m of the proceeds to buy back 2.5m preferred shares held by Citigroup. The stock will be retired, said Legg in a statement on Monday night. Citi retains another 5.5m preferred shares in Legg.The remainder of the proceeds will be used to strengthen Legg’s balance sheet and for general purposes, including potential acquisitions, it said.A few weeks ago, Legg announced a $1.1bn bailout of its money market funds in a move which halved its exposure to troubled Structured Investment Vehicle (SIV) debt.Legg, which has $1,000bn under management, has seen its share price drop by 30 per cent in the past year as it struggled to absorb its purchase of Citigroup’s asset management arm, while being hit by a performance downturn and investor outflows from its funds.It warned in its statement that it expected its December quarter earnings to fall, to between $1.04 and $1.09 a diluted share. However, that was still slightly above analysts’ estimates.Scott Nuttall, who was nominated by KKR as its representative on the board, said Legg was one of the world’s leading asset management franchises and had “a very bright future”.KKR, which is best known as a buyout firm, has previously taken minority stakes in companies along with a board seat. Last year it did so with Sun Microsystems.The notes will expire in 2015 and are convertible into cash or into Legg Mason stock. The conversion price would be at $88 a share. Legg shares on Tuesday were trading at $70.State Street Corporation, the world’s biggest institutional money manager, also said it would raise $500m in a public offering, in a similar move to shore up its balance sheet. The money would qualify as “tier one” capital, the company said.The group, which also has a custody business, said its fourth quarter earnings fell by 28 per cent, to $223m, after it set aside $618m to cover legal claims and other costs relating to subprime losses in its bond funds. State Street shares fell more than 6 per cent on the news.The group a few weeks ago ousted the head of its $2,000bn asset management division after several investor lawsuits relating to its funds’ investments.Ron Logue, the chief executive, said it planned to appoint a new asset management head before the end of the first quarter.
659;STT;State Street Corp;2008-01-15T21:34:10Z;Wall Street hit by weak retail sales data;;US stocks plunged to their lowest level in ten months after Citigroup revealed a record $9.8bn quarterly loss and an unexpected decline in retail sales eroded confidence in the consumer sector.Concerns about problems in Citi’s consumer business and fears of further big writedowns in the financial sector sent equities into a spin. Energy stocks also hit the skids as the crude oil price retreated amid fears of weakening US demand.Even the prospect of sweeping interest rate cuts did little to stem losses as traders bet the US economy was heading for a sharp downturn.The S&P 500 fell 2.5 per cent to 1,380.95, its lowest level since March. The sell-off was broad-based, with only 24 companies trading in positive territory. The S&P moved further below its 80-week moving average, a technical support level last breached five years ago.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.2 per cent to 12,501.11 with Boeing among the leading bluechip fallers amid unconfirmed reports the company may announce more delays to its 787 Dreamliner jet. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.5 per cent to 2,417.59.Stocks hit reverse gear after Citigroup wrote off $18.1bn in subprime-related losses causing the bank to sink to a massive fourth-quarter loss and slash its dividend by 40 per cent.Traders were expecting Citi to “kitchen sink” the fourth quarter, but the $9.8bn loss still came as a shock to some analysts, who had forecast about half that amount.Citi’s consumer credit costs increased $5.4bn and included a $3.85bn charge to shore up loan loss reserves, suggesting the bank is heavily exposed to the weak US consumer loan market. The stock plunged 7.3 per cent to $26.94.Citi and Merrill Lynch said they would raise a total of $21.1bn in fresh capital to help shore up their weakened balance sheets. Merrill, which reports fourth-quarter results on Thursday, fell 5.3 per cent to $53.01.Elsewhere, Moneygram sank 49.5 per cent to $6.15 after the payment services company said net unrealised losses on the value of asset-backed securities rose from $571m to $860m.State Street, the money manager, fell 5.9 per cent to $79.82 after its fourth-quarter earnings fell 28 per cent and it set aside $618m to settle subprime-related legal claims.Consumer companies were also pummelled on Tuesday after retail sales capped their worst year since 2002 with a 0.4 per cent decline in December, the first monthly fall since June.Recent same-store sales results at mid and upmarket retailers have been poor but economists had still forecast an unchanged reading.The sales decline added to fears that US consumers, faced with falling house prices and rising mortgage costs, were trimming their spending on non-essentials.“A lot of the data are pointing to either very slow growth or a recession at this point,” said Brian Gendreau, investment strategist at ING Investment Management.Williams-Sonoma fell 9.9 per cent to $20.01 after the home furnishing retailer reported a decline in same-store sales and cut its full-year outlook.Sears Holdings and Nordstrom, the department store chains, fell 5.9 per cent to $86.02 and 5 per cent to $30.17 respectively.In technology Apple’s shares plunged 5.5 per cent to $169.04 after investors reacted with disappointment to a range of new product launches. Intel closed only 1.7 per cent lower at $22.69 but the shares plunged 10 per cent after-hours. The chipmaker reported a 51 per cent increase in net income to $2.27bn, narrowly missing Wall Street’s estimates.A combination of worrying employment data, a manufacturing slowdown and retail weakness have convinced traders that nothing less than a 50 basis point interest rate cut at the end of this month will do.Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, last week assured the market that the Fed was prepared to take “substantive” action on rates.However many traders still believe the prospect of substantial easing is too little, too late: “The Fed is way behind the curve,” Todd Salamone, vice president of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said.Equity markets usually welcome interest rate cuts, but some analysts fear an emergency 75bp cut would indicate the Fed believes the US economy is severely threatened. “I don’t think they will go with an inter-meeting move, as that would signal panic,” Mr Gendreau said.An unexpected decline in producer prices last month may give the Fed more room more manoeuvre. Producer prices fell 0.1 per cent in December. However, for the year, headline producer prices rose 6.3 per cent, the largest increase since 1981.
660;STT;State Street Corp;2008-01-04T17:30:18Z;Subprime woes lead to State Street exit;;The subprime mortgage crisis claimed its first victim of the year on Thursday as State Street, a leading US financial services group, announced the departure of William Hunt, its asset management chief, and a $279m charge to cover potential legal costs.Mr Hunt had been chief executive of State Street Global Advisors, the company’s asset management arm, which was behind its subprime bets. He will leave with $14.1m in severance pay and benefits, and $5m in vested stock options and retirement benefits, the company said. He will not receive a bonus for 2007.State Street, a Boston company that also provides custody and other services to mainly institutional clients, said it would set aside $618m to cover legal and other costs arising from fixed-income investments, resulting in an after-tax charge of $279m in the fourth quarter.Analysts predict other companies with subprime exposure are likely to follow State Street’s example in setting up reserves for legal costs. By mid-December, there had been 38 US subprime class-action suits, NERA Economic Consulting says.State Street said its reserve was set up to deal with “legal exposure and other costs associated with the underperformance of certain active fixed-income strategies”. It said it was responding to “customer concerns as to whether the execution of these strategies was consistent with the customers’ investment intent”.“Some of our customers that were invested in the active fixed-income strategies have raised concerns that we intend to address,” said Ronald Logue, chairman and chief executive of State Street.Mr Hunt left only weeks after the company said four of its off-balance-sheet vehicles held $29.2bn of asset-backed commercial paper, short-term securities that are often backed by revenues from subprime mortgages and consumer loans.
661;STT;State Street Corp;2008-01-03T22:43:30Z;US retail and tech stocks disappoint;;Wall Street stocks had a sluggish day as news of an increase in private sector employment and new factory orders was offset by weakness in technology and retailers.Traders welcomed strong results from Monsanto, the agribusiness, but poor December sales at Ford and General Motors weighed on the car sector.Equities paused after a sharp sell-off the previous day, prompted by soaring commodity prices and a contraction in the manufacturing sector.However consumer discretionary stocks fell sharply, dragging the economically sensitive sector more than 20 per cent below its previous market peak, the definition of a “bear market”.The S&P 500 rose as much as 0.7 per cent before closing flat at 1,447.16 with a majority of stocks ending the session lower. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,602.68 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 13,056.72.The onset of a bear market in the consumer discretionary sector was a worrying signal for investors sensitive to indications of a US economic slowdown. The sector has lost 21.2 per cent of its value since its peak last June.Although a slump in the homebuilders has contributed to the sector’s decline, the inclusion of an array of other well-known US consumer companies on a list of significant fallers suggests a broader malaise.“It’s the retailers, the hoteliers, the casual dining sector – the whole consumer sector is getting smashed right now,” said Jay Wong, portfolio manager at Payden & Rygel.Office Depot has fallen 65 per cent during the period, discount retailer Big Lots has lost 53 per cent, JC Penney, the department store operator, has shed 51 per cent while Marriot International, the hotel chain, is down 29 per cent.Stocks rose in early trade on Thursday after the Commerce Department said new factory orders increased 1.5 per cent in November, much greater than the expected rise of 0.4 per cent.But traders remained cautious as the data came only a day after a sharp contraction in the December ISM manufacturing index.Investors reacted favourably to news that the private sector added 40,000 jobs in December. Although modest, the figure prompted stock futures to rally as some traders had feared the number would be negative.Weekly jobless claims fell 21,000 to 336,000, below an expected level of 345,000.US markets remain acutely sensitive to employment news, with many analysts pointing to jobs as the key indicator of whether the US economy will fall into recession. The Labor Department is on Friday due to release keenly awaited data on US non-farm payrolls.State Street on Thursday became the latest financial company to reveal exposure to the troubled US mortgage market. The money manager said it would take a $279m charge for the fourth quarter, but the stock closed 8.2 per cent higher at $85.37 after its 2007 operating profit outlook, which excludes the charge and other costs, beat Wall Street estimatesIn the biotechnology sector, Monsanto beat Wall Street estimates after reporting fiscal first quarter net income of $256m, almost treble last year’s figure. The group raised its 2008 earnings guidance and the shares rose 8.5 per cent to $120.92.Celgene gained 7.7 per cent to $49.85 as it passed a regulatory hurdle to the completion of its acquisition of Pharmion.Sciele Pharma rose 11.4 per cent to $22.10 after it received regulatory approval for four dosage strengths of a drug to treat high blood pressure. Onyx Pharmaceuticals, the top performing US stock in 2007, rose 4 per cent to $57.98. The stock made a return of 425 per cent for investors last year.The drug retailing sector lagged, after last month’s pharmacy same-store sales disappointed analysts. CVS Caremark fell 6.6 per cent to $36.77 and Rite Aid fell 15.2 per cent to $2.28.Carmakers were in focus as Toyota overtook Ford to claim the number two position in the US market. Ford’s sales of cars and light trucks declined 9.2 per cent in December, while sales at General Motors sales slid 4.4 per cent. The shares fell 2.3 per cent to $6.45 and 2 per cent to $23.92 respectively.Gold miners were among the best performers as the precious metal held near record highs. Barrick Gold rose 5.9 per cent to $48.71.
662;STT;State Street Corp;2007-12-26T19:25:47Z;From Wall Street: Boom year or bum year?;;For the past few months, New York’s luxury retailers have been bracing themselves for a more difficult Christmas as the subprime mortgage meltdown threatened to eat into Wall Street bonuses. The media has been full of reports of billion-dollar writedowns and how bonuses are bound to suffer.It’s not just Maserati dealers on Park Avenue who have been concerned about their prospects. Investment bankers’ wives have been expecting to tighten their belts this year, according to jewellers in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is Wall Street’s southern outpost thanks to the presence of Bank of America and Wachovia.Yet it hasn’t quite worked out that way. Wall Street bank shareholders may have suffered badly. But employees are generally doing very nicely – and not just at Goldman Sachs. Average bonuses at the top Wall Street banks look set to match 2006 levels, as management seeks to retain top talent despite the huge subprime write-offs. Sales at Tiffany’s Fifth Avenue store are said to be well ahead of last year.Although the average may be up there will be even wider disparity between the winners and losers than usual. “We will have some really big ones and some zero bonuses,” said one senior Wall Street executive.Some of the biggest ones should probably go to the small sales team at Deutsche Bank which managed to sell off billions of dollars of subprime-related structured investments in the early summer, saving the bank a fortune. Some of the smallest bonuses should go to the guys, including some in rival banks, who bought them. But then they probably don’t have jobs any more. David WightonHigher learningYou would think that after reaching the C-suite at a major Wall Street firm you would be done taking tests. But you would be wrong.Erin Callan, who has been a top corporate lawyer and a senior investment banker at Lehman Brothers, discovered this recently after being tapped to be Lehman’s chief financial officer, a position that makes her one of the highest ranking women on Wall Street.Callan was forced to crack the books once again over the holiday season to study up for the Series 27 test, an exam of 145 questions administered by Finra, the securities industry’s self-regulatory group.The painful exam takes about three-and-a-half-hours to complete and is filled with questions about SEC and Finra rules and how to reconcile various items on a balance sheet. A score of at least 70 per cent correct is needed to pass.Had she failed, Lehman Brothers might have found itself in the rather odd position of going into the New Year with no one officially in charge of its books. Thankfully Callan, widely regarded as one of the sharpest young minds in the business, aced the exam on her first try. Ben WhiteShots departedAn innocent pleasure that has kept countless Wall Street folk amused this year comes to an end next week. From January 1, you will no longer be able to find out where Jimmy Cayne played his latest round of golf just by surfing the web.The US Golf Association’s Golf Handicap Information Network, which is used by 2m golfers to record their scores and calculate their handicaps, provided fascinating insight into the lives of Wall Street titans during this summer’s credit meltdown. Most memorably, it revealed that Cayne, the chairman and chief executive of Bear Stearns, took time out to play several rounds at the very time that two of the bank’s hedge funds were imploding.Sadly, those killjoys at the USGA have decided to make the system less transparent. From Tuesday, ordinary visitors to the ghin.com site will not be able to see when and where a golfer played his recent rounds.For the record, it appears that Cayne has played only once since August. But some believe he will soon have more time free to practise his putting. David WightonAgainst the grainBruce Wasserstein’s Lazard is not afraid to play the contrarian role. Lazard’s asset management division, which has edged out of the bantamweight class with more than $140bn in assets, ended its year by raiding venerable Boston firm State Street’s quantitative division.Undeterred by the poor showing by quants this year, Lazard last week poached a team of five quant managers from State Street, and a sixth from Boston Private Value Investors.The gang will start at Lazard’s new Boston office early in the New Year, Lazard told its troops in an internal memo. The group sold $600m in debt this year to help fund its expansion. Deborah Brewsterobserver@ft.com
663;STT;State Street Corp;2007-11-20T05:23:10Z;Navigating the whirlpool to appease shareholders;;"Caught between the Scylla of administration and Charybdis of a cut-price takeover, Northern Rock’s shareholders are showing signs that they still want a say in navigating the bank through its crisis.In any normal circumstances, the bank’s shareholders would have a great deal of influence in deciding its future. After all, they own the company and have to approve any bid chosen by the board.But nothing about the current Northern Rock situation is normal and in reality the shareholders have very little power.Investors face a stark choice between accepting a bid which gives them something for their shares, or receiving nothing if the bank is put into administration or run until its loans have been repaid.A number of the bidders have privately indicated that Northern Rock’s equity has “very little” value, meaning that investors are likely to be wiped out and left with little or nothing.The bank, which expects between eight and 10 bid proposals, said on Monday that the offers it had received were “materially below” the current market price, sending shares falling by 21.4 per cent to 104.2p.One proposal by Virgin Group would see it taking a majority stake in return for injecting £1bn into the bank and adding its personal finance business, Virgin Money, into Northern Rock. This would result in shareholders’ stakes being diluted, although they would benefit from any subsequent rise in the share price as Northern Rock recovered.Shareholders are likely to receive very little from any bid process, even though their support will be necessary to push through any proposal.As an indication of how little small shareholders matter, none of the bidders apart from Luqman Arnold, chairman of Olivant, have yet gone round shareholders to discuss their bids.The Treasury made it clear on Monday that its priorities are to protect taxpayers’ money, ensure financial stability and see that depositors are protected. Nowhere did the Treasury mention it had any responsibility to protect shareholders.But there are signs that some of Northern Rock’s shareholders are growing restless and active.SRM Global, the hedge fund run by former UBS trader Jon Wood, and fellow hedge fund RAB Capital, which together account for about 13 per cent of Northern Rock, have called for the auction process to be halted to prevent the bank being sold on the cheap.Indeed, key shareholders are planning to propose to Bryan Sanderson, the chairman, that Northern Rock should halt its sale process and install a new management team headed by Mr Arnold, a former Abbey National chief executive.It is understood that SRM Global and other institutional shareholders will put forward their proposals to Mr Sanderson this week.Olivant wants to put in its own management team and take control of the company. Mr Arnold’s backers intend to buy a stake at a price similar to where the shares now stand.Jon Wood of SRM has said: “Now is not the time to sell the bank but to work instead with the government on a restructuring from within and pay it back over a period of time.”Some large shareholders, including RAB and SRM, are thought to have held informal discussions about the best way to preserve the value of their stakes amid expectations that several of the bids would virtually wipe out the equity.Retail shareholders also hold about 25 per cent of Northern Rock.Roger Lawson of the UK Shareholder Association, which represents retail investors, has made it clear it would be “totally unacceptable” if the government enabled third parties to make enormous gains at the expense of current shareholders.The association intends to hold meetings of small investors in Newcastle and London next week.Most bidders have indicated they want Bank of England support to continue after any takeover. The bank owes £20bn to the UK government, which has had to guarantee retail depositors. If Northern Rock had not received that assurance, it would now be insolvent.The fact that Northern Rock’s share price dropped just 21 per cent on bidders’ low offers shows that some investors have factored in these risks. It is possible they are expecting the government or bidders may have to offer them something to vote through any solution.Either way, appeasing vocal shareholders is likely to remain just one aspect of the dangerous whirlpool into which the bank has been sucked.Large holdings in Rock●RAB Capital

664;STT;State Street Corp;2007-11-09T23:53:50Z;Gloom envelops world markets;;Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic concluded their worst week in months on Friday as deepening economic gloom raised expectations that the US Federal Reserve would be forced to cut rates again in the face of mounting credit losses.The S&P 500 was down 3 per cent for the week. In London, the FTSE 100 fell 3.7 per cent on the week, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was down 3.1 per cent, their worst performances since the credit squeeze took hold at the end of July.The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 experienced its worst week since April 2002, losing 6.8 per cent as market turmoil hit a sector that has been a haven from the credit crisis.Bond markets priced in the near certainty of a quarter-point interest rate cut when the Fed meets in December, and a 75 per cent chance of a second such cut at its January meeting. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell to 3.41 per cent, its lowest level since February 2005.“Treasuries are strictly in flight-to-quality mode, and investors are waiting for the next shoe to drop,” said Kevin Flanagan, fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley. “This is round two and there will probably be a round three.”Rate cut expectations helped push the dollar index to a record low of 74.978. The dollar set a fresh low of $1.4752 versus the euro and fell to Y110.52 against the yen.The turmoil was fuelled by mounting credit turmoil. Fire sales of mortgage assets from complex debt vehicles began in earnest after the trustee of a $1.5bn complex debt deal managed by State Street Global Advisors started liquidating its portfolio.Ratings downgrades for mortgage securities have pushed a clutch of such deals into default. Trustees have issued default notices for more than 14 collateralised debt obligation deals in recent weeks, representing securities with a face value of more than $10bn.A default means the most senior investors in the CDO can liquidate the underlying assets to get their money back. Analysts say more deals are on the brink of default.Wachovia, fourth-largest US bank, estimated that the value of its sub-prime mortgage securities fell $1.1bn in October and said it was increasing loan loss provisions because of “dramatic declines” in house prices in some parts of the US.Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase also warned in a regulatory filings that they could face further writedowns in the fourth quarter.Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage company, said its third-quarter loss doubled to $1.52bn. Capital One, the leading credit card issuer, said more customers had difficulty paying their bills in October than in the third quarter.
665;STT;State Street Corp;2007-10-12T15:27:35Z;The long and the short of it;;"Big investors are expected in five years’ time to be holding $1,000bn in so-called 130/30 funds, a type of modified long/short fund that is emerging as one of the most successful new investment products.The product is being sold by investment banks, asset management groups and hedge funds, putting it at the centre of the convergence between traditional asset management and hedge funds. It also reflects the increasing use of shorting as an investment tool.The strategy now manages more than $80bn, with the amount having almost doubled in the past six months, according to research compiled by Merrill Lynch.In the US about 80 fund managers in the past two years have either launched a 130/30 fund, or indicated that they plan to.Bob Jones, the head of quantitative strategies at Goldman Sachs, says: “Everybody’s doing it, and if you’re not doing it, you’re an exception”.Goldman launched several such funds last year and now has $4bn under management. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s largest institutional manager, has reached $10bn under management in the strategy.Fidelity has launched a 130/30 fund for institutional clients, using a fundamental rather than quantitative strategy, with managers making their own stock selection.The funds, which are mostly quantitatively managed, are being tested by the credit meltdown that has badly affected many quantitative strategies. Most were launched in the past year and have short track records.Quantitative strategies suit 130/30 funds because the “quant” method is often to list stocks from most desirable to least desirable. The fund can take the least desirable ones and short them.Morningstar tracks 74 130/30 funds and reports that during August, very few outperformed traditional long-only funds. However, they typically did not lose as much as quantitative hedge funds, because of the limited leverage of 130/30 funds.Charlie Shaffer, the head of 130/30 funds at Merrill Lynch, says that so far, over the longer term most had beaten their long-only equity equivalents.The strategy, sometimes called “hedge fund lite”, typically invests 30 per cent in short positions, and has 30 per cent leveraged, making it attractive to pension funds or endowments keen to lift returns but wary of unfettered hedge funds. The fees are pitched between long-only equity and hedge fund fees.Several mutual funds using the strategy have also been launched, though the majority of money in the strategy is from institutional investors.Trying to improve on the clunky name, some firms have tried marketing them as an “edge strategy”, “flex strategy” or “short extension” funds.The product gives hedge fund managers a chance to bid for traditional pension fund business without scaring them off.Morgan Stanley recently issued a report on how long/short hedge funds could become 130/30 funds – and thus be reclassified as a “traditional” rather than an “alternative” asset class.Pension funds classify 130/30 strategies as part of their mainstream equity portfolios for asset allocation purposes. That means there is potentially a bigger pot of money to go into the strategies.Shaffer says: “We were
out there early to say this product could hit a trillion [dollars].”He adds that Merrill expected “significant convergence between long-only equity and unconstrained investing styles”, and that once clients had become comfortable with the 130/30 product, they were asking for higher levels of shorting and leveraging, such as 170/70.Steve Deutsch at Morningstar says 130/30 funds are fairly conservative investments. “They will end up with returns not as high-flying as the general market, but they won’t reach the lows either,” because of their shorting component, he says.Most funds offer 30 per cent shorting and 30 per cent leveraging because those are the optimal levels that have shown to increase returns without significantly increasing the risk.However, as Shaffer says, once investors become comfortable with the idea, it seems likely they might want to opt for higher levels of leveraging.This would increase the risk of the investment, which might seem to defeat the purpose, but if the investor was happy with the manager’s overall performance then a slightly higher risk/return level might be acceptable.As more traditional mutual fund managers launch these products, there are also likely to be more fundamentally managed funds available.There has been little research on whether fundamental or quantitative styles are better suited to 130/30 funds.That is a question investors would need to answer, and might also depend on how quantitative managers respond to the downturn in their style."
666;STT;State Street Corp;2007-10-11T17:37:12Z;View of the day: Emerging markets;;"Emerging market equities will continue to advance this year, boosted by secular and cyclical factors, says George Hoguet, portfolio manager and strategist at State Street Global Advisors.“China and India are the locomotives of emerging Asia,” he says. “Recent research by Deutsche Bank suggests that, for every 1 per cent decline in US growth, China’s
output would slow just 0.4 per cent.“The rise of domestic demand in China, which last year added the equivalent of the entire installed electricity generation capacity of the UK, implies that the country’s growth will not fall sharply should the US fall into recession. The same is true for India.“The Baltic Dry Index suggests world trade volumes will remain robust. Merger and acquisition activity will continue.“Secular drivers are more important. These include improving national and corporate balance sheets; rising productivity; the appreciation of Asian currencies; the technology, media and telecoms
revolution; improved return on equity; and increasing flows from strategic investors.“Over the past five years, the 12-month forward p/e discount of emerging markets to developed markets has fallen from 45 per cent to 7 per cent. It would not be surprising to see emerging market equities trade at a parity with developed market equities within the next year.”"
667;STT;State Street Corp;2007-09-20T03:59:00Z;Narrow victory leaves all to play for;;"Scotland is having an extraordinary year in political terms. As well as marking the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Union with England, Scots have for the first time voted in a devolved government that is committed to holding a referendum on independence.Yet the narrow margin of the Scottish National party’s victory in May – just one seat ahead of Labour – means the minority Nationalist government in Edinburgh will struggle even to hold such a referendum by its target date of 2010, far less win it.The SNP’s victory ended Labour’s 50-year dominance of Scottish politics. Labour is now in outright control of only two of Scotland’s 32 unitary local councils. However, opinion polls show only about a third of the electorate support outright independence.One reason Alex Salmond, the SNP’s charismatic leader, became first minister was that his upbeat assessment of Scotland’s prospects played better with the electorate than Labour’s defensive campaign, which focused on the perils of breaking the union with the rest of the UK.Craig Anderson, head of KPMG, the accounting group, in Scotland, says: “Alex Salmond has made a very impressive start; far more impressive than many people, including me, would have thought… If it makes people feel good about being Scottish, then [having an SNP government] is definitely a positive. However, there is also a concern about full independence. Being part of the union has served Scotland very well over the years.”Before the devolved parliament was established in 1999, some business leaders had expressed concern that it would cause Scotland to turn in on itself, at a time when the forces of globalisation were gathering strength. These fears were partly justified: the early years of devolution were dominated by rows over the outrageous cost of the new parliament building at Holyrood – £430m – and undignified squabbles over MSPs’ expenses.However, Labour – and its Liberal Democrat coalition partners – eventually succeeded in steadying the devolved institution. Holyrood has become accepted as the main political forum for the nation, and there is considerable support among voters for giving the parliament more powers.Mr Salmond, who once worked as an economist with the Royal Bank of Scotland, believes an independent Scotland can use its wealth from North Sea oil to join the “arc of prosperity” that surrounds it – small, prosperous countries such as Ireland, Norway, Finland and Iceland.Many question Scotland’s ability to follow the example of these countries, given the differences in its history, demography and economic structure. But the SNP’s confident and internationalist outlook seemed more in keeping with the country’s recent economic experience than Labour’s doomladen warnings during the election campaign.The Scottish economy was hit hard by the bursting of the technology bubble at the start of the decade, and thousands of electronic manufacturing and assembly jobs were shed – often by overseas companies that had been lured by government grants to provide employment in areas long blighted by the decline of traditional industries, such as coalmining, steelmaking and shipbuilding.Since then, the Scottish economy has witnessed a long period of steady growth and now enjoys record levels of employment. But the industries that have provided this growth – such as financial services, oil and gas, manufacturing, biotechnology and whisky – are all extremely open to international market pressures.There is considerable pride in financial circles in the extraordinary track record of Royal Bank of Scotland, which has become the world’s fifth biggest bank, mainly through acquisition. RBS is leading the consortium bidding €71bn for the Dutch bank ABN Amro, in what would be the biggest bank takeover in history.However, there were also regrets last year when Scottish Power agreed to an £11.6bn takeover by Iberdrola, the Spanish energy group, in a deal that marked the exit of the last Glasgow-registered company from the FTSE 100.Scots are painfully aware that they can hardly admire the swashbuckling acquisitiveness of Sir Fred Goodwin, RBS’s chief executive, while also deploring the acquisition of Scottish Power, which had itself been a predator in the global market, albeit an unsuccessful one.However, the potential vulnerability of even the largest Scottish companies to takeover is an underlying source of concern – particularly in the business services sector, which stresses the importance of the “headquarters effect” to maintaining a critical mass of lawyers, accountants and corporate advisers.One of most intriguing aspects of the SNP’s programme is its decision to convene an 11-strong council of economic advisers, including two Nobel prizewinners, under the chairmanship of Sir George Mathewson, former chairman of RBS.Mr Salmond has called it the most “formidable, intellectual firepower ever to have tackled Scottish economic underperformance” and says it will be charged with coming up with the thinking that will allow the new administration to see Scotland’s growth levels match that of the UK as a whole inside four years.“Its formation sends out the clearest message both domestically and internationally that Scotland is serious about tackling economic underperformance,” says Mr Salmond.Jim Mather, the SNP’s enterprise minister, has suggested that the new government might choose to build on the council of advisers to create a national economic council, bringing together a wide range of those with an interest in boosting economic growth.Such attempts to build consensus on economic policy are understandable, particularly given the SNP’s lack of an overall majority. But there is also a danger that the precarious parliamentary arithmetic at Holyrood will prevent the new government from taking tough decisions.John Campbell, chairman of Scottish Financial Enterprise, trade body for the thriving financial services sector, said before the election that he was concerned that lack of clear leadership from the parliament could lead to dangerous uncertainty and even a period of stagnation.One reason the financial sector in Scotland has done so well in recent years is that it has emerged as a prime target for inward investment – not just from companies moving out of London, but from overseas groups looking for a UK base with a skilled workforce.One of the most successful areas is the relatively new industry of asset servicing. US banks such as State Street and Citigroup have chosen Scotland as a base from which they offer fund managers in Scotland, the UK and the rest of Europe a variety of services – including investment accounting, performance measurement and treasury functions.A recent Ernst & Young Scottish Item Club forecast warns that policy issues – such as the strained transport service – need to be resolved if Scotland is to build on its strengths in financial services and continue to catch up in business services.Among the factors cited as having a vital role to play in Scotland’s economic future are improved links to the main city airports; fast, reliable travel between Edinburgh and Glasgow; and easing the congestion faced by commuters in the central belt, including the Forth road crossing; along with affordable office accommodation.“With solutions to congestion issues in London and the south-east of England unlikely to materialise rapidly, Scotland, in particular the central belt, has the opportunity to position itself as the prime alternative location in the UK,” says Dougie Adams, economic adviser to the E&Y forecast.“The established success in Scotland’s banking sector is a clear demonstration that there is private sector life outside of London. It is vital that government actively recognise the importance of the financial and business services to our economy and identify ways in which the sector can be developed.”"
668;STT;State Street Corp;2007-08-29T20:28:13Z;Wall St rallies led by tech stocks;;Wall Street stocks rebounded strongly on Wednesday after sharp falls in the leading indices on Tuesday.Markets were lifted by the release of a letter from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to Charles Schumer, chairman of Congress’s Joint Economic Committee, saying the Fed is closely watching financial markets and is ”prepared to act as needed” should the economy be threatened.Shares were also bolstered by a resurgent technology sector, Altria’s long-awaited spin-off of Philip Morris International and some better-than-expected earnings results.Rebecca Engmann Darst, equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers, said US shares had in effect “recovered from a sullen, late-session tantrum” on Tuesday, sparked by the release of somewhat dour minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting.She said it showed how at times the markets had strayed from examining fundamentals. “Investors seem more preoccupied with watching a circus freak show than the main attraction of the economy.”The S&P 500 closed up 2.2 per cent at 1,463.76 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.5 per cent to 2,563.16.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.9 per cent higher at 13,289.29 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 2.5 per cent at 787.32.The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was up six basis points at 4.57 per cent.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index fell by 10.2 per cent to 23.63 after two days of sharp rises.The Nasdaq was boosted by healthy rises in several technology shares. Seagate Technology shares rose 3.8 per cent to $25.39 after the leading maker of computer hard-disk drives raised its first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late on Tuesday and several analysts lifted their price targets for the company’s stock.Apple was another strong performer, climbing 5.7 per cent to $134.08 after the company issued invitations to an event next week at which it is widely expected to unveil a new version of the iPod digital music and video player.Google rose 1.3 per cent to $512.88 after the internet search engine said George Reyes, its chief financial officer, would leave by the end of the year.Mr Reyes sparked a sharp drop in Google shares in February 2006 when he made off-the-cuff comments about the company’s need to “find other ways to monetise our business”.Oracle was another technology company in investors’ sights after SAP, the German software maker that it is suing for alleged theft of program codes, offered to settle. Its shares closed 4 per cent higher at $20.13.In other sectors, Altria Group rose 1.1 per cent to $69.80 after its expected announcement that it would spin off Philip Morris International, its tobacco unit. Altria also raised its quarterly dividend by 8.7 per cent to 75 cents a share.In earnings news, Big Lots had its biggest rise since March, gaining 9.9 per cent to $28.91 after the biggest US seller of discontinued goods reported second-quarter earnings above expectations.Borders Group shares rose 1 per cent to $14.94 after it reported a second-quarter net loss of $25.1m compared with a net loss of $18.4m last year. The slimmer-than-expected losses prompted Standard & Poor’s to upgrade the shares from “sell” to “hold”.“While industry conditions remain as challenging as ever, and we expect Borders Group’s turnround to take longer than management projects, the recent 35 per cent slide in share price mitigates further downside risk,” said Michael Souers, the ratings agency’s specialty retail analyst.In a sign that the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis continues to cloud investor sentiment, State Street shares fell 0.3 per cent to $61 on concerns about how credit-market turmoil has hit its managed funds.Mortgage applications fell by 4 per cent in the week to August 24, according to a report released on Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association.Dillard’s shares fell 0.6 per cent to $24.20 after it posted a hefty second-quarter net loss.Amgen was in the spotlight after a US federal court ruled that Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, had been infringing one of the biotechnology company’s patents. Its stock rose 2.4 per cent to $50.19 by the close of trading.Boeing shares were up 1.3 per cent to $96.90 after it said it had secured a $515m Nasa contract to produce the upper stage of the Ares I crew launch vehicle.Shares in PDL BioPharma plunged 20.3 per cent to $18.80 after the developer of technology for cancer medicines announced a restructuring and was downgraded by JPMorgan Chase.
669;STT;State Street Corp;2007-08-29T00:25:21Z;State Street hit by ABCP conduits exposure;;"State Street shares fell 4.3 per cent after it emerged the US financial services group has almost $29bn worth of exposure to so-called asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits among investment products at the centre of recent market turmoil.A quarterly regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission puts State Street’s holdings in the conduits at $28.81bn as of June 30 this year, up from $25.25bn at the end of last year.State Street issued a statement about the conduit programme, which has been part of the company’s business since 1992: “The credit quality of the assets is very good – primarily AAA/AA assets. The commercial paper continues to be sold daily. We continue to actively monitor market developments,” it said.Asset-backed conduits are large programmes used by banks to fund lending to
clients at cheaper rates than they would provide themselves, or to exploit the arbitrage potential between long-term investment rates and short-term funding rates.The conduits are designed to spread risk among lenders financing mortgages and other investments. Packages of loans are financed by short-term debt raised in the commercial paper market, and companies such as State Street commit back-up financing for the deals."
670;STT;State Street Corp;2007-07-24T17:21:31Z;Global Overview: Equities retreat amid nervousness;;The equity rollercoaster ride continued on Tuesday as investors took fright at disappointing corporate earnings, downbeat comments on US housing and fresh weakness in credit markets.Evidence of the growing sense of nervousness among investors was provided by the latest confidence survey from State Street Global Markets.Global investor confidence fell to a six-month low this month, led by North American institutional investors.“The great and the good at the big investment banks have offered soothing words that problems in the US subprime mortgage sector are contained and will not spill over into broader markets,” said Andrew Capon, at State Street. “Institutional investors do not seem to be convinced.”Mr Capon noted that equity prices had yet to suffer but added: “The dip in confidence suggests that investors are growing anxious about future headwinds.“Wider credit spreads have typically been the harbinger of stock market woes.”In the credit markets, the cost of insuring European junk debt – as measured by the iTraxx Crossover index – hit a fresh two-year high on Tuesday.Alan Ruskin, chief strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said the focus in credit markets was now not only on price but collapsing new issuance. But he added that the situation was not yet as grim as some had feared.“The collapse in collateralised debt obligations should represent a material credit slowdown but not something that would fit the term credit crunch,” Mr Ruskin said. “This, at best, could partly explain the continued sanguine attitude displayed by global equities and US equities in particular.”As recently as last Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were trading at record highs. In equity markets on Tuesday, the Dow was down 0.8 per cent by mid-afternoon in New York while the S&P was 0.9 per cent lower and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 0.7 per cent.That were earnings disappointments from big-name companies such as DuPont while the perilous state of the US housing market was underlined by poor figures from Countrywide, the mortgage lender, and building materials group USG Group.European stocks suffered even bigger losses, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index dropping 1.5 per cent and the FTSE 100 in London shedding 1.9 per cent, its biggest one-day fall since MarchIt was a slightly brighter picture in Asia, however, as Hong Kong, Sydney and Mumbai all closed at fresh record highs. In Seoul, the benchmark Kospi index briefly pushed above the 2,000 points level before going into retreatIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average rose 0.2 per cent.On the currency markets, the dollar remained on the back foot, falling to a fresh record low against the euro and its worst level for two months against the yen.“The widening of US credit spreads continues to eat away at dollar support given US dependence on foreign capital and in particular corporate-related fixed income product,” said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank.“It is hard to conceive what could trigger a notable shift in the current negative dollar sentiment.”In spite of the yen’s firmer tone against the dollar, analysts said there few signs of any loss of appetite for the yen carry trade – where investors sell the low-yielding Japanese currency to fund purchases of higher-yielding assets.The weaker tone in the equity markets failed to trigger much in the way of safe-haven buying of government bonds. By midday in New York, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury was unchanged at 4.95 per cent while the 10-year Bund yield was also flat at 4.43 per cent.In commodities, Brent oil futures tumbled below $75 a barrel level after fresh assurances from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that it would boost supplies if needed. It closed at $75.08, down $1.78 on the day.Last week, Brent hit an 11-month high and was just a whisker away from the all-time high struck in August 2006.Gold hit an 11-week high above $687 an ounce as the metal continued to find support from the dollar’s persistent weakness.The view among analysts was that a test of the $700 level was now extremely likely.
671;STT;State Street Corp;2007-07-22T18:07:10Z;Why family businesses want to sell;;Number 60 State Street holds a nostalgic appeal for a certain type of Bostonian. The city’s party crowd fondly remembers when the Bay Tower Room, the building’s penthouse lounge, used to hum with cool jazz tunes as they basked in its glory as the hub for nightly revelling.But “The Room” has been closed for four years and today the red granite skyscraper will host an altogether more sombre affair. When the scattered and squabbling members of the Bancroft family convene in the ninth-floor offices of Hemenway & Barnes, the law firm, they will only have one point on the agenda: whether to sever their 105-year association with Dow Jones and sell the media group to a rather younger listed family business – Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation – for $5bn (£2.4bn, €3.6bn).As the diverse members of the clan, who include a horse breeder, a former airline pilot and a speedboat champion, agonise over the future of a company built by their forefathers, they may draw some solace from the fact that they are not alone.Over the past few months, corporate America has witnessed a flurry of takeovers of companies whose founding families had substantial stakes. This month Hilton – the hospitality giant started by Conrad Hilton in 1919 with a small Texas hotel – agreed a $26bn sale to Blackstone, the private equity group. Hilton followed a long line of companies that had broken with their past.In April Tribune, the owner of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, was sold for $8.2bn to Sam Zell, the property tycoon. It was the culmination of a process begun last year when the Chandler family began agitating for change.Meanwhile Clear Channel Communications, which the Mays family built from a small San Antonio radio station into the biggest power on the US airwaves, is in the throes of a $26.5bn buy-out by Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital.Even the Ford family, one of the pillars of America’s corporate aristocracy, invited an investment banker to its latest annual gathering to advise on whether it should continue to back the struggling carmaker that bears its name.In the past year alone, take­overs of listed family companies were worth more than $90bn. The total soars to nearly $150bn if deals such as ones for Cable­vision, the cable group, and HCA, the hospital operator, where the founding families participated in the buy-out, are included (see below). “At present, a number of family companies are under unique pressure [to do a deal],” says John Rose, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group. “Generational issues and the abundant liquidity in capital markets are creating an increase in the velocity of ownership changes at family businesses.”This trend raises the prospect of a shift in the ownership structure of a portion of US capitalism. If families increasingly withdraw from listed companies, is America in danger of losing the steady corporate stewardship and entrepreneurial drive that has been an important part of its economy since the days of the Rockefellers and Vanderbilts? Or is the change to be welcomed as it removes a class of share-holders intent on milking the companies founded by their ancestors?The answers lie in the dynastic and financial motives behind the deals involving family companies. “The primary reasons for families selling out have been that there is no heir to takeover the business and they are using the booming private equity markets to finance their exit from the companies,” says Raffi Amit, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.At Hilton, for example, Barron Hilton, Conrad’s son, remains co-chairman and is said to come the office almost every day. But he is 79 and the family scions, including his granddaughters Paris and Nicky, have shown neither appetite nor aptitude for running the family firm. Similarly, no Bancroft has held a top management position at Dow Jones since 1932.The capital and takeover markets are so attuned to these generational dynamics that last week’s news that Shari Redstone, board member and a potential heir at Viacom, might leave the company after clashing with her 84-year-old father Sumner, immediately stoked rumours of a sale of the television and films group.In other, less financially buoyant, times, the mere lack of an heir might not have prompted families to cash out. But the abundant liquidity of the past few years, coupled with a willingness by private equity groups and some large companies to expand into an ever wider array of businesses, has persuaded many descendants to sell their inheritance.The lure has been particularly powerful for companies operating in troubled industries, as family members became increasingly concerned that future streams of dividends might soon dry up.Not coincidentally, several recent deals involving family groups have been for companies in turbulent sectors such as media, manufacturing and chemicals. “These people are very smart. They saw the writing on the wall and they understood it was the right time to get out,” says Ronald Anderson, a professor of finance at Washington’s Kogod School of Business.To be sure, families are not about to disappear from corporate America. Contrary to the perception that family companies are mainly a feature of European and Asian markets, Prof Anderson estimates that founders and their descendants still control about half of the top 2,000 US industrial companies (excluding financial groups and utilities).But the recent spike in take­over activity does pose the question of whether the reduction in the ranks of large listed family businesses will harm investors and the US economy.In many respects, companies with substantial family shareholdings are an anachronism, especially in a capital market as developed as the US, where corporate ownership tends to be spread among a myriad of shareholders. Indeed, a study of Fortune 500 companies by Wharton’s Prof Amit and Belen Villalonga of Harvard Business School found that, once founders step down or die, the performance of family companies slips below that of other corporations.An obvious reason for the underperformance is that passing the managerial baton to a son or a daughter is a flawed succession strategy – as shown by the troubles that dogged companies such as Ford and Motorola, the handset maker, when they were headed by family members.According to Russell Reynolds, the father of the US headhunting industry, boards should never pay heed to famous surnames when picking the top management. He says: “It is ridiculous to put the son or a daughter of the founder in charge unless they have proven themselves over 10 or 20 years in the same or a similar business.”(Mr Reynolds adds that although RSR Partners, his executive search group, employs his son Trey as president, that is not a contradiction because the company is private and his son is not chief executive.)The poor performance of family companies’ share prices and profits once the founders leave can inflict some lasting damage on other shareholders – especially if members of the ruling dynasty decide to cut their losses and negotiate a takeover when results, or the share price, are weak. Some argue that it is precisely this mixture of lackadaisical management, poor corporate governance and urge to sell when things go wrong that makes family companies so attractive to private equity. “If family companies are undervalued, they are an easier target for private equity firms,” says Harvard’s Prof Villalonga. “The acquirer might think that there is more room for improvement.”Warren Buffett, the legendary investor, made a similar point in characteristically colourful fashion when he attacked the Bancrofts’ stewardship of Dow Jones in a recent television interview. “They blew it …as a business, having the audience, the franchise, everything they commanded, they owned the field,” he said. “And they let other people take it away from them …It could have been a company that was worth $50bn now instead of $5bn.”Stock market investors may not be the only victims. Several experts maintain that having companies controlled by passive, rent-seeking family members with little interest in day-to-day operations is a drag on the economy. “In this era of hedge funds, activist investors and fast-changing global markets, who needs a bunch of guys whose main goal is to sit tight, not rock the boat and collect the dividends? Their passivity ends up harming the economy,” says an institutional fund manager with stakes in family companies.But not every family has proved a dead weight. Academic studies and empirical evidence show that having large chunks of shares controlled by a group of siblings gives family companies one crucial advantage over other listed corporations: it makes it more difficult for management to feather its own nest at shareholders’ expense.Known as “the agency problem”, this conflict of interests typically arises because executive pay is not aligned with shareholder returns, so that top management stands to be handsomely rewarded even if its strategies fail to benefit investors. By contrast, family members whose wealth is tied up in one company have a powerful incentive to keep a close eye on management and a tight grip on shareholder funds.This beneficial effect is at its most evident in a company such as Wal-Mart. At the retail giant, the family of the late Sam Walton holds around 40 per cent of the shares but its power goes well beyond the stake. Its influence is so pervasive that Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, still “reinterprets” the founder’s sayings to justify company policy, even when Sam himself would probably have disagreed – such as with the current pro-environment campaign.Still, under the the watchful eye of the family, Wal-Mart – which still counts Rob Walton, the current patriarch, as chairman – has dwarfed the competition, becoming the world’s largest retailer thanks to bold acquisitions and innovative strategies. The company’s rise has translated into large rewards for both the family and outside investors in the stock, which has more than trebled in price since Sam’s death in 1992.Even in the troubled media sector, a family company such as the Washington Post, which is still run by the Graham publishing dynasty, has provided shareholders with better returns than the broader market over the past decade.Beyond these individual cases, the strongest reason for the enduring vitality of America’s family companies sector is perhaps its ability to regenerate itself through a constant supply of new businesses.“I don’t see the recent spate of family companies selling out as anything to worry about,” says John Davis, who heads the Families and Business programme at Harvard Business School. “We will see many more family companies rise and seek new capital in the future.”It is not just that some of the existing family firms may one day become the new Wal-Mart, but that some already large companies could one day become family businesses. Although some of the modern-day Rockefellers and Vanderbilts, such as Bill Gates and Mr Buffett, have made it clear they do not intend to start a dynasty, others might.As one technology industry expert says, “There are enterprises out there that are family companies waiting to happen. In 20 years’ time we might talk of Google or Oracle [Larry Ellison’s software group] as family companies.”In the meantime, a pivotal deal for News Corp, a company likely to be inherited one day by one of Rupert Murdoch’s children, hangs on a close vote by members of an older dynasty. As he awaits news from 60 State Street, Mr Murdoch senior must hope that the Bancrofts do not share his own convictions on the corporate merits of blood ties.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall and James PolitiBuy-outs create potential for family conflictsFamily-run companies have traditionally been regarded with suspicion by corporate governance experts because of the fear that overbearing family members might short-change minority shareholders.But the latest wave of takeovers has raised the spectre of a different, potentially more serious, conflict of interest.The main concern is that the financial incentives to strike a buy-out deal are so large for family members, and the companies’ management, that they decide to force it through at a price that is not so attractive to other investors. This is particularly important in deals where the founding family is one of the principal sponsors of the sale and remains a shareholder in the newly-privatised entity.One of the earliest transactions to attract scrutiny was the $13.5bn leveraged buy-out of Kinder Morgan, the US pipeline operator, in April 2006. Richard Kinder, the founder and holder of an 18 per cent stake in the business, led a consortium of investors including Goldman Sachs to make an offer for the company.Mr Kinder came under fire for not informing his board of his plans early enough and was accused of pushing the deal through without enough negotiation on price. In the event the board fought back, forcing the consortium to increase its offer. But the events raised investors’ awareness of the pitfalls of family-sponsored takeovers.The process employed in the sale of Clear Channel Communications, the US radio station owner, by the founding Mays family later last year also came under attack, because a deal with Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners was struck only weeks after the company was formally put up for sale. In the end, the Mays family was forced to make significant concessions on their pay-out and the buyers had to raise their bid.The potential conflict of interest between family shareholders and outside investors has been deemed serious enough to bring about a change in mergers and acqusition protocol. Over the past few months, M&A lawyers have built new devices into US deals allowing companies to seek alternative buyers for their companies for a number of days following the announced deal.These “go-shop” provisions can often run as long as 50 days. In addition, it has become more common for company founders to remain neutral, at least nominally, in takeover talks. In other words, management will often say that although they have struck a deal with one investor group, they are also open to backing a rival consortium if it is willing to offer more.By James Politi
672;STT;State Street Corp;2007-07-17T21:56:41Z;Wall St rallies amid solid earnings;;US blue chips crossed a fresh milestone on Tuesday as solid earnings, deals and buybacks helped Wall Street extend its bullish run.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.15 per cent at a record level of 13,971.55. The benchmark also set an intra-day record high of 14,021.95.The broader S&P 500 index pared early gains and closed relatively flat at 1,549.40.Among the major S&P sectors, industrials, materials and technology led gains. Consumer stocks, energy, healthcare and telecoms were lower.“Investors are seeing strong momentum on earnings, a growing economy and low inflation,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.He said that investors had likely turned cautious ahead of the June consumer inflation report, due on Wednesday.Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, testifies before Congress on the US economy and monetary policy on Wednesday and on Thursday.“There is no doubt Bernanke could create some volatility for stocks,” Mr Paulsen said.After the closing bell, Bear Stearns said that the sub prime mortgage related assets held by two of its hedge funds were virtually worthless. Bear’s stock price was around 2 per cent lower at $137.20 in after-hours trade. The bank recently extended a loan of $1.6bn to the less levered fund, whose assets are now worth 9 cents in the dollar.Leading the major benchmarks was the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite, up 0.55 per cent at 2,712.29.Semiconductor stocks advanced after Novellus provided stronger guidance for future orders.The chipmaker’s shares surged 11.3 per cent to $33.03, while the Philadelphia exchange semiconductor index rallied 3.1 per cent.After the closing bell, Intel posted better-than-forecast earnings, but its gross margins fell. Intel set a 52-week high of $26.52 on Tuesday, and fell in after-hours trade. Yahoo also reported after the closing bell and while results met estimates, the internet search company lowered guidance for the third quarter. Yahoo fell in after-hours trade after a rise of 3.1 per cent to $27.53 in regular trade.Ebay and IBM are scheduled to report on Wednesday and Google on Thursday.For the year to date, the Dow is up 12.1 per cent and remains shy of the Nasdaq’s climb of 12.3 per cent.The Dow’s failure to hold early gains above 14,000 was sparked in part when companies, that had reported better-than-expected earnings, attracted profit taking.Johnson & Johnson slid 1.7 per cent to $62.74 after its second-quarter profits rose 9.3 per cent, with international sales up 18 per cent.Coca-Cola recorded a 1 per cent rise in profits and a sales increase of 19 per cent. The stock fell 1.3 per cent to $53.17.Banks in the Dow rallied on Tuesday. Several financials reported solid earnings and allayed concerns the sector was being hurt by the troubles in subprime mortgage and structured credit markets.JPMorgan rose 0.2 per cent to $49.92 ahead of quarterly results on Wednesday, while Citigroup was 0.5 per cent higher at $52.46 and will report its earnings on Friday. Notable Dow members United Technologies, Altria and Pfizer are due to report earnings on Wednesday.In deal news, Plains Exploration said it had agreed to buy Pogo, a rival oil and gas company, for $3.6bn in cash and stock. Pogo surged 13.9 per cent to $57.50, while Plains was 6.5 per cent lower at $47.88.Buy-backs were in focus after Rohm & Hass, a speciality chemicals and plastics company, was upgraded by brokers after it announced a $2bn share repurchase plan. The stock soared 9.8 per cent to $61.18.Among banks reporting on Tuesday, Merrill Lynch revealed a 31 per cent increase in second-quarter earnings. But after an initial rise to $89.23, Merrill shares closed down 1.4 per cent at $86.20.Matthew Albrecht, brokerage industry analyst at Standard & Poor’s equity research, said growth in equity underwriting and the private client business mitigated Merrill’s slowdown in the mortgage business and some subprime exposure.Wells Fargo said earnings rose 13 per cent and its stock rose 0.4 per cent to $35.59.Charles Schwab recorded a 16 per cent rise in profit and its stock was unchanged at $22.25.State Street said its profit rose 61 per cent and also upwardly revised its revenue forecast for 2007. The stock gained 2.1 per cent to $71.87.KeyCorp rallied 4.6 per cent to $36.71 after the midwest bank reported an 8 per cent gain in profit.News Corp rose 2.6 per cent to $24.25 after it reached a tentative agreement to buy Dow Jones, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal.Approval of the $5bn deal faced a vote by the Dow Jones board later in the day. However, the Bancroft family, which controls 64 per cent of Dow Jones’s voting stock, will ultimately decide whether the deal is approved. Dow Jones slipped 0.9 per cent to $56.45, below News Corp’s $60-a-share offer.On Wednesday, the focus of investors will turn to Mr Bernanke, and his testimony on the economy and monetary policy. The Fed chairman speaks before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, and the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.Traders said he may seek to reassure the markets that problems in the subprime mortgage market are likely to remain contained. Before Mr Bernanke speaks, the June consumer price report is released on Wednesday.“A further decline in core inflation could allow Bernanke to focus more on the housing market as a risk for the economy,” said Richard Gilhooly, senior fixed income strategist at BNP Paribas.Economists at Lehman Brothers said June consumer prices “should decelerate sharply on softer energy prices, but it is unlikely to ease concerns about underlying inflation pressures.”Lehman expects the headline Consumer Price Index will rise 0.17 per cent in June, or 2.6 per cent year-on-year, while the core CPI should rise 0.22 per cent, “for the largest monthly gain since February.”
673;STT;State Street Corp;2007-07-17T21:36:33Z;Record revenue for State Street;;State Street on Tuesday reported record revenue in the second quarter as the world’s largest institutional money manager sold more of its products to clients both in the US and overseas.The Boston-based company said net income was $366m, or $1.07 per diluted share, in the second quarter, up from $227m, or 68 cents, a year earlier.Revenue rose to $1.9bn from $1.7bn. State Street's total assets under management increased to $1,930bn, up 26 per cent.Analysts had predicted that State Street would generate net income of $339.6m, or $1.01 a share, according to Thomson Financial, the research company.In an interview with the Financial Times, Ron Logue, chief executive, said that State Street expected non-US revenue to represent 50 per cent of total revenue “within the next few years”. Last year, 43 per cent of revenue came from outside the US.“Our business in Europe and Asia is growing about twice as fast as it is in the US, but in the first six months of the year, the US business has picked up,” he said.“If you’re going to be a global company, you’ve got to have half your revenues from outside the US,” Mr Logue added.He expressed caution about the second half of the year, voicing concern over the “seasonal weakness” in certain market-driven revenues in the third quarter – namely, lower transaction volumes. “We’ve seen that seasonality year over year,” he said.Lori Appelbaum, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, called the period a “huge revenue quarter” for the company.“Revenues and operating leverage were much better than our high expectation driven principally by stronger net interest income,” she said in a research note. “State Street is simply benefiting from sizeable growth generated in global asset management activities.”Processing fees and other revenue dropped 12 per cent to $65m “primarily due to the consolidation of tax-exempt investments on to the balance sheet in the third quarter of 2006”, the company said.State Street raised its 2007 revenue growth forecast to between 20 per cent and 22 per cent from 16 per cent to 18 per cent.Excluding merger and integration costs, the company expects 2007 earnings growth of 10 per cent to 15 per cent.Management fees from State Street Global Advisors, the group’s core asset management business, rose 22 per cent from a year earlier, as the unit continued to become a more important contributor to the company’s overall earnings.State Street shares ended Tuesday’s session up 2.1 per cent at $71.87.
674;STT;State Street Corp;2007-06-24T21:37:58Z;Perils of when tradition strays;;Many traditional asset managers have launched hedge funds to take advantage of the investing talent they already have and to secure higher margins on their assets. Financially, the model has been successful for many. However, running hedge funds in parallel with traditional funds involves many challenges. The main ones are how to manage the different style of investing required, and how to structure the business so that it does not conflict with existing operations.Possibly the larger issue is that so-called traditional asset management strategies and hedge fund strategies are rapidly converging, especially in institutional management. For example, the same product, called a 130/30 strategy, is being offered to institutional investors by traditional asset managers, such as State Street, and by hedge funds, such as DE Shaw. The product uses a limited amount (30 per cent) of shorting and leveraging to lift returns, making it a hyped-up stockmarket strategy.This convergence means that for some big institutional managers, such as Barclays Global Investors, Goldman Sachs, Wellington and Bridgewater Associates, managing hedge fund money is not that different from the investing they already do. Already, the term “unconstrained investing” is being used to describe true hedge funds, in part to distinguish them from more general institutional strategies.The convergence is especially true of quantitative managers, a relatively new wave of sophisticated investors who base their decisions on complex computer models that often use derivatives and synthetics. Their underlying strategy aims to separate beta, or market, returns from alpha, or outperformance. This style of investing lends itself more easily to selling stocks short as well as long and to using a full range of financial instruments – both hallmarks of hedge fund investing.However, a shift in investing mindset can be difficult for more conventional managers modelled on a single manager selecting stocks based on their view of a company. Many long-only mutual fund managers say they would like to be able to short stocks and theoretically it seems an easy step. After all, the research is already done and the manager might often have views about which stocks are likely to do badly.In practice, though, the skills are quite different, and there is a lengthy list of mutual fund managers who have quit and then been burnt in their attempts to become successful long/short investors. And quantitative investing, another common hedge fund strategy that is increasingly used in the long-only fund world, requires a big investment in technology and infrastructure for it to work well.Bill Gross, the bond fund manager at Pimco, was one of the first to describe hedge funds as “a remuneration strategy, not an investment strategy”. He was being scathing, but in some ways, the fee structure rather than the investment approach is what defines a hedge fund.One of the main issues for traditional managers moving into hedge fund strategies and funds is how to manage remuneration-related conflicts for the firm. First, a company offering hedge funds is offering institutional investors two different fee structures, sometimes for strategies that do not appear that different. Conventional management of an equities portfolio will cost a big investor less than 50 basis points – half a per cent a year. This “conventional” management increasingly is making use of sophisticated strategies similar to those offered by hedge funds, but still demanding low fees.Hedge funds, however, typically charge 2 per cent a year and a 20 per cent performance fee. So the asset manager must clearly separate the hedge fund offerings, and justify the much higher fee, if they move into hedge funds.The other conflict for traditional managers is how to compensate hedge fund managers without alienating the rest of the workforce. Since hedge fund managers are usually paid more than traditional long-only managers, this can be difficult. Some top mutual fund managers, such as Legg Mason’s Bill Miller and T Rowe Price’s Brian Rogers, have consistently produced ret­urns in line with average hedge fund returns, but without the risk, and also with the daily liquidity that mutual funds offer. However, they are not paid in the way hedge fund managers are.Franklin Resources, which trades as Franklin Templeton, is one firm that has grappled with the question of how to manage these conflicts. It plans to increase its alternative assets (it has a hedge fund, private equity and real estate) and set them up as separately run, independent divisions to avoid the appearance of conflicts.The same conflict is felt by hedge funds offering more constrained institutional products. James Simons’ Renaissance Technologies launched an institutional fund last year and surprised the market by charging much less than his 40 per cent-plus performance fees.
675;STT;State Street Corp;2007-05-29T20:23:12Z;Carry trades recover after March jitters;;Carry trades are back to levels last seen before the bout of risk aversion that shook global markets in late February and early March, according to data from State Street Global Markets.Jitters on the world’s stock markets, spurred by a sharp fall in Chinese equities in late February, saw investors rush to exit carry trades, in which riskier, high-yielding assets are funded by selling low-yielding currencies such as the yen, Swiss franc and Taiwanese dollar.However, the State Street data shows that after a short-lived unwinding in March, investors are now aggressively selling the lowest yielding currencies in the basket of twenty that it tracks in favour of the higher-yielding currencies.State Street said that according to its foreign exchange flow indicator – a data series that goes back to 1994 – three-month cumulative flows from institutional investors into the low-yielding yen were at the seventh percentile, meaning it has been in greater demand on 93 per cent of occasions in the past 13 years. Meanwhile flows into the Swiss franc and Taiwanese dollar were now at the eighth and 26th percentiles respectively.In contrast, State Street said that favoured high-yielding currencies such as the Brazilian real and New Zealand dollar had three-month inflows in the 97th and 98th percentiles respectively, meaning inflows were higher on just 3 per cent and 2 per cent of occasions.In addition, State Street said carry was once again the dominant theme on the currency markets. “The correlation between flows and carry has now risen to 60 per cent, the level it was at just prior to the short-lived correction in equity markets that began on February 28.”Furthermore, State Street said that with volatility on options in major currencies at close to record lows of just over 6 per cent, complacency was writ large across markets. However, it said that beneath the surface, there were some signs that risk was not being disregarded completely.“Retail stocks are being sold globally and so is the financial sector,” State Street said.
676;STT;State Street Corp;2007-05-25T16:54:26Z;A US Spider with a $10bn web;;What’s the world’s most traded share or security? Not Google, nor oil giant BP nor even a bank such as Barclays, embroiled in the ABN Amro takeover tussle. It’s actually said to be State Street’s Spider, an exchange traded fund (ETF) in the US that tracks the performance of the US’s S&P 500 index, with a daily turnover of more than $10bn.UK investors could be forgiven for not having heard of the Spider (full name State Street S&P 500 ETF) – or even of ETFs. While these stock market-listed index trackers have seen a meteoric rise in the US, they have yet to gain a wide following over here, particularly among private investors.This is despite a range of attractions, especially low costs but also predictable performance and a diverse choice of investment possibilities from global stock markets to commodities and private equity companies.Total annual costs (referred to as total expense ratios) are as low as 0.2 per cent and typically range up to around 0.75 per cent. That makes them cheaper than most of the stock market tracker unit trusts they resemble and much lower charging than actively-managed investment funds, where total annual costs can reach 2 per cent.ETFs, like shares and other quoted securities, are bought through a stockbroker or online dealing service. But while investment industry lobbying continues for the abolition of the 0.5 per cent stamp duty on share purchases, ETFs already escape this levy.In the UK ETFs are growing from a base of a few dozen and offer an increasingly broad spread of investment exposures. One popular ETF, iShares FTSE UK Dividend Plus, tracks the performance of a basket of high-yielding shares. As well as that value play, others offer exposure to “of the moment” investments such as infrastructure, the water industry and private equity.As trackers of market indices, groups of shares or other assets, performance is also relatively predictable. Even in emerging markets iShares – part of Barclays, the UK’s biggest ETF issuer – says its tracking error (the degree to which returns diverge from the index) is only 0.7 per cent. ETFs can be held in Isas, Sipps and even Child Trust Funds.All this should make ETFs attractive to investors distrustful of the value provided by active investment managers, who aim to outperform markets but in many cases don’t – and charge high fees even when they underperform. Frank Henze, head of product development at iShares, says: “The product is so well suited to the retail investor. It translates industrial strength investment into the retail market.”Daniel Draper, head of Lyxor ETFs, UK and Ireland, a Sociétié Générale subsidiary that has just launched the UK’s first ETF for the FTSE All Share index, adds: “The vast majority of investment returns come from asset allocation. ETFs are a simple, cost-effective and transparent way of investing in a chosen market and have the potential to simplify the asset allocation process while lowering investors’ costs,”In practice, usage and even awareness among private investors has been held back by the fact that ETFs don’t pay commission to financial advisers. “The UK retail market is dominated by commission-based distribution,” says Henze.Until recently there was also a tax disadvantage for overseas’ issuers listing ETFs in the UK. This has now been removed, prompting Lyxor, Europe’s second- largest ETF firm, to launch over here. Up to another 100 ETFs are expected to launch by the end of the year, with that competition driving down costs even further.Online dealer Selftrade says a total of £120m of ETFs are held by thousands of its clients and iShares FTSE 100 ETF is regularly among its most popular buys and sells. Some investors use them to get exposure to the market when prices are moving quickly, while for others they appeal as part of a “core, satellite” portfolio strategy – providing market exposure which can be enhanced with bets on individual shares or other investments.Justin Modray of financial adviser Bestinvest sees attractions for investors actively playing the markets. Having a market quote means values change throughout the day and investors can deal at known prices. Along with low transaction costs, this makes ETFs more suitable for trading – including going short to profit from falling prices.Ben Yearsley of IFAs Hargreaves Lansdown says that investors who like market trackers should consider ETFs. However he adds that Hargreaves “isn’t a fan of passive investing”, believing that it can help investors identify active fund managers such as Invesco Perpetual’s Neil Woodford and Psigma’s Bill Mott capable of consistent outperformance.
677;STT;State Street Corp;2007-05-25T15:29:03Z;EU directive is altering the landscape;;"Once upon a time, mutual funds limited themselves to running plain vanilla long-only equity and bond portfolios, leaving the racy world of derivatives to their hedge fund rivals. But the European Union’s Ucits III directive threatens to shake up that cosy distinction for good.The directive, passed in 2005, gave mutual fund managers the power to use derivatives to generate higher returns, rather than simply to reduce risk. This ruling threatens to alter the mutual fund landscape not only in the EU, but everywhere else that the Ucits calling card is accepted, from Hong Kong to Chile.And while the impact of Ucits III has thus far been more evolutionary than revolutionary, dramatic change is now afoot.“This is a significant point in the history of the European mutual fund landscape that could potentially change significantly as structured product providers and long-only asset managers innovate to meet the requirements of their client base,” says Huw Price at Commerzbank.Initially a number of long-only equity managers made limited use of their new powers by employing index options to attempt to improve their risk/return trade-off, notably Anthony Bolton, star fund manager at Fidelity, who has reportedly used put options to protect his fund in a downturn.In recent months, investment houses such as Axa Rosenberg, State Street and Invesco have taken this a step further by rolling out 130/30-type funds. These “beta one” products combine short positions in individual stocks equivalent to 30 per cent of the fund’s assets – usually expressed via swaps or other derivatives – balanced by gross long positions of 130 per cent.This strategy emerged in Australia and the US and, aided by the more liberal Ucits III regime, is now expected to sweep Europe. Less than $5bn (€3.7bn, £2.5bn) of European pension fund money was believed to be invested in these vehicles at the start of 2007. By the end of this year, this is likely to have ballooned to $30bn-$40bn, according to Morgan Stanley.Investment houses are experimenting with leverage; 140/40 funds are reasonably common, with one continental house said to be looking at a 200/100 fund.But this is merely the first iteration of how Ucits III will free mutual fund managers to exploit the world of derivatives.The new regime also promises to give a boost to structured products, which, while popular in much of continental Europe, did not qualify for Ucits status prior to 2005, limiting their marketing reach.The more commonplace strategies include covered call funds, where yield is enhanced by selling out-of-the-money call options on the individual stocks, limiting potential upside returns; and protected products that sell upside index calls and use the money to buy downside puts, effectively putting a ceiling and floor on potential returns.However, in a more radical departure, a number of new, entirely derivatives-based products are starting to emerge.ABN Amro and Courtiers Investment Services, a Henley-based boutique fund manager, both launched pure-derivatives investment funds in the UK in March, while Crédit Agricole and Dresdner Kleinwort have led the trend in France and Germany respectively. ABN’s initial offering sums up the dramatic changes afoot, in that not only is itconstructed entirely out of derivatives, but it also offers access to an asset class off limits to most retail investors, that of volatility.The Defined Alpha 20 fund aims to exploit the historic divergence between implied and realised volatility on the S&P 500.“The strategy has been down in only 24 of the past 180 months,” says Mike Egerton, director of private investor products at ABN, who back-tested the fund prior to launch.The fund is initially aimed at institutional investors, such as private banks, wealth managers and private client stockbrokers, but a retail version is planned for later in the year.Indeed, the Dutch bank has wide-ranging plans to further exploit the Ucits III regime to launch new derivatives-based products, from a capital-protected, rules-based call overwriting fund to catastrophe bonds.Courtiers’ response to the new-found freedoms embodied in Ucits III is perhaps even more dramatic. Launched in 1984, Courtiers had largely been operating a multi-manager platform, taking decisions on asset allocation and then parcelling out cash between long-only funds.Now, instead of allocating money between active managers, Courtiers’ range of growth, balanced and cautious funds will simply generate exposure to underlying assets through the use of derivatives.“We have got approval to put all of our portfolio in derivatives,” says Gary Reynolds, chief investment officer of Courtiers. “This is efficient in terms of cost, tax and liquidity. We think it will take about 100 basis points off the costs.”For example, Mr Reynolds estimates it will cost about £150 to get exposure to £6m worth of UK equities via options, with the bid/offer spread accounting for a further £250. Buying the shares outright would cost £30,000 in tax alone.“We think we can be even more precise with our risk controls. We don’t have to worry about what the fund managers are doing,” adds Mr Reynolds. “We are very excited about this. There are massive inefficiencies out there. I think there will be other products like this that come along,”However, in leaping so far, Courtiers may have left some of its clients behind, according to Citi, which helped structure the funds.“Courtiers’ job in successfully convincing their high-net-worth clients of the benefits the underlying derivatives in their Ucits III fund can bring is made harder as they are really pioneers in this space,” says Stuart Pyott, managing director, equity derivatives at Citi.“I am sure this will get easier as more of these funds launch. Derivatives have an unfair image and to some extent they deserve better PR as the economic case for their use in generating alpha can be compelling.”Nevertheless, Ucits III will inevitably narrow the divide between two, once distinct, sectors of the investment industry. “There will be a convergence between long-only funds and hedge funds as they move towards each other,” says Bella Ferreira, senior market analyst at Feri Fund Market Information, which monitors fund launches."
678;STT;State Street Corp;2007-04-11T17:34:07Z;The Short View: Flows into US equities;;Investor disenchantment with the US continues to deepen. Cross-border flows from institutional investors into US equities relative to other assets are almost at their lowest point in more than a decade, according to State Street.Since State Street started tracking the flows in 1995, the only time three-month average flows have been weaker was in the final throes of the last bear market in early 2003 in the lead-up to the Iraqi war.For eurozone-based investors, this has hardly been an irrational response to what has been a miserable performance from US equities in recent years on a relative basis. The S&P 500 index might be up 80 per cent from the 2003 lows but the performance is a less impressive 49 per cent in euro terms. Over the same time, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was up 119 per cent. And the S&P 500 only managed a 1.64 per cent gain in 2006 in euro terms.Richard Bernstein, strategist at Merrill Lynch, points out that a rising stock market with an appreciating currency is very different from a rising bourse with a depreciating currency. While the former suggests a strong economy with growth potential, the latter simply reflects a “money illusion” – a market that in effect rises partly because it is cheaper for investors with other currencies to buy it.For 2007, international investors seem to be voting with their feet, partly fearing a further slide in the dollar given an uncertain economy and the widening interest rate differential with Europe.For contrarians, this may present opportunities to speculate on an eventual rally in US equities in relative terms. But they might be waiting for a while. The valuation argument for the US market is not compelling. The S&P 500 index is trading on a price-earnings multiple of 15.3 times 2007 earnings, a premium to the 13.2 times multiple for European equities, according to Thomson Financial. The forecasts assume 7.2 per cent earnings growth for the US and 6.6 per cent for Europe. In the past, the US could count on the superior record of its corporates to justify a valuation premium. But that support must be fading as Europe catches up.
679;STT;State Street Corp;2007-04-04T21:02:42Z;FSA to act on foreign IPO concerns;;"UK financial regulators on Wednesday gave the first official recognition of intensifying City concern about the impact some overseas listings are having on the standards and reputation of London.The Financial Services Authority said it will canvass opinions in the City about how to clarify the regulations to make clear whether companies have chosen light-touch listing methods, which can offer investors less protection. It said it was calling for formal debate about the balance between attracting new flotations and maintaining quality.The decision comes a day after John Thain, chief executive head of the newly merged NYSE Euronext exchange group, took a thinly veiled swipe at the London Stock Exchange, criticising corporate governance and inadequate protection for minority investors offered by some Russian companies. There has been a steady flow of Russian and Kazakh companies seeking to raise capital in London.The FSA’s decision to formalise an already rumbling debate followed private pressure brought to bear by a group of large shareholders this year. There are widespread worries among institutional investors about the ability of companies with weak corporate governance standards to raise capital on the LSE.In February, a group of important investors, including Hermes, Fidelity, State Street, Royal London, Barclays Global Investors and M&G, warned the FSA the quality of the market was under threat.“In a less benign [economic] environment some decisions being taken now might come back to haunt the regulators,” a fund manager told the FSA.Hector Sants, managing director for wholesale business at the FSA, said new issues from non-traditional markets and European regulations designed to open up competition made it important to consider the balance: “This is a very important debate because of the changing nature of capital markets.”Peter Montagnon, head of investment affairs at the Association of British Insurers, said investors were concerned about confusion between different types of London listings. These include primary, with traditional corporate governance standards; secondary, which need no primary listing elsewhere and have minimum regulation; and global depositary receipts (GDRs), only available to professional investors. The LSE also operates the Aim junior market with weaker regulation.“There’s a risk of confusion here, and there’s a risk that if we are not careful we could sacrifice some of London’s reputation for quality and with it one of the reasons it is an attractive market,” he said.Even some investment bankers – who make large fees from listings – are concerned. A senior industry figure said: “Has it gone too far? Not yet, but we’re close.”The LSE has been successfully promoting itself in Russia but is keen to head off investor criticism, which surfaced last year when several big groups attacked the listing of Rosneft, Russian oil producer.The LSE welcomed the debate. “We are particularly keen to have clear labelling of the different forms of listing, giving investors the choice but making sure it is very clear exactly what they are being given,” it said."
680;STT;State Street Corp;2007-04-04T15:28:32Z;A thirst for foreign investment;;For a country renowned for a frequently insular approach to the world, Japan has proved remarkably welcoming to foreign investments and foreign investment houses.Koji Yamamoto, president of State Street Global Advisors (Japan), says the country’s pension funds typically put a quarter of their money in non-yen assets – “probably higher” than the norm for the US and about the same level as internationally minded UK funds.This thirst for foreign investment – and foreign investment styles, such as hedge funds, that originated outside Japan – has drawn Japanese institutions to foreign firms with global expertise.Industry estimates suggest foreign houses now manage about a quarter of all Japanese money invested with professional asset managers. Though institutions are still more likely than retail investors to funnel money through foreign houses, households are increasingly abandoning their conservatism, using foreign fund managers in their quest for yield abroad.For example, the global utilities income fund managed by Pictet, the mid-sized Swiss private bank, has ensnared the imagination of the public since it was launched two years ago to invest in equities, accumulating a net asset value of Y2,200bn. Figures from Japan’s Investment Trust Association show Pictet alone accounted for more than 9 per cent of net inflow into onshore mutual funds in the nine months to December – more than anyone else except the mighty Nomura and Daiwa, Japan’s two biggest securities houses.For the western firms that have been successful in Japan, sharp growth has generally come over the past few years, as strands in a web of regulations that made doing business hard have been removed one by one.The State Street group, a specialist in institutional investment, is now managing Y10,000bn of money in Japan. But seven years ago it was only Y1,500bn. Pictet’s funds under management have ballooned from only Y150bn two years ago to Y2,800bn now – though the bulk of this comes from the one fund.Breakthroughs on the regulatory front have been unspectacular but steady over the past ten years or so. Foreign houses welcomed, in particular, the end of the rule that pension funds had to put at least half their money in ultra-safe assets – Japanese government bonds and cash – and no more than 30 per cent in foreign assets.The big chance for foreign investment houses came at the end of the 1990s, when the banks decided to move into the distribution of retail investment products. Crippled by bad debts, they had few financial or management resources available to think up their own products – but were reluctant to use ones offered by other Japanese financial services companies that could be construed as rivals.One solution was to seek foreign fund managers. Largely because of the banks’ interest, the distribution network among Japanese financial services companies for big western fund managers such as Fidelity is now impressively wide.An official at a western fund manager says breaking into the distribution network is much easier than in many European countries. “Europe is still very much a closed architecture world, with strong universal banks that have full control of everything that goes to their clients.”Western fund managers also claim they have made headway because they take a more long-term approach than many Japanese fund managers. They say Japanese firms are more concerned with fads and gimmicks. Takuhide Hagino, head of new fund development and marketing at Pictet Asset Management (Japan), cites the example of the emerging markets equities craze of 2005 among Japanese fund managers. Pictet, he argues, had the discipline to ignore this, after deciding these markets did not offer attractive valuations for investors.But Mr Hagino says the strong success of Pictet’s global utility income fund – an original idea executed after careful research using focus groups among likely investors - has spawned about 30 imitations.Mr Hagino says Japanese houses “do not take care of existing mutual funds”. Instead they act “like investment banking underwriters”, launching new funds, only to lose interest and happily accept a steady decline in assets under management after the initial fanfare. Japanese managers dispute this assessment, though they do undeniably offer an extremely large number of new funds compared with their counterparts in other rich countries. Many western fund managers acknowledge Japanese investment houses are becoming more long-term.Domestic house Kokusai, whose multi-trillion yen Global Sovereign fund is Japan’s biggest retail investment trust, has a small army of employees dedicated to maintaining customer service for existing and new clients of the fund.But even if all Japanese fund managers raise their game by addressing the faults their western rivals complain about, the battle between western and Japanese fund houses is not a zero-sum competition. The retail market in mutual funds – still no higher than Y60,000bn out of a total value of household assets of Y1,500,000bn – is widely predicted to grow rapidly, providing rich pickings for everyone.This may bring in some of the mid-sized western investment boutiques that have yet to establish themselves properly in Japan.
681;STT;State Street Corp;2007-02-15T18:28:21Z;US pressures Tokyo over Japan Post;;The Bush administration is to increase pressure on Tokyo to ensure US companies do not lose out in the privatisation of Japan Post, the world's biggest financial institution, even as a senior Japanese official on Thursday called US concerns “a misunderstanding”.Susan Schwab, US trade representative, said the administration was closely monitoring the process and was prepared to resort to litigation if US financial services groups were unfairly disadvantaged.In October, Japan’s post office will be split into four companies – a bank with assets of Y226,000bn (£956bn, $1,867bn, €1,428bn), a life assurance company with assets of Y114,000bn, a mail delivery service and a post office network.The break-up of the post office, also the world’s largest bank and insurance company, will transfer management of more than $3,000bn (£1,537bn, €2,295bn) of assets into private hands later this year and bring new competition into the Japanese banking and insurance sectors.Foreign companies are concerned that the financial institutions created from the break-up could use implicit government guarantees to expand their businesses, since Tokyo will continue to own large stakes for years. Under current plans, the government will own 100 per cent of the post office companies until they are listed in three to four years’ time.In particular, foreign life assurance groups are worried that the newly privatised life assurance company will be allowed to sell new products before equal competitive conditions are put in place. The postal company, for example, has asked to sell insurance products, including variable annuities, that foreign companies have historically been strong in.But Nobuyuki Kinoshita, director-general of the Office for the Promotion of the Privatisation of Postal Services, on Thursday said US concerns were based on “a misunderstanding”.He said: “It is impossible for US financial services groups to be unfairly disadvantaged.”The postal privatisation law states that Japan will implement measures to ensure equivalent conditions of competition, so “if they looked at the law, they would see that discrimination is impossible”, he said.Ms Schwab was expected to underline the US view in front of the Senate finance committee in Washington last night at a time of tension over the elevated trade deficit with Japan.Another concern is that US companies have so far been awarded a limited role in the 10-year transition towards full privatisation that begins in October, although financial services groups such as AIG, State Street and Fidelity Investments have all pitched for management of the funds.Goldman Sachs was initially selected as the only foreign asset manager to share responsibility with Daiwa Securities and Nomura Holdings for offering investment products and managing the savings of some Japan Post customers.But Goldman was later ruled out of a future role by Japan Post executives after the US bank was punished by the Financial Services Authority for violating the country’s investment trust laws.
682;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
683;STT;State Street Corp;2007-02-05T22:00:04Z;US stock investors cautious amid deals;;Wall Street was in a cautious mood on Monday amid a flurry of merger and acquisition activity and earnings reports.Stocks ended the day little changed against a backdrop of higher oil prices.The S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent lower at 1,446.98. After solid gains last week, analysts debated whether the bull run could continue.“Indicators suggest that equities are becoming as frothy as in May 2006,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. He said JPMorgan was “becoming more nervous about the durability of the current bull run”.Others suggested, however, that the economic background favoured holding stocks. The recent mix of economic data has suggested a combination of moderating inflation and overall economic strength in spite of weakness in the housing and manufacturing sectors. “We do not see significant warning signals for an economic downturn and see little reason to be bearish on the US equities,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.Among M&A deals, Triad Hospital surged 14.7 per cent to $49.65 after it revealed it had agreed to a buy-out from private equity investors for $4.7bn and the assumption of $1.7bn in debt.Lear rose 11.5 per cent to $38.64 after it reported an approach from a group affiliated with Carl Icahn, the investor. The group offered $2.61bn, or $36 a share for the car-parts maker.State Street fell 6.5 per cent to $67.08 after the financial services group said it would acquire Investors Financial Services for about $4.5bn in stock.Herbalife announced that a private equity firm had made an offer of $38 a share, or $2.7bn, for the company. Its shares jumped 21.21 per cent to $40.12.Mills Corp received a $1.56bn offer from Simon Property Group and hedge fund Farallon Capital Management. The mall owner agreed to be bought by Brookfield Asset Management last month. Mills rose 16.8 per cent to $25.87.By the close in New York the Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent lower at 2,470.6. Offsetting technology weakness was KLA-Tencor, up 2.6 per cent at $51.29. The semiconductor maker said its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 18 per cent and it boosted its guidance on the outlook for its fiscal third-quarter.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 12,661.74.One of the best performers in the Dow was Wal-Mart after it released an estimate on Saturday that its January store sales should rise 2.2 per cent, a stronger-than-forecast outcome. Its shares rose 0.9 per cent to $48.52.Humana rose 0.9 per cent to $57.84 after its fourth-quarter net income more than doubled to $155m from the previous year and surpassed analyst estimates. The health insurer also raised its earnings outlook for 2007.
684;STT;State Street Corp;2007-02-05T21:02:32Z;Claims staked in land grab;;The universe of exchange-traded funds continues to expand at an extraordinary rate. As Deborah Fuhr, managing director at Morgan Stanley, says, 2006 was a breakthrough year for the industry.Not only did worldwide assets under management in ETFs jump 37.6 per cent to $573.9bn but the number of providers and products bloomed around the world. The pace of expansion shows little sign of slowing this year. With worldwide ETF assets forecast by Financial Research Corporation, a US data company, to reach $1,000bn by the end of 2010, there is something of an investment industry land grab going on.Providers are rushing to stake a claim to product and geographic territory – to gain first-mover advantage in introducing innovative ETFs or stake out geographic territory from Budapest to Mumbai.Ms Fuhr estimates the number of ETFs jumped 61 per cent to 732, while the number of managers rose from 50 to 64. The number of listings of ETFs nearly doubled from 601 to 1,055.No firm, however, came close to matching Barclays Global Investors, the undisputed dominant force in the industry, in taking advantage of these trends. With its iShares brand of ETFs, it continued to strengthen its competitive position.In spite of new entrants, the heavyweight lifted its global market share last year from 46.82 per cent to 49.6 per cent by the end of December, according to Morgan Stanley. Its assets under management in ETFs jumped from $195.17bn to $284.83bn over 2006. This is nearly three times as high as nearest competitor State Street Global Advisors, with $100.01bn invested in its ETFs.BGI also set a blistering pace in product launches, bringing 39 ETFs to market. That increased its portfolio to 188 ETFs. Its range will expand with the $240m acquisition announced last November of rival Indexchange, the German ETF pioneer that was owned by the bank HVB.The acquisition will bring on board 79 ETFs with $21.46bn of assets, 3.01 per cent of worldwide industry assets under management. These will be merged with iShares, making its European presence even more formidable.SSGA, which pioneered ETFs in 1993 with the S&P 500-tracking SPDR, had a more mixed year. Assets under management in ETFs increased from $92.5bn to $101.1bn but that was not enough to prevent it losing market share. Morgan Stanley estimates its market share dropped from 22.19 per cent to 17.6 per cent. However, Ms Fuhr says State Street will be one to watch in 2007.The other feature of 2006 was the growth of smaller providers staking a claim with new products highlighting areas ranging from commodities to indices of companies selected on the basis of fundamental factors such as dividend pay-outs or cash flows.PowerShares, which was bought last year by mutual fund group Amvescap, set a strong pace, attracting attention for its innovative fundamental ETFs and others based on indices of stocks selected on quantitative factors. The Illinois-based company launched 33 ETFs, lifting its total portfolio to 69. Assets under management rose from $3.3bn to $8.47bn and its market share from 0.79 per cent to 1.5 per cent, according to Morgan StanleyAnother newcomer to gain plaudits for product innovation was Claymore Investments. Its 14 products included ETFs based on indices compiled to exploit factors such as corporate insider buying trends and Wall Street analyst upgrades. It also launched an ETF based on companies that have been spun off from larger groups, another based on companies with strong patents.However, in the ETF land grab, there is one curious anomaly, a company that stands out more for its absence than its presence – the industry giant Fidelity. At the end of last year, it had one ETF – a product that tracks the Nasdaq Composite, with $130m of assets under management.
685;STT;State Street Corp;2007-02-05T19:42:31Z;State Street;;Winning custody is sometimes a matter of paying up for it. Take State Street, whose latest deal would leave it with more than $14,000bn in assets under custody. Strategically, buying its smaller rival, Investors Financial Services, for $4.5bn makes some sense. It would make State Street the second largest global custodian and the number one hedge fund administrator.Size matters in serving institutional investors. High fixed costs mean each additional client can have a disproportionate impact on profits. State Street hopes to repeat the success of when it bought Deutsche Bank’s custodian business in 2002.State Street foresees annual pre-tax cost savings of between $345m and $365m by 2009, or about half of Investors Financial’s operating expenses. Taxed and net of restructuring costs, such savings are worth perhaps $2.5bn on a net present value basis. Based on State Street’s closing price on Friday, that is a touch above the 54 per cent premium to Investors Financial’s average share price for the previous three months.That means State Street has already handed over the bulk of the deal’s putative benefits to Investors Financial’s shareholders – leaving it exposed to any hiccups. Although it has a strong record in retaining customers, it will no doubt lose some of Investors Financial’s. Investors Financial has grown swiftly but might well struggle in a more turbulent capital market environment.Even after Monday’s 6 per cent fall in State Street’s share price, the offer values Investors Financial at 27 times 2007 earnings. Add in the potential for similar deals in the future and it is easy to see why State Street’s shareholders are feeling a little nervous.
686;STT;State Street Corp;2007-02-05T18:28:47Z;The Short View: Carry trade worries;;For all the worries expressed about risks to global markets from the carry trade, the extent of the phenomenon has proved remarkably elusive to quantify.But State Street Global Markets has provided evidence to suggest that the practice of borrowing in the currency of countries with low interest rates to invest in higher yielding assets in another currency is approaching extreme levels. The financial services group tracks fund flows – the level of contracts built up over 120 days to purchase or sell a currency at a future date – among institutional investors.It says the correlation between fund flows and yields for a basket of 19 currencies it tracks has reached 61 per cent, the highest level since 1999. As State Street says, investors are buying the highest yielding currencies and selling the low with abandon.Net six-month fund flows into the yen, the lowest-yielding currency of the 19 in its basket, are at their most negative since March 2000. They have only been more negative for 5 per cent of the time since State Street started tracking them in 1995. Similarly, net flows into the Swiss franc, the 17th lowest-yielding currency, have only been more negative for 4 per cent of the time since tracking began. By contrast, net fund flows into the Brazilian real, the highest yielding currency, have only been more positive 6 per cent of the time. Other high yielders like the Australian dollar are also seeing high net positive flows.All this might explain why the yen has rallied on speculation that its recent weakness might be raised at the meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations this week. But the move may be small beer to what could happen. Albert Edwards, strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort, pointed out last week that the yen is extremely cyclical, closely tracking shifts in the Japanese economy. So any strong Japanese economic data and/or rise in expectations of local rate rises could trigger a trimming of the carry trade. Given the scope for wider market volatility if that happens, global investors ought to be watching Japanese economic data closely.
687;STT;State Street Corp;2007-02-05T16:30:38Z;State Street to buy IFS for $4.5bn;;"State Street, the world’s largest mutual fund servicing business, said on Monday it would acquire Investors Financial Services for about $4.5bn in stock.Ronald Logue, State Street’s chairman and chief executive, said the two Boston-based companies ""already share a similar focus, service model and customer type, which makes for a seamless and swift consolidation.""State Street said the deal – which is supposed to close by the third quarter - would cut into earnings this year, but would begin adding to the bottom line in 2009. The company sees cost savings of about $345m to $365m in the first two years after the acquisition closes amid staffing, technology, and property consolidation.State Street said it expected pretax restructuring charges of $625m to $675m.Analysts praised the deal as “strategically sound” but said that the terms appear expensive. Andrew Marquardt, analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton, said in a research report that: “there appears to be meaningful overlap and economies of scale opportunities, but the pricing looks expensive at first glance”.Once the deal has closed, the State Street will have more than $14,000bn in assets under custody, including $3,500bn in mutual fund assets under administration.The acquisition comes on the heels of a merger announced between rivals Mellon Financial and Bank of New York. The new company, to be known as Bank of New York Mellon, will have more than $16,600bn of assets under custody.Earlier this year, State Street said it would buy Currenex for $564m to add electronic foreign exchange trading services.Shareholders of Investors Financial, a provider of accounting, back-office and investment-advisory services to asset managers, will receive 0.906 State Street shares for each share of Investors Financial. The deal values the Boston-based company at $65.01 a share, a 38 per cent premium to Friday's closing price of $46.95.In morning trade, shares of State Street were down 5.6% at $67.74, while IFS jumped 28.6 per cent to $60.50."
688;STT;State Street Corp;2007-01-22T22:29:57Z;State Street buys online forex trading platform;;State Street, one of the world’s largest financial services groups, has stepped-up its efforts to attract more business from hedge funds and other active traders by buying Currenex, an online foreign exchange trading platform, for $564m in cash.Currenex provides electronic currency trading primarily for the rapidly growing $1,300bn hedge fund industry where State Street, which is primarily known for its money management and custody businesses, has been trying to boost its presence.“This acquisition diversifies State Street’s trading customer base beyond traditional asset managers to include more active currency managers and hedge funds,” said Joseph Hooley, vice-chairman.State Street, which has $1,700bn in assets under management and $11,900bn in assets under custody, said Currenex would augment its FX Connect foreign exchange trading platform, which last month topped $108bn of trading volume in one day. “The future of global electronic foreign exchange trading will be determined by who can provide the most efficient technology solutions that allow quicker access to markets and flexible, comprehensive trading solutions,” said Mr Hooley.Brad Bailey, an analyst at the Aite Group, a US consultancy, said: “Currenex, despite problems in the past, has become one of the leading innovators in institutional FX trading. The nature of FX trading has changed dramatically in the past few years, pressuring dealing banks and offering tremendous opportunities to traders.”Founded in 1999 and part- owned by TH Lee Putnam Ventures, Currenex has offices in New York, Chicago, London, Singapore and Redwood City, California. State Street said the purchase should not affect 2007 results but should add slightly to earnings in 2008.The currency market is one of the largest in the world with $2,300bn traded every day. By 2010, volume is expected to reach $3,000bn a day, with electronic foreign exchange trading likely to double to roughly $2,000bn a day, according to a study from ClientKnowledge.
689;STT;State Street Corp;2006-12-04T21:29:41Z;BoNY in $17bn takeover of Mellon;;Bank of New York on Monday announced an agreed takeover of Mellon Financial for about $17bn, eight years after it made an abortive $24bn hostile bid for the Pittsburgh-based asset management and custody group.The deal between two of the oldest financial institutions in the US will create the world’s leading securities services company and could trigger further consolidation in the global custody industry.Tom Renyi, BoNY’s chief executive, said: “Other management teams will be coming together today and saying ‘what is our response?’ ”The combined group will have $16,600bn of assets under custody, overtaking JPMorgan Chase, which has $12,900bn. Other leading asset servicing companies include State Street, Citigroup, BNP Paribas and Northern Trust.“This transaction dramatically reduces the options for other players,” said one adviser to the deal. Scale is increasingly important in a fast-growing business in which technology spending is rising rapidly.Bob Kelly, recently appointed chief executive of Mellon, said: “There has been tremendous consolidation in the US market but Europe is just starting that and will go on for five years. Then we have Asia.”About 25 per cent of the combined group’s revenues will be outside the US and Mr Renyi said this would continue to grow faster than its domestic business.The deal is presented as a merger but BoNY will have the upper hand. It gets 10 board members against Mellon’s eight and BoNY shareholders will own 63 per cent of the new company. Mr Renyi will be executive chairman for 18 months after the deal closes and will then be replaced by Mr Kelly who will be chief executive until then.Shareholders in the two companies get stock in a new combined group in a ratio determined by the average share prices over the past year. Because Mellon’s shares have performed better, this ironically means they get a smaller effective premium over Friday’s close. BoNY shares were up 11.8 per cent at $39.67 in late New York trading while Mellon’s were 6.5 per cent higher at $42.66. Mellon has had a stock split since BoNY bid eight years ago, which was worth the equivalent of about $45 per share.Mr Renyi said the deal was “unbelievably” attractive financially with the companies forecasting $700m of cost savings, about 8.5 per cent of the expense base, with about 3,900 jobs to go out of 40,000. No revenue synergies have been assumed in the forecasts.Mergers in custody tend to result in some client losses and, while Mr Renyi said the aim was not to lose any, some attrition was built into financial projections. It was too soon to say what impact the merger would have on Mellon’s joint ventures with ABN Amro and CIBC, he said.Mr Renyi said the companies were highly complementary with BoNY stronger in securities servicing and Mellon bigger in asset management. Together they will be the 10th biggest asset manager globally with $1,011bn under management. Within asset servicing, Mellon is stronger with pension funds and endowments while BoNY has done better with mutual funds.David Hilder, analyst at Bear Stearns, said the merger was “very positive for both banks because it solves problems for both banks and creates a strong, more competitive player in asset servicing and asset management.”
690;STT;State Street Corp;2006-11-30T02:48:50Z;Beijing widens pension fund mandates;;Beijing has for the first time appointed foreign institutions to manage the overseas investments of its $40bn state pension fund, in a move that is expected to further strengthen China’s clout in international capital markets.The National Social Security Fund, established in 2000 by the central government as a pension fund of last resort, has handed investment mandates to 10 international groups – including UBS, Pimco, Invesco, State Street, Alliance Bernstein, and Black Rock.The mandates – including global equity, US equity, Hong Kong equity and global fixed income – are widely seen as “trophies” that could allow fund managers to win further business from cash-rich institutions in China and across Asia.The new mandates also offer a unique opportunity for US companies such as Alliance Bernstein, State Street, Janus and T Rowe Price. They have so far avoided a costly foray into China’s domestic fund market, where foreigners are required to buy minority stakes in fund joint ventures.Peter Alexander, head of Z-Ben Advisors, a specialist research firm, said: “The NSSF will one day become so big that the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation [with about $140bn of assets] will pale in comparison.”The bulk of the NSSF’s assets has been raised through a government policy that forces state-owned enterprises listing overseas to set aside 10 per cent of the proceeds – in shares – to go into the fund’s coffers.This has left the fund with a highly concentrated port-folio. Some 40 per cent of its total assets are invested in just three listed Chinese state banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Bank of Communications, according to Z-Ben Advisors.The NSSF has declined to unveil the size of the individual overseas investment mandates. But analysts believe managers will receive an initial total allocation of about $1.5bn, which is already held in offshore accounts in Hong Kong. The fund is thought to have raised the money by selling some of its holdings in the banks, including a $600m sale of ICBC shares on the first day of its recent flotation in Hong Kong.According to the NSSF’s official record, it holds about $27bn of assets, with the bank stakes booked at cost. Given the sharp rise of these shares in recent months, the fund’s total assets are estimated to have jumped to $40bn, says Mr Alexander of Z-Ben Advisors.With its rapidly ageing population and falling fertility rate, China is facing a pensions crisis. It has a narrow “demographic window of opportunity” of about 10 years to fix its fledgling pension system, according to Stuart Leckie, a Hong Kong-based pensions expert and adviser to the Chinese government.
691;STT;State Street Corp;2006-11-20T15:09:03Z;Ask the expert: Investor strategy;;"Alan Brown is an outspoken and insightful commentator on markets and fund management. As chief investment officer at Schroders, he oversees a fund management operation managing some £123bn of assets for clients. He has been working in markets since 1974 when he joined Morgan Grenfell as an equity analyst.After working for several fund management firms, he joined State Street Global Advisors in 1995 and later became chief investment officer and vice-chairman, playing a pivotal role in building up the profile of firm and shaping its investment culture. Mr Brown answers your questions below.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Globally we see a property boom, and this has also rippled down to the developing economies. Do you feel that global hedge funds will be looking at a global real-estate fund to gather capital gains from property prices?
Sahan J, Sri LankaAlan Brown: We have indeed seen a global property boom that has spread to many parts of the world. Looking at your question, I am not sure that I necessarily see hedge funds capitalising on rising property prices. However, we do believe that the property market is ripe for a more global investment approach. Historically, the majority of property investment has been carried out on a local basis. Increasingly, we now see investors interested in more geographically diversified strategies thereby seeking to avoid potential local hot spots. Another catalyst has been the growing number of REIT type structures available around the world.Quite clearly developing economies should be a part of this. Emerging market investment started with equities, moved on to bonds and we see no reason why it should not embrace property as well. One caveat though, this expansion into developing countries is likely to occur one country at a time. There are minimum standards of law of property and transparency that will be necessary to attract foreign investors. Some countries are already clearly there, others have a way to go.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Where are global markets heading in the next couple of years in your view?
Su Hoi, Tokyo, JapanAlan Brown: When thinking about the global equity markets today, I am reminded of the old Hong Kong airport. A final approach to the runway with a sharp right hand bend taking one apparently perilously close to apartment blocks on either side!The runway today represents a soft landing view of the world’s economy where the US slows down to 2 to 2 1/2 per cent growth, Japan and Europe put up reasonably solid numbers and China continues on track with continued high single digit growth. Against that backdrop, with equity markets quite reasonably priced by historical standards, markets could quite likely have a reasonable year in 2007 even in the face of slower earnings growth. This is a benign scenario with a better balance to world growth than we have seen in years.The apartment blocks to the left represent the possibility that the consumer reaction to the housing downturn could be much more severe than currently expected. The theory here is that individuals save with a monetary goal in mind. To the extent that stock markets and housing realise those goals without the need to actually save, then individuals can spend, and indeed can dis-save through taking out equity from their houses. Hence the negative savings rate in the States.When house prices actually decline (and we are in uncharted waters here) then first it becomes much more difficult to extract equity from your house to support current spending and second, there is the possibility of an abrupt rise in the savings rate driving the economy into recession. If this were to happen it is likely that the rest of the world would follow too. The one bright spot here is that the Fed’s gun is “reloaded” now and there would be plenty of room for cutting rates aggressively to re-ignite growth.The apartment blocks on the other side represent the possibility that the American consumer is more resilient than we expect and the economy doesn’t slow down. In which case all bets are off as to where interest rates would peak as we would expect the Fed to continue to tighten quite aggressively.Today, we look set fair to make it to the runway. I reckon we have missed the apartment blocks on the right, but we are still keeping an eye on those on the left.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Certain investors such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch have publicly claimed that they do not pay much attention to the state of the economy, the general direction of the equity market (in the short-term at least) as well as other macro-economic indicators. How important is these information to your operation and how do you filter out the noise from what really matters?
SK Tan, Hong KongAlan Brown: We believe that there is more than one way to “skin a cat”. Warren Buffet espouses a particularly long-term strategy and so for him, worrying about the short-term outlook for the economy is not going to add much. What is most important is that whatever philosophy one espouses (growth or value manager for example), one should not get blown off course because of short-term set backs.Having the conviction to follow a particular approach is likely to be rewarded in the medium term. We do pay attention to economic indicators, but to filter out the noise, we do so against a cyclical perspective of the economy where we are interested in developments over years not months.One other thing, not everything is as quite as it appears in investing. For example, one often hears the view that high levels of turnover on stock markets mean that we are all becoming speculators, rather than investors. But consider this: If you think back to the days of the “nifty fifty” when one was supposed to be able to buy IBM, Kodak and Xerox and hold them forever, which was the most speculative act?Was it the investor who had the hubris to think that he knew anything about the world thirty years on, or was it the investor who recognised that he couldn’t see beyond the next couple of years or so, and so invested with a much shorter-term horizon?Today’s product and management life cycles in the face of rapidly changing technology do not allow us the luxury of buying and holding forever.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..If you want to have an average return of 12 per cent per annum, how would you allocate your investment portfolio? What would be your weighting on emerging market such as eastern Europe and Latin America? How risky do you think for entering India now?
Kaili Jen, TaiwanAlan Brown: This is an interesting question. It is very important to make sure that ones investment aspirations are consistent with market opportunities or risk premia.Given the headline return numbers we see so often from individual countries or stocks, it is tempting to assume that it should be relatively easy to earn 1 per cent a month. Part of the problem here is the difference between ex-ante and ex-poste. After the event it is always easy to find stocks or markets that have delivered 12 per cent and indeed very much more. The difficulty is in identifying them in advance!It always helps when thinking about returns to go back to some basic theory. And when thinking about equity markets I often find a Gordon model being a good place to start. The Gordon model simply stated says that in the long run the return from equities is equal to the dividend yield plus the growth in the yield.Growth in dividends in the very long-term has to keep pace with growth in the economy and inflation. So, if you have a market with a dividend yield of 2 per cent, inflation of 2.5 per cent and trend growth of 3 per cent, a first cut at the long-run return of the market would be 7.5 per cent per annum. Many markets in the developed world would today be fall into the range of offering returns of between 7 and 8 per cent, and remember that is before fees and expenses of investing.So, to earn a return of 12 per cent is either going to require a very high degree of added value from active management, or investment in riskier markets (emerging markets would be good candidates) or the use of leverage. Or some combination of all three.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..How should I allocate investments during a downturn in the markets, especially if I need this money during retirement?
John Koh, Chicago, USAlan Brown: Managing investments where one is dependant upon them for current income presents some quite different challenges to managing investments during the accumulation phase of saving. As far as is possible, it is highly desirable if you can structure your investments in a manner which will not lead you to be a forced seller during market downturns when asset prices are depressed.So, for example, if you are in the fortunate position of being able to set up a portfolio which can meet your income needs through dividend income, bond interest and other forms of income (rental, for example), then you will be able to ride out market downturns quite easily.To the extent that that is not possible, it makes sense to consider building in some natural liquidity into your portfolio through having bonds with staggered maturity dates providing additional funds through return of capital. Other strategies which can help could include capital protected investments.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Some people think that active fund management is an expensive waste of time. What would you say about this and what is the role of active management in the average investor’s profile?
Tunde, London, UKAlan Brown: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) which underlies much of the thinking behind passive management strategies has stood the test of time pretty well. However, few today believe that markets are perfectly efficient and most recognise that CAPM is at the end of the day a partial equilibrium model. As such it is an abstraction of reality. At times the active/passive debate, which invokes so much passion amongst practitioners, must leave our clients feeling somewhat bemused.I think the answer to your question can be found in taking a look at what the world’s most sophisticated investors are doing. Sophisticated institutional investors routinely use both active and passive strategies. Our clients recognise that they are natural bedfellows and not oil and water! It makes sense to employ active strategies where they are most likely to be rewarded, in more inefficient markets. Where markets are very efficient, it makes more sense to go passive.Active management also comes in many guises. Being too benchmarked focused can also cause real difficulties during bear markets such as we experienced during 2000 to 2002. Increasingly we see investors interested in managing towards real world outcomes, for example earning inflation plus returns, protecting surpluses. All of these require active management.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..What do you think is the best way to invest in Chinese companies and capitalise on the China growth story?
Robert Gollings, RussiaAlan Brown: China clearly represents a tremendous opportunity for investors. However, it is not without its own special risks. So far, the rewards of high levels of economic growth have flowed very unevenly to shareholders, and standards of corporate governance and the law of property are well below western norms.One of the lower risks ways to benefit from China’s growth is to invest in developed country companies who will benefit as suppliers to China, or as trading partners. Resource stocks in the Asian region, for example, are likely to be prime beneficiaries from China’s rising need for raw materials.Investing directly in China requires a great deal of expertise and local knowledge. It is an area where investors are most likely to require professional help from firms with a wide experience of the country and region.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..What is your opinion on BRICs as an investment? Should a short term investor get involved or is the investment strategy more long term?
David Labrie, Rhode IslandAlan Brown: Investing in emerging markets in general is likely to be towards the more risky end of most investors portfolios. As such, it makes sense to take a long-term view of the asset class, recognising that markets can be volatile in the short-term. The case for emerging markets is a strong one. These are some of the most vibrant areas of the world economy, experiencing well above average economic growth rates.Stock markets are small in relation to GDP compared to the developed word and valuation levels are generally cheaper. Since the Asian crisis in the late 90s, national accounts have been brought well under control and indeed Asian central banks have acquired very substantial Dollar reserves. These economies are not therefore as vulnerable to economic shocks as they were in the past and, at the same time, standards of corporate governance have been gradually improving.The BRIC story obviously focuses on a sub-set of emerging markets concentrating on the big four. Generally, for a core emerging market strategy, we would recommend a broader, all inclusive approach. There is little advantage to be gained by unnecessarily reducing the investment opportunity set. However, once an investor has an established core investment in emerging markets, a focused strategy alongside the core can have its place. Certainly, beyond the economic dimension, the big four by virtue of their very size are likely to be particularly important political and economic partners to the West.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Where is the best bet for low risk capital gains, disregarding any requirement for dividends or any other income stream?
Michael Beaman, London, UK?Alan Brown: Of the main asset classes, public equities look better value than most. Although equity markets have enjoyed good returns over the last few years this has been fully supported by increases in earnings. As a result, Price Earnings multiples appear quite reasonable. Of course there are always risks, and one to focus on right now is the extent of the US consumer reaction to the housing downturn. For the moment, a soft landing for the US economy seems most likely, but this is an area to watch. Any abrupt increase in savings could tip the US and then the rest of the world towards recession. We see no sign of this at the moment but we are keeping a careful eye out.If low risk is paramount, then you could consider capital protected strategies which will ensure that you at least get your money back. However, there is a price to pay for protection. Otherwise, a broadly diversified, global equity strategy would be a good place to look. While you may have no requirement for income, do bear in mind that high yielding stocks can have defensive characteristics in the event of a market downturn.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..I’m setting up a venture capital house focusing mainly on emerging markets (commodities and natural resources) and long term wise I plan to establish a CSR Investment Fund for Africa. Can you advise me what is the best way to learn and master the art of fund management and investment in natural resources?
Tony Malalane, MozambiqueWhenever I am asked about learning about investments, I always refer people to a book by Peter Bernstein called Capital Ideas, the Improbable Origins of Modern Wall Street. While this will not particularly help you with the specialist skills necessary to manage natural resources in emerging markets, it will give you a very solid foundation in the workings of capital markets in general.In doing so, it will make sense of many of the apparent contradictions in the investing world and should help keep you out of trouble! It is also, in my view, a cracking read!………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….."
692;STT;State Street Corp;2006-10-30T11:10:27Z;UK pension lottery idea sparks debate;;A suggestion in these pages two weeks ago that the UK government should offer deferred index-linked annuities to allow workers to escape the “lottery” of defined contribution pension schemes has provoked debate in the industry.John Nugée, head of the official institutions group at State Street Global Advisers and a former reserves manager at both the Bank of England and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, argued that more needed to be done to help individuals who are increasingly being locked out of defined benefit pension schemes, and thus face great uncertainty in providing for their retirement.His solution was for the government to issue index-linked deferred annuities that individuals could buy every year of their working life, allowing them to build up a guaranteed income in retirement tranche by tranche.Mr Nugée argued that only the public sector could meet this need, as an annuity may still need to be paying out 70 or 80 years after it was purchased.Any radical change in the UK’s annuity regime could have repercussions elsewhere, given that the UK is the undisputed leader of the industry, accounting for around half of the $20bn of business written every year.Mr Nugée’s proposals have been broadly welcomed. “I think this idea is a very good one, although it needs refining,” says Professor David Blake, director of the Pensions Institute at London’s Cass Business School.“It’s an interesting idea. We all need to look more imaginatively at the annuity market,” adds Michelle Lewis, pensions officer at the TUC. “We are not keen on the whole risk being put on an individual’s shoulders.”Commentators from both sides of the political spectrum agree that more needs to be done to allow individuals to annuitise their savings pot in several stages to reduce risk. Mr Nugée himself quoted the example of an individual retiring and buying an annuity in 2002 who would have received just 40 per cent of the retirement income of someone with an identical payment history retiring two years earlier, due to lower annuity rates and the equity market slump.“It is very good news that people are talking about the annuities crisis and he has done a great service by raising this issue,” says Philip Hammond, Conservative spokesman on work and pensions.“It does seem to me that there must be a way of avoiding the risk that you have to annuitise at a point in the cycle that disadvantages you. We need to be spreading the risk by annuitising over a period of time.”However there is a broad view that if deferred annuities were to be created, individuals should only be encouraged to drip-feed their pension savings into them during the final five to ten years of their working life, rather than throughout their career, in order to retain exposure to equities.“I suggest that people do this in the five years before retirement,” says Mr Blake, who points out that the UK government did issue its own annuities until it gave way to the private sector in 1928.“The problem [if you annuitise earlier] is that you are out of the equity markets and you forego the equity risk premium for a very long time.”Alan Brown, head of investment at Schroders, agrees, saying: “This would be an almost ideal asset to buy in the final decade before retirement. For longer investment horizons the cost of being in government bonds rather than higher returning assets means you don’t want to do that for too long.”Alan Rubenstein, European head of pensions advisory at Lehman Brothers, was more critical, describing any move into bonds by a 30 or 40-year-old worker as “reckless conservatism”.Mr Nugée accepts this point, but believes some people would still benefit from purchasing tranches of guaranteed annuity throughout their working life.“In an ideal world, if you can rely on people to invest wisely you would hope that they would follow a lifestyle approach, starting mostly in equities and as they age switching to fixed income,” he says.“But there are also people who would benefit from the fact that, whatever else, they have made a start, they have an absolute bedrock on which they can build. I think that the task of getting people into the savings habit is so difficult that we need to try innovative ideas.”Ms Lewis of the TUC can also see both sides of this coin. “An individual could be tying up money that could be generating better returns, but there is an issue of growth versus certainty. People do like to have a degree of certainty.”Another concern raised by many commentators is that the proposal would be unfair to future generations. Because the government would receive the funds immediately, but would not need to service this debt for decades in some cases, some saw this as unfair on those who would be left to pick up the bill for earlier spending.However, Mr Brown of Schroders refutes this argument. “GDP is consumed in the year that it is made. Whether income is transferred to pensioners via taxation and benefits or government bonds and interest payments, there is no greater problem of inter-generational equity,” he argues.Perhaps the most intractable problem would be persuading a government that is already exposed to significant longevity risk through state pensions, unfunded public sector pensions and the health system, to take on still more risk.“I think from the government’s point of view it is extremely unattractive. You have a government that is trying to move the responsibility from the state to the individual. This clearly runs counter to that,” says Mr Rubenstein.“The idea that the government can readily absorb all the risk of the private sector is a big step,” adds Mr Hammond. However, two years ago, the government’s Debt Management Office did consult on the possibility of issuing longevity bonds that would have allowed pension funds and insurance companies to offload some of their longevity risk to the government, a proposal that only remained on the drawing board because of a “lukewarm response” from the industry, according to Robert Stheeman, chief executive of the DMO.And Mr Nugée remains convinced his logic is infallible. “I can understand the government’s reluctance, but to be perfectly honest they have got very little choice.“The wider [longevity risk] is spread the easier it is to bear. I don’t think they can escape this.”

694;STT;State Street Corp;2006-10-12T17:14:38Z;Hedge funds: New message – be seen to be responsible;;If the hedge fund industry did not already feel under enough scrutiny from regulators, politicians, investors and media, ratings agencies have just racheted up the pressure a notch.With S&P and Moody’s announcing their intention to rate hedge funds on how well they deal with risk, there is now greater urgency to look and behave like responsible guardians of assets.Of course, many hedge funds are exactly that, but now they must prove it. This gives service providers a big opportunity to act as long-term strategic partners to large hedge fund groups.Large global service providers such as State Street and Citigroup believe they can give added credibility in the eyes of ratings agencies and investors. Richard Ernesti, global head of Citigroup’s alternative investment product sales, says: “It is more than just compliance – it becomes a marketing issue. If you go to a big institutional client, it can only help if you can say ‘we are a hedge fund and manage money well but everything else is done by Citigroup, because they are experts in servicing’.“We provide transparency to the client and the client’s clients, and transparency helps sell portfolios.”Some hedge funds have yet to realise how fast the industry is maturing and the demands they face. Moderately successful managers can raise $1bn without breaking sweat, but with it comes responsibility for managing the assets of pension scheme members and charities.The growth of the industry is phenomenal, says Gary Enos, head of alternative investment servicing at State Street. “Four years ago, 100 per cent of our business was single strategy hedge funds. With the growth of funds of hedge funds and multi-strategy funds, that’s now only 25-35 per cent.“Whereas we serviced over 100 managers in 2002 with $35bn in assets, now we service 79 with $175bn in assets.”And with size comes sophistication, as hedge funds seek more exotic assets and strategies to replace strategies whose returns have waned amid stronger competition.This puts pressure on service providers to employ staff who understand the instruments and the strategies. “When you get involved with fixed income, derivatives, distressed debt and such, you cannot just pull market prices off exchanges,” says Mr Enos. “You need CFAs (Chartered Financial Analysts) to produce financial models that can give proper valuations.”Citigroup says it may outsource valuation work in the case of very hard to value instruments. “We have very stringent procedures and we do employ outside pricing agencies,” says Mr Ernesti.And sophistication does not just relate to investment techniques. Citigroup says the emergence of multi-strategy funds means that some hedge funds use a variety of prime brokers, and this can be difficult to track. “You would want to control the flow of information between your prime brokers,” says Mr Ernesti. “Hedge funds that operate across borders particularly need a partner that can reconcile all the positions across all the strategies and geographies.”Citigroup is also working on a solution for the thorny problem of trying to automate subscriptions and redemptions. The process is currently predominantly manual even though investors may have to tackle a 35-page document with 150 areas to fill in. Any service provider with a perfect automated system would surely be welcomed by most hedge funds.Technology is, of course, key to success in asset servicing. The bigger providers believe they have the edge here. “As a hedge fund, you need a strategic partner that can invest in new technology,” says Mr Ernesti. “This is a problem for niche providers. If you are a growing business you want a provider with deep pockets that can grow with you.”No provider could survive without an online service. Citigroup has developed Hedgelink, which provides transparency to both hedge funds and their clients. Through it, hedge funds can provide statements, performance data, updates to the prospective and a whole range of investment tools that can benchmark portfolios to indices and compare them to historical data.While the outsourcing of fast-moving technology may satisfy clients, it also helps to control costs at the hedge fund. “This way, back office costs are no longer fixed,” says Mr Ernesti. “They are variable and change as the fund grows.”This is particularly true of funds of hedge funds, which tend to have less capacity constraints than single strategy funds so have been known to grow with rapidity.“Forty per cent of our book of business is funds of hedge funds,” Mr Ernesti says. “The challenges as they expand are that of many businesses: organisational and operational issues.”Citigroup thinks it can bring to bear its long-held capabilities in traditional asset management, which is a more mature industry, to address these needs.The other big opportunity it sees comes from the explosion of hedge funds outside the US, particularly in Asia. It is no longer good enough to service hedge funds in Singapore and Hong Kong from the US. “You need a fully-fledged Asia office that can offer back and middle office support,” Mr Ernesti says.“Asian firms want to be serviced in their home timezone, not in US Eastern Time.”
695;STT;State Street Corp;2006-10-12T17:14:38Z;Australasia: Sign that consolidation is under way;;"When HSBC bought Westpac’s sub-custody business in Australia and New Zealand for A$150m in July, the deal shed rare light on the often invisible world of asset servicing in the country.While asset servicing and global custody might not get much regular publicity, it is a highly competitive segment of the Australian market. It is evolving rapidly due to technology and the increasing complexity of a market which sees inflows of A$1bn every week through the country’s compulsory savings regime.For HSBC, the deal took its assets under administration in Australia from barely A$10bn to more than A$230bn. In strategic terms, it helped the bank scale up to the leading position in the sub-custody business it holds in the rest of the Asia-Pacific, and gave it the ability to offer a genuine regional service to its clients, many of whom were using HSBC in Asia and Westpac in Australasia.“That deal was probably the first sign in a long time that consolidation is happening in Australia,” says Wayne Francis, Citigroup’s vice-president and securities country manager for the bank’s Global Transaction Services.“It was also indicative that it is the global players who are going to be looking at acquisitions of the locals, and it was the first sign of that happening.”A look at statistics published by the Australian Custodial Services Association reveals that foreign banks are already active in the market.Citigroup, for example, is a significant player in the more plain vanilla area of domestic custody and clearing, with A$110bn in assets under administration as at the end of 2005. Other main players in that space are the local NAB, with A$242bn under administration, and JPMorgan with A$220bn.The momentum, according to Mr Francis, is clearly with the global banks who are able to both leverage their technology investments and use their reach to service the needs of clients whose businesses are also increasingly global. “The thing we’ve found is that this is an economy of scale game,” he says.“Multinationals are forcing out the local players because it really is a continual search for better technology. It is all about straight through processing and automating processes to eliminate all those historical troublemakers like the need to send faxes, so that the information is as instant as it can be.”Citigroup entered the Australian custody market in 1985 but has really only focused on ramping up this side of its business over the last five years.It boasts Australia’s largest fund manager – Colonial First State – among its clients but is also moving up the value chain by adding another service – third party clearing for offshore clients.Recent regulatory changes have changed the rule that only brokers with a bricks and mortar presence in Australia can participate on the Australian Stock Exchange, and Citigroup is taking advantage of that by clearing for Lehman Brothers, which trades out of its Japan office but is now in the ASX top 20 rankings by
volume.Another foreign player with a strong presence in the asset servicing market is State Street, which – along with BNP Paribas, JP Morgan and the NAB – is active as a master custody administrator, providing middle and back office services such as unit pricing and compliance monitoring for investment managers, including many large pension funds. State Street has more than A$225bn under administration in this market segment, but outsources its domestic custody requirements.State Street’s Australian managing director, David Travers, says the ever- increasing scale of the Australian pension funds and their diversification into asset classes such as hedge funds and private equity, requires an outsource provider who is able to deliver on technology, and continually invest in their solutions. “I think the power of the State Street model in this market is that we are able to wrap technology together and give our customers one view across all of their asset classes,” says Mr Travers.“That’s something that does differentiate us, whereas a lot of our competitors use packaged products that are different locally to globally.”State Street, for example, is considering rolling out its Private Edge private equity platform into Australia, and recently sent an executive from the head office in Boston to talk to Australian investors about their appetite for such a service, and their requirements.“We are trying to push ourselves further up the value curve and more and more into the back offices of our customers so they can focus on their core business areas, such as portfolio management and product development,” says Mr Travers.“You have managers who are entering the market and they don’t want to establish big infrastructures, they are looking for a full solution or a turnkey solution from a custodian such as ourselves.“There’s also been quite a bit of merger and acquisition activity so you have many larger firms which have purchased and tried to integrate different systems, and for them it also makes sense to use an outsource partner.”Mr Travers says State Street’s goal is to become the number one master custodian provider in Australia, a position it held until the early part of this decade. To achieve that ambition, he agrees that the company will need to look at acquisitions.“Any consolidation that happens in the market, State Street will be looking to be part of it,” he says.“Around 80 per cent of our global revenues come from these type of investment services, and that is a lot more than some of our competitors.”"
696;STT;State Street Corp;2006-10-12T17:14:37Z;Consolidation: US players overtaken by resilient region;;"When the major US players took over the vast bulk of the global custody business in the UK in the 1990s, many industry observers assumed that it would be only a matter of time before they rolled up the map of continental Europe in the same studied manner. The truth is, though, that no large-scale acquisition has taken place since State Street relieved Deutsche Bank of its global custody operations in late 2002.One interesting quirk demonstrates a certain resilience in continental Europe that was not shown by their UK counterparts. “If you look at the top 10 players 10 years ago, there was not a single European global custodian amongst them,” observes Sebastien Danloy, global head of sales for investor services at Société Générale Securities Services. “Today, there are four: UBS, HSBC, BNP Paribas, and Société Générale.”Société Générale argues strongly that its own recent acquisition of the Italian custody operations of UniCredit Group demonstrate its growing credentials as a force to be reckoned with in international securities services. “This purchase means we are now a top three player in three European markets,” says Mr Danloy.The €548m acquisition of the custody and fund administration of the entity known as 2S Banca, forms a central plank of the strategic plans to transform SGSS into a major pan-European custodian.2S Banca is the second-largest custodian in Italy with more than €455bn in assets under custody and nearly €80bn in funds under administration, and offers opportunities for further significant growth, says SGSS.The brisk demand for 2S Banca is interpreted by some in the industry as evidence of a renewed interest in an industry that has long been regarded as moribund, and the scarcity value of such businesses becoming available to purchase. “Custody remains one of the only links that some banks have to financial institutions, which helps explain why many have not gone down the route of selling their custody operations,” says Mr Danloy.“A further consideration is that custody delivers a stream of recurring fee income revenue, a welcome addition to transactional revenue flows.” He insists, though, that despite the excess of demand over supply, SGSS did not overpay. “The price was right, and if the right opportunities arise, we will acquire more,” he says. “This is not a one-off. It is our first, but will not be our last. We have positioned ourselves to be one of the consolidators in the European market place.”Acquisitions are one obvious way of consolidating, but in the current market they are few and far between. However, a good deal of what might be described as disguised consolidation is taking place.Established in 1998, ABN Amro Mellon Global Securities Services is one of the longest standing joint ventures in European securities services. It has to be acknowledged as unusually successful by comparison with the normal fate of joint ventures, which have a propensity to fizzle out as the years pass, and questions of governance and strategic drift bring their original
raison d’ être into question.“Our model was initially viewed with scepticism but it has stood the test of time,” says Nadine Chakar, chief executive of ABN Amro
Mellon. “And nobody’s been able to follow us. Joint ventures can be challenging, but equally the benefits are immense. We have proved that you don’t need to own the cow to drink the milk, as they say in the Netherlands.”The most immediate example of a joint venture reaching the end of its natural life saw Allied Irish Banks (AIB) agree to sell its 50 per cent stake in AIB/BNY Securities Services (Ireland) Ltd to Bank of New York at the end of August. AIB/BNY Securities Services (Ireland) Ltd was established in 1995 as a joint venture between AIB and Bank of New York to provide services for a number of fund structures domiciled in Ireland.“Having reached significant scale it was natural for both parties to strategically review the partnership and decide how best to continue and develop the business,” says Mon O’Driscoll, head of investment banking at AIB Capital Markets.By contrast, RBC Dexia Investor Services, one of the most recent new creations in the industry created by fusion between Royal Bank of Canada and Luxembourg’s Dexia, has confidently started life as a single global unit.But it already has its critics, who pose questions about complementary strengths and overlaps. “Are there too many cooks in the kitchen there?” asks one rival. Rob Wright, chief operating officer at the new firm, rebuts the criticisms strongly. “We are a good match, of a similar size, with a shared vision, and are headed in the right direction. Others could well follow.”"
697;STT;State Street Corp;2006-09-22T15:51:37Z;Active ETFs: Is Wall Street about to get active?;;"The trend in exchange-traded funds is: the more specialised the better. Almost every week flashy new products arrive that slice the stock market more thinly, divide the globe more narrowly and give investors an opportunity to back those hard-to-access asset classes. They are designed to track indices that only came into existence to allow someone to launch an ETF.With ETFs – baskets of securities that are designed to track indices and trade like stocks – investors can make size, style, sector and even sub-sector bets; they can also take regional and country tilts and in some cases can make leveraged investments and take short positions. It is only natural, therefore, that the latest buzz surrounding ETFs is about the launch of a first official actively managed fund.But for all the chatter, it has not happened yet, and it is not entirely clear when
it will. “Active ETFs have been a year away for years,” says David Haywood, director of alternative investment res­earch at Financial Res­earch (FRC), the Boston-based data company. “There is a lot going on and with all of the new entrants to market, one of them could get it done. But I honestly could not predict when an active ETF will make it to market.”ETFs – first introduced by State Street in 1993 – have skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. Today, assets in ETFs total more than $336.9bn compared with $71bn in 2000. And just in the past year, there has been a significant rise in the number of ETFs, according to the Investment Company Institute, the industry body. As of July 2006, there were 268 ETFs, whereas in July 2005 there were 171 – a 57 per cent increase. In June alone there were 42 new ETF launches. To put that in perspective, the total number of ETF launches in 1996 was 17.While many of these newly launched ETFs use indices that incorporate alternative weighting and quantitative strategies, none are technically considered actively managed. “People are just trying to do something that’s a little different,” says Dan Dolan, director of wealth management strategies for the Sector SPDRs Trust, which is managed by State Street. “There are only so many recognisable indices and once they’re taken, you’ve got to put a new spin on what you’re doing, you’ve to distinguish yourself from the competition.”The result, arguably, is needless complexity and confusion. William Breen, a finance professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, says the field has been so complex that investors need to look at the contents of the funds, not just their label. For example, the difference in annual returns over the past five years of two ETFs tracking US small companies is 6 percentage points a year – and the better-performing fund has done it with only 70 per cent of the volatility. So, which index you chase can make a big difference.Many ETFs are not as diversified as they seem, he says. “You can take too much specific risk by investing in concentrated indices. If you look at iShares’ Spain fund, 49 per cent of the portfolio is in the top three stocks.”In sectoral ETFs, he says, it is not uncommon for the largest holding to account for more than 20 per cent of the fund. On these arguments, ETFs do not offer quite the passive diversification that many of their investors are looking for, and so launching an active ETF might make sense.The biggest obstacle to active management in the ETF business is the trans­parency problem. At the moment, the Securities and Exchange Commission stipulates that ETFs must disclose their holdings on a daily basis, whereas traditional mutual funds are required to disclose their holdings every six months. This is not a problem for someone tracking an index. They are not buying and selling very often, and everyone in the market already knows the constituents of the index.Active managers, however, do not want to reveal their holdings for fear of being front run by the market. The big concern is that observant hedge funds would notice when an ETF buys a particular stock and then start buying that stock on the basis that the ETF will continue to add the stock to its portfolio. This would in turn drive up the price the ETF pays.The current disclosure rules would also enable rivals to easily copy each other’s trading strategies, says Brad Pope, director of strategy for Barclays Global Investors’ iShares. “Transparency has two main benefits: one is that on any given day investors know exactly what’s held in the portfolio and therefore have a better understanding of what they can expect; and two, it enables the market maker to better trade the product,” he says.These concerns over transparency represent a huge hurdle for fund companies who may be considering introducing active management. In other words, while there is a big competitive advantage to being first to market with a standard index fund – because of both the pent-up demand and the fact that there are very few ways to differentiate index funds – there will be a penalty for being first with active management.“There is steep cost to being the first,” says Noel Archard, head of ETF product management at Vanguard. “From an operational point of view there is the question of how we satisfy the trading community’s needs for full transparency but also protect the shareholders. It means a lot of time and money spent to make the regulatory bodies comfortable.”So far these hassles have been too great to overcome, which is why fund companies appear to be waiting for someone else to make the first move. Once that happens, others will probably follow. “Right now you have people poised in the wings waiting to see how that first one out of the gate goes,” Mr Archard says.Of course there is another big question surrounding this issue: are actively managed ETFs even necessary?As trading vehicles, ETFs already have some distinct advantages. For instance: unlike mutual funds – which set a price for shares once a day after the market closes – ETFs are priced like stocks and traded throughout the day. This allows investors to dash in and out of the market while also using stop orders – orders to buy or sell when a specified price is reached – and limit orders, to buy or sell a stock at or close to a particular price. Moreover, because ETFs trade like stocks, they can be sold short – meaning investors can bet an index will fall by selling borrowed shares, then buying them back when prices drop.Active management could enhance these features, Mr Archard says. “From a conservative point of view, an active ETF would give you some interesting risk strategies – such as options. If you like a manager, you could go long, but you can also buy a put for when that particular manager’s style happens to fall out of favour. With a bad manager, you could even sell short,” he says.On the other hand, introducing active management could diminish the attributes of ETFs that investors find so appealing, such as their low costs, total transparency and tax efficiency. Dan Culleton, lead ETF analyst at Morningstar, the fund data company, says he is especially concerned that active management would reduce ETFs’ tax advantages. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs do not need to sell their holdings to meet shareholder redemptions, helping to minimise capital gains distributions. “It’s possible that an active fund manager who is picking stocks would incur more turnover and have to realise more capital gains not recognised by ETFs in-kind redemption feature,” he says.Active management could lessen the funds’ cost-effectiveness, too. “Management fees would be the big concern,” says Mr Culleton. “Ostensibly you’re getting the talent of the manager and his or her staff. Everyone thinks they deliver a lot of alpha and so they’re going to charge you what they think they’re worth. Already we’re seeing expense ratios creep up on certain ETFs that have launched recently because they ‘add value’.”Mr Dolan, a self-described ETF purist, says active ETF management would lessen their appeal. “The beauty of the product gets diluted,” he says. “It’s like anything in the financial services world, when a product is popular and it works, the market gets flooded until it stops working. Look at what’s happened to hedge funds.”"
698;STT;State Street Corp;2006-07-24T17:30:40Z;The Short View: ‘Safety first’ for big investors;;Investors showed some signs of recovering their nerve on Monday, helped by takeover activity and hope that the Israel-Lebanon attacks could be resolved without spreading into a wider war. Gold dropped to $606 at one stage and more importantly, oil is now back below $74 a barrel from the $78 it reached earlier this month.Relief at the oil price decline undoubtedly helped European equity markets to enjoy a solid session while Wall Street opened in positive mood.But this rally may not last: sentiment is clearly fragile. Ian Scott of Lehman Brothers points out that US mutual fund investors sold a net $800m in international equity funds last week. Past periods when investors have repatriated funds have tended to coincide with market crises such as Black Monday in 1987, the first Gulf War and the Russian crisis of 1998. They have tended to represent buying opportunities for equity investors, with an average subsequent 12-month gain of 19.3 per cent.State Street, which through its custody arm sees a lot of institutional fund flows, argues that big investors are in “safety first” mode, with a reduced attitude to risk. They have not reached the “riot point” stage, where there is a wholesale retrenchment of portfolios and a flight from equities.Perhaps it is difficult for the markets to establish a decisive trend because investors are being presented with two contrasting pools of information. On the one hand, central banks in the US, eurozone and Japan are all raising interest rates leading to understandable worries about a “liquidity squeeze”, which geopolitical concerns have exacerbated.On the other hand, the news from the corporate sector is still very good. According to Citigroup, as of July 20, US second quarter results had beaten expectations by a weighted average of 4.6 percentage points and were 14.9 per cent up on a year ago.Sentiment may only tip decisively in one direction or the other if either the peak in interest rates is clearly in sight (hence last week’s rally on Bernanke’s perceived dovishness) or if profit estimates start to be revised significantly lower.philip.coggan@ft.com
699;STT;State Street Corp;2006-06-26T16:23:09Z;Imagination is the only limit;;"Want to make a bet on silver? How about aerospace? Or perhaps you fancy alternative weighting techniques? With nearly 200 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the market holding about $341bn in assets, almost anything is possible.And the possibilities are multiplying. Even investors who consider themselves au courant with all the latest hot products, can find it tough to keep tabs on exchange-traded funds. The number of ETFs – baskets of securities designed to track indices and trade like stocks – is rocketing as each week newer, zippier products come to market.According to Financial Research Corporation (FRC), the Boston-based data
company, 65 ETFs have launched already this year and 52 launched last year. To put that in perspective, the number of ETF launches in 1996 was 17.According to Dan Dolan, director of wealth management strategies for the Sector SPDRs Trust which is managed by State Street: “In the beginning ETFs were positioned as an alternative to mutual funds, but a current trend is using an ETF as a pure stock substitute, eliminating single stock risk.“In other words: why just buy Exxon, when I could invest in an ETF of oil and gas producers and spread the risk?” Mr Dolan points out.Dan Culleton, lead ETF analyst at fund data company Morningstar, says: “There is a frenzied pace of growth because ETFs are the fastest growing niche of the mutual fund market, which is a very mature market. Providers want to get in on the action and solidify their position. There is also a rising interest in delivering new ways to access alter­native asset classes.”As ETF providers explore initiatives for the second half of the year and beyond, investors should expect a run of new products. “The trend is to get more specific, more narrow and more esoteric,” says Mr Culleton. “The types of products being offered are limited only by the provider’s imagination.”Barclays Global Investors – the biggest ETF provider in the US – plans to introduce several products that cover hard-to-access asset classes, such as commodities and fixed income. BGI is the only ETF provider to offer fixed income funds, although the Vanguard Group also has a fixed income ETF in the works.“If you are a financial adviser who likes to use ETFs because of their flex­ibility, missing out on fixed income is a big problem,” says Tom Taggart, a managing director at BGI. “It is an asset class of great interest to financial advisors, and that is our sweet spot.”In addition, he says, Barclays is focused on expanding its commodities line; iShares already offers a gold ETF and recently launched a silver trust. Mr Taggart says BGI has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission for several new commodity-based ETFs, which should begin trading by the end of the year.Vanguard says that in addition to new fixed income funds it is considering introducing new international funds. Vanguard offers several international ETFs, including European, Pacific and emerging markets. “There is continued demand at the regional level, rather than just individual countries,” says Noel Archard, head of ETF product management at Vanguard.Providers are also increasing sector and sub-sector lines. The first ETFs mimicked big stock indices such as the Standard & Poor’s 500, and ETFs based on the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000 continue to be the most heavily traded stocks each day in the entire US stock market. These were similar to traditional index funds but had lower fees and were more tax efficient. As they grew in popularity providers started expanding beyond indices to narrower segments of the market, giving investors ways of backing sectors, geographic regions or currencies.Mr Dolan of State Street says investors should expect to see “a greater number of sector products that thinly slice industries”.State Street has filed for 17 new ETFs that specialise in such industries as aerospace, leisure, computer software, computer hardware, and healthcare equipment.State Street is not the only ETF provider introducing sector products. First Trust Advisors last week launched the Dow Jones Internet Index, which tracks 40 of the largest and most actively traded US-based internet companies. The index, which was launched at the height of the dotcom bubble in February 1999, is designed to measure companies whose primary business generates at least 50 per cent of its revenues from the internet.Other ETF providers are coming out with indices that incorporate alternative weighting and quantitative strategies. Earlier this month WisdomTree introduced 20 ETFs that track dividend indices – 18 of these US and international indices are weighted based on the total cash dividends comp­anies pay; two are based on dividend yield.PowerShares, meanwhile, plans to introduce at least 31 ETFs this year – 10 of which are based on the “fundamental indexing” methodology of Robert Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates. One of these will weight mid- and small-cap stocks based on revenues, book value, cash flow, and dividends instead of by market capitalisation. The other funds will apply the same weighting scheme to stocks in sectors including basic materials, industrials, consumer goods and financials.Like the WisdomTree funds, they are based on the theory that orthodox indices geared to market capitalisation are automatically biased in favour of over-valued stocks. “PowerShares is based on indices that have intelligent design,” says Bruce Bond, president and CEO of the company, which currently has 37 ETFs on the market but is still a relatively small player in the industry. “The reason we are introducing these funds is to provide a better weighting structure rather than just market capitalisation which has a growth bias.”Some future ETFs will also use sophisticated trading techniques. Both ProFund Advisors and Rydex Investments – two money managers that have already carved out a niche in the fund management industry – plan to launch leveraged ETFs. While these funds are predominantly aimed at hedge funds and big institutions, they will enable bullish retail investors to make big bets on traditional stock indices while allowing bearish investors to make money during market downturns.Industry experts are divided over how much longer this product innovation will continue. David Haywood, director of alternative investment research at FRC believes the market is close to saturation. “We are quickly reaching the point where we’re over-ETFed,” he says. “You can only slice and dice these indices so many ways.”But Avi Nachmany, director of Strategic Insight, an asset management research company, expects innovation to continue for some time. The reason, he says, is that buyers of ETFs are not typical mutual fund investors. “It is relatively simple: they are not people who are buying and holding for a long time, they are not people who are saving for retirement.”He believes ETFs are targeted at a very different market: “One third or more of ETF buyers are institutional investors including hedge funds. And the vast majority of the remaining two-thirds are individual owners through high-end advisors and brokers. ETFs are becoming accepted and convenient trading vehicles. ETF innovation is allowing them new ways to be successful.”Mr Dolan of Sector SPDRs says that only when these new ETFs cease to be successful will innovation abate. “When you have a fund strategy that does well, 15 more follow it, and then it doesn’t work any more,” says Mr Dolan. “The ETF business is in still early in terms of its asset growth. But most of the big products are already out there, what we are seeing now is more marginal. A lot of what you are seeing now is an attempt to penetrate the retail market.”"
700;STT;State Street Corp;2006-06-19T18:34:25Z;Inexorable rise of the EquiLend platform;;On a warm early summer evening in 2001, Goldman Sachs hosted a lavish party at the Villa Medici, set high in the hills above Rome.Some of the biggest participants in the $1,000bn global securities lending business were in attendance. Huddled on one of the villa’s many balconies, executives could be overheard speaking about something called Hubco.It has turned out that Hubco was the working name for a company now known as EquiLend, an industry-owned platform for electronic securities lending and borrowing. Since its 2002 launch, EquiLend has grown so explosively that it now facilitates $20bn of securities lending and borrowing trades in a single day.Though little understood, securities lending has become an important tool for large institutional money managers and pension funds to improve returns, and they have a willing borrowing market in the form of investment banks and hedge funds.A measure of the growth is that on a typical day during its first year in operation, EquiLend would process 3,600 transactions, representing securities valued at $2.2bn. Growth has not slackened.Brian Lamb, chief executive of EquiLend, says that since this time last year alone, the client base has increased 70 per cent.“That increase in clients has resulted in daily values of all trades executed through the platform growing 67 per cent since the same period last year,” he says. “In fixed income alone, the numbers have increased 80 per cent.”Talk at the three-day conference, the end of which was marked by the Goldman party, focused on the pressing need for automation of the securities lending and borrowing business (known collectively as securities financing), which had been a slower adopter of technology than many other areas.As a result, a range of software and so-called electronic solutions providers went to Rome in 2001 touting their wares and seeking to make quick money.Senior figures from some of the largest broker dealers and custodian banks in the business decided this was not to be tolerated. Rather than line the pockets of opportunists, they agreed, they needed to club together to form their own electronic platform, having agreed that automation was unavoidable in the long run.That turned into EquiLend, unveiled as an industry-owned platform soon after the conference.It was set up by 10 of the largest companies involved in the securities financing business, lenders and borrowers. They invested $4m for the pleasure of being at the top table.The founding companies were Barclays Global Investors, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Northern Trust, State Street and UBS.Credit Suisse and Nomura have since invested. Barclays Capital, ABN Amro, Mellon and Société Générale have come on board as new clients.“There are a number of reasons why a firm would want to use EquiLend,” said Eugene Picone, EquiLend’s chairman and also a senior vice-president at JPMorgan. “From our perspective, we see the value in the overall economies of scale that we have been able to extract from the system. In the past year we have increased balances by over 100 per cent and enjoyed a 20 per cent improvement in our cost-efficiency ratio.”Earlier this year the securities lending conference returned to Rome, with EquiLend’s place at the heart of the securities financing business looking assured.Securities financing plays a vital role. The basic securities lending transaction involves the temporary transfer of a security by its owner to another investor or intermediary. Once the securities have settled, the title and voting rights are transferred to the borrower, who can sell or re-lend the borrowed securities during the life of the loan. The borrower agrees to return the loaned securities, secure the loan with collateral of equal or greater value than the loaned securities, pay user fees, and remit to the lender dividends, coupon interest or other distributions that occur during the time the securities are on loan.Borrowers tend to be investment banks, broker-dealers, intermediaries and, increasingly, hedge funds.Lenders, with equities or fixed income securities available for loan, will commonly participate in one of two ways, either directly or indirectly through an agent.Large institutional investors such as pension plans, insurance and life companies are the most willing to lend. It is a simple and safe way to bolster returns they are generating from assets held for the long term.Many pension funds, particularly in Europe, had resisted securities lending, due primarily to a lack of understanding, but that seems to be changing. The big global custodian banks such as State Street and Northern Trust are now more proactive with their clients’ money and are persuading more to take part.
701;STT;State Street Corp;2006-06-12T20:21:30Z;Pan Asia fund fails to excite investors;;The Pan Asia Bond Index Fund, the first exchange-traded bond fund in Asia, has generated scant interest from investors in the past year, despite its heavyweight backers, namely the Asian Development Bank and the region’s central banks.According to the fund’s manager, State Street Global Advisers, the size of PAIF has only grown from the initial $1bn — contributed to by the 11 members of the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) — to around $1.2bn since it was launched in July last year.“We are a bit disappointed that the fund has not attracted as many investors as we hoped,” said Ramon Maronilla, portfolio manager.“The main reasons have been high energy prices, which may see growth slow down globally, and rising US interest rates. Many Asian central banks continue to mirror the Fed’s moves.”The cool reception to the fund is a blow to the Asian Bond Fund, an initiative which includes PAIF, and its aspiration to encourage issuance and participation in Asia’s debt capital market, which has lagged growth in other emerging markets.Listed in Hong Kong, PAIF invests in domestic currency sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds in Hong Kong, mainland China, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.It has been billed as a one-stop shop for gaining access to a basket of local currency Asian bonds.Its founders had hoped that a yield of around 4 per cent and a low $1,000 price of entry would lure investors.Judging by their limited interest, however, investors will require more persuasion.The Asian debt market has failed to shine since the 1997/98 financial crisis, which prompted a new era of fiscal prudence.Supply has been limited and yields have gone down, partly because of the global phenomenon of a flattened yield curve and because Asian issuers have in recent years cleaned up their balance sheets, improving their credit ratings in the process.Regulations have also made it a less than friendly market, with many countries in the region maintaining withholding taxes until recently.China’s currency restriction has also meant that for foreign investors, the country which is the main growth driver in the region is absent from the local currency bond market.“Our job as the fund’s manager is to educate the market about this particular asset class, and we take the medium to long term approach to gauging PAIF’s success,” Mr Maronilla said.
702;STT;State Street Corp;2006-06-09T17:37:05Z;Central banks burnish Street cred;;"An interest rate rise in the eurozone and endless discussion of the likelihood and timing of increases in Japan and the US gave markets plenty to focus on this week.It wasn’t just the majors that were dominated by rate rise news; Denmark, India, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey and Thailand all lifted key lending rates this week too, and some were unexpected.“One thing they all had in common was inflation concerns based on rising oil prices,” noted Carlin Doyle, strategist at State Street. “What is more remarkable is that for [some of them], inflation is benign which suggests that central banks were more concerned about their inflation-busting credibility than actual domestic price pressures.”In the event, the European Central Bank’s quarter-point raise to 2.75 per cent had been priced in by the market, and yields in that region ended the week little changed. Some investors had worried that the ECB would go for a steeper, 50 basis point hike, so were relieved at the more careful pace.On Friday, German two-year notes yielded 3.35 per cent from 3.33 per cent at the start of the week. Ten-year Bund yields were steady at 3.93 per cent.Gilts largely tracked their cross-channel counterparts. The Bank of England kept rates on hold at 4.5 per cent as expected, and two-year yields were at 4.66 per cent from 4.68 per cent while 10-year yields slipped to 4.56 from 4.58 per cent.In the US, hawkish comments on Monday from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, served to solidify expectations of a quarter-point rise to 5.25 per cent later this month and to invert the Treasury yield curve.Inversion implies the market is betting on an economic slowdown and lower interest rates, since long-term bonds should yield more to compensate for the extra risk.On Friday, two-year notes yielded 5.02 per cent from 4.92 per cent on Monday. Ten-year yields, at 4.985 per cent, were down 2bp from Monday levels, inverting the spread, or difference, between the two and triggering talk of a further inversion.Japanese government bonds ended the week higher, helped by a flight from volatile stocks into the traditional safe haven of bonds and bets that the recent weakness in shares might delay the Bank of Japan’s first rate rise.Ten-year yields were at 1.85 per cent from 1.86 per cent while two-year yields fell to 0.73 per cent from 0.81 per cent."
703;STT;State Street Corp;2006-03-22T19:00:43Z;Increased volume of long-dated debt fails to reassure;;The issuance of long-dated and index-linked gilts would be stepped up, the government promised on Wednesday, but the pledge did little to relieve concerns about the severe shortage of such bonds facing UK pension funds.Members of the pensions industry have urged the government to increase sharply the amount of these bonds to enable them to match their liabilities – or payments to current and future pensioners – to the assets they hold.Pension fund demand has helped to create distortions in the gilt market by driving prices on long-dated and index-linked gilts higher – and yields down to levels not seen for at least 40 years.Wednesday’s announcement from the Debt Management Office detailing the gilt programme for the coming year was one of the most anticipated UK market events in recent memory.The market experienced a rollercoaster ride as investors digested the news on supply. Prices on long-dated gilts initially fell after Gordon Brown said during his speech that the “issue of long dated gilts will increase from just under a half, to just under two thirds of issuance.”But the DMO’s remit showed that overall issuance of gilts in 2006/7 would be £63bn, compared with £52.3bn in the current year, and prices later rallied.The DMO promised at least one auction a month of long-dated index-linked bonds among the 16 index-linked auctions during the next financial year. There will also be at least nine auctions of long-maturity conventional gilts maturing in 15 years or more. The DMO has kept flexibility to sell in supplementary auctions about £2.5bn every quarter in maturities that respond to changing market conditions.The promised amount of index-linked issuance of £16bn was below market expectations, though it is higher than the current year’s £10.8bn. Nick Horsfall, senior investment consultant at Watson Wyatt, the pensions consultant, said the £16bn was “insufficient to meet the structural demand of pension funds wishing to manage their risk through moves into high quality index linked assets.”Robert Stheeman, chief executive of the Debt Management Office, said: “We are not blind to the needs of the pension funds, but there is a limit to how far we can go.”Mike Amey, portfolio manager at Pimco Europe, said there were constraints on what the DMO could do. “Their job is not to solve the pensions problem,” he said. “Their job is to keep a liquid gilt market and to fund the government debt as effectively as possible.”David Scammell, director of fixed income at Schroders, said the DMO’s plan for supplementary auctions meant that, as long as demand remained high, more long-dated conventional and index-linked gilts would be issued.But Andrew Roberts, a strategist at Merrill Lynch, said: “I’m absolutely flabbergasted . . . They had an opportunity to do something aggressive in long and index-linked issuance. But this is just tinkering at the edges.”Marc Ostwald, analyst at Monument Securities, said the increase in issuance was still “a drop in the ocean” relative to the potential demand by pension funds.Denis Gould, UK head of fixed income at AXA Investment Managers, said the guaranteed amount of long-dated bond supply was less than expected but the regular supply of long-dated conventional and index-linked bonds suggested that market squeezes, such as the one that occurred in January, would be unlikely to occur.Some investment managers said pension funds were finding other way to hedge their inflation risks, to some extent easing pressure on the index-linked gilts market. Joe Moody, head of liability-driven investing at State Street Global Advisors, said some pension funds were saving money by buying inflation swaps directly from companies that have inflation-linked revenues, instead of index linked bonds.Despite the chancellor’s comments, the proportion of all conventional gilts carrying long maturities will decline over the coming year. This is because the single largest issue in the market, maturing in 2021 and carrying a market value of some £25bn, becomes a medium-dated gilt of less than 15 years maturity.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
705;STT;State Street Corp;2006-03-06T18:15:34Z;Stronger global growth unnerves bond markets;;A new round of bid activity on both sides of the Atlantic underpinned equity markets on Monday, but bond markets continued to be unnerved by signs of stronger global growth and speculation about higher interest rates.The yield on 10 year Treasuries rose above 4.7 per cent, breaking above the top of its recent trading range and taking it back to levels last seen in June 2004 when the Federal Reserve first began to lift US short-term interest rates.It was the fourth successive session that Treasury yields have risen, and it reflected growing confidence about the strength of the US economy and the possibility of a large rise in US employment this Friday.At the same time, there was continued speculation about whether the Bank of Japan would later this week start ending its five-year policy of quantitative easing after data showed that the country was continuing its economic recovery and emerging from deflation. Quantitative easing has involved flooding the Japanese banking system with liquidity at a time when the country’s interest rates have been virtually zero.Christopher Probyn, chief economist at State Street Global Advisors, said bond markets were anticipating a shift in BoJ policy and further tightening by the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve, and the same forces had been buoying up the euro and yen relative to the dollar.The timing of any moves in Japan remains uncertain, given the political pressure on the BoJ not to move too fast and risk choking off the country’s nascent economic revival. Junichiro Koizumi, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday urged caution on the BoJ, which led to a weakening of the yen against the dollar.In equity markets, the main features were AT&T’s $67bn move to buy BellSouth Corp and confirmation that Linde, of Germany, had agreed to purchase BOC, of the UK, for $14bn. There were also record profits from HSBC, the UK bank.This underpinned European equity markets where the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.6 per cent to 1,350.15. In London the FTSE 100 closed at its highest level since June 2001.On Wall Street, the mood was more subdued. At mid-session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1 per cent at 11,015.0 while the S&P 500 lost 0.2 per cent at 1,284.4 and the Nasdaq Composite was almost unchanged at 2,303.8.Japanese equities rose 1.5 per cent, the first rise for the Nikkei 225 in four sessions. The Indian stock market hit a new record high, as Reliance Communications made an $8bn market debut.There were several warnings that markets might be near to peaking.Jonathan Wilmot, chief global strategist at Credit Suisse, said: “Investor sentiment doesn’t feel exactly euphoric these days, at least compared to the peak of the tech bubble.“But it does feel pretty complacent, perhaps even smug. This usually means that someone, somewhere is about to lose a lot of money.”He added: “We still think the most likely catalyst for an outburst of volatility is a growing perception that global growth is too strong, rather than the opposite.”Angus Campbell, head of sales and market strategist at Finspreads, in London, said: “March has often marked a turning point for indices and since we’ve been struggling to mark new highs, many traders are positioning themselves for lower prices.”Oil prices fell after indications from members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in Vienna this week, that there would be no cuts in production.
706;STT;State Street Corp;2006-02-22T17:50:04Z;The Short View: Not too bullish, nor too bearish;;"How confident are investors at the moment? There is no shortage of indicators to help us out.The State Street Investor Confidence index fell to its lowest level this month. This sounds pretty serious – until one notes that the index was launched only in September 2003, not long after the start of the substantial rally in stock markets.State Street’s index has the merit of judging the state of confidence by investors’ actions, not their words. The recent fall is because of equity sales by US-based investors. Since equities are a risky asset, share sales are deemed as a sign of lower confidence.But if one looks at Merrill Lynch’s investor confidence survey, it finds the most widespread overweighting of equities by asset allocators in the survey’s history (since April 2001). Even here, the signs are not all one way: institutions have also been increasing their cash weightings.UBS’s risk index also looks at market movements, rather than opinions, to judge sentiment. It finds sentiment broadly neutral; credit spreads are tight and financial stocks are outperforming utilities (both positive signs), but equity market volatility is increasing (a negative signal).The Yale School of Management Stock Market Confidence Indices, which look solely at sentiment, show 77 per cent of institutions expect the market to rise over the next 12 months. This is lower than 2002 and 2003 but higher than for the first six years of the survey, from 1989 to 1995.So what emerges from this rather confused picture? Alas, there are no easy calls for contrarians to make; investors are neither overwhelmingly bullish nor bearish. David Bowers, the Merrill Lynch strategist, thinks investors started the year in very bullish mood, believing the US Federal Reserve would soon stop raising interest rates, but now realise a pause for breath might be needed after such a sharp rally.A more general point is that risk indicators may now be distorted. Low real yields on index-linked bonds may just be a sign of pension fund demand, not investor euphoria. And gold may no longer be a haven, simply a momentum play in a volatile commodities market.philip.coggan@ft.com"
707;STT;State Street Corp;2006-01-30T15:12:56Z;HMV shares soar after Permira approach;;Shares in HMV opened sharply higher on Monday in after the troubled UK music and books retailer received a takeover approach from Permira, the private equity group.HMV confirmed newspaper reports of a preliminary offer “which may or may not lead to an offer being made for the Company” but gave no further details of the bid.On Sunday people close to the situation said Permira would be expected to pay at least a 25 per cent premium to HMV’s Friday share closing price of 163¼p, about 205p-210p a share, valuing the company at more than £800m.Following the confirmation HMV shares shot up 25 per cent to a three-month high. By mid-afternoon on Monday the shares were 17.5 per cent higher at 193p.The HMV board is believed to be holding a meeting to consider the offer this week.Earlier this month HMV, which also owns Waterstones, the bookseller, announced that Alan Giles, its chief executive of eight years, was stepping down. The announcement was accompanied by a dramatic profit warning.The company’s profits have been hit by a downturn in consumer spending and a focus on top-line growth at the expense of margins.Sales have also been hurt by digital downloading. Although this only accounts for a small proportion of music and film sales so far, it will take a much greater share as more and more households sign up for broadband internet access.The profit warning prompted analysts to cut 15 to 20 per cent from their full-year forecasts, taking them to about £100m before tax. This compares with last year’s £124m.Since floating in May 2002, HMV’s shares have fallen 7 per cent, underperforming the retail sector by 16 per cent.Several US investors have built up large stakes in HMV including Brandes, the value fund, with 7.3 per cent and State Street Global Advisors with 5.2 per cent.Permira, which is believed to have been looking at HMV for some time, has appointed Merrill Lynch, the investment bank, to advise on the bid.Last year HMV’s 440p-a-share recommended offer for Ottakar’s, the rival book chain, was referred by the Office of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission after a highly public campaign by publishers and authors. The Competition Commission said last week it would report provisional findings into the planned purchase by the end of March. It is not known whether Permira would be interested in proceeding with such an acquisition.Last September HMV warned that underlying sales in the UK had collapsed 9.2 per cent. This sent shockwaves through retail investors who had hitherto seen small ticket items such as CDs and books as being immune from the consumer slowdown.Their view was reinforced by the fact that HMV had been one of the retail winners during 2004’s difficult Christmas.Permira’s current investments include the budget hotel group Travelodge and gym chain Holmes Place.

We were young then and just starting to formulate our opinions of the world.The year 1968 is one that I think is indelibly etched in our memories. I had grown up in Boston, but that year I was a platoon leader in the navy stationed in Texas. I had to mobilise troops to go to places like Memphis – when Martin Luther King was killed – and Chicago, during the riots at the Democratic National Convention. It wasn’t pretty.The violence of 1968 was followed by several economic problems – the oil crisis, rationing. So while my generation has seen some of the biggest booms, we’ve also seen the downside of economics, which is very different from the younger generations.Today we are at the vanguard of a change that has to take place in terms of the world’s retirement philosophy. The world now needs to fund a very large bubble of people and the days of government and business providing 100 per cent of retirement are over. There is going to be more reliance on the individual to fund retirement and the emphasis on investment returns is going to become more acute.There’s going to be a lot of change and I don’t know exactly how it’s going to turn out. We’re going to force some change – just as we did in the 1960s.Generally speaking, most of us 60-year-olds don’t feel as old as we are. We’re healthier, more active and we’ve had more opportunities presented to us than previous generations, plus we’ve had better access to medicine.I am going to keep on working; I don’t think of myself as 60, I think of myself as two 30s.“"
709;STT;State Street Corp;2005-12-05T19:19:39Z;The Short View: Classic conditions for a bull market;;"The Japanese stock market marches remorselessly higher while the yen sinks inexorably lower. On Monday, the Nikkei 225 notched up a five-year high while the yen hit a 32-month low against the dollar and a record low against the euro.The two trends are clearly connected. The yen’s weakness is boosting Japanese exports, and that in turn pushes up industrial production; figures may show the latter reached a record high in November. And the normal worry about an economy with a depreciating currency – inflationary pressures – is actually good news when it comes to Japan.The rest of the economy is duly benefiting. According to State Street Global Markets, the current upturn has seen the sharpest decline in the Japanese unemployment rate since the 1980s. Japanese Retailing stocks have been soaring on the grounds that improved consumer incomes and sentiment will prompt a surge in spending.Just as important, the global growth outlook appears to be solid, as indicated by recent purchasing managers’ surveys and the strength of commodity prices. Bijal Shah and Dhaval Joshi of SG point out that about some 40 per cent of the Japanese market comprises international cyclical stocks, making the Tokyo market a play on the global growth outlook.Furthermore, Japan is still a substantial market in global terms (some 23 per cent of the widely followed MSCI EAFE index) but one that investors in which a market where investors have been underweight in for many years. That may explain the recent rush by foreign investors to get involved.According to State Street, over the 120 days to November 25, institutional flows into the Japanese market were in the top 10 per cent in the nine-year history of its portfolio indicator.The Tokyo stock market thus has the classic conditions for a bull market. Money flows are positive, momentum is strong; and and there is a “story” that investors can believe. This story is one of rejuvenation of the Japanese corporate sector, recovery from the years of deflation and political reform under prime minister Junichiro Koizumi. Those who do not buy the story (such as SG’s Shah and Joshi) tend to believe the market is overvalued and could be undermined by a global growth slowdown in 2006."
710;STT;State Street Corp;2005-10-22T00:53:05Z;‘Sorry’ Robinson in Rentokil retreat;;Sir Gerry Robinson was on Friday forced to give up his attempt to become executive chairman of Rentokil and issued an apology to the company's employees after talks with investors failed. Sir Gerry said: “I am sorry that we have not found the right way forward. This was a genuine attempt to make a change with the existing shareholders staying involved. This has been an unsettling time for employees of Rentokil Initial and I apologise for that.”The former chairman of Granada and star of the TV series I'll Show Them Who's Boss approached the support services company for takeover talks in August but did not explain how he would turn Rentokil round or what performance targets he would use.David Greenall, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, said: “Sir Gerry's credibility is at an all time low. He might as well go back to TV.”Sir Gerry's turnround plan for Rentokil included returning up to £600m to shareholders through a special dividend and gearing up the company.He wanted to install himself as chairman of Rentokil Initial in return for shares worth £76m at current prices, payable to his bid vehicle Raphoe Management, of which he owns 72 per cent. A successful bid would have netted him about £55m.Doug Flynn, chief executive of Rentokil, said: “This has been an expensive exercise that could cost Rentokil up to the thick end of £20m. A lot of work has been done and we have had to prepare all the defence documents. If we could make Sir Gerry pay for all this, believe me we would.”But Mr Greenall said he thought £20m was a ridiculous number plucked from “cloud-cuckoo-land”.“Is this just an excuse to put more costs through the business?” he asked. Last week, Sir Gerry shied away from launching a full bid for Rentokil, deeming it “unnecessary”.He hoped instead that disaffected shareholders would install him as the company's executive chairman.The biggest investor in Rentokil, Franklin Templeton, which owns about 14.7 per cent, was the only shareholder to come out publicly in support of Sir Gerry.Richard Lacaille, European chief investment officer at State Street Global Investors and 10th largest shareholder with 2.6 per cent, said: “I should bloody well hope he has apologised. You can't install somebody when he has nothing to say.“Sir Gerry was talking up the fact that he was going round shareholders but he never came to see us.”Mark Shepperd, analyst at UBS, said: “Sir Gerry seriously misjudged the mood of investors. He needs to choose his targets more carefully. Investors generally don't like this kind of approach.”Other analysts wondered, with amusement, whether Sir Gerry would turn his focus towards Compass, the caterer, which on Friday suspended a senior executive following a United Nations investigation.Shares in Rentokil fell 0.2 per cent to 155p
711;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Workforce: Better educated but lower paid;;"Scotland has delivered the strongest growth in financial services employment of any part of the UK over the past five years: 20,000 jobs, or a 23 per cent increase.Employers talk highly of their Scottish workforces. State Street is one of the large US custody banks that has chosen to offer from Scotland its asset servicing expertise to institutional investors elsewhere.Alasdair Reid, head of State Street’s asset owner group in northern Europe, says: “What attracts us to Edinburgh is the people. Our clients tell us the quality of staff they deal with in Edinburgh is fantastic.”This employer preference is backed up by hard statistics, which show Scottish employees tend to be better educated but lower paid than the UK financial services sector as a whole.Although earnings are higher in financial services than the average for the Scottish economy, official figures show “managers and senior officials” earn an average of £37,000 a year, compared with an average of £44,000 for UK financial services.While the proportion of financial services staff having a degree or higher qualification is similar at Scottish and UK levels, 24.1 per cent and 25.3 per cent respectively, no fewer than 13.4 per cent of the Scottish financial services workforce has a higher education qualification below degree level, compared with just 6.3 per cent for UK financial services overall.The most recent quarterly survey by Scottish Financial Enterprise, the trade body, published in August, found overall respondent companies’ sentiment was more optimistic than in the previous survey, and business prospects were expected to increase for the following 12 months.Overall, respondents expected to see an increase in headcount during the next quarter, with almost 90 per expecting levels to rise or remain steady. However, 67 per cent of banks and building societies expected a decrease in headcount.The most recent annual survey conducted by Joslin Rowe Scotland, the recruitment specialist, and sponsored by SFE and Scottish Enterprise, the development body, found 58 per cent of those surveyed admitted difficulty in recruiting for specific skills. The most difficult to fill were: life and pensions team members and managers, and team members in human resources, clients services, settlements, asset servicing and investment operations.Worryingly, 53 per cent of the sample felt location hindered their recruitment effort.The survey said: “Solutions to these candidate shortages focused mainly on training existing staff (an increase of 15 percentage points on the previous year to 75 per cent), increasing temporary staff headcount (34 per cent), and, for the first time in the top five, recruiting from other industries (34 per cent).”The concept of “growing your own” key staff continued to form an important part of the sample’s recruitment strategies, with 56 per cent of organisations expecting to operate specific graduate recruitment and 37 per cent school-leaver schemes this year.Just under half of the respondents claimed they would also be running work experience schemes for graduates and school leavers. Some 14 per cent of those questioned said they had sought foreign language speakers in the past year, Chinese, German, French and Spanish emerging as the most required.For the third year, the review recorded a rise in the number of financial services companies based in Scotland who were actively trying to increase diversity of the workforce.But Margaret Dyer, director of Joslin Rowe, says: “In perhaps one of the most encouraging findings, nearly 17 per cent of firms stated they were taking the solution very much into their own hands by forging links with diverse schools and organisations.”The Financial Services Strategy Group, the joint forum of the Scottish executive and the industry, recently mapped the education and labour market initiatives serving the industry, in order to help identify mismatches between supply and demand.The “Financial Services Tours” project provides briefing sessions and company visits for careers advisers in schools, colleges, universities and job centres.These are expected to increase the advisers’ understanding of the importance of the sector, the wide range of companies operating in this sector; and the skills and attitudes that employers expect.This year 10 tours will take place, involving 300 delegates and 25 companies."

RH Donnelly eased 2.4 per cent to $61.77.The deals provided distraction for a market once again preoccupied with inflationary concerns. A report on manufacturing activity last month indicated that the US industrial sector expanded in spite of the recent hurricanes. “That was a real shock,” said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services.A rise in the price index for raw materials received most attention, reviving worries about inflation and the chances of a continued tightening of monetary policy by the US central bank.Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach and Co, who sees interest rates at 4.75 per cent by the first quarter of 2006, said: “The fear is that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates. It’s just a matter of time before we see some pick up in inflation.”However, Mr Mendelsohn said that the market was being supported by the continued strengthening of the dollar, which has hit a near three-month high against the euro and a 16-month high against the yen.“The strong dollar has been helping to put a floor on the US equity market,” he said. “It has brought in a lot of Japanese and European buying as it boosts the return on US assets. These foreign inflows have offset many of the headwinds for the US equity market.”Still, investors on Monday morning appeared more concerned with manufacturing data, which forced declines in the stocks of leading US manufacturers, with Alcoa down 2.3 per cent to $23.89 and General Electric down 1.3 per cent to $33.23.Banking shares, which tend to benefit from higher interest rates, were mixed. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange banking index was nearly unchanged, as State Street rose 0.9 per cent to $49.36, while North Fork fell 0.5 per cent to $25.38.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent off at 10,535.48. The S&P 500 index eased 0.2 per cent to 1,226.70 and the Nasdaq Composite index bucked the trend with a 0.2 rise to 2,156.43.Other stocks in the news included Lexar Media, which rose 18 per cent to $7.53 after JPMorgan analysts upgraded the stock.Two stocks attracted interest after joining the widely-quoted S&P 500. Ameriprise, the financial advisory firm spun off from American Express, lost 4.5 per cent to $34.20 as it became an S&P 500 component from its first day of trading. Lennar, the housebuilder, added 3.3 per cent to $61.70.
713;STT;State Street Corp;2005-09-20T18:39:47Z;End of the line at Marshall Field’s;;Terry Lundgren, chief executive of Federated Department Stores, on Tuesday announced the final demise of Marshall Field’s, the Chicago-based department store that is one of the best known names in American retail history.In a blow to Chicago’s civic identity, the landmark store on the city’s State Street will next year begin trading as Macy’s – the New York-based nameplate that Federated is rolling out as its main national brand, following its acquistion of May Department Stores.Mr Lundgren said that Federated had “great respect for the legacy and traditions of Marshall Field’s”, and that the decision to change its name had been taken after “we carefully researched customer preferences and studied alternatives”.The move provoked a strong initial reaction in Chicago. An online poll on the Chicago Tribune’s website had solicited more than 10,000 responses within hours of the announcement, with 90 per cent saying they would be less likely to shop at the new Macy’s store following the name change.“Marshall Fields is synonymous with Chicago. I am so heartbroken that we will be losing a Chicago institution,” wrote one particpant in the paper’s online discussion.Marshall Field, the retailer’s founder, played a leading role in the development of the traditional American department store, establishing the State Street store location under his own name in 1881. He was also one of Chicago’s most important philanthrophists, taking a major role in funding the development of the University of Chicago and the city’s Art Institute.During the 1950s and 60s, the State Street store – with its motto “Give the lady what she wants” – played a leading role in introducing Americans to Parisian high fashion. Marshall Field also developed a notorious rivalry with Bloomingdale’s after the New York store, now also owned by Federated, moved into Chicago in 1988.In 1990, Marshall Field’s was bought by Dayton Hudson, the antecedent of the Target discount chain, and its exclusive reputation suffered as its name was extended to the retailer’s Midwest department store chain. It was subsequently sold to May department stores in 2004.Federated also said it expected up to 6,200 job losses in a management reorganisation following its merger with May, including 1,700 due to the closure of May’s corporate headquarters and mechandising offices in St Louis.The company also said it would study the future of its Lord & Taylor division during the rest of 2005 and make a decision about its future by the end of the current fiscal year.It said it also intends to divest the Bridal Group division it acquired from May. Credit Suisse First Boston and Banc of America Securities will be advising Federated.
714;STT;State Street Corp;2005-09-01T19:42:27Z;Katrina could alter course of Fed;;George W. Bush, US president, and Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, met on Thursday to discuss the economic impact of Hurricane Katrina - a meeting that stoked already intense speculation as to whether the Fed might put on hold its steady progression of interest rate hikes.In what is normally the second-quietest week of the year, dealers have reported unusually heavy trading as the enormous physical and economic implications of the storm become clearer.“Katrina’s effects are felt nationally . . . and appear a whole lot bigger and far-reaching than [the 1996 storms in the northeastern US] or any other natural disaster in recent times,” said David Rosenberg, US economist at Merrill Lynch, in research published yesterday, noting the potential impact of the storm on transport arteries and food production and storage.“Everyone is focused on energy, but just ask the folks at Cargill, Tyson Foods or Archer Daniels what all this means for their businesses – and keep in mind that food accounts for nearly 15 per cent of the consumer spending pie versus 5 per cent for energy.”“People are now expecting a very weak fourth quarter or first quarter,” said Rick Klingman, head of US Treasury trading at ABN Amro. Last week, the markets were pricing in at least two more quarter-point hikes in the Fed funds rate, which is currently 3.5 per cent, by December.“Now they are talking about Fed rate rises being taken off the table for the rest of the year.”The December Fed funds futures contract, traded on the Chicago Board of Trade, has risen to 96.245 from 95.92 since Monday, implying the market now believes the Fed funds target will be no more than 3.75 per cent at the end of this year. Currently, the rate is 3.5 per cent. And the rise in the February contract, from 95.76 to 96.195, suggests the market thinks that 3.75 per cent might well be the final peak of the cycle, compared to its expectations just last week of a 4.25 per cent rate.Eurodollar futures – interest rate contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange – have also risen as rate rise expectations have been scaled back.Brian Garvey, a senior strategist at State Street, noted that the shift in eurodollars was the largest three-day move in US rate expectations since the days immediately following September 11 2001.“Katrina has created a lot of uncertainty, and certainly provides an excuse for the Fed to step back and assess the effects not only of the hurricane but also of its prior tightening,” said Mr Garvey.He added the Fed could be in a “fog” for several months as it analysed the impact of the storm.Treasuries also leapt again on Thursday, sending yields to fresh two-month lows. Yields on two-year notes reached a low of 3.695 per cent while the 10-year yield slipped below 4 per cent for the first time since June.This is the fifth time in a year that 10-year yields have dropped below 4 per cent, though on no occasion have they held below the psychologically important level for more than eight days.“This is the first break that coincides with a major shift in rate expectations, and perhaps this could be more sustainable,” added Mr Garvey.John Roberts, managing director, rates at Barclays Capital, concurred that traders were “looking for a pause [by the Fed] in September or November”. But he thinks the pessimism is overdone – at least for now.“Is this going to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back and makes the US economy go into recession? I don’t think so,” he said.“[Katrina] does have some impact on the economy, but third quarter GDP is going to print 4 per cent, so if we go back to 3.5 per cent, is that a disaster? No.”Mr Roberts said the ability to get oil refineries around the Gulf of Mexico running again is the key to the longer-term impact of Katrina, with the restoration of petrol production particularly important.Petrol shortages could make the upcoming Labor Day holiday appear to be “a disaster”, according to Mr Roberts. But he said the swing in the market’s psychology had gone too far and could reverse within a few weeks.“The Fed can sit and watch, there’s plenty of time until the next meeting,” he added. The next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled for September 20.Alan Ruskin, research director at 4Cast, also doubts the Fed will change course. “There is of course no such thing as a free lunch, and speculation goes that the president will also subtly ask the Fed chairman to hold off on rate hikes,” he said in a research note. “We remain sceptical that the Fed chairman will oblige.”
715;STT;State Street Corp;2005-08-23T21:32:11Z;Overview: High oil keeps equities lower;;"Worries about high oil costs cast a shadow over global equities on Tuesday, as investors fretted about the potential economic damage from a crude price that remained above $60 a barrel.Oil eased back in early trade amid falling US gasoline prices and growing expectations that US inventories data on Wednesday could show crude oil stocks rising for a fourth consecutive week, before finishing ahead.Sentiment was nervous, with worries about possible supply disruptions remaining at the fore. Traders fear production in the Gulf of Mexico could be disrupted during the peak September hurricane season, and they remain concerned about global refinery constraints.However, by the close in New York, Nymex West Texas Intermediate for October delivery had recouped its earlier losses to end 6 cents higher at $65.71 a barrel. October Brent rose 15 cents to $64.65 a barrel. At this level, WTI is less than $2 below its all time record of $67.10 set on August 12.Wall Street stocks drifted lower on disappointing US home sales and as the second quarter corporate reporting season wound down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.5 per cent lower, the S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2 per cent.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said: “Investors have begun to fear that economic growth and inflation trends are accelerating, and that higher interest rates will restrain equity markets.”European shares were also under pressure with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index falling 0.6 per cent at 1,186.73 despite a bigger-than-expected jump in investor confidence in Germany in August.The ZEW index reached 50.0, its highest level for 17 months and well above the 37.0 reading in July. Capital Economics said the outcome firmly killed off any lingering expectations of an ECB rate cut. “Today’s data suggest a broad-based economic recovery in Germany, confirming that the next move by the ECB will be an upwards one,” it said. The euro was initially supported by the data, but ended the day at $1.2210, a fraction lower.Japanese shares hit a four-year high. The Nikkei 225 Average was 0.2 per cent up on the day at 12,472.93.State Street noted that its investor confidence index had risen in August, rising 2 points to 84.8 from July’s revised reading of 82.8.“Institutional investors have been willing to add to the risk of their portfolios over the past month, as US longer term interest rates continue to show resilience to short-term rate increases by the Federal Reserve,” said Paul O’Connell at State Street Associates. “Nevertheless, this increase is muted; confidence remains at relatively low levels, and investors clearly have reservations about becoming too extended.”Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, was also cautious. He said “sky-high energy prices” and the “excesses of the American consumer” were the two main dangers facing the global economy.But he drew comfort from the economic revival of Germany and Japan, the world’s second and third largest economies, because of their ability to offset any downturn in the US, thus tempering downside risks to global growth.“Japan and Germany collectively account for only about 17 per cent of world GDP – 9 percentage points below the peak share in 1995 and about 11 percentage points below America’s current 28 per cent share. Convergence of these shares is possible over the next 3-5 years,” he stated."
716;STT;State Street Corp;2005-08-15T22:33:22Z;American investors move away from US assets;;American investors diversified away from the US at the fastest rate in 10 years, even as foreign buyers stepped up their purchases of US assets, data released on Monday suggested.US investors bought $146bn of overseas bonds and equities in the past 12 months more than at any time since 1994.But despite anxieties about the still-growing US current account deficit, overseas investors poured a net $71.2bn into US assets, up from a revised $55.8bn in May, according to the Treasury.The capital flows, which more than covered the $58.5bn trade deficit for June, suggest that confidence in the strength of the US economy will be sufficient to sustain the external deficits.The dollar rose to $1.236 from $1.239 against the euro on the news.The US needs to attract more than $2bn in net inflows each working day to cover the current account gap, of which the capital and trade accounts are the most visible and biggest components.“The bulk of the current account financing burden falls on securities rather than direct investment so we have to focus on this report,” said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac Bank.US financial markets have paid particularly close attention to foreign appetite for US assets amid concerns that Asian central banks could be curbing their purchases of US bonds. Lower demand from overseas could push US borrowing costs sharply higher.The inflows into the US were led in June by the corporate bond market. Foreigners bought a record net $52.2bn in corporate debt compared with a 12-month average of $27bn as bonds rallied strongly after credit market turmoil in May which had largely shut down the market for new borrowing.But overseas investors remained wary of US stock markets. Foreigners bought a net $0.1bn of US stocks which took the three-month rolling average to just $1.7bn, the lowest in eight months.“That they're buying bonds and not stocks has to be a bit of a concern,” said Mr Callow. “It suggests investors are happy to take fixed coupon payments on bonds but not convinced enough to bet on equity market appreciation.”American investors' interest in overseas assets is the latest example of a growing trend. According to the Treasury, US investors bought $9.64bn of foreign equities, up from $4.7bn in May and taking the 12-month total to $96.2bn.“It is partly because of the dollar, partly corporate scandals. Both have been a wake-up call to investors with too much exposure to US equities,” said Brian Garvey, strategist at State Street bank.State Street's indicators have shown weak demand for US equities over recent weeks from both domestic and foreign buyers, even when good news has lifted stocks.“This is one of the reasons we're still negative on the dollar,” added Mr Garvey.● Separately, the Congressional Budget Office on Monday forecast the budget deficit will shrink to $331bn this fiscal year, down from a record $412bn last year, as tax revenues improve. Economists had forecast an even bigger deficit this year.
717;STT;State Street Corp;2005-07-19T23:39:17Z;Funds expect US rates to reach 4%;;Global fund managers expect the benchmark US interest rates to rise to 4 per cent before the Federal Reserve will stop tightening monetary policy, a Merrill Lynch poll showed on Tuesday.Its latest monthly survey of 300 portfolio global managers, Merrill found greater confidence about the outlook for the world’s largest economy in the wake of a consistent stream of better-than-expected economic data.The figures have led fund managers to believe that the Fed will raise benchmark interest rates by a further 75 basis points to reach a so-called neutral stance in monetary policy – the point at which borrowing costs do not slow down economic growth, while inflationary pressures are kept in check.The findings come as Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is due to testify before US lawmakers on the outlook for the US economy.David Bowers, the chief equity strategist at Merrill, said: “There’s a greater consensus that interest rates need to rise further.”He added that while fund managers thought growth was improving, they were unconvinced that it would support corporate margins.Their scepticism is reflected in higher cash positions, with a net 19 per cent of managers saying they hold overweight positions in cash. The net refers to the balance of fund managers’ views.At the same time, inflation has returned to the managers’ list of concerns this month and a net 37 per cent of investors said they believed global core inflation would increase in the next year. Last month, a net 22 per cent of survey respondents gave the same answer.US stocks remained out of favour, with a net 29 per cent of global fund managers saying they were underweight in Wall Street shares.In Europe, two-thirds of fund managers said an opposition victory at German elections in autumn would speed up restructuring of companies there.Even among the group of the 30 per cent of European fund managers who believed the result would not affect the pace of reform, about 43 per cent said restructuring would happen regardless of who was in power.Meanwhile, an index of investor confidence from State Street Global Markets fell to 81.1 for July, from 85 last month. Michael Metcalfe, senior strategist at State Street, said the index was near its lowest point this year, reached in March, and warned “[it] highlights that the economic outlook is perhaps not as rosy as a cursory glance at the fundamentals might suggest”.
718;STT;State Street Corp;2005-05-17T18:15:56Z;Schroders to lose an architect of its recovery;;Schroders on Tuesday said one of its key executives was stepping down as the fund management group provided further evidence of its improving fortunes.The company said Richard Horlick, its head of investment who has been instrumental in rebuilding its performance, was leaving less than three years after joining from Fidelity, the US fund manager. He will be replaced by Alan Brown, former chief investment officer of State Street Advisors.The move surprised the market, but Michael Dobson, Schroders chief executive, said the decision had not been taken suddenly. “It is something Richard and I have been talking about for some time,” he said, adding that the timing of the departure was determined by Mr Brown’s availability.Under the terms of his contract, Mr Horlick, who was paid £1.5m in salary and bonuses last year, will receive six months’ pay, but will lose any deferred cash and shares to which he would have been entitled if he had stayed. However, he will receive a £700,000 payment he was offered in 2002 as compensation for giving up his Fidelity share options.Mr Brown is a respected figure and was the most senior British executive in the US asset management business before he stepped down from State Street in March. He will join Schroders in July.The management reshuffle was announced as Schroders reported profit in the first quarter of the year of £50.4m. The figures reflect the continuing improvement in its asset management division, as Schroders benefits from its switch to higher-margin retail funds.In the first quarter, the company reported a net inflow of £1.2bn. It is the company’s first quarterly net inflow for some time, though Mr Dobson cautioned that institutional flows were very lumpy and the picture could change later in the year. Schroders shares jumped 38½p, to 727p.Mr Dobson also said that Schroders, which has a £700m cash pile, was still looking for potential bolt-on acquisitions.
719;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Pound ticks lower as Labour majority narrows;;British assets suffered little in the wake of the Labour government’s reduced majority, although the pound encountered a mild sell off.With most results in, the majority appeared to have been slashed to around 60 from 167, and there were perhaps minor concerns that backbench rebellions could hinder the progress of future economic reforms. But the result was largely expected and sterling’s reaction was considered to be knee jerk.“On the margin sterling will suffer slightly in the wake of the reduced majority, but at least for the short-term the result will imply little change in policy or leadership,” said Mitul Kotecha, currency strategist at Calyon.The pound fell in early London trade by more than half a cent to $1.8956 against the dollar, before recovering some ground by midday to $1.8990. Most strategists however, remained confident that the pound’s fall was temporary.“A majority of this magnitude is still sufficient to ease concern regarding potential impediments to passing legislation,” said Ryan Shea, strategist at State Street. “As such, the result removes a modest potential downside threat to sterling due to increased political uncertainty.”Stocks listed in London outperformed their counterparts in Europe, which fell in response to weakness on Wall Street overnight. The sense of continuity in London helped investors shrug off the effects of US losses that came in the wake of debt rating downgrades for both General Motors and Ford and the FTSE 100 edged a couple of points higher to 4,903.4.Fears over the sustainability of UK growth have been driving bond yields lower, but most investors were keeping their powder dry ahead of US employment data due later. Gilts were also responding to the Standard and Poor’s downgrade of GM and Ford.By midday, the yield on the 10-year gilt was unchanged at 4.516 per cent.

Mudlark, ever trusting, relayed on Friday a message from the Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein global equity analyst that he was ""home with a revolting cold"".It now emerges, however, that Montier had cried off days earlier, using the more novel explanation that his wife had booked a holiday without telling him.Montier's absence from the Edinburgh conference was especially noted because he was due to propose a motion that ""pension funds investing in hedge funds will all end in tears"". The debate went on without him; a vote that was evenly divided before arguments were exchanged swung narrowly to the negative afterwards.As for Montier's reluctance to appear, might it have anything to do with last week's global asset allocation note by DrKW colleague Albert Edwards?Edwards put himself forward as ""an early candidate for the 2005 Ass of the Year"" because of an untimely recommendation to move heavily overweight in bonds.

Their father, Robert Douglas- Miller, worked at Jenners for 39 years and is still chairman after retiring as an executive in 1999. All three will move on next month when the sale completes.Salmon should beware: all three admit to being keen fisherman.

722;STT;State Street Corp;2005-03-02T20:49:12Z;European Comment: The trials of Werner Seifert;;Werner Seifert, chief executive of Deutsche Börse, was not choosing an easy life when he made his bid approach for the London Stock Exchange. The going so far has been rough.A little relief came yesterday when State Street Global Advisors, a US fund previously counted in the rebel camp, gave unexpected backing to Deutsche Börse's indicative offer of 530p a share or £1.3bn ($2.5bn). State Street owns 1.6 per cent of the Frankfurt exchange.That still leaves owners of some 36 per cent of Deutsche Börse's shares opposing the deal. In the absence of the right to vote on the deal under German law, and Deutsche Börse's refusal to allow one, some threaten to try to oust more than half the supervisory board at May's annual meeting.What might happen? Hedge funds could take their gains from Deutsche Börse's rising share price and sell out. The supervisory board and Mr Seifert could be ousted, leaving the way clear for rival Euronext. Or Mr Seifert, who has written to shareholders assuring them their concerns will be met, could bulldoze his way through.Things seem to be shifting his way again: the rebels' proposed replacements for him and Rolf Breuer, supervisory board chairman, have not been well received.If the Office of Fair Trading, the UK regulatory body, decides on a full inquiry by the Competition Commission, it could be September or October before bidders are free to put their best offers. Euronext, which has yet to name a price, could hit shareholder unrest if it bids too high.No doubt the honourable thing for Mr Seifert to do would be to offer an advisory vote, but that seems unlikely - it would set a precedent for if he makes a higher bid later on.If Mr Seifert gets through May's meeting the rebels will have shot their bolt, and he will have more room for manoeuvre. There are risks on all sides. This column is not normally slow with advice, but on this one, Mr Seifert, you are on your own.Galileo gambitNational rivalries continue to frustrate the necessary process of consolidation in European aerospace and defence, notwithstanding such successful cross-border ventures as Airbus or Alenia-Westland.So the European Union's decision to postpone again the decision on who should build its Galileo satellite navigation system with 30 satellites to challenge the Pentagon-controlled Global Positioning System should be welcomed.The two rival bidders for the landmark contract - pitching a consortium including France's Thales, the Franco-German EADS and Inmersat of the UK against a partnership between Italy's Finmeccanica, Alcatel of France and two Spanish companies - are clearly disappointed by the delay.The contest was so close Brussels could not make up its mind. At least, this is the official version. The European Commission also argued extending the bidding for three more months would lead to improvements in the rival offers.The real motive is more subtle. For Brussels is secretly manoeuvring to persuade the two groups to join forces and co-operate in a truly pan-European strategic industrial venture ultimately involving €7bn of investments and creating, says the Commission, 100,000 new jobs.Not only would collaboration on such a scale avoid devisive political conflict but it could well provide a powerful stimulus for further aerospace and defence consolidation. It would also show Europe is serious in its efforts to revive the Lisbon process by combining its technological and industrial strengths rather than pursuing an old patchwork approach.Calm on the M&A frontThis year's slow start to mergers and acquisitions in Europe is bad news for investment bankers but not necessarily for anyone else. According to Thomson Financial, deal volumes in January and February were running at less than half the $12bn a week seen last year.If this means companies are being cautious and only pursuing transactions that are sure to be value-creating, it could be a good thing, even if those expecting a bonanza after last year's Sanofi-Synthélabo hostile takeover of Aventis and Santander's acquisition of Abbey National are disappointed.Cross-border consolidation is needed in many industries but not at any price. Too many past bids have benefited the target company's shareholders but not the acquirer's.Too much should not be read into two months' figures. Companies have excess cash and, in the face of slow domestic markets, the temptation to grow by acquisition will become more insistent. The danger is, as in the last M&A wave, that Europe comes to the party late and leaves with the worst hangover.european.comment@ft.com
723;STT;State Street Corp;2005-02-24T17:24:44Z;Dollar drifts higher as focus returns to Asia;;The dollar moved higher on Thursday, but watchers described the move as more drift than direction as the market continued to focus on developments in Asia.By midday in New York, the euro was at $1.3205 from $1.326 at midday in London, while the greenback was at Y105.4 against the yen from Y104.7 in Asian hours.Sterling wobbled, slipping from $1.91 to $1.901 before recovering. Rumours circulated that dollar buying was related to a Ryanair order for Boeing planes, but Chris Furness at 4Cast described that as “dumb,” since the payments would not be made so early. He suggested the move could have been related to the upcoming settlement for France’s new 50-year bond. “But even that is speculation,” he added.■ The lack of direction in the major currencies was countered by still strong focus on Asian currencies. The latest news was a gathering of academics, policymakers and central bankers reported by the Korea Times.Attendees met unofficially, but are to set up - officially - an Asian “Bellagio Group,” named after the European forum which began in the 1960s to discuss more closely co-ordinating monetary policy. The dollar, its level and Asia’s role, were believed to have been discussed.“The fact that such a step has been taken indicates the growing level of concern that is apparent among policymakers within the region,” said Simon Derrick at Bank of New York.Some dismissed the group as a “talking shop” and pointed out that Asian policymakers already had the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN), a ten-member club that often includes the outsiders South Korea, Japan and China. There is also the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) organisation. Since the 1997-98 currency crises, policymakers have worked to strengthen policy relationships between countries and there is a series of swap arrangements in place to assist ASEAN countries experiencing liquidity problems.“Given the level of currency reserves in the region, we can’t take it too lightly, but the market will only really pay attention when it starts doing something,” said Mr Furness.■ There was interest in the Canadian dollar after the 2005 budget proposal, revealed late in the North American session on Wednesday, removed entirely the limit on foreign content for Canadian tax-sheltered pensions savings.The dollar jumped against its Canadian counterpart on expectations the measure would weaken Canada’s currency as funds extended their overseas holdings. The limit was last raised in 2000 to 30 per cent from 20 per cent.According to State Street bank, Canadians invested an average C$17bn a year overseas between 1995 and 1999. In 2000, this leapt to C$64bn. But analysts yesterday said the market reaction to the latest change may have overstated the likely impact.Harvinder Kalirai, strategist at State Street, said the change could just encourage people to shift taxable overseas holdings into tax-free shelters, not therefore affecting currency flows.“After all, it’s not like Canada has capital controls,” he added.Moreover, the jump in outflows in 2000 has since largely been attributed to the “new economy” stock bubble in the US that attracted massive inflows from around the world. Jeremy Friesen, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets noted that the change to the rules in 2000 did not have a noticeable effect on the exchange rate, and that there are more factors supporting the Canadian currency now than then.RBC forecasts the Canadian dollar will trade in a range against the greenback between about C$1.20 and C$1.25.“We think dollar-Canada is at or near the top of this range,” he said, recommending investors established short dollar-Canada C$1.2450 with a target at C$1.2166 and a stop loss at C$1.2560.By midday in New York, the dollar was at C$1.244, having jumped from C$1.237 to C$1.249 on the news on Wednesday.

It had no idea about the talks, which had been under way for the past five months. ""It's news to me,"" said one Baugur insider.However, it is thought that Somerfield's announcement has not changed the Icelandic company's position.Baugur is still awaiting an initial response from Somerfield, whose board is expected to meet later this week - at the earliest - to discuss its offer, which values the company at ?1.03bn.The UK's fifth-largest retailer said on Thursday that it made the announcement to ""get it out on the table in light of the Baugur approach"".Somerfield is planning to invite a property partner to acquire, develop and leaseback the properties. Although it could do the deal through short-term debt, it is more likely that Somerfield would fund the deal through a sale and leaseback.It said it had a shortlist of potential partners, although it is understood that the Rotch Property Group, which did a property deal on 51 Morrison stores with Somerfield last year, is not on the list.Somerfield plans to increase the floor space from 82,000 sq ft to about 250,000 sq ft, taking the average store size from about 650 sq ft to about 2,000 sq ft.The company declined to comment on the current turnover of the stores or how long it would take to complete the conversions.Mark Webster, senior investment manager at State Street Global Advisors, which owns 3.4 per cent of Somerfield, said the Texaco deal emphasised the fact that Somerfield's management was moving away from the poorly-performing Kwik Save format and repositioning itself in the fast-growing convenience sector.However, it still has some way to go, given that it still has to refit 75 per cent of its 523 Kwik Save stores.It also has to update 60 per cent of its 701 Somerfield stores.The shares ended yesterday 2p higher at 188?p, valuing the company just a fraction under Baugur's ?1.03bn indicative offer."
725;STT;State Street Corp;2005-02-15T17:55:50Z;Dollar rebounds as overseas demand persists;;"The US dollar recovered from a sharp sell-off on Tuesday as fresh data revealed continuing foreign demand for US assets.The greenback had tumbled almost a cent to a low of $1.3052 against the euro as the day's raft of US data got off to an uncertain start.Retail sales fell 0.3 per cent month-on-month in January, driven by a tumble in auto sales, while the Empire state manufacturing survey also came in a trifle lower, largely due to softness in its employment component.However, the data releases differed little from consensus forecasts, with retail sales ex-autos actually a little better than expected, rising 0.6 per cent on the month.Paul Mackel, currencies strategist at ABN Amro, instead attributed the dollar sell-off to the actions of the Romanian central bank, the BNR.The BNR reportedly intervened twice on Tuesday to weaken the leu against the euro, with ABN believing it did so by buying the euro and selling dollars, rather than intervening directly in the leu/euro rate.Although the Romanian intervention may have been as small as €50m (or as much as €300m), it could have pushed the euro/dollar rate higher in light trading ahead of all-important US portfolio flows data, Mr Mackel believes.The leu had risen 11.5 per cent against the euro so far this year as interest rates of 15.75 per cent attracted yield-seekers. On Tuesday it fell 4 per cent to 36,500 leu to the euro.What is not in dispute is that the greenback erased the bulk of its losses when the cross-border portfolio flows data came in a little better than forecast.The US attracted net inflows of $61.3bn in December, with the November number revised up $8bn to $89.3bn. Equally importantly, inflows remained steady despite a lack of buying by Asian central banks.Net inflows into US Treasuries slumped from $32.8bn to $8.3bn, the lowest figure since September 2003. Instead the bulk of inflows went into corporate and agency bonds, although a net equity outflow of $8.3bn was disappointing.""The data sugests no deterioration in funding isues for the dollar,"" said Ian Gunner, currencies strategist at Mellon Financial.Brian Garvey at State Street Bank went further still, saying ""one could argue that Europe's love affair with US assets that came to an ugly ending after the Nasdaq bubble is flickering once again.""This allowed the dollar to trim its losses to sit just 0.1 per cent lower on the day at $1.2985 to the euro, $1.8895 against sterling and C$1.2328 against the Canadian dollar.However, the yen continued to strengthen after its initial move higher against the dollar, and by mid-session New York trading was up 0.5 per cent at Y104.48 to the dollar, Y135.68 to the euro and Y197.43 versus sterling.Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, argued the yen's move was driven by the breaching of key technical levels, initially against the euro.The search for yield that has helped drive the Romanian leu also pushed up a number of other currencies on Tuesday.The Turkish lira hit a nine-month high of TL1.304 to the dollar with carry-trade investors likely to have been active in a five-year bond auction.The Brazilian real also hit a 30-month high of R$2.567 to the greenback amid speculation that the Brazilian monetary policy committee, the Copom, will today raise interest rates by 50 basis points to 18.75 per cent.The South African rand jumped 1.7 per cent to R5.9776 to the dollar, despite data showing the annualised rate of GDP growth fell to 4 per cent in the last quarter, potentially giving the Reserve Bank the scope to cut interest rates."

Now BAE faces the prospect of having the programme run by KBR, the Halliburton subsidiary (at least for now) chosen by the Ministry of Defence to manage the project.How angry is Mike Turner, BAE chief executive, about the change in fortunes?Very angry indeed. At a reception last month hosted by the Defence Export Services Organisation, an MoD agency, several people present saw Turner locked in a heated discussion with Tony Pryor, KBR's chief European lobbyist.Accounts of what Turner said vary, but all agree he let his anger at Pryor show and laced his accusations with a healthy number of expletives. If KBR got the contract, he added, BAE would pull out. Most versions of the incident say Pryor gave as good as he got.Now it gives a hootThe past six months have been rough for Minerva, the property company that owns 60 per cent of Allders, now in administration. Not only did attempts to sell itself fail, but it has also been lambasted by analysts for lack of transparency.In October, it refused to hold a meeting to present its annual results, in which it announced a surprise 20 per cent jump in net asset value.Andrew Rosenfeld, Minerva's robust chief executive, has decided to welcome City scribblers with open arms next time.Mittals hedge betsThe Mittal family, steelmaking kings of the world, have invested in the Global Advantage Fund, taking the young macro hedge fund's net assets under management to $20m (£10.6m). They've also taken a stake in the fund's manager, Dawnay Day mc Capital Management.Blow your own hornDonald Rumsfeld's musings on ""known unknowns"" and ""unknown unknowns"" have inspired Alan Brown, chief investment officer of State Street Global Advisors. In a note to investors, Brown declared: ""There are events out there which we simply can't predict."" In Jack Benny's words, ""Oh, really?""Brown also trumpets his success at the start of 2004 in forecasting that equities would go up, but by less than in 2003 (when they rose 26 per cent). He is similarly proud of the accuracy of his 2003 prediction that markets would rise by single figures, acknowledging that giving himself 25 per cent leeway in either direction helped.And what's Brown's 2005 forecast, made a full month into the year? He goes out on a limb to predict ""single digit returns"" for equities.Prince in darknessSince ""Taking Responsibility for Tough Choices"" was the theme of last week's World Economic Forum, it was appropriate that Charles Prince, Citigroup's chief executive, was co-chairman.What a year he had in 2004, apologising in Japan for serious breaches of regulation and in Europe for a controversial trade in the euro government bond market. But there are limits to accountability.Bloomberg reported that Prince was asked at Davos about a Citibank account that Palestinian Authority records show was held by an investment company controlled by Yassir Arafat. On three occasions, the agency said, Prince replied: ""Talk to our press people.""mudlark@ft.com"
727;STT;State Street Corp;2004-11-23T22:11:32Z;Global Overview: Greenback highlights fragility;;"There was plenty to unsettle world markets on Tuesday, with the dollar lurching to fresh lows against the euro and oil prices climbing back above $50 per barrel.The US currency resumed its downward trend after Russia signalled it might cut the share of its foreign exchange reserves held in dollars and lift the proportion held in euros.At one point the greenback fell below $1.31 to the euro, and it was finding it hard to recover from that level by mid-session in New York. The US currency also hit a nine-year low against a basket of currencies.Another rise in oil prices also weighed on investor sentiment in a week when stock markets are in subdued mode ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday in the US tomorrow. Nymex crude futures hit a high of $50.25 in early trade before settling back to just under $49 a barrel.Wall Street opened lower and, by the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had inched up 0.03 per cent off to 10,492.60. European markets opened on a firm note but weakened late in the session in response to the higher oil price and Wall Street's decline. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,024.05.Merrill Lynch suggested world equity markets had got ahead of themselves after the strong run since the start of the month. The sharp rally in stocks since the US presidential election had left stocks ""very much overbought"", said Trevor Greetham, Merrill's director of global asset allocation, in a research note.But Ajay Kapur, global strategist at Citigroup Smith Barney, believes equities can make further progress, gaining about 10 per cent from current levels over the next year as valuations look cheap relative to bonds. One downside risk, he said, was that corporate earnings growth in 2005 fell short of forecasts, with consensus estimates suggesting a 10 per cent rise in US earnings and 20 per cent in Japan. ""A 20 per cent rise in Japan looks pretty unlikely,"" he said.The fragile state of market sentiment was underlined by the latest State Street investor confidence index. This dropped to 85.3 in November from an upwardly revised 89.2 in October. Paul O'Connell at State Street Associates said: ""We see that investors from Europe appear highly concerned by developments in the euro and the US dollar and are overall selling risky assets in relation to their portfolio holdings. By contrast, Asian investors are more buoyed by regional growth prospects. They are displaying stronger confidence and systematic buying across their portfolios.""There were signs of this confidence in a firm showing for Asian shares yesterday, even though Japan was closed for a holiday. Hong Kong hit a 3½-year high while Jakarta reached a record closing peak to take its advance for the year to 39 per cent.Gold, responding to renewed dollar weakness, almost breached the $450 level, reaching $449.50, a new 16-year high."
728;STT;State Street Corp;2004-11-18T19:05:21Z;Gold tracking fund sees firm demand on debut;;"The listing of the long awaited gold tracking fund on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday was met with firm demand but also a fall in bullion prices from 16-year highs.It is the first time a pure commodity backed investment has listed on the NYSE.Streettracks Gold Trust - which was set up by the World Gold Council and is distributed and marketed by State Street Securities, the US financial services group - made its stock market debut 18 months after the WGC, which is funded by gold miners, filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The trust, which is an exchange traded fund, had traded about 2m units by early afternoon in New York.With each unit accounting for a 10th of a troy ounce of gold, the units traded equated to 200,000 ounces of gold or about 6 tonnes. Annual gold demand is about 2,500 tonnes.Streettracks is the fourth listed product sponsored by the WGC, with the other three listed in Australia, London and Johannesburg. These products provide investors with an investment that tracks the gold price, without having to worry about storage, transport or insurance of the physical product.Streettracks will be a key test for this relatively new style of investment product as the US is home to some of the world's largest listed gold miners, and New York is home to the Comex gold futures contract, another popular entry point for investors seeking exposure to the precious metal.The London-listed Gold Bullion Securities said yesterday it had attracted $766m of fund inflow since it listed almost 12 months ago.However, WGC and State Street officials were unable to comment about Streettracks Gold Trust because the SEC has ruled it a ""continuous offering"".This prevents parties associated with the product from talking about the launch. Brokers in New York were also tight-lipped because of the SEC ruling.Although the gold price hit a fresh 16-year high yesterday for the fifth successive day on dollar weakness, a rebound in the US currency later in the session sent bullion prices lower.Gold peaked at $445.90 a troy ounce in early morning trade, its highest level since July 1988. Bullion was quoted at $440.85/$441.60 a troy ounce in late London trade.""It was starting to look very stretched when [the price] moved above $445, and then we saw some selling come in,"" said one London-based gold trader.Gold has risen more than 5 per cent since the re-election of President George W. Bush on November 2 as the metal benefits from a diversification out of the dollar into other assets.Gold has a close inverse correlation with the dollar. It has gained about 70 per cent over the past three years, a period which has seen the US currency slide to nine-year lows against a basket of leading currencies."
729;STT;State Street Corp;2004-11-07T21:43:01Z;SEC close to backing new gold ETF;;The long wait for a new listed gold investment product backed by the World Gold Council and State Street Securities may soon be over, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission expected to approve the product, a first of its kind to be listed on a US stock exchange.The WGC, an industry body financed by some of the world's largest gold miners, and State Street, the US group, are expected to meet next week to finalise details of a marketing programme for the new product, which will allow investors to buy gold without worrying about storage, insurance or transportation costs, or the risk of margin calls associated with gold futures.Precious metals traders and fund managers said talk of an imminent approval from the SEC was a factor behind the run up in the bullion price to a 16-year high of $433.90 a troy ounce on Friday as hedge funds were taking positions in the futures market last week in anticipation of the launch of a new product.The gold investment instrument will be an exchange traded fund (ETF), which are very popular for US investors as they track stock indices for a lower cost than index-based managed funds.The product, which may be listed by the end of the year on the New York Stock Exchange, will be an open-ended fund and track the gold price, with each unit equal to one-tenth of an ounce of gold.If approved it would end an 18-month wait for the London-based WGC, which first filed for the product originally called Equity Gold Trust in May 2003. One of the factors why it has taken so long is because it represents a landmark decision for the SEC.There is no investment product listed on a US stock exchange that is backed by a commodity because pension funds are largely prohibited from taking a direct investment in a commodity. It could also potentially pave the way for more ETF-style funds backed by commodities.Barclays Global Investors has also filed a gold ETF investment proposal with the SEC.Another factor that the SEC had to overcome was the fact that the new gold investment product was to be controlled by the WGC, an industry advocate. However, it is understood that WGC plans to eventually sell the company that will administer the ETF to State Street.
730;STT;State Street Corp;2004-11-01T07:44:57Z;The benefit of being local;;There can be few cities in the world that are home to as many university students as Boston, Massachusetts. So it is perhaps surprising, then, that when it comes to studying for an executive MBA programme, there is relatively little choice. With the big brand names such as Harvard and MIT spurning these executive degrees, Boston University is proving to be a popular choice.“I wanted a peer group that was dynamic and entertaining,” says Denise Ulibarri, senior vice president with State Street Bank, and an alumnus of BU’s EMBA programme. Boston University, she says, was “top of the house in the Boston area”.Though the trend globally is for EMBA programmes which pull together students from as far afield as possible, programmes that draw on local managers still have enormous strengths, says Kevin Martin, vice president for e-learning sales and business development at Tech OnLine, and a fellow classmate of Ms Ulibarri from the BU EMBA class of 2001. “Most of our classmates were from the local area. The connectivity is amazing. Numerous times I’ve phoned people up and bounced ideas off them.”Boston University’s school of management, situated in a new building in the heart of the city - and just a stone’s throw from the Red Sox baseball ground - has built its reputation as the provider of part-time MBAs in the Boston area. These days, though, it has ambitions to be more - much more.Dean Louis Lataif, who joined the school in 1991 - making him one of the longest-serving deans in the US market - emphasises two strengths of the school. The first is the use of teamwork in teaching, the second the development of the MS-MBA programme, which he believes is one way forward for the more traditional general MBA programme.These days Prof Lataif says that between a half and two-thirds of the BU faculty are happy to work in teams, but says there are structural inhibitors to most business schools following this route. “Part of the problem is the tenure-reward structure,” he says. “We [business schools] pay big bucks for super-specialists. The problem in business is that we’ve all these damn human beings to manage.”As someone who spent 27 years working for the Ford Motor company before becoming dean of the school, he knows, if anyone does, the value of teamwork. He set up a Center for Team Learning in 1996 with the help of the GE Fund and he introduced a policy in which faculty who promote networking are incentivised separately.As to the MS-MBA, it is a joint degree, which, says Prof Lataif, “is not about technology but about doing business the way it needs to be done”.Nonetheless, it takes just 21 months for participants to graduate with an MBA and an MS in Information Systems.Included in that period are two separate internships.Graduates are proving particularly popular in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, IT and financial service sectors and corporate sponsors include Sun Microsystems and Shell Oil. At the moment, with 70 students, the programme is half the size of the full-time MBA programme, but it will grow if it continues to prove popular, says Prof Lataif.As well as the mainstream MBA programme, BU has introduced an international MBA that requires students to begin their programmes in Japan or China. The programme includes mandatory language training and three months of study in the chosen country.In executive non-degree programmes, in which BU admits it is still a novice, the Chinese connection also plays a role. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce, for example, is a core client for which the school runs a nine-week programme, six weeks of which are in Boston and the remaining three in Beijing.Within the MBA curriculum itself BU has not been slow to innovate in the face of the falling number of jobs for MBAs in the early 1990s and the concern about corporate ethics. All students are required to take two credits on ethics and a further two credits in career management.Though most business schools would view career management as something that should take place outside the core curriculum, if at all, this is not so at BU, says Jennifer Lawrence, assistant dean for career services and herself a marketing professor.“The academic faculty has recognised this has value.”Innovation is paying off across the board.Ranked 12 in the US and 27 in the world in this year’s Financial Times EMBA rankings, BU has risen in the table for the past two years.
731;STT;State Street Corp;2004-10-19T21:22:15Z;Global Overview: Falling oil gives equities a fillip;;"Falling oil prices and upbeat earnings statements from two US technology heavyweights gave Asian and European bourses a much-needed boost yesterday.But after a strong opening that took the Dow Jones Industrial Average back through the 10,000 mark, selling pressure set in amid fears that leading US health insurers would be embroiled in an investigation into the industry. By the close, the Dow was down 0.6 per cent at 9,897.62, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index was 0.7 per cent lower at 1,922.90.Overnight falls in oil prices and better-than-expected results from IBM and Texas Instruments meant Wall Street's positive mood at the close of play on Monday spilled over into Asia and Europe. The Tokyo market ended a seven-day losing streak, with the Nikkei 225 Average rising 0.9 per cent. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index edged back through 1,000, closing 1 per cent higher at 1001.7.Nymex crude futures, which reached a new record of $55.33 in Asian trading on Monday, fell for a second consecutive day as traders took a more pessimistic view about the outlook for global growth next year. Nymex November crude futures settled down 38 cents at $53.29 per barrel, while Brent oil was down 59 cents at $48.32.The equity markets' enthusiastic reaction to falling oil prices left at least one observer bemused. Jim Wood-Smith, head of strategy research at Gerrard in London, said: ""It remains a slight puzzle that each fractional down day in the oil markets is purported to lie behind equity rallies, seemingly no matter how much the oil price had risen in the preceding days. This may be indicative that investors are more willing to buy the dips than sell into strength.""If this is one sign of returning investor confidence, then so too was the latest survey by State Street Global Markets. Its global confidence index climbed 0.9 per cent in October from a revised 84.7 in September. But the index remains close to its lows for the year and the October increase - only the second rise this year - marks only a small recovery after the 24-point fall from 109.0 last December.Michael Metcalfe, senior strategist at State Street Global, said: ""The fact that investor confidence fell for the first seven months of the year and has now stabilised suggests that professional investors reduced their allocations to risky assets in anticipation of slower growth and higher oil prices. As a consequence their confidence is now less vulnerable than either consumers or business to the latest wobble in growth.""The fall in oil prices boosted the yen, which jumped 0.9 per cent to a three-month high of Y108.39 against the dollar. As Japan has no oil production of its own, it is particularly sensitive to changes in crude prices.Gold rose $3.85 to $419.35 an ounce, spurred by a weaker dollar. The US currency fell despite an uptick in core US inflation that suggests the Fed will continue to raise interest rates."
732;STT;State Street Corp;2004-10-12T20:53:39Z;Market Overview: Oil price dominates sentiment;;"Oil prices pushed higher during Asian and European trade on Tuesday, sending US crude to a record level above $54 a barrel and pulling equity markets up short on worries about the impact on global growth and corporate profits.US crude oil futures hit another all-time high of $54.45 in overnight electronic trade before running into profit-taking when New York opened. November crude settled down $1.13 at $52.51 - the first fall in six trading days - as traders opted to take profits following the overnight surge at a time when demand growth is at its strongest for more than two decades.The International Energy Agency said yesterday that high oil prices were beginning to slow the world economy and encourage fuel efficiencies in China. The Paris-based agency cut its forecast for world oil demand growth in 2005 by 320,000 barrels per day to 1.45m barrels per day, which would leave consumption at 83.85m barrels per day.Jim Wood-Smith at Gerrard, the broker owned by Barclays, said Wall Street and European markets looked uninspired with a nervous sense that the rally in equities since mid-August was running out of steam.""Now that the momentum is easing, markets are left to focus on the oil price, which is showing every inclination of reaching the pre-ordained target of $60 a barrel,"" he said.Wall Street was lower in morning trade as news of lower-than-expected third-quarter profits from financial services provider State Street cast a pall over the start of the corporate earnings reporting season.But equities rebounded as the oil price tapered off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 0.1 per cent lower at 10,077.18 and the Nasdaq Composite falling 0.2 per cent.Surging commodity prices compounded concerns about weakening investor confidence in Germany and sent European equities to 10-day lows.The ZEW research institute's monthly gauge of investor confidence for Germany took a bigger-than-expected tumble to its lowest level for 16 months amid concerns about oil and a slowdown in global growth.Daniela Etschberger, at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, said the survey confirmed the likely slowdown in growth momentum with oil prices posing an additional risk to the export- dependent recovery in Germany and the Eurozone. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed 0.8 per cent lower at an indicated 1,001.42.Tech stocks led Asian markets lower as a gloomy outlook from South Korea's LG Philips LCD compounded concerns about the impact of soaring oil prices. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average fell 1.3 per cent - its biggest one-day loss for two months - as exporters fell due to high oil prices and its tech sector was hit by the fallout from LG Philips.In currency markets, the dollar gained against European currencies, encouraged by the weaker-than-expected ZEW numbers."
733;STT;State Street Corp;2004-10-12T20:34:03Z;Wall Street pares losses as crude eases;;"The same crude prices that had sent Wall Street blue chip stocks on a highway to hell with their earlier surge almost put the indices back in black in the last hour of Tuesday's session.Nymex crude gave in to aggressive profit-taking ahead of data on US petroleum inventories, settling at $52.51 per barrel after it had surged past $54 per barrel in overnight trading.The reversal sent blue-chip stocks into a rebound of their own in the last hour of trading to close within a whisker of positive territory.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was less than 0.1 per cent lower at 10,077.18, while the broader S&P 500 index was 0.2 per cent lower at 1,121.84. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index recovered much of its earlier losses and closed 0.2 per cent down to 1,925.17.Jay Suskind, head trader at Ryan Beck, said: ""We just can't ignore oil, because it has continued seeping into the overall picture of future economic growth and individual company earnings, and will act as a brake to some degree.""Despite Tuesday's retreat, crude prices remain vulnerable to supply worries in the face of unrelenting global demand as the winter begins in the northern hemisphere. Pumping capacity in the Gulf of Mexico remains impaired following hurricanes in the region, while the prospect of prolonged strikes in Nigeria and lower output from Russia could renew upward pressure on crude prices.Trading volumes picked up on Tuesday, conferring credibility on the rally. However, some traders said the statistical dead heat between the two contenders for the White House with only three weeks to go until the election is causing many investors to stay away from the market.Tuesday's rebound appeared to vindicate the view that last week's retreat in the face of dismal economic news would prove a short-term correction that would give in to the market's curent upward trend.The third-quarter earnings season is picking up pace, and by the end of this week about a third of the companies in the S&P 500 index will have reported results.Bullish investors have argued that the market has ignored upbeat corporate earnings all year and it will have to take them into account eventually. The inevitable slowdown in corporate earnings fuelled fears that by the time the market gets around to taking earnings into account, the news will have already become less exciting.Mr Suskind said the much-discussed fourth-quarter rally was only likely to happen after the election early next month and provided the oil markets become more stable, affording investors a chance to make more educated bets on the effects of expensive oil on the rest of the economy.""Oil is a moving target right now, once it becomes more stable, people might start looking at what 2005 is going to look like and discount anything that might happen until the end of this year,"" he said.Merrill Lynch shares were 2.9 per cent higher at $52.48 even after the Wall Street bank reported a 15 per cent decline in quarterly profits from the previous quarter. While Merrill exceeded analyst forecasts, the news underscored its vulnerability to trading in equity and fixed income markets.Also in the financial sector, State Street gave up 6.1 per cent to $41.16 following its news of below-estimate earnings last quarter.Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceuticals and healthcare group, reported higher quarterly profits thanks to higher demand for medical devices and drugs. Shares added 2.6 per cent to $56.82.In the technology sector, a downbeat assessment of semiconductor markets from Philips, the Dutch conglomerate, cast a pall ahead of quarterly results from Intel, due after the close. Shares in the world's biggest chipmaker lost 1.6 per cent to $20.28 by the close, while Advanced Micro Devices eased 1.8 per cent to $13.70. The semiconductor sector index fell 1.3 per cent.Fred Hickey, editor of the Hi-Tech Strategist newsletter, said he would not be surprised to hear Intel give a positive message with its earnings but warned: ""That won't address the real problem, which is high inventories"". Referring to the recent rally in chip stocks he said: ""It defies everything going on in the economy, there is very little logic behind the optimism.""Also reporting results after the close is Yahoo, the internet portal. Its results are seen as indicators of insights into trends in the global internet advertising and electroni c commerce market. Shares were up 0.6 per cent at $34.23.In the more traditional advertising segments, Gannett reported growth for its newspaper and television units but the media group's shares edged down 2.1 per cent to $83.25."
734;STT;State Street Corp;2004-10-12T16:46:29Z;Sterling falls as CPI data points to rate freeze;;Sterling and the euro were both under pressure on Tuesday after the release of soft economic data.The UK's consumer price index rose just 0.1 per cent in September, far below expectations of 0.4 per cent, with weakness in transport and communications balancing price rises in clothing and education.Headline CPI has now fallen to 1.1 per cent year-on-year, just a tenth of a point above the level at which Bank of England governor Mervyn King would have to explain to chancellor Gordon Brown why the government's inflation target of 2 per cent is being missed by such a margin.ABN Amro, Calyon and ING Financial Markets were among those suggesting that the soft inflation data meant UK interest rates have now peaked at 4.75 per cent.“Our view that the BoE may raise rates in November now looks highly unlikely,” said James Knightley, economist at ING. “Indeed, the next move in rates is looking more likely to be downwards than upwards.”“The doves are sitting pretty as pricing power in the high street remains notably absent,” added Daragh Maher, senior FX strategist a Calyon. “This further supports our view that rates have peaked, and while this is largely reflected in short-sterling contracts, it should provide another bearish push for sterling, particularly against the resurgent US dollar.”This proved correct, with sterling falling 0.7 per cent to $1.7861 against the dollar, and 0.2 per cent to Y196.03 against the yen, although it was little changed against the euro at £0.6885.The euro was undermined by Germany's influential ZEW investor confidence survey, which fell to 31.3 in October, well below September's 38.4 and the fourth straight monthly fall.The data, which the ZEW Institute attributed to higher oil prices and a global slowdown, suggested that Germany's export-led recovery may be slowing.Chris Towner, consultant at risk management group HIFX, painted a more disturbing picture still. “I can see a parallel between what is happening in Germany and what happened in Japan,” he said. “They have high savings rates, subdued consumer confidence levels and stubbornly high unemployment. There is no domestic demand.” The euro fell 0.6 per cent to $1.2303 against the dollar.The dollar was stronger across the board, rising 0.3 per cent to Y109.79 against the yen, following the passing of the Homeland Investment Act, a generous tax holiday designed to encourage US multinationals to repatriate retained profits.Debate over the effect of the Act continued, with Michael Metcalfe at State Street Bank seeing inflows of $6bn a month into the dollar, “a small stop gap” in the $50bn a month US trade deficit. Divyang Shah at IdeaGlobal saw “at best a modest dollar positive”, with sterling and the euro the most vulnerable to repatriation flows.
735;STT;State Street Corp;2004-10-11T19:20:22Z;Market Insight: ETFs catch the big boys' eyes;;"Exchange traded funds - passively managed, low-cost baskets of shares that track an index or sector - last week won the support of one of the world's biggest investment funds.Norway's $140bn Petroleum Fund - which ranks in the same league as funds such as Calpers of the US and ABP of the Netherlands - announced that some of its flood of new cash from rising oil prices would be going into ETFs.Knut Kjaer, head of the fund, said ETFs ""have become liquid and an alternative to futures contracts"".This is the sort of endorsement ETFs backers, such as Barclays Global Investors and State Street Global Advisors, have long been seeking.ETFs were initially popular with day traders as a quick and dirty way to get broad exposure to an index. But, as the Norwegian move shows, they are increasingly finding favour with big money investors. The number of institutional investors holding US-listed ETFs is now 1,400, according to Thomson Financial, a 6 per cent rise this year.Another reason why the Petroleum Fund's move is significant is that Europe so far has been slow on the uptake. Assets under management, at $25bn, are only a seventh of the $175bn in the US.ETFs were pioneered by the Spyder, which tracks the S&P 500, in the early 1990s. They took off during the equity boom of the late 1990s when US investors bought huge volumes of Qubes - so-called because their ticker code was QQQ - to get exposure to the Nasdaq and its raft of technology stocks.Even after the bubble burst, volumes of Qubes kept growing because they were then being bought to take short positions in those same technology stocks. Today, Spyders and Qubes between them still make up a quarter of all ETFs by asset value and three quarters of the trading volume.The ETF's closest cousins are mutual funds. But ETFs trade all day like ordinary shares, so they have not suffered the price distortions that clouded mutual funds during the market timing scandal. In theory they are as liquid as the underlying shares themselves, although in practice bid-offer spreads have been wider in Europe than the US, which has discouraged use.Issuers of ETFs stress they are equally useful to small and large investor alike, as they provide a simple way to buy a whole country's equities, either for the short or long term. David Franklin, at fund manager Christows, says it uses them both long term in the US, supplemented by ""a handful of individual stock ideas"", and short term in the UK, to park new cash inflows while they are researching UK stock picks.ETFs can be held for indefinite periods, whereas the alternative of a futures contract buys exposure for only a set period, usually of three months, which has to be rolled over to maintain the position.The total of assets under management in ETFs is still only a fifth of 1 per cent of the world's financial assets but volume of trade is growing fast. In the US it is up 30 per cent this year to about 175m a day, equivalent to about 5 per cent of the 3,400m daily share trades on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq combined.Europe is also experiencing fast growth and is up 25 per cent in the first eight months of this year. Germany and France have seen more trading volume than the UK but this year the UK has been catching up. Take-off among the UK retail sector has been slow because there is little incentive for independent financial advisers to recommend them but the arrival of more institutional users will bring some of the needed liquidity."
736;STT;State Street Corp;2004-10-05T18:30:16Z;New ETFs provide 'quick and dirty' access to China;;"UK and US investors will get their first chance next month to use exchange-traded funds to gain direct exposure to the booming Chinese economy.ETFs are baskets of securities that track the movement of a particular index but unlike traditional mutual funds they trade on an exchange like shares do.The two lead issuers, State Street Global Advisors and Barclays Global Investors, have been racing one another to get to market first in China.SSgA said in August that it was poised for a launch. But BGI pipped it to the post last week with its announcement of an iShare ETF tracking the FTSE/Xinhua index of 25 mainland China companies, to be listed on the London Stock Exchange from October 25.An iShare is also due be listed on the New York Stock Exchange pending regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, possibly as soon as this week.Until now, the only ETF for mainland China stocks has been listed in Hong Kong. Barclay's iShare MSCI China contains about two- thirds of the constituents of the new offering.ETFs, pioneered by SSgA with the Spyder in the 1990s, are used by retail and institutional investors but outside the US the investor base has so far been mostly institutional. There is about $170bn of assets under management in the US compared with $24bn in European ETFs.The collapse of retail equity investing after the bursting of the technology stock bubble in 2000 hampered growth in Europe but issuers are finding the rise of hedge funds a fertile new customer base.Simon Gaunt, a broker at Teather & Greenwood in London, says the main use they are seeing for ETFs is for hedging.They also allow investors to go short - taking a bet on falling prices.Although the Chinese economy is growing by a healthy 9 per cent, the FTSE/Xinhua index has taken a dip this year and is down 2.6 per cent so far. But this is precisely why BGI sees them as timely.Bruce Lavine, head of iShares in Europe, said: ""China is a very long-term story and investors want access. If they think China is overvalued, they now have a tool to get in and out.""Low liquidity of ETFs outside the US discouraged use at first but it is improving, especially for emerging market ETFs.The iShare MSCI Emerging Market Index now trades 200,000 shares a day in London and the Hong Kong ETF 275,000.While liquidity has been a problem, leading to prohibitive costs to trade in and out, fees for ETFs are highly competitive compared with mutual funds.Although the Barclays China ETF will be at the top end of the range, with a total expense ratio of 0.74 per cent, that will still be 2-3 times cheaper than most China mutual funds.ETFs are essentially a ""quick and dirty"" way to get exposure, with particular appeal to hedge funds. Specialist China funds will not necessarily be customers.Shifeng Ke, manager of the China fund at Edinburgh-based Martin Currie, said: ""These might be useful if you don't have a research ability. But we are active managers. We think stock selection is the better way.""Institutional investors take a similar view. Neil Gregson, head of emerging market equities at Credit Suisse Asset Management, says: ""We do use ETFs but only for short-term purposes. Mostly we see them as competition for what we do.""At Axa Investment Managers they have their own rival products to BGI and SSgA, although not yet a China ETF. Bruno Guiot, head of ETF development, said: ""Investing in China is not an easy task and such an ETF is part of the answer.""The 25 Chinese companies in the index are heavily weighted towards the telecoms and oil sectors, including China Mobile, China Unicom, Petrochina, CNOOC and China Petroleum, which between them represent almost 40 per cent of the market. The biggest gap is in banks. Most of the big banks in China are not quoted.Graham Colbourne, chairman of FTSE Asia-Pacific, said sectoral concentration was commonplace for indexes in other countries, too, including the UK's FTSE 100.BGI is also launching iShares MSCI Japan today. It said the US equivalent iShares ETF on the same index already has $5.8bn of assets, while overall iShares have 110 funds listed globally, totalling $92.3bn."
737;STT;State Street Corp;2004-09-27T16:06:34Z;Soaring oil price takes its toll on currencies;;Oil concerns led currency movements on Monday, pushing the dollar lower against a range of currencies, but weakening the yen even more.As crude inched ever closer to $50 a barrel, making new records on the way, the dollar slid lower against net exporters like Canada, where the Canadian dollar hit its strongest level since January at C$1.2729. Much of Canada's exported oil goes to its southern neighbour.The dollar was hit too by higher metals prices, which helped other 'commodity currencies' like the Australian dollar, which rose from US$0.7105 in late Asian trade to US$0.7147 in the New York day.The euro and sterling also benefited from the dollar's softer tone, and the single currency rose to $1.2308 in the New York morning from $1.225 early in the London day. Sterling rose to $1.8080, a one-month high, from $1.803 in the London morning.The yen however led the losers on Monday, touching six-week lows against the euro and the dollar as investors worried about Japan's total dependence on oil imports and recently weaker economic data.The dollar rose to Y111.41 from Y110.5 in Asian trade, but eased to Y111.14 by midsession in New York as it came under renewed pressure itself from the oil price rise. The euro reached Y136.79 from Y135.7 earlier.Weak Tokyo stocks were another factor weighing on the Japanese currency. Analysts at State Street bank noted that while the Nikkei is off 1.7 per cent this month at 10,895, the yen's losses have added to the problems for overseas investors. While State Street's flows suggest foreigners are still buying into Japan, it warned this may be at risk.“If the coming key economic releases complete the recent run of disappointments and press the Nikkei toward 10,300, it is likely that foreign investors may begin to question their investment into Japan more seriously,” said Michael Metcalfe, senior currency strategist at the bank.Simon Derrick, head of currency strategy at Bank of New York, said market participants were watching Chinese officials carefully for any clues as to the timing of a revaluation of the renminbi ahead of the weekend G7 conference, which Chinese officials will join in for the first time.“It is difficult to believe the subject of the US current account deficit and imbalances in FX aren't going to come up at the meeting,” he said. “But it's equally difficult to say what, if anything, on the subject will surface in public.”This time last year, a call from the G7 for “more flexibility in exchange rates” was taken by the markets as tacit acceptance of a weaker dollar versus managed Asian currencies such as the yen and the renminbi which is pegged tightly to the dollar.
738;STT;State Street Corp;2004-08-27T20:47:12Z;Wall St slows to a crawl as convention looms;;Like a ghost train in a rainy night, Wall Street stocks moved ahead this week but hardly anyone was there to see it happen.Trading volumes were positively torpid and reached new lows for the year at the New York Stock Exchange during the week. “We'll need a cattle prod to reach 1bn shares today,” said one trader yesterday, and his view was vindicated when 847m shares exchanged hands at the Big Board.While a few stocks received some attention, the broader market edged modestly higher.By Friday's close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher at 10,195.01, or 0.8 per cent higher for the week. The S&P 500 index added 0.2 per cent to 1,107.77 on Friday and was 0.9 per cent higher for the week. The Nasdaq Composite put on 0.5 per cent to 1,862.08, for a weekly showing of 1.3 per cent to the upside.Many market watchers said the torpor was set to continue and worsen next week, when the Republican party holds its quadrennial national convention in New York's Madison Square Garden arena, above the railway station where trains from Long Island and New Jersey bring many Wall Streeters to work.The combined fears about a more tedious commute than usual and possible terrorist incidents have caused even the most workaholic traders to book time off. There were wide expectations for Wall Street to become a ghost town setting as early as lunchtime Friday.The effects of the market-wide languor were felt in the relatively tepid reaction from the stock market to the retreat in oil prices. Having flirted with a $50 price for a barrel of crude, futures begun a decline last Friday that continued this week. By the close of trade on Friday, they stood at $43.18.Nevertheless, concerns that US shoppers might not be as loose with their wallets in the near future were reiterated by some companies even as lower petrol prices gave some cause for optimism.Wal-Mart saw its shares fall by 1.9 percent for the week after it trimmed its August forecast on Monday for sales at stores open at least a year, saying that back-to-school activity had not lived up to expectations.Krispy Kreme Doughnuts shares ended Thursday 10.4 per cent lower but were only 1.9 per cent lower for the week after the purveyor of sugary treats announced a 56 per cent drop in profits, missing forecasts and withdrawing its quarterly and full-year earnings guidance.Likewise, Starbucks shares fell 6.5 per cent on Thursday and were 5.3 per cent lower for the week after disappointing sales figures from the coffee shop operator.Fred's, the discount retailer, saw shares lose 10.9 per cent the same day and 12.6 per cent for the week as it released lower quarterly earnings.However, Target, another discount retailer, sounded a different note from rival Wal-Mart when it reaffirmed its August same-store sales guidance on Tuesday, sending shares 1.4 per cent higher for the session and 2.5 per cent higher for the week.Williams-Sonoma, a retailer of high-end corkscrews and other housewares, said on Wednesday profits rose 55 per cent in the quarter. Shares gained 9 per cent this week.Even if some US consumers might be loath to consume as much, they appeared to still be buying food. HJ Heinz, the company best known for its tomato ketchup, announced a 7.8 per cent rise in quarterly profits on Tuesday, and the news sent shares 2.8 per cent higher, for a weekly gain of 3 per cent. The company said brisk sales of its low carb frozen foods helped the results.In a sign that not all foods are equal, poultry producers came under pressure this week when Sanderson Farms on Tuesday said profits missed analyst estimates. Shares fell 18 per cent for the week, along with those of Pilgrim's Pride, which gave up 16 per cent that days but were only 2.8 per cent lower for the week, and Tyson Foods, which fell 5.3 per cent and 7.9 per cent for the week.Some deal-making also broke the August lull. Toronto-Dominion Bank shares eased 2.4 per cent on Thursday after it announced the purchase of a controlling state in Banknorth, a Maine bank whose shares added 10 per cent on the news a day earlier.BlackRock shares rose 2.4 per cent on the same day and were 10.4 per cent for the week after it announced the $375m purchase of SSRM Holdings, the holding company of State Street Research & Management, from MetLife. The insurer's shares were flat for the week.
739;STT;State Street Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Rentokil refuses sell-off despite 10% profits fall;;Rentokil Initial, the business services group that ousted its chairman and chief executive this year, on Thursday refused to break itself up or sell off any of its seven divisions as it announced a 10 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits.Shares fell 4 per cent to 147p after the announcement, but Brian McGowan, who became chairman after Sir Clive Thompson was ousted in May, insisted that no shareholders had called for a break-up.He said: ?I have listened to the City, investors, analysts and advisers…The overwhelming comment was a concern with the operational issues, not the make-up of the group.?Although ?one or two? had called for the disposal of its parcels delivery and conferences business, Mr McGowan said most believed the sale of the two divisions would be a ?sideshow?.He did not expect a new chief executive, for whom a search is under way, to reverse his decision. ?It would seem unlikely that any organisation would employ an individual who clearly had fundamental ideas at loggerheads with the board [that] is employing him,? he said.Some analysts and investors questioned whether measures, including changing the company?s culture and investing in IT, were sufficient. ?We would have expected some more flesh on the bones,? said Mark Webster of State Street Global Advisors, a Rentokil shareholder. Former boss Sir Clive said: ?I am extremely surprised that this strategic review is substantially a restatement of old operational initiatives announced in the last few years…Shareholders deserve better than this.?There was also speculation that Rentokil?s refusal to contemplate a break-up could entice a private equity bidder prepared to do the job for it. Mr McGowan would not say if Rentokil had received any approaches. Sir Clive also refused to comment on whether he intended to bid.Pre-tax profit in the six months to June 30 fell from ?200.5m to ?180.4m. Turnover slipped from ?1.22bn to ?1.21bn.However, Rentokil said full-year earnings would not be less than ?350m, in line with a profit warning in May. It also pledged the full-year dividend would be 10 per cent higher at 6.71p with a similar rise in 2005, but said it was halting the share buy-back of the past four years.An interim dividend of 1.93p (1.75p) is payable from earnings per share of 7.26p (7.85p).
