The US-based company said the “strategic pivot” would reduce capital expenditure by $1.5bn over five years and enable it to become cash flow positive by 2021.Albemarle said the delayed projects are based in Australia and Chile, the world’s two biggest producers of the soft, grey metal used in batteries, aircraft components and pharmaceutical products. Lithium prices have fallen 12.3 per cent this year, according to an index compiled by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, reflecting a surge in supply and concerns over demand amid an escalating trade war between the US and China. Luke Kissam, Albemarle’s chairman and chief executive, said the company expected lithium prices to continue to fall in the near-term before supply-and-demand dynamics tightened in 2020. “The potential impact of electric vehicle subsidy changes in China, possible shifts in cathode chemistry, excess inventory held in spots along the supply chain and the current oversupply of lithium carbonate in the market has caused some caution in the energy storage value chain,” he said. “We have always stated that we would add production capacity to meet demand,” Mr Kissam added. Shares in Albemarle jumped almost 9 per cent to $73.49 following the announcement of the slowdown in construction and second-quarter results, which were ahead of analysts’ expectations. Global lithium supplies have ramped up this year in response to a boom in demand for battery raw materials, which has been driven by bullish forecasts for sales of electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Australia is at the centre of the lithium boom, with six mines opening over the past three years and A$3bn (US$2bn) in commitments to build five new processing plants, capable of processing spodumene ore, which contains lithium. Albemarle said it would reduce spending and downsize its planned lithium hydroxide processing facility at Kemerton, 150km south of Perth, and put on hold a similar facility planned in the remote Pilbara region of Western Australia. The Pilbara project is part of a joint venture with Mineral Resources, an Australian company. Mr Kissam said the company would also delay yield improvement work at its La Negra mine near Antofagasta, 1,300km north of Santiago in Chile.Last week, Albemarle revised its joint venture with Mineral Resources. Under new terms agreed to by both parties, Albemarle will own 60 per cent of the Wodgina lithium mine in the Pilbara and provide its Australian partner with a stake in its Kemerton processing plant. Some analysts warn a recovery in the lithium market might take longer than expected. Morgan Stanley said this month it expected lithium prices to keep falling until 2025, compared with an earlier forecast of 2021, as new technologies lower the cost of production and keep the market oversupplied. “We believe most investors and the sell side underestimate the ability of companies to ramp up production of high-quality material and lower production costs in the medium term,” it said.Morgan Stanley’s forecast assumes that electric vehicles will only make up 10 per cent of the global fleet by 2025 due to a “global . . . slowdown and lower subsidies in China that postpone needed investments in infrastructure”.Additional reporting by Henry Sanderson in London
1;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2019-02-21T18:26:09Z;Shares in Albemarle jump by 6 per cent on bullish lithium forecast;;Shares in Albemarle, the world’s largest producer of lithium, rose by 6 per cent on Thursday after it projected double-digit growth in demand for the raw material due to rising sales of electric cars.“The momentum around electric vehicles has started to accelerate,” Scott Tozier, chief financial officer at Albemarle, said.The North Carolina-based company said it expects demand for lithium to grow at a compound annual rate of 21 per cent through to 2025 due to growth in electric cars and large scale batteries for utilities.Demand for lithium in electric cars will rise from 70,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2018 to over 650,000 tonnes by 2025, it said. That would take the total lithium market demand to over 1m tonnes, it said.Albemarle said it was “not forecasting any significant macroeconomic headwinds and have not seen any decline in our customer demand forecasts.”The comments will be a relief to the lithium sector which has been hit by falling prices, fears about oversupply and concerns about a reduction in subsidies to electric car buyers in China.Eric Norris, president of lithium at Albemarle, said Chinese customers had been reluctant to commit to long-term contracts for lithium. But he added that the changing nature of government subsidies would push carmakers towards higher energy density batteries that use more lithium.“That incentive to longer-range is beneficial to us and to the industry,” he said.Shares in Albemarle rose by 5 per cent to hit $87 on the New York Stock Exchange.Albemarle said its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose by 17 per cent last year to $1bn.
2;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2018-11-21T12:08:32Z;Lithium producer Albemarle takes $1.15bn stake in Australian mine;;Albemarle, the world’s largest producer of battery raw material lithium, has agreed to buy a 50 per cent stake in an Australian lithium mine for $1.15bn, as it looks to grow its supply to meet rising demand from electric cars.The company will set up a joint-venture with Australia’s Mineral Resources to develop its Wodgina hard rock lithium mine and build a plant to produce lithium hydroxide for batteries.The deal comes as North Carolina-based Albemarle is facing greater government scrutiny over its business in Chile, where it is looking to expand production from the Atacama Desert.Demand for lithium is set to triple over the next decade due to rising sales of electric cars, which use the lightweight metal in their batteries.“We feel confident in leveraging this world-class lithium resource with an experienced and knowledgeable mining company like Mineral Resources to help meet the growing demands of our global customers,” Luke Kissam, Albemarle’s chief executive, said.Located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, Albemarle said the Wodgina hard rock deposit has a mine life of over 30 years.The two companies will fund and build a plant at the mine site to produce lithium hydroxide for batteries, the company said. Albemarle will have the right to market and sell all of the lithium.The first stage of the project will produce around 50,000 tonnes per year of lithium hydroxide for batteries, rising to 100,000 tonnes in the second phase.Albemarle is the largest producer of lithium in Chile, where the metal is extracted from brine beneath the Atacama. But regulators have said Albemarle has not honoured its commitment to provide cheaper lithium to companies in Chile, as part of a policy to promote a battery industry in the country.In October Chile’s nuclear regulator, which is in charge of quotas for lithium production in the country, denied Albemarle’s request to increase production in the country.Shares in Albemarle have fallen by 25 per cent this year to trade at $95.74 in New York.
3;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2018-02-27T00:45:25Z;Shares of lithium producers rattled by gloomy forecast;Albemarle and SQM hit as Morgan Stanley warns metal price may plunge 45 per cent;A warning from investment bank Morgan Stanley that new supply of lithium will swamp demand for a metal that has been prized for its role in electric car batteries sent shares in its two largest producers tumbling on Monday.Shares in US-listed Albemarle closed down more than 7 per cent to $110.10, while those of rival SQM dropped more than 8 per cent to $53.71 after analysts at Morgan Stanley cautioned that the lithium price could plunge 45 per cent over the next four years.Lithium has become one of the world’s hottest commodities, with its price more than doubling over the past two years, as forecasts that electric cars will dominate the auto industry proliferate. Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors, for example, is in talks with Chile’s SQM over a supply deal. A Tesla Model S uses more lithium in its batteries than 10,000 smartphones, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.But a debate over how much new lithium supply will arrive on the market — and how quickly — has muddied the outlook for the metal. Morgan Stanley estimates supply from projects in Argentina and Australia, as well expansion by the largest producers in Chile, may add around 500,000 tonnes per year to supply by 2025. The annual supply is currently at about 215,000 tonnes.“We expect these supply additions to swamp forecast demand growth,” the analysts said, forecasting the price of lithium carbonate will fall from $13,375 a tonne to $7,332 a tonne by 2021 and then towards $7,030 thereafter. Prices for South American lithium are currently trading at $14,500, according to Benchmark Minerals Intelligence.Electric cars need to reach 31% of global car sales in 2025 from less than 2% currently to offset surpluses in lithiumCarmakers are eager to establish a diverse source of supplies, rather than relying on one or two countries or companies. That is especially the case for China, which is developing its own lithium deposits. From a geological perspective, lithium is abundant and higher prices have encouraged producers to find new reserves.Electric cars would need to reach 31 per cent of global car sales in 2025 from less than 2 per cent currently to offset the surpluses, according to Morgan Stanley, which downgraded its ratings on Albemarle and SQM to “underweight” from “equal weight”.The two companies, which will report fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, are key to the future of lithium since they are the lowest-cost producers. Over the past year they have both secured an agreement with Chile’s regulator that allows them to expand production.The speed at which they increase supply will determine lithium’s future. Chile has lost market share to higher-cost mines in Australia over the past two years due to a rapid increase in demand, especially from China, the world’s largest electric car market.Morgan Stanley estimates Albemarle and SQM will add an additional 200,000 tonnes a year of lithium by 2025, increasing Chile’s share of the market to a third of global supply.But other analysts say the two companies will not ramp up that fast. Joe Lowry, a lithium consultant, says SQM has little incentive to expand beyond an extra 50,000 tonnes required by its January agreement with the regulator Corfo.“Morgan Stanley’s predictions of an additional 200,000 tonnes of supply from Chile by 2025 and a steep price decline is another demonstration of the ‘big name’ analysts not understanding lithium supply, demand or the cost curve,” Mr Lowry said.
4;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2018-01-18T18:19:34Z;Lithium stocks slide after SQM gets approval to ramp up production;;Lithium stocks were hit hard on Thursday after one of the sector’s biggest producers was given the green light to boost production. On Wednesday, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile, or SQM, said it had resolved a long-running dispute with Chile, striking an agreement to expand production to meet demand from electric cars. Fears that the New-York-listed company, which has a market value of $15bn, could flood the market with fresh supplies have cast a shadow over the sector. Shares in Albemarle dropped 8 per cent to $116, while FMC Corp fell 5 per cent to $89.22. Two years ago they were trading at $50 and $34 respectively. SQM was off 2 per cent at $58.34.“SQM, the global lowest-cost producer, yesterday got the right to increase 4 to 6 times its annual lithium production quota. We expect SQM to aggressively recover market share from 2020 and see downside risk to the lithium price ,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley. “Negative for global lithium equities.”Prices for lithium have jumped by over 200 per cent over the last five years as demand outstripped supply. Those gains and the hype around electric vehicles have driven the share prices of companies like SQM, Albermarle and FMC into the stratosphere. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said they expected SQM to increase production of lithium carbonate equivalent from an expected 63,000 tonnes in 2019 to 163,000 tonnes by 2024.“While SQM's additional volume increases as a result of the license changes announced should not impact the market until 2020, it could impact sentiment in the sector and supports our view that supply options are increasing which should see the market begin to balance by late 2018,” said Deutsche. The sell off in lithium stocks comes Canada’s PotashCorp attempts to sell a 32 per cent stake in SQM.
5;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2018-01-17T18:37:52Z;Focus on electric cars lights up lithium;Demand for metal used in rechargeable batteries looks healthy but supply is growing;In the aftermath of recent car emission scandals, governments in countries such as France are strongly encouraging carmakers to go electric. Paris wants to banish petrol and diesel cars by 2030.Elsewhere, such as the UK, diesel car demand has slowed. In turn this shift has refocused attention on low or zero emission electric vehicles. Those EVs require batteries, and prices of their key inputs — lithium, cobalt, lead and nickel — have soared.The first two of these have attracted the most interest given their current importance to batteries. Together they make up about half of a battery’s cathode. No surprise that prices for each have trebled in less than three years.Neither it is no surprise that share prices of both lithium and cobalt producers have also rocketed. But while nickel could replace some of the cobalt required over time, as cathode technology evolves, lithium should remain integral to all batteries for some time.And lithium demand looks healthy, compounding at a 14 per cent rate between 2017 and 2022. That’s because sales of rechargeable batteries should treble by 2025 to $59bn, according to Credit Suisse, as buyers take up electrified vehicles, both hybrids and fully electric.You know a bull market has arrived, though, when specialist indices and exchange traded funds appear for lithium. Have a look at what’s inside, though. The Solactive Global Lithium index not only has lithium makers such as US listed Albemarle and FMC Corp, it also contains carmakers Tesla and BYD. More than 40 per cent of index members at best only consume lithium. This index has more than doubled since early 2016. Junior miners such as Australia’s Galaxy Resources have been six baggers.Even as demand builds, supply too is surging. Although Argentina and Chile used to make a large proportion of lithium carbonate, that balance will shift.Australia’s contribution is increasing so rapidly that an excess supply of lithium carbonate is likely for the next couple years at least. “It’s our top short idea,” says Vivienne Lloyd at Macquarie.Should lithium prices finally tumble, expect the lithium miners to head back to ground.alan.livsey@ft.com
6;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2017-04-16T15:14:39Z;Chile leverages its lithium with manufacturing incentives;Companies bid on projects tied to the country’s vast reserves;"Chile is set to capitalise on the global demand for electric vehicles with companies from South Korea, China, Japan and Europe bidding on manufacturing projects tied to the country’s vast reserves of lithium, a key component in batteries powering cars as well as cell phones and smartwatches.The winning companies will be guaranteed 25 per cent of US producer Albemarle’s lithium production at the lowest cost available in the market, according to Eduardo Bitran, executive vice-president of the country’s development agency Corfo, which allocates permits for production of lithium in the country.The Latin American country wants to attract manufacturing of battery components, such as cathodes and electrolytes, as demand for electric vehicles rises, Mr Bitran said.“Lithium is in short supply and we have seen in the spot market prices that have gone very high,” he said. “They will have, for a very long period of time — 25 years or more — security of supply, but also steady prices.”Chile has the world’s largest reserves of lithium in the salt flats of Salar de Atacama in the north of the country, but production is restricted by quotas set by Corfo. At present, only two companies, Albemarle and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile, extract lithium from the surface brine, which evaporates in the fierce desert sun.Limits on supply have helped boost lithium prices, which have roughly doubled since 2015.The tender comes as electric car and battery companies are showing increasing interest in Chile’s resources. While Mr Bitran would not name the companies, China’s BYD, the electric car and battery maker part-owned by Warren Buffett, said this month it was talking to lithium producers in Chile about potential deals to secure supplies.In January, Albemarle signed an agreement with Corfo to expand its authorised quota of lithium production from the Atacama Desert to 80,000 tonnes a year, up from 25,000 tonnes in 2015.The deadline for the tender is May 31 and between three and six companies would be pre-qualified based on the added value of their projects relative to per tonne of lithium consumed, Mr Bitran said. The final results will be announced in November.“It is not a beauty contest; it has to be a firm commitment,” Mr Bitran added.Successful candidates would have access to approximately 20,000 tonnes of Albemarle’s lithium at the lowest price available in the export market when the company reaches its 80,000 tonne quota, he said.They would also enjoy access to Chile’s low-cost electricity, which has come down in price from $120 per MWh in 2014 to less than $50 per MWh because of growth in renewable energy, Mr Bitran said. Chile has some of the highest solar radiation in the world in the Atacama.“We are now becoming very competitive in terms of energy costs,” he said. “This is very important because anyone who is buying an electric car is really putting a value on the carbon of all the components including the battery.”"
7;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2017-03-16T14:46:40Z;Albemarle boosts lithium demand forecast on faster electric vehicle uptake;;Albemarle, one of the world’s largest producers of battery chemical, lithium, raised its forecast for demand by the end of the decade due to faster uptake of electric vehicles.The company said it now expects lithium demand to grow by 30,000 tonnes a year through 2021, from a prior forecast of 20,000 tonnes.The company said while there is continuous innovation in battery design it doesn’t see any “disruptive non-lithium energy storage technologies on the horizon.”Last year around 190,000 tonnes of lithium was consumed, a growth of between 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes from a year earlier, Albemarle said.Extracted in South America and Australia lithium has been one of the key raw material beneficiaries of the growth in demand for batteries from consumer electronics and electric vehicles.While lithium production rose by 14 per cent last year that was not enough to satisfy demand causing prices to jump by 74 per cent in December, according to London-based Benchmark Minerals Intelligence.Lithium-ion batteries in cars contain around 40 to 100 kilograms of lithium, compared to less than 0.1 for consumer electronics, according to the company. Batteries for electricity storage for power grids contain more than 1,000 kilograms, it says, but that market is not expected to take off until after 2021.Shares in Albermarle have risen 22 per cent year-to-date. The company aims to capture 50 per cent of the market growth in lithium and produce 165,000 tonnes a year of lithium by 2021.
8;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2016-12-09T19:49:15Z;Obama’s environmental whiplash for US carmakers;Trump may find EPA fuel-economy standards have surprising longevity, says John Dizard;A fight is imminent in the US Senate over the confirmation of president-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Scott Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.And now car culture has become a significant part of the Pruitt debate. Much to the shock of US auto manufacturers, as well as to the Trump transition team, on November 30 the EPA, under the administration of Barack Obama, the outgoing president, announced it was leaving its original greenhouse gas and fuel consumption standards for light-duty vehicles in place until 2025.The auto manufacturers had vigorously opposed the draft Corporate Average Fuel Economy (Cafe) standards. From Mr Trump’s election up to November 30 they thought the final Cafe rules would be much loosened by a fossil-fuel friendly Trump EPA.The car people had believed that it might not finalise the standards until as late as April 2018. But then they were given only 30 days to file their comments on the stringent 1,000 page-plus rules.$200bnEstimated cost of the EPA’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards from 2012 to 2025This is quite serious money. The agencies involved in formulating the rules have estimated that the cost of Cafe from 2012 to 2025 will be about $200bn.The auto companies believe the Cafe standards are not only much more expensive than that, but even physically unattainable with available technology, factories and supply chains.The car people say they could only comply by selling a very large number of fully electric vehicles that consumers do not want. Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the US trade association representing carmakers that sell new vehicles, testified to the US House of Representatives in September about a “gap”, between the number of electric vehicle sales car companies believe are required by Cafe, and the number of vehicles consumers will buy. EV buyers are effectively subsidised by fossil-fuel buyers.According to studies cited by Mr Bainwol: “That translates to 900,000 [battery electric vehicles or BEVs], or 11 per cent of estimated 2020 new-car sales. This represents a dramatic increase from the 70,823 BEVs that were sold in 2015 . . . Cafe is effectively a mandate on consumption, not production, measured by what consumers take out of the showroom rather than what automakers put in the showroom.”The environmental activists who support the EPA’s Cafe standards believe the car companies are perfectly capable of meeting them.Luke Tonachel, the director of the clean vehicles and fuels project for the Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental group, says: “They have a history of meeting Cafe standards. In fact, 2015 and 2016 were among the biggest ramp-up years. The engineers have gotten to work and applied their knowledge. This is happening across the industry, not just for the [car companies], but for the entire supply chain.”Also, Mr Tonachel says, the EPA’s standards-making process is fully documented. “The agencies have all the information they need for the determination they have proposed. That is a result of the analysis they have done. They have put tens of millions into doing that.”There are many actions the Trump administration will be able to take with a stroke of the president’s pen, such as withdrawing from environmental initiatives such as the Paris climate accords, or suspending the implementation of President Obama’s Clean Power Plan. Such actions will be difficult for environmentalists to stop.The Cafe standards will take much more time to unwind. Not only will there have to be a new rulemaking procedure, which will require its own technical analyses, but it will have to be done in a way that does not disrupt that car supply chain and production plans even further. Difficult. Figure on at least 18 months to two years, with junkyard-dog environmentalist lawyers clamped on the Trump EPA’s leg.Mr Pruitt, administrator-to-be, has a record of being a very persistent litigator. He and his allies among the climate sceptics know that while they can win battles against the Clean Power Plan and the Obama EPA’s Cafe standards, they will not have won the war until they have a fully documented and litigated reversal of what is called “the endangerment finding”. This was the determination in 2009 that greenhouse gases may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare.Even many Republicans have been reluctant to touch the endangerment case. The Trump team, though, looks as though they will go there.There is one industry that is quite happy with the climate policy-based electric vehicle tilt: lithium mining and processing. Shares of Albemarle Corporation, which supplies between 30 and 35 per cent of the raw material for lithium batteries, have more than doubled over the past year.The auto people may be angry with the EPA, but the battery people are pleased.
9;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
10;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2016-11-28T17:55:07Z;Lithium supply predicted to keep up with demand;Albemarle CEO says production will keep pace with growth of electric vehicles;The global market for battery chemical lithium is likely to remain “fairly balanced” for the next four to five years with supply rising to meet increased demand from electric vehicles, according to Albemarle, one of the biggest producers.Demand for lithium is likely to rise by 20,000 tonnes a year until 2021, Luke Kissam, chief executive of the US-listed company said on Monday. But that can be met from additional expansion from the largest global producers, he added.“We want to have the capacity to build it [production] up to be able to meet market demand but we don’t want to flood the market,” he said at the Mines and Money conference in London.Lithium is emerging as a key material in the battery supply chain as global carmakers focus on launching electric cars and the world’s largest car market China tightens regulations on petrol and diesel engines. Demand is expected to be further boosted by the growing use of large batteries for home and power grid electrical storageBut raw lithium extraction is geographically concentrated in South America and Australia and dominated by four companies: Chile’s Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile, or SQM, Albemarle, FMC and China’s Tianqi Lithium.That has raised fears about supply as electric vehicles come down in cost, driving up demand for batteries. Chile’s largest producer SQM has been unable to expand production in the country amid a dispute with the government over its payments.“Lithium, a key input into batteries, is the obvious beneficiary of the move to EVs [electric vehicles] as the mining industry currently appears unlikely to be able to satisfy demand,” analysts at Investec said in a report on Monday. “Especially given the simultaneous rise of power storage batteries.”Mr Kissam said he is confident new supply will come on to the market in time. Chile will resolve political issues that have held back expansion of lithium capacity, he predicted. Albemarle expects to sign an agreement with the industry’s regulator Corfo to expand production by the end of the year.Albemarle is also assessing whether to reopen the Kings Mountain lithium mine in North Carolina, which was one of the largest in the world. It is also exploring for lithium in Argentina, where it hopes to begin production after 2024.Altogether Mr Kissam, who became chief executive in 2011, said the company has capacity to produce around 165,000 tonnes of lithium annually by 2021. The global lithium market is currently around 185,000 tonnes per year.The company takes a conservative view of penetration of electric vehicles. It predicts plug-ins and electric vehicles will make up 2 per cent of annual sales by 2021, up from 1 per cent currently.Mr Kissam said batteries for energy storage will be a “huge opportunity” after 2020. It could account for an additional 10,000 tonnes of annual lithium demand, he said.
11;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2016-06-17T14:49:59Z;BASF buys Chemetall surface treatment unit for $3.2bn;German chemicals group makes largest purchase since 2011;BASF, the German chemicals group, has joined the sector’s recent drive toward consolidation by purchasing Albemarle’s Chemetall unit for $3.2bn.Albemarle is a $9bn specialty chemicals business based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, but its Chemetall unit, a leading global surface treatment business for the auto and aerospace industries, is based in Frankfurt. Half of the unit’s $845m sales last year stemmed from western Europe.Its acquisition follows higher-profile deals in the sector in recent months, which have left BASF on the sidelines. Dow Chemical and Dupont, the two largest US chemicals groups, announced plans for a $130bn merger last December, while in February ChemChina bid $43bn for Switzerland's Syngenta and, last month, BASF's German rival Bayer bid $62bn for American agribusiness Monsanto. BASF’s Albemarle deal is much smaller, though it is relatively large for the German group. It has not made an acquisition on this scale since 2011 when it purchased specialty chemicals company Cognis for €3.1bn. According to BASF, which is the largest chemical company in the world with €70bn in sales last year, the all-cash deal will complement its paints and coatings division, which last year recorded sales of €3.2bn. Wayne T. Smith, the BASF board member in charge of coatings, said BASF’s aim was “to grow profitably in downstream, innovation and solution-focused businesses”.Albemarle chief executive Luke Kissam said the sale would help his company invest in future growth by reducing leverage and returning capital to shareholders.Chemetall has 2,500 employees across 21 production sites. Its operating margins are expected to grow from 24 per cent last year to 26 per cent next year, according to a presentation to investors. Its main products are chemical treatments for cleaning, sealing and protecting metals.Andreas Heine, an analyst at MainFirst, said the deal would allow BASF to increase its exposure to the auto industry, where it is the largest supplier among chemical companies.[BASF’s aim was] to grow profitably in downstream, innovation and solution-focused businessesEarlier this year, BASF sold its industrial coatings business to Akzo Nobel, for €475m. But Mr Heine said the Albemarle deal made it clear that the broader paints and coatings division was still important.He called the deal “expensive” — the purchase price is about 15 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation — but he said it could be justified by expected growth in the industry.Between 2007 and last year, the compound annual growth rate at Chemetall was about 7 per cent, BASF said in a presentation.Mr Heine said he expects BASF would also secure financing at less than 0.5 per cent, adding to the attraction. “It has to be seen in that context,” he said.The deal is subject to approval by antitrust regulators and expected to close by the end of the year.
12;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2014-07-15T15:16:12Z;Chemicals maker Albemarle to buy Rockwood for $6.2bn;;Albemarle, the chemicals manufacturer known for its bromine-based products, is to buy lithium specialist Rockwood in a cash-and-shares deal that values Rockwood at about $6.2bn.The deal is the latest in a series in the chemicals sector, where investors are demanding higher returns and corporations are seeking to focus on the areas in which they can add the most value.Albemarle is focused on providing catalysts to the petrochemicals refining industry while Rockwood’s products are used more and more for lithium-ion batteries and other advanced varieties of battery.Luke Kissam, Albemarle chief executive, will retain the position in the merged company. “The resulting company will have broader customer reach, increased diversity across end markets, technologies and geographies and more consistent and predictable earnings growth,” he said.For each Rockwood share, shareholders will receive $50.65 and 0.4803 of a share in Albemarle, which the companies said valued Rockwood’s shares at $85.53. Those shares surged 11 per cent to $83.90 while Albemarle’s shares fell nearly 2 per cent to $71.48.Robert Zatta, Rockwood chief executive, said the “compelling transaction” offered Rockwood shareholders an immediate premium and significant participation in the combined organisation’s “tremendous growth potential”.“Our complementary speciality chemicals portfolios are expected to generate significant growth through the continued penetration of lithium-based energy storage products, compelling secular trends driving global catalyst growth, attractive surface treatment prospects and new bromine applications,” he said.The US’s two biggest chemical manufacturers – DuPont and Dow Chemical – have both restructured in recent years to move away from the production of commodity chemicals that competitors in emerging markets can produce more cheaply. The US’s chemicals industry is expected to benefit both from increased domestic oil refining and processing activity as a result of the shale oil and gas boom, and from continued access to cheap feedstocks and energy as a result of the boom.Rockwood announced in September that it was selling its titanium dioxide pigments business and some other divisions to Huntsman Corporation for an enterprise value of $1.32bn. In 2012, Cabot Corporation bought Netherlands-based Norit Corporation for $1.1bn, while in the same year Eastman Chemical paid $4.8bn in cash and shares for Solutia.Albemarle’s shareholders will control about 70 per cent of the new company, which will trade under the Albemarle name, while Rockwood’s shareholders will hold the rest. On the new board, Albemarle would provide eight members and Rockwood three, the company said.
13;ALB;Albemarle Corp;2011-05-26T18:22:09Z;Chinese rare earth metals prices soar;;A gravity-defying leap in the price of Chinese rare earth metals has triggered fears that the cost of components used in a range of goods from mobile phones to hybrid cars could soar.The three to fivefold jump in prices since January comes after China, the world’s biggest producer of rare earths, has clamped down on domestic output.The implications could be far-reaching. Although annual consumption of the metals is small relative to that of other commodities, rare earths are found in everything from fluorescent lights to wind turbines. They are very difficult, if not impossible, to substitute.Industrial buyers are in shock after witnessing the price of rare earths such as cerium oxide jumping 475 per cent in just five months, amid falling supplies.“I’ve never seen anything like it,” says one US-based purchaser of rare earths. “People are trying to wriggle out of using rare earths in any way they can, whether by developing new products or finding substitutes.”Rare earths came under the spotlight after China, which produces more than 90 per cent of the world’s total output, started to reduce export quotas two years ago. Beijing’s influence aroused concern when exports of rare earths to Japan were temporarily suspended after a diplomatic dispute.Following that de facto embargo, governments around the world, particularly Washington and Tokyo, have stepped up their efforts to develop other sources of supply. But those efforts will take years. In the meantime, Beijing has tightened regulations on its own polluting rare earths sector as part of a programme to clean up Chinese mines. Many expect China’s rare earth production to fall as a result.As China cuts further export quotas – this year’s overseas sales licence is 4.5 per cent lower on an annualised basis than last year’s and more than 40 per cent below the 2009 quota – global demand for the metals has been growing.Beijing has also clamped down on smuggling, which at one point accounted for about one-fifth of total sales, further squeezing the global market.Statistics collected in Hong Kong show exports of rare earth metals have halved over the past year to reach just 1,819 tonnes last month. At the same time, the value of exports has soared to more than $121,000 per tonne, a 10-fold increase from a year ago.Traders say that Chinese customs officials are policing exports and require that sales contracts match an internal price list, known by some as the “secret price”. They say sales of rare earths are quicker, but that offers are withdrawn more often because of rapid price moves.Li Miaoling, general manager of China Metallurgical Import and Export Group, a Guangdong company, says: “Since the end of year, customs has been adjusting their price list every week. We’ve had to add a clause to our contract stating that if customs raises prices, we will have to adjust.”The cost of neodymium oxide, which is used in permanent magnets and wind turbines, has risen more than threefold this year, hitting Rmb850,000 per tonne, according to Antaike, the Beijing-based commodities consultancy.Dysprosium oxide, used in lasers, has jumped 338 per cent since January to Rmb4,700 a kilogramme, an all-time record. Even prices for the most common rare earths, such as lanthanum, used in hybrid car batteries, have risen sharply.Users have been scrambling to find alternatives. Hybrid carmakers are accelerating the development of lithium ion batteries. Toyota, for example, is developing an induction motor for electric cars that uses fewer rare earth magnets.Chemical companies, also big consumers of rare earths, have been developing alternatives. Albemarle, the US-based chemical company, recently introduced a new line of low rare earth fuel catalysts, citing a 1,500 per cent increase in the cost of lanthanum in the last 12 months.With China planning to reduce output, manufacturers are braced for a sustained period of high prices. In February, Premier Wen Jiabao outlined a “five-year plan” for rare earths that included increased state oversight, raising environmental standards, a crackdown on smuggling, the closure of illegal mines and consolidation of rare earth producers. A new environmental code for rare earths mines will come into effect in October and Beijing has halted issuing new licences for the mines.“China has been rectifying the rare earth industry, taking environmental protection and other things into account,” Lin Donglu, secretary general of the Chinese Society of Rare Earths, says. “Rare earth output will definitely be reduced.”Yin Jianhua, rare earth analyst at Antaike, says: “Over the next five years China will probably continue reducing exports.”This shift in policy follows similar policy changes on other commodities. Beijing has launched an industry-wide “consolidation” process for coal over the last two years, which has dampened output and forced China, once an exporter, to import large amounts of coal, pushing up prices.China has also purged illegal and environmentally damaging mining of antimony, a metal used in fireproofing goods. The crackdown on antimony has pushed the cost of the commodity to a record high.In the face of concern from industry and from global capitals, China has insisted that it will continue to be a reliable supplier of rare earths. However, rising prices fit neatly with China’s ambition to end its role as supplier of cheap rare earths to the world. As Mr Lin of the Rare Earths Society says: “Prices of gold, oil and other commodities are all high. Why should the cost of rare earths not be high, too?”
