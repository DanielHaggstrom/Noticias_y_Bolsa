0;AVB;Avalonbay Communities;2012-11-26T23:41:45Z;Lehman to sell Archstone for $6.5bn;;Lehman Brothers has agreed to sell Archstone, the apartment business it bought at the height of the US real estate bubble, to Equity Residential and AvalonBay Communities in a $6.5bn cash and equity deal.The sale brings to a close one of Lehman’s biggest gambles on US real estate and comes amid signs of an improvement in the US housing market. It also replaces Archstone’s plans to raise about $3.45bn from what would have been one of the biggest initial public offerings this year.The companies would pay $2.7bn in cash, $3.8bn in common stock, and would also take on Archstone’s $9bn worth of debt, Equity Residential, part of Chicago mogul Sam Zell’s business empire, and AvalonBay said in a statement.The investment bank, under the leadership of its former head Dick Fuld, bought Archstone and its portfolio of luxury apartments in a leveraged buyout in 2007. The purchase helped add to the bank’s $30bn worth of illiquid property assets and edged Lehman into bankruptcy the next year. The company has been selling off securities and businesses in an effort to repay its thousands of creditors ever since.Lehman this year bought the final 26.5 per cent of Archstone that it did not already own in an effort to pave the way for a public float or sale.“The sale of Archstone to Equity Residential and AvalonBay is a very positive outcome for our creditors,” Owen Thomas, chairman of Lehman’s board, said in a statement. The failed bank’s shareholdings in Equity Residential and AvalonBay will also provide Lehman with “the potential for further appreciation and substantial liquidity for our remaining investment”, he added.The deal will be one of the biggest in the US real estate sector this year and comes as the country’s housing market is recovering. The Case-Shiller house price index turned positive on an annual basis in the second quarter of 2012 and there has been a recent pick-up in sales and housing starts.“Archstone’s assets will fit perfectly into the Equity Residential portfolio, further improve the overall quality of our assets and add scale to our operating platform in our core markets,” said David Neithercut, Equity Residential’s chief executive.Tim Naughton, CEO of AvalonBay, said: “This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high quality portfolio of apartment communities concentrated in our markets.”Equity Residential will receive 60 per cent of Archstone’s assets and liabilities, including 23,110 apartments. AvalonBay gets the remaining 40 per cent, or 22,222 apartments plus six apartment sites under construction.Equity Residential said it would issue 19m common shares to help fund the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. AvalonBay will sell 14.5m shares.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi in New York
1;AVB;Avalonbay Communities;2011-12-28T21:42:57Z;S&P 500 back in negative territory for year;Energy stocks hit by falling crude price;A five-day rally in US equities came to an abrupt end as energy stocks led a sell-off, which put the S&P 500 back in negative territory for the year.The S&P 500 closed down 1.3 per cent to 1,249.64. With just two trading days left in 2011, the benchmark US index is down 0.6 per cent for the year, and is set to end December, historically one of the best months of the year, a mere 0.2 per cent higher.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1 per cent to 12,151.41 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.3 per cent to 2,589.98.Energy and material stocks fell the most as the price of oil fell for the first time in seven days.Oil explorers Nabors Industries and Chesapeake Energy dropped 4.1 per cent to $17.41 and 3.7 per cent to $22.66 respectively.Investors in refiners, which see margins squeezed when the price of crude oil inputs rise faster than petroleum prices, appeared to catch on to the fact that the price of crude is back up around the $100 a barrel mark. Tesoro fell 4.2 per cent to $23.07 for the worst performance in the S&P 500 and Valero Energy was off 2.3 per cent to $20.77.In the materials sector Californian rare earth metal miner Molycorp fell 14.1 per cent to $24.04, after the Chinese government raised its export quota for rare earths, putting downward pressure on prices.The S&P 500’s financial sector fell 1.6 per cent, with Bank of America off 3.6 per cent to $5.29 and Citigroup off 2.9 per cent to $26.13.Whirlpool, the dishwasher manufacturer, fell 0.6 per cent to $46.37. Shares had slumped more than 8 per cent on Tuesday, as investors feared the worst after Sears Holdings, whose outlets stock Whirlpool products, announced it would close up to 120 stores due to poor sales of consumer electronic goods.Sears Holdings shares also fell another 0.2 per cent to $33.33 after their 25 per cent fall on Tuesday, as analysts responded to the announced store closures.“While the company announced a series of measures to sustain cash flow, we do not see how they dig out of these problems,” said Gary Balter, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse.Mr Balter highlighted the company’s resort to bank borrowing lines at a time when retailers see high cash flow from holiday spending, and told clients, “one wonders if vendors begin to worry about their own exposure.”Data from Bloomberg on Wednesday suggested initial public offerings on US exchanges by internet businesses next year may raise $11bn, with Facebook expected to deliver the largest-ever internet IPO.But separate data from Birinyi Associates showed that the 19 internet and social media companies which debuted on US exchanges this year have generally delivered poor returns to investors.While the $6.2bn raised by internet and social media IPOs in 2011 was the third-highest ever, only trailing the $15.9bn raised in 1999 and $9.6bn in 2000, the majority of those companies are currently trading below their debut price.At the close last Friday, this year’s internet IPOs were on average 17.5 per cent below their IPO price compared to a 0.4 per cent decline for all other IPOs.Once first trading day jumps are factored out, new internet stocks have fared even worse. Investors who bought internet stocks at the open on their first day of trading had seen share prices fall an average of 37.5 per cent by the close last Friday, against an average loss on all other IPOs of 14.6 per cent, according to Birinyi.Of those 19 internet IPO stocks, 84 per cent were trading below their debut price at the close last Friday compared to 69 per cent for all the other IPOs this year.The trend continued yesterday with recent IPO stocks continuing to show softness.Social game developer Zynga was down 2.6 per cent to $9.50 yesterday, 50 cents beneath its launch price two weeks after its debut. LinkedIn was off 1.8 per cent to $61.73. The market capitalisation of the professional networking website has fallen by more than one-third since the start of August, although it remains well above its $45 debut price. Groupon fell 1.9 per cent to $22.62.“[Internet IPOs] have created trading opportunities in the short term, but if you are not allocated shares at the IPO price, buying in the open market on the first day of trading with the intent of holding the stock has not been a profitable strategy,” said Kevin Pleines, an analyst at Birinyi.
2;AVB;Avalonbay Communities;2011-12-14T21:53:53Z;Solar stocks lead Wall Street down;;First Solar fell 21.4 per cent to $33.45, its lowest level in four years, as the company announced its second restructuring in six weeks.The solar panel manufacturer will shed 100 jobs and focus on building comprehensive large solar utility plants, such as the Topaz farm in Southern California, which it sold to a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway last week, instead of selling standalone solar panels.First Solar’s market capitalisation has fallen by almost 75 per cent this year as a global supply glut of solar panels pushed down prices.“It’s been clear for years that this company would suffer margin compression as global supply rose,” said Theodore O’Neill, solar analyst at Wunderlich Securities. “The bigger problem is that the new strategy is not much different from the old strategy.”First Solar’s competitors sold off as investors feared an intensification of price competition in the sector. Yingli Green Energy fell 7 per cent to $3.61 and SunPower Corp fell 16 per cent to $5.30.Elsewhere, markets fell sharply for the third day running as investors once again took fright at newsflow from Europe.The S&P 500 closed down 1.1 per cent to 1,211.82, now down 3.5 per cent for the week and at new lows for December.“Eurozone leaders simply haven’t done enough to provide any finality for investors,” said Phil Orlando, chief investment strategist at Federated Investors. “If you’re an investor looking ahead to 2012, it’s difficult to focus on domestic data, when there are so many potential eurozone landmines.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 1.1 per cent to 11,823.48, although the index at least remains in positive territory for the year. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,539.31 as Apple slumped 2.2 per cent to $380.19.Apple was knocked by Intel’s plans to expand production of “ultrabook” computers, which do not use hard disk drives. That could cut into MacBook Air’s market share, and take away customers from the tablet market.Retail brokerage Charles Schwab fell 4.9 per cent to $10.97 as weak equity trading volumes led the company to slash its guidance for fourth-quarter earnings by 25 per cent.But the financial sector of the S&P 500 was down just 0.3 per cent, outperforming every sector of the S&P 500, as big banks unusually recorded gains in a falling market.Wells Fargo climbed 0.3 per cent to $25.86 and JPMorgan was up 0.7 per cent to $31.51.Financials were helped by gains for residential real estate investment trusts.AvalonBay Communities rose 2.1 per cent to $125.25 and Equity Residential c limbed 1.9 per cent to $54.72 after Goldman Sachs put out a bullish note.“Apartment landlords can push rents [higher] despite minimal job growth. In fact, rents are up 4.9 per cent in 2011 despite just 1.4 million jobs created,” Goldman analyst Jonathan Habermann told clients.Higher capital spending knocked several shares in the oil and mining sectors.Pioneer Natural Resources fell 4.8 per cent to $82.84 after subsidiary Pioneer Southwest Energy said it would sell 2.6m new shares to fund new drilling.Mining equipment manufacturer Joy Global slumped 10.8 per cent to $75.44, despite matching analysts’ expectations on third-quarter revenues.Investors balked at plans to raise 2012 capital spending to $200m, up from the $150m previously budgeted and the $111m spent in the most recent fiscal year.“Management used the earnings call to rein in any expectation that order growth in 2012 will be anything like the 20 per cent plus we’ve seen in 2011,” said Robert McCarthy at Baird. “The worry was that large miners may delay major orders next year because of the weakening macro environment.”Shares in Groupon fell to $21.10 in early trading, barely above their $20 IPO price as analysts began publishing research on the discount offers website.Of the 11 banks which worked on Groupon’s IPO, only five recommended clients buy the stock.Citi analysts told clients: “Material upside valuation from here requires success in new segments that we believe could take significant time to prove out.” The shares closed off 3.3 per cent to $22.55.Avon was the standout performer in the S&P 500, up 5.1 per cent to $16.96, the day after the company parted ways with chief executive Andrea Jung.Broadcom climbed 0.9 per cent to $28.45 as the chipmaker bucked the semiconductor industry trend and raised fourth-quarter guidance.
3;AVB;Avalonbay Communities;2011-12-04T19:27:56Z;Lehman estate could scupper Archstone deal;Equity value in apartment company questioned;The estate of bankrupt Lehman Brothers believes that Archstone – the apartment company that Bank of America and Barclays have agreed to sell part of their stakes in – is worth $1bn more in equity value than the price at which the two banks have struck their deal, people familiar with the matter said.The estate is considering mounting a matching bid to derail the banks’ deal with Equity Residential,the real estate company headed by Chicago mogul Sam Zell.EQR said late on Friday that it had agreed to pay $1.325bn in cash for a 26.5 per cent stake in Archstone, which was taken private at the height of the property boom. The deal values it at about $16bn including debt.However, the agreement with EQR triggers a right of first refusal for the estate of the investment bank, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, to buy the stake. People familiar with the matter said that should Lehman exercise its right to match the offer, the banks have also agreed to grant EQR an option on their remaining 26.5 per cent stake.The estate has repeatedly clashed with Bank of America and Barclays about how to unwind the group’s holding in Archstone.While the estate is focused on maximising value and could seek an initial public offering for Archstone in the future, Barclays, with 25 per cent of the company, and Bank of America, which owns 28 per cent, have been pushing a quicker sale.People familiar with the situation said that the estate sees another $1bn in Archstone’s equity value over the $5bn valuation reflected in the EQR deal.The purchase price agreed by Equity Residential represents a capitalisation rate – the properties’ net operating income relative to the total value – of 5.3 per cent. That is slightly above where listed peers such as AvalonBay and Equity Residential itself trade, with some analysts arguing that Archstone could command a premium to rivals because of the rare opportunity to buy a nationwide portfolio of prime apartment properties.The estate has 10 days to mount a matching bid for the stake. It has for months been talking to potential backers, including Blackstone and Brookfield Asset Management who both participated in the auction for the banks’ stakes, about helping finance a bid to consolidate Archstone’s ownership.While the bank’s stakes are purely financial, striking a deal with the estate could win an investor such as Blackstone or Brookfield more control over Archstone’s portfolio of prime residential property.However, it is not clear under the terms of the original agreement whether the estate can bring in a partner at this time, said people familiar with the matter. The estate must also agree with the creditors’ committee in order to mount a bid.Archstone’s portfolio includes 48,922 apartment units as well as 1,332 apartments under construction and land sites for future development. Morgan Stanley advised Equity Residential on the deal, while Barclays and Bank of America advised themselves. Gleacher & Company are advising the Lehman estate.
4;AVB;Avalonbay Communities;2011-10-12T03:19:03Z;Franklin leads fall in US money manager stocks;;US money manager stocks fell on Tuesday after Franklin Resources, parent of Franklin Templeton Investments, revealed an unexpected decline in fixed income assets under management during September.Overall assets under management at Franklin Resources fell from $716.4bn at the end of August to $659.9bn at the end of September – principally due to falling asset prices, with Barclays Capital estimating investor outflows from equity funds were only $2.4bn and outflows from fixed income funds less than $1bn.Equity withdrawals had been expected, but the fall in fixed income assets under management from $314.6bn to $297.7bn worried some analysts.“We had previously factored in a much lower growth rate in global fixed income [but] now we expect negative flows [in the last quarter of 2011],” Chris Spahr, an analyst at CLSA wrote to clients. Mr Spahr lowered 2012 and 2013 earnings estimates for Franklin Resources by 12 per cent “to reflect much lower average AUM than expected”.Franklin Resources fell 2.9 per cent to $96.85. Legg Mason fell 1.3 per cent to $26.80. BlackRock fell 1.4 per cent to $153.06 and Federated Investors fell 2.4 per cent to $17.72. But some analysts said Franklin Resources’ woes might not be mirrored at other firms.“Asset declines at Franklin were mainly down to the performance of the Templeton Global Bond Fund, mainly invested in international bonds, which have been hit by emerging market currency weakness,” said Jeff Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “There’s really not much read-across to domestic fixed income funds,” he added.The broad S&P 500 eked out a 0.1 per cent rise to close at 1,195.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 11,416.3 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.7 per cent to 2,583.03.But after hours, Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, marked the start of the quarterly earnings season by missing forecasts for the first time in four quarters. Alcoa reported earnings per share of 14 cents excluding restructuring costs, compared with analyst expectations of 22 cents. The stock was down in after-hours trading.Insurers were among the biggest beneficiaries of another Europe-fuelled rally. Genworth Financial, which sells a consumer debt insurance product in Europe, was up 3.1 per cent to $5.62. Fears that Europe’s financial crisis could herald a spike in unemployment, and lead to pay-outs on the policy, have weighed on Genworth’s stock price.Lincoln National rose 1.9 per cent to $16.34, and MetLife was up 0.6 per cent to $30.58, as the insurance sector rallied on hopes that European equity assets may recover in value.Derivative exchanges sold off, with CME Group down 3.4 per cent to $257 and IntercontinentalExchange off 2.3 per cent to $123.10, though analysts struggled to explain the moves.The New York Stock Exchange was up 2.3 per cent to $26.46, tracking its potential merger partner, German exchange Deutsche Börse, which rose 1.4 per cent while German markets were open.Fashion group Nordstrom was down 2.8 per cent to $49.26, after a filing showed executives had sold shares last week.Video streaming service Netflix continued its downward momentum, falling 2.7 per cent to $108.66. On Monday the company reversed a previous decision to hive off its DVD delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster, but did not row back on a 60 per cent price rise for the joint DVD and streaming service.Fertiliser maker Mosaic Company rose 4.3 per cent to $55.77 after Credit Suisse increased its estimates for fertiliser prices, citing strong demand for grain.Reits fell, with Equity Residential down 3.1 per cent to $52.91 and AvalonBay Communities falling 2.2 per cent to $118.50.Store chain 99 Cents Only Stores rose 4.4 per cent to $21.39 after agreeing to a $1.6bn cash takeover by alternative asset manager Ares Management and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The deal values the group at $22 a share.Citigroup was up 5.1 per cent to $27.84, outperforming peers. Bank of America was up 1.4 per cent to $6.37 and Morgan Stanley was up 0.7 per cent to $15.39.Solar panel maker First Solar fell 6.5 per cent to $55.91 after a sharp fall in the spot price of polysilicon.Sprint rose 7.2 per cent to $2.38 after FBR Capital’s David Dixon made the stock his “top pick”, saying the group could meet its capital needs by issuing debt.
5;AVB;Avalonbay Communities;2011-10-06T03:16:45Z;Yahoo surges on Microsoft takeover reports;;Shares in US internet portal Yahoo rose 9 per cent in the last two hours of trading on reports that Microsoft is considering a bid.An existing tie-up means Yahoo’s website is powered by Microsoft’s Bing search engine, leaving some analysts sceptical of the value of a bid.“Why buy the cow when you already get the milk for free?” said Herman Leung, senior internet analyst at Susquehanna Financial.“Its not clear what’s in it for Microsoft, but if anyone has the cash, it’s them, so you can’t rule it out.”Buyers pushed Yahoo up to $15.77, a rise of 20 per cent on the week, on hopes of a bidding war between Microsoft and Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce site, which confirmed its interest in buying out the California-based group last Friday.Microsoft closed up 2.2 per cent to $25.89.The broad S&P 500 was up 1.8 per cent to 1,144.04 as the International Monetary Fund pushed for a speedy recapitalisation of European banks, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said she was inclined to act soon. That followed a 4 per cent surge in the last 40 minutes of trading on Tuesday, after the Financial Times broke news of European government talks about co-ordinated bank recapitalisations.Wednesday’s gains left the benchmark up 1 per cent for the week and 50 points clear of the bear market territory it had traded in for much of Tuesday.Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, warned: “It’s still difficult for retail and institutional investors to commit to this market. With volatility still elevated, it’s a day trader’s market.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent to 10,939.95 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.3 per cent to 2,460.51.Bank of New York Mellon fell 2.9 per cent to $18.28 after the bank was hit by government lawsuits for allegedly systematically mispricing forex transactions for clients over 10 years. That briefly pushed down shares in all the major US trust banks as investors absorbed further reputational damage to the industry.But State Street, which is subject to a separate $54m civil lawsuit for forex mispricing, closed up 1.3 per cent to $32.47, and Northern Trust, which is not subject to litigation, was also up 1 per cent to $36.37.Brad Hintz, trust bank analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the financial implications of the lawsuits facing State Street and BNY Mellon were manageable.“Fraud is hard to prove. And although this will encourage more civil lawsuits, the dollar amounts involved aren’t large,” he said.Residential real estate investment trusts suffered in the morning session.Equity Residential fell 1 per cent to $51.70 and AvalonBay Communities was off 1.2 per cent to $111.55.Reits have attracted flows from yield-seeking investors because they are required to pay out any profits in dividends. They have been able to take advantage of a recovery in the rental market faster than commercial reits, because tenancies come up for renewal more frequently. But their dependence on short-term funding from the repo market is worrying some investors.Sectoral movements in the S&P 500 hinted at positive sentiment.Cyclical materials and energy stocks were up 4.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively.Alpha Natural Resources, the Appalachian metallurgical coal miner, whose share price has been hit by concerns over Chinese demand, jumped 12 per cent to $19.70. Refiner Tesoro was up 13.8 per cent to $21.95.Apple inched up 1.5 per cent to $378.25. Investors were underwhelmed by the launch of the latest iPhone model. The stock is down 2.1 per cent for the week.Jefferies analyst Peter Misek predicted a quick turnround once investors tune into the upgrades “under the hood” of the iPhone.Costco fell 1.7 per cent to $80.25, despite reporting fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $27.58bn, a 17 per cent increase on the same quarter last year. Some analysts had expected even better results from the wholesale club, while investors were cautious about the company’s decision to increase membership fees to offset rising commodity costs.Seed company Monsanto rose 5.2 per cent to $66.25, after reporting better than expected fiscal fourth quarter results. The company also promised to restate its financial results for the past three fiscal years as a result of a federal investigation into incentives paid to distributors of its herbicide.
6;AVB;Avalonbay Communities;2011-09-14T20:53:34Z;Residential REIT declines blight Wall Street gains;;Residential real estate investment trusts took a tumble on Wednesday, after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Rod Petrik told clients to expect “much more pedestrian” performance, following a strong run so far this year.Residential Reit stocks have strongly outperformed commercial Reits this year. The short duration of residential leases relative to commercial leases, means residential Reits can immediately take advantage of a strengthening rental market, as contracts come up for renewal more often.But, according to Stifel’s research, residential Reit stocks are now over priced, with share prices valuing residential Reit 34 per cent higher than other Reits with similar earnings.AvalonBay Communities fell 2.5 per cent to $130.40. Apartment Investment and Residential fell 0.9 per cent to $26.48 and Equity Residential fell 2.2 per cent to $58.79.Reits have significantly outperformed most other equities this year, as low interest rates have eased financing costs, and made dividends, which Reits are legally obliged to pay, attractive to yield-seeking investors.Bloomberg’s Reits index, which is dominated by commercial property funds rather than residential funds, was up 0.8 per cent Wednesday and is only down 1.7 per cent for the year.The broader S&P 500 index jumped 1.4 per cent, leaving it up 5 per cent for the week.That was despite disappointing retail sales data, which showed consumption stagnated in August.Timothy Speiss, vice-president of EisnerAmper Wealth Planning, said the retail figures were not unexpected and that “markets are pricing in hopes of getting to a master agreement on the European crisis,” where talks between the German, French and Greek governments continued Wednesday.Financials were up 1.2 per cent led by life insurer Hartford Financial Services, up 4.8 per cent at $18.18, and Ameriprise Financial, up 2.1 per cent at $43.80, as Credit Suisse analyst Thomas Gallagher upgraded both companies to to “buy”.Low interest rates and a weak equity market have raised questions about whether life insurers can generate returns on the premiums they take in from customers. But Mr Gallagher told clients, “low interest rates will have only a minor impact” on 2012 earnings.Bank of America rose 0.7 per cent to $7.05, but RBC Capital Markets became one of the first research shops to suggest BofA may offer fair value under $10.Analyst Paul Miller cut his BofA target price from $12 to $8, telling clients, “There seems to be no end in sight for [BofA’s] litigation expenses, and there is little clarity into what the company will look like two to three years down the road.”Most buy-side analysts have “buy” ratings on the stock, which has almost halved in value this year.Reaction to Cisco’s analyst day on Tuesday was mixed. Analysts greeted the company’s restructuring, which involves significant cost-cuts, but were divided on whether it can now deliver sales growth given the weak macroeconomic environment. “Three-year revenue growth rate guidance of 5-7 per cent appears conservative to us especially as year on year comparisons get easier. This new target is well below the recent 12-17 per cent target,” Jason Noland of Baird wrote to clients.But Rod Hall at JPMorgan told clients: “The good news is that [Cisco] has finally reduced its targets to levels that are achievable. The bad news is that those targets boil down to earnings per share growth of just 7-9 per cent.”Cisco’s shares fell 0.1 per cent to $16.33. The stock traded as low as $13.30 in August, and is still down almost 20 per cent for the year.Micron Technology was again among the top performers in the S&P 500, up 5 per cent at $7.20. It has now gained more than 13 per cent this week.Statistical research by JPMorgan suggested Micron, Nvidia, and other semiconductor stocks are in an “accumulation” cycle, with investors piling into the sector as it recovers from an oversell.Nvidia rose 5.2 per cent to $15.28 and the Philadelphia semiconductors index was up 2.6 per cent on Wednesday, and 5 per cent for the week.Cablevision rose 7 per cent to $17.83 on reports of a deal with Time Warner that will allow Cablevision subscribers to watch Turner Networks programming on tablets.Shares in Sears, the department store, rose 6.2 per cent to $58.48 on reports its Kenmore brand may be made available for sale through other outlets.Some investors were cheered by analysis of Tuesday’s sectoral movements in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Transport stocks outperformed the broader index by almost 3 per cent.“This kind of outperformance by the Transports has happened 177 times over the last 50 years, and the average performance for both the Transports and the Dow in the near term has been very positive,” according to a note from the Bespoke Investment Group.On Wednesday transport stocks in the Dow were up 2 per cent, while the wider index was up 1.3 per cent at 11,246.73. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.6 per cent at 2,572.55.
7;AVB;Avalonbay Communities;2011-08-10T20:56:48Z;US stocks resume downturn;;US equities once again fell sharply on Wednesday, wiping out a late-Tuesday rally that many had hoped would represent a bottom to August’s steep declines.Financials continued to lead the move lower, dropping 7.1 per cent as a sector by the close. Citigroup fell 10.5 per cent to $28.49, and Bank of America fell 6.8 per cent to $6.77.The major indices ended the session at the day’s lows, with S&P 500 index falling 4.4 per cent to 1,120.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.6 per cent to 10,719.48, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 4.1 per cent to 2,381.05.The chief executive of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, sought to allay fears. On Wednesday he said the bank would seek to pay a dividend as soon as possible, and said it would not seek new equity capital.But the two largest US financial institutions, seen as highly sensitive to a US economic slowdown, only endured further volatility. Wednesday’s losses wiped out the brief rally in the shares on Tuesday, bringing them back near their lows seen after a 20 per cent correction on Monday.Leading financial declines on Wednesday were regional banks. Regions Financial fell 11.5 per cent to $4.23, and SunTrust slipped 11.5 per cent to $5.80. Wells Fargo, seen as one of the better-capitalised banks, still fell 7.7 per cent, to $22.88.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets recommended that investors should keep buying bank stocks. “It is important to remember that bank fundamentals are strong and we believe they are getting stronger,” they wrote.However, they also warned that regulatory uncertainty was weighing on the stocks. “The Federal Reserve needs to provide the [systemically important financial institution] buffers and a timetable to reach them,” they wrote.The troubles of large European banks weighed as well. France’s credit rating, much as the US’s was earlier this week, is feared to be vulnerable as European countries are all called to fund bail-outs to “peripheral” economies such as Greece.Glenn Schorr, analyst at Nomura, said: “Despite the low valuations, we believe macro concerns will probably keep buyers on the sidelines in the near term”.There were gains in the sector, however, unlike in previous sessions. Capital One, the consumer lender and credit card group, agreed to acquire the US card businesses of HSBC for $30bn, which follows its earlier $9bn deal to buy ING’s US deposit unit. It is now among the five largest consumer depositaries in the US. The shares rose 0.7 per cent to $41.05.“This is a strong acquisition for Capital One and complements the ING acquisition,” said analysts at Citigroup.AvalonBay Communications, the property management group, was up 0.1 per cent to $125.67, after it was named as a possible buyer of rival Archstone, still owned by the bankrupt Lehman Brothers estate.The market had initially slipped to new lows on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold rates near zero until 2013, but did not extend any additional liquidity programmes.After the S&P 500 dropped to just above 1,100, many traders stepped in to close shorts, believing that the Fed’s promise of liquidity could be a catalyst for gains. But the market quickly resumed its initial move at Wednesday’s open.“The Fed did not commit to a third round [of quantitative easing] yesterday. Some traders seeking a bottom may have inferred they were likely to do so, but they didn’t do that,” said Clark Yingst, chief market strategist at Joseph Gunnar.Mr Yingst said that energy groups and other commodity-linked companies would benefit the most if investors believed “QE3” of some form was imminent. “Hard assets will be what people are seeking if there is ultimately going to be a round three of easing,” he said.ExxonMobil, the crude oil giant, was down 4.4 per cent at $68.03 on Wednesday, and Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was down 3.3 per cent at $43.55.Materials groups CF Industries, the fertiliser producer, and Newmont Mining, the gold producer, were among the market’s most resilient performers, as the sector outperformed, down 3.3 per cent. CF’s shares were off by 0.3 per cent at $149.59 and Newmont added 0.7 per cent to $55.81.Retailer Macy’s succumbed to the sell-off, dropping 3.6 per cent to $24.52, despite the department store chain raising its full-year earnings forecast from $2.45 to as much as $2.65 a share.Polo Ralph Lauren, the apparel designer, added 4.5 per cent to $125.28 after it topped analyst expectations by earning $1.90 for the quarter, versus forecasts of $1.47.Walt Disney fell 9.1 per cent to $31.54 as the entertainment and media group missed forecasts for its revenues this quarter. Sales totalled $1.62bn, versus $1.83bn that had been forecast.Analysts at Nomura lowered their price target from $45 to $42 a share. “The stock is likely to be range-bound unless the macro outlook brightens or earnings begin to beat expectations again,” they said.
8;AVB;Avalonbay Communities;2011-08-09T20:43:42Z;Lehman estate eyes disposal of Archstone;;The Lehman Brothers estate is pushing ahead with plans to sell or list Archstone, the apartment company that it took private for $22bn near the zenith of the property boom, even as market ructions complicate discussions about how to proceed with Bank of America and Barclays, owners of sizeable stakes.People familiar with the matter said the banks were working on documents for an initial public offering, which could be filed by the end of the month. JPMorgan Chase has been retained to assist with a possible float.The group has also started discussions about a potential sale of Archstone, which could be valued at as much as $20bn including debt, or just a stake, with a select group of potential buyers, those people said.Possible buyers include EQR and AvalonBay, the publicly listed property companies, as well as Blackstone and Brookfield Asset Management, they said.Blackstone, EQR, AvalonBay and Brookfield declined to comment, as did Archstone’s owners and JPMorgan.Lehman led the $22bn leveraged buy-out of Archstone in 2007, as part of the investment bank’s ill-fated foray into commercial property. The estate of the bankrupt bank now holds about 47 per cent, while BofA owns 28 per cent and Barclays 25 per cent.While the Lehman estate is focused on maximising value regardless of timing, say people familiar with the matter, Barclays and BofA are leaning towards a faster solution, suggesting a sale rather than a lengthy IPO process.However, the market turmoil has the potential to shift the dynamic, those people said, as it makes the prospect of achieving a full IPO valuation more challenging.The banks invested about $4.8bn in common equity and provided more than $5bn in financing as part of the original deal, most of which was converted to preferred equity as part of a debt-for-equity restructuring last year.Archstone has sold assets since 2007, making it hard to put a value on its portfolio.“Assuming they have taken care of the assets, this is a very high quality portfolio,” said Andy McCulloch, senior analyst at Green Street Advisors. “The rebound in apartment values has been fairly dramatic, with values for some areas back to, or even past, their peak.”Toronto-based Brookfield is a substantial investor in real estate but has rarely bought residential property. The fund manager prefers distressed situations and tends to avoid auctions, potentially limiting its interest in pursuing Archstone.Blackstone also has a history of large property transactions. The private equity firm made a string of profitable sales after its $36bn buy-out of Equity Office Properties in 2007.EQR and Avalon Bay are residential-focused real estate investment trusts, with market values of about $16bn and $10.7bn respectively.
