0;NVR;NVR Inc;2014-09-03T18:05:28Z;Delta Air Lines forecasts hit US airline stocks;;US airlines slumped on Wednesday after Delta Air Lines, one of the largest US carriers, trimmed its third-quarter revenue forecast amid concerns of overcapacity on transatlantic and Pacific routes.The Atlanta-based airline said it expected third-quarter passenger revenues to rise between 2 and 3 per cent, compared to earlier projections as high as 4 per cent. Delta also lifted its third-quarter expected fuel costs.The industry has been buffeted by profit warnings from several European carriers over the summer, as demand for flights between western Europe and the US has ebbed.Delta noted revenue passenger miles – a key industry metric – on its transatlantic flights in August was roughly flat from a year earlier. Revenue passenger miles for flights between US and Asia-Pacific markets slipped 2.4 per cent in the month.The company’s chief financial officer Paul Jacobson said the airline was taking action to reduce its capacity on flights between the two regions, including trimming planned flight increases to Europe.Mr Jacobson, speaking at an investor conference, added the “Ebola situation, as well as geopolitical events elsewhere in the Middle East and in Russia” have had “an impact on our unit revenues”.Despite Wednesday’s declines, US airlines have had an exceptional run. The six largest US airlines have each climbed more than 20 per cent this year, while Delta has nearly doubled in the past 12 months.The advance has been predicated on consolidation and a relentless focus on profits – airlines have cut unprofitable commercial flights and increased business and first class amenities to compete for corporate travel. Analysts with UBS noted Delta still had a “meaningful” opportunity in 2015.“Assuming combination of sustained demand strength, reasonable supply growth, and further benefit from up-gauging, we see potential for another year of 3-4 per cent [passenger revenue growth],” Darryl Genovesi of UBS said.Delta shares fell 5 per cent to $38.82, American Airlines slumped 3 per cent to $39.14, United Continental slipped 2 per cent to $49.03 and Southwest declined 1 per cent to $32.58.Toll Brothers shares led US homebuilders lower after the company said net contracts signed in its third quarter fell 6 per cent, short of Wall Street consensus estimates.Overall, sales rose 53 per cent from a year earlier to $1.06bn while profits more than doubled to $97.7m, or 53 cents per share. Analysts with Goldman Sachs said they were concerned by the weakness shown in new orders.They added they were “not yet willing to read too much into” August trends “given this is a slower seasonal time”.Toll Brothers shares fell 5 per cent to $33.95, NVR declined 2 per cent to $1,146.57 and PulteGroup slipped 4 per cent to $18.18.Alere and Stericycle were under pressure after analysts with Goldman Sachs dimmed their views on both healthcare companies.The brokerage cut its rating on Alere to sell from neutral and its assessment of Stericycle to neutral from buy. Analysts with the investment bank said Alere would have difficulty surpassing year ago comparisons.Shares in Alere fell 1 per cent to $35.71 while Stericycle slipped 1 per cent to $117.82.Apple was the worst performing stock on the Nasdaq 100, declining 4 per cent to $98.94, a day after it disclosed the theft of nude pictures of celebrities from its iCloud storage service was a “very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions”.The attack, which Apple is investigating alongside the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, comes less than a week before the iPhone maker is set to debut new devices.Overall, US equity markets were little changed ahead of Friday’s monthly employment report. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,000.72 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 17,078.28.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 4,572.56.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
1;NVR;NVR Inc;2014-07-24T16:48:04Z;Builders slide as profits and home sales dip;;US homebuilders slumped on Thursday as two of the sector’s largest companies reported second-quarter profits shy of Wall Street forecasts and a new report showed a slide in new home sales.Results from DR Horton and PulteGroup fell short of expectations despite comments that demand has improved across much of the country from executives with each company.DR Horton, which builds homes across 27 states, said profits fell 23 per cent from a year earlier to $113.1m, or 32 cents per share. Sales climbed 28 per cent from a year earlier to $2.1bn, in line with forecasts.The company was forced to take a $55m charge relating to the Chicago housing market, which executives characterised as “very weak”. William Wheat, chief financial officer, noted DR Horton “[did] not have another concentration of underperforming communities” on the scale of the Chicago market.Rival PulteGroup struggled to jump start sales growth. Revenues rose less than 1 per cent from a year earlier, trailing forecasts.Sentiment across the sector soured further after figures from the Department of Commerce showed an 8.1 per cent decline in new home sales in June and a steep downward revision to May figures.“We still think the housing market will continue to recover given the upbeat news in most other housing indicators,” Daniel Silver, an economist with JPMorgan, said. “However, the persistent weakness in the new home sales data in recent years suggests that conditions are not completely favourable across the housing market.”Since the year’s start, the Philadelphia Housing Index, a gauge of the homebuilding industry that holds a market capitalisation above $95bn, has fallen 5 per cent.DR Horton shares slipped 12 per cent to $21.93 while PulteGroup declined 3 per cent to $19.24. Peer Lennar dipped 3 per cent to $39.26 and NVR fell 3 per cent to $1,131.67.The tech sector also remained in focus on Thursday, as better than expected results from Facebook offset declines at two closely followed industry peers.Facebook shares surged 5 per cent to $74.98 after the company’s profits eclipsed Wall Street forecasts and its mobile advert network continued to grow.The shares have now doubled from when they were first sold in a May 2012 public offering best remembered for technical failures on the opening day of trading.Wall Street analysts said the scale of the rise in profit margins was the biggest surprise. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, Facebook’s operating margin climbed to 59 per cent in the quarter from 44 per cent a year earlier.Results at Angie’s List and TripAdvisor failed to excite investors.Shares of Angie’s List, the contractor and plumbing review site, tumbled 19 per cent to $8.21 after the company forecast third quarter sales as much as 7 per cent below consensus expectations.TripAdvisor shares declined 5 per cent to $101.79 after the tech company reported earnings below analyst forecasts, despite a 31 per cent jump in sales.Analysts with broker Cantor Fitzgerald lowered their rating on TripAdvisor to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ following the quarterly results.Overall, the Nasdaq technology index rose 0.6 per cent to 2,185.03.Under Armour, the maker of sports apparel, led the benchmark S&P 500 after the company said sales surged 34 per cent from a year earlier to $610m, buoyed by sales of new running shoes.Shares of the company, which also lifted its full-year sales outlook to as much as $3bn, soared 15 per cent to $69.55.Caterpillar remained under pressure after executives warned it was “too soon to suggest” that its mining business, which underpinned much of its success earlier this decade, was turning around.Caterpillar net revenues fell 3 per cent from a year earlier to $14.2bn as sales in its resource division slid 29 per cent. Shares fell 3 per cent to $105.04.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 1,987.98, reaching a new record earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 2.8 points lower 17,083.80. The Nasdaq Composite also dropped 1.6 points to 4,472.11.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
2;NVR;NVR Inc;2014-06-30T17:18:05Z;US homebuilders buoyed by sales lift;;DR Horton, one of the largest US homebuilding companies, was boosted by the third in a series of encouraging reports on the US housing market.Shares in the builder rose about 3 per cent to $24.58, adding to a recovery in the market valuation to previous highs as it overcomes investor concerns of industry weakness that emerged this year.DR Horton’s peer construction companies were also lifted by the improved sentiment.Lennar shares rose 1 per cent to $41.987. NVR shares gained 0.4 per cent to $1,150.60 and PulteGroup shares increased 0.4 per cent to $20.16.The latest report from the National Association of Realtors showed pending sales, seen by economists as a better indicator of the future direction of the market, had climbed. This followed a lift in sales of existing and new homes last month also.Pending sales rose 6.1 per cent in May, more than three times what was forecast and the best single month since 2010.May’s data, which the pending sales figures add to, suggest that momentum has at least picked up since the winter.Shares in volatile retail group American Apparel fell 6.8 per cent to 90 cents after the company said it had rejected founder Dov Charney’s request for a special shareholder meeting, days after the company unveiled a poison pill plan to defend itself against a hostile takeover.Shares in the company on Monday were 53 per cent lower than a year earlier.Mr Charney, the ousted chief executive, said the purpose of the meeting was to fill vacancies on the board, among other governance tasks.The board announced on Saturday that it had adopted a one-year stockholder rights plan hours after Mr Charney, the company’s largest shareholder, had launched new efforts to increase his 27 per cent stake in the indebted company.The company, which holds $250m in debt, said the pill would be triggered if any shareholder with more than 15 per cent of its shares planned to increase his or her stake.Yahoo shares climbed 3 per cent to $35.13 after a Piper Jaffray analyst upgraded the technology company’s shares to “overweight” from “neutral”, with a target price of $43, up from $37.The upgrade was made on the grounds that the company’s stake in Alibaba was undervalued at its current price.“As we get nearer an Alibaba IPO, a more realistic valuation should be reflected,” said analyst Gene Munster in a note.The company’s core business is expected to continue to grow below industry rates, he said. But Alibaba “could more than make up for the challenges at the core”, he said.Shares in newly listed GoPro continued to rise 13 per cent to $40.55 following its market debut last week at an issue price of $24.On its first day of trading, shares in the company, popular with extreme sports fans for its wearable video camera, rose 31 per cent, kicking off its initial rising trend. The company boasts a market capitalisation of $4.99bn.The S&P 500 rose 0.04 per cent to 1,960.23 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.15 per cent to 16,826.60. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.23 per cent to 4,408.18.US equities were set to finish the quarter on an overall note despite Monday’s mixed trading – a positive close will see the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices record a sixth straight quarter of gains.That is the longest streak of quarterly advances for the Nasdaq since 2000 while for the S&P it is the best run since 1998.For the latest quarter, the S&P was up 4.7 per cent compared with 1.3 per cent in the first quarter.
3;NVR;NVR Inc;2011-08-31T21:20:40Z;Wall Street mixed on homebuilder strength;;Homebuilder stocks diverged after analysts made different calls on the housing market and which business models are likely to prosper.UBS analyst David Goldberg upgraded several companies and said the market for new homes had certainly bottomed.“Several valuations in the sector suggest the new homes market will get a lot worse [but] we believe fundamentals are at – or near – a trough.” Mr Goldberg said,Mr Goldberg upgraded Lennar from hold to buy, arguing the homebuilder’s financial arm, Rialto, which invests in distressed property assets, will benefit if the housing market recovers. Lennar shares were up 0.3 per cent at $14.70.Mr Goldberg also upgraded DR Horton to buy from hold as the management’s “focus on driving volumes, including emphasising [speculative] construction” gives it inventory to sell.He reduced his target price for KB Home from $11 to $7, because “management’s commitment to a build-to-order model …will probably lead to slower growth in a stable housing market”.DR Horton stocks fell 0.8 per cent to $10.52 while KB Home was down 2.2 per cent to $6.59.But other analysts did not agree that builders with aggressive strategies will outperform.“I wouldn’t be recommending their shares,” said Michael Widner, of Stifel Nicolaus. “The new homes market has been in a trough for 18 months now and we don’t know when it will turn.“Companies are adjusting to what could be a new normal of low demand for two to three years and it is prudent to do so.”Mr Widner recommended buying homebuilders with relatively little debt. “If demand stays weak, at least their balance sheets won’t be continually eroded by payments to service debt.”Mr Widner said DR Horton had one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector.He also said companies like NVR, which buy options to develop land, rather than buying land outright, are less dependent on rising demand.“NVR isn’t taking a bet on whether land prices will go up or down“NVR outperformed the sector, off just 0.04 per cent on the day at $636.50. Meritage Homes, another builder that prefers options to buying land, only fell 0.1 per cent to $18.99.Mr Goldberg upgraded Meritage from sell to hold, arguing that its “land light model, which focuses on optioning lots” should protect it from “further downside”.The broad S&P index rose 0.5 per cent to 1,218.87, as the ADP Employer Services survey suggested private companies added 91,000 workers to payrolls in August. The index has now made gains for four consecutive days, the longest rally since late June.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.5 per cent to 11,613.76, putting it in positive territory for the year, for the first time since the start of August.The Nasdaq Composite index of technology stocks rose 0.1 per cent to 2,579.46.AT&T shares fell 3.9 per cent to $28.48 after the Department of Justice moved to block the company’s proposed $39bn takeover of T-Mobile USA.Shares in Verizon, the largest US mobile phone network, fell 0.4 per cent to $36.17.But Sprint, the third-largest network, which would be dwarfed by both AT&T and Verizon if the deal went through, spiked 5.9 per cent to $3.76.Industrial stocks outperformed the index by rising 0.7 per cent after mining equipment manufacturer Joy Global reported quarterly earnings per share of $1.54, 4 cents higher than expected. Its shares was up 1.3 per cent to $83.45.Materials stocks in the S&P 500 underperformed, up only 0.3 per cent, after Goldman Sachs analyst Sal Tharani cutting price targets by an average 24 per cent across the sector because of weak demand from developed economies.Mr Tharani recommended buying Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold stock on expected high demand for copper.Mr Tharani also recommended buying aluminium producer Alcoa.Alcoa shares were up 3.6 per cent to $12.80 and Freeport rose 1.1 per cent to $47.11.The biggest riser on Wednesday was electronic broker E Trade Financial, after Rich Repetto, a Sandler O’Neill analyst, told clients that daily average revenue trades, or DARTs, in the electronic retail investor market rose 40 per cent month on month in August.
4;NVR;NVR Inc;2010-04-06T20:56:29Z;US stocks rise on bank takeover speculation;;"Shares in Massey Energy, the largest coal producer in the central Appalachian region of the US, dived more than 11 per cent yesterday following an explosion at a coal mine in West Virginia that killed at least 25 people.The disaster was the worst of its kind for fatalities in the US since 1984.Federal inspectors have already fined the company more than $382,000 for repeated serious violations involving its ventilation plan and equipment at the mine, the Associated Press reported yesterday.Massey’s shares sank 11.4 per cent to $48.45.Elsewhere, US stock prices fluctuated around the flat level yesterday for much of the session but swung modestly higher after the release of the latest Federal Open Market Committee minutes.Continuing Greek sovereign debt problems weighed on investor sentiment. However, takeover speculation among regional banks gave some support.“The market is on guard for a discount rate hike,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.Looking forward to next week’s start of the earnings season, Mr Kalivas said: “The market is pricing strong results, and the reaction to friendly news next week will provide insight into the market’s ability to move higher into May and June.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent at 1,189.44, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat to 10,969.99 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent higher at 2,436.81.The Vix index, closely-watched as a guide to risk aversion, fell 3.8 per cent to 16.4.Regional banks were some of the highest rising stocks in the S&P 500 index, helped by speculation that some may be takeover targets for overseas financial groups.Regions Financial led the group, rising 4.4 per cent to $8.55. Zions Bancorp rallied 4.6 per cent to $24.27, Keycorp was up 3.8 per cent to $8.47 and SunTrust Banks added 3.5 per cent to $28.71.CA, a leading maker of software for mainframe computers, fell 1.9 per cent to $23.40 as the company said it expected its profit in 2010 to be at the lower end of its forecast range.It also said it would cut about 1,000 jobs as part of a restructuring programme – 8 per cent of its workforce.The homebuilding sector was lower across the board as Daniel Oppenheim, an analyst at Credit Suisse, warned that the sector could underperform the wider market over the coming months as demand for houses falls after the US homebuyer tax credit expires at the end of the month.KB Home, a homebuilder that caters to first-time buyers, lost 2.8 per cent to $16.51 as the stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “outperform” by Credit Suisse.In a client note, Mr Oppenheim wrote that companies catering to the lower end of the housing market would be the most affected by the end of the tax credit.Rival NVR lost 1.4 per cent to $727.44 as the stock was also downgraded to “neutral” from “outperform” at Credit Suisse with a target price of $750 per share. Pulte Group lost 2.5 per cent to $11.16, and DR Horton fell 0.6 per cent to $12.52.Shares in Teekay Tankers, an oil tanker owner and operator, were down 6.8 per cent at $12.15 after the company said it would offer 7m shares of common stock as part of its plan to finance a $169m acquisition of three tankers from its affiliate.El Paso Corp, which owns the longest US natural gas pipeline network, rallied
1.6 per cent to $11.66 on news that Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure fund backed by Credit Suisse and General Electric, had agreed to invest up to $700m in the Ruby Pipeline project in the Rocky Mountain region of the US and take a 50 per cent stake in the project.China Information Security Technology was one of the top risers in the Russell 2000 index, a small-cap index, gaining 31.6 per cent to $7 on news that the software company had been chosen as one of two suppliers to State Grid Corporation of China to help build a nationwide electricity grid.Microsoft gained 0.2 per cent to $29.32. Reports suggested that it was set to launch its long-awaited “Project Pink” phones next week as part of its drive to gain share of the growing smartphone market."
5;NVR;NVR Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
