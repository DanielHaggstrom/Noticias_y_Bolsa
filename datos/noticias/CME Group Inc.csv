0;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Samsung shares create Korea headache for US investors;Change in Kospi 200 composition prompts US venues to suspend related derivatives;US investors have lost their ability to trade some derivatives tied to South Korea’s benchmark stock index through venues such as Chicago-based CME Group, after a shift in the composition of the Kospi 200 triggered a change in its regulatory treatment.Korea Exchange (KRX), which operates South Korea’s bourse, said trading in Kospi 200 futures contracts on CME’s Globex platform would be suspended from Tuesday, as a result of the change. CME confirmed the suspension.Some institutional investors will still be able to access futures contracts based on the index — which consists of South Korea’s biggest companies — directly through the domestic exchange. But this will hinge on their ability to meet additional US regulatory requirements. The change occurred because Samsung Electronics, the maker of memory chips and smartphones, increased in value to more than 30 per cent of the Kospi 200, a KRX spokesperson said.As a result, the widely traded index moved from being “broad-based” to “narrow-based” under US law. The contracts were previously regulated by the US Commodity Futures and Trading Commission. They are now also under the purview of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The link-up between the CME and the KRX, formed in 2009, had allowed US investors to trade the contracts outside of Korean market hours. “We are well aware of the inconvenience this will cause to US investors but we have no choice because of the related US rule change,” KRX said. The exchange has said it would consider allowing for night trading of the futures on the domestic exchange for qualified institutional investors.Gary DeWaal, a New-York based special counsel at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman, said it was because of the nature of US regulation that a product “which was regulated one way on one day could be entirely differently regulated on a different day.” Eurex, the derivatives arm of Frankfurt-based exchange group Deutsche Börse, has withdrawn access for US investors to some Kospi 200 futures products.The Kospi 200 has fallen 16.7 per cent this year, while Samsung’s shares have fallen 11.1 per cent. “Samsung shares have performed better than other Korean shares recently on heavy retail buying, increasing the portion of its shares in the local stock market,” said Hwang Se-woon, a researcher at Korea Capital Market Institute. “The rule change will cause a lot of inconvenience to US investors, depriving them of an important hedging tool, therefore increasing market volatility. The problem could naturally be resolved if other Korean share prices rebound, reducing the portion of Samsung. But this will take time.”
1;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Exchanges and data groups get swept up in market storm;Drops in shares of CME Group and the like could be a signal that capitulation is close;"It is not hard to find evidence that stock markets are in trouble; the fact that key indices have snapped a decade-long bull run is proof enough.But the recent performance of shares in stock exchange groups and other trading houses is another discomfiting sign.While most of the market has been in a tailspin for more than two weeks, key trading venues had held up relatively well, buoyed by massive amounts of trading on their platforms. All that volatility is good for someone, after all.Although the sector had faced selling pressure in recent weeks, what had been striking is that investors have mostly treated them as defensive stocks. Until Thursday CME Group, the futures exchange, Tradeweb and index compiler MSCI had shown gains for the year as investors bet that market turmoil would boost trading volumes, and thus the US companies’ earnings.No longer. Top performers over the past few years, such as London Stock Exchange Group and Deutsche Börse, registered heavy falls on Thursday, while all three US groups more than wiped out their year-to-date gains.The industry that spans trading exchanges and data services has enjoyed a run of high growth since 2010, thanks in no small part to a favourable regulatory environment that has handed the exchanges, rather than banks, the greatest responsibilities to manage the risks of trading.The difficulty faced by new entrants trying to break into this world has helped CME and data provider S&P Global to more than treble over that period, giving them market values of $75bn and $63bn respectively.The S&P 500 Financial Exchanges & Data Index, which covers some of the biggest players in US markets, has not been unscathed, down about 14 per cent from the start of the year. But compare that to the KBW Banks index, the US sector benchmark, which is down by more than one-third over the same period to leave it trading on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 8, about half its average level. The forward p/e ratio of the exchanges and data sector has fallen from 31 to 24, about in line with its long-term average.Regulators have judged banks to be more resilient than they were during the last big crisis in 2008, thanks to tougher standards on capital and liquidity. But they remain at the mercy of fast-falling interest rates and credit risks — and even the big drop in crude.Berenberg analyst Chris Turner notes that such forces are largely irrelevant for exchange and data groups like the LSE or Nasdaq. Nor are they much affected by other scenarios that regulators build in to stress tests for the banks, like big falls in asset prices or consumer confidence.Which is why the recent slumps in share prices are noteworthy. Further rapid, heavy declines would suggest the moment of maximum fear — and a floor for the market — is near."

The move reflects shifting consumer tastes away from processed cheese and towards fresher and more healthy choices — and the growing popularity of foods that use large amounts of the dairy goods, such as Italian and Mexican dishes.The new contracts will sit alongside the Chicago exchange’s existing cheese contracts, which are based on a blended monthly average price of block and barrel cheese.In the US, the food is typically sold in 40-pound blocks — about the size of a carry-on suitcase — or 500-pound barrels. Food manufacturers and restaurants typically buy the fresher block cheese, while the barrel cheese, which has more preservatives, is more commonly used in powders or processed brands such as Kraft’s Velveeta. The latter has been hit by a shift to healthier products and private-label brands.Until two years ago the price spread between the physical goods of block and barrel cheese rarely averaged more than five cents, but widened as much as 37 cents in September as buyers paid higher prices for block cheese.CME’s future contracts will be settled in cash and are priced to the monthly average for 40-pound block cheddar cheese, as reported to the US Department of Agriculture.“Our clients continue to look for tools to manage their price exposure in physical cheese markets, including food manufacturers and processors of cheese,” said Tim Andriesen, managing director of agricultural products at CME.Open interest — the number of commodities contracts outstanding — in CME’s existing futures and options combined is 42,000 contracts. An average of 915 contracts trade each day.The average US consumer ate 11.2 pounds of American cheddar cheese in 2018, compared to 9.04 pounds in 1995, according to US government data. Other cheeses such as mozzarella, Monterey and Colby have grown in popularity over the past 25 years. Demand for US cheeses abroad, particularly in Asia and Latin America, has also spurred more production.Each contract represents the equivalent of 20,000 pounds of block cheddar cheese and will be priced in increments of $0.001 per pound. The contracts will launch in January next year, pending regulatory approval.
3;CME;CME Group Inc;2019-11-12T20:05:57Z;Nasdaq to sell commodities futures business to German exchange;US group fails to break duopoly in energy markets;Nasdaq is to sell its commodities futures business to an exchange owned by Deutsche Börse, ending a four-year effort to break into energy markets dominated by US rivals CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange.EEX, controlled by the German exchange, said it would pay an undisclosed sum to buy the business, known as NFX, which hosts oil and freight futures contracts.Spearheaded by former Nasdaq chief executive Bob Greifeld in 2015, NFX aimed to halve the cost of trading some of the world’s biggest energy futures contracts.Direct competition between futures exchanges is rare, as different venues tend to dominate in their chosen market, but energy is an exception. CME and ICE battle fiercely over market share in highly active oil and gas contracts such as WTI and Brent crude.Peter Reitz, chief executive of EEX, described the purchase as a “landmark deal” for the exchange in its attempt to break into the US seaborne commodities and freight trading markets. NFX’s biggest contracts are in US power, natural gas and oil.Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Virtu Financial, the proprietary trading firm, were among NFX’s early supporters. In spite of incentives such as zero transaction fees for the first nine months of operation, it was unable to garner extensive volumes. Instead, traders tended to stick with the deepest, most liquid markets where they can enter and exit without moving prices.NFX’s WTI contract traded 4m contracts last year, down 63 per cent year on year, according to data from the FIA, the futures industry trade association. The comparable contract on the CME traded 306m in 2018.EEX, whose revenues rose last year by 21 per cent to €256.6m, aims to complete the integration of US power contracts on NFX to its US subsidiary Nodal by the end of the year, and to transfer all open positions in dry bulk freight by next February. Other contracts will be transferred in spring next year.It has already pushed into trading in trucking freight futures, which track the spot rate for trucks on routes between several US cities.Adena Friedman, Nasdaq’s chief executive, has sharpened the exchange’s focus on growing markets, such as financial data and technology, and reduced the focus on underperforming assets such as fixed income and commodity futures.Earlier this week ICE said it would launch an exchange in Abu Dhabi to host the first futures contract based on the state oil company’s flagship Murban crude.The contract will set the price for the country’s oil and marks a radical departure for the Abu Dhabi government, which had a longstanding policy of retroactively setting monthly official selling prices for its mainly Asian customer base.
4;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Why the good times are unlikely to last for exchange groups;Steady accumulation of assets across the trading spectrum raises risks;"Shares of CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange are at record highs, underscoring investors’ enthusiasm for companies that run the infrastructure for global markets.With equity capitalisations of $77bn and $52bn, respectively, the US duo are the most highly-valued of the clutch of trading venues specialising in stocks, bonds, futures, derivatives and foreign exchange. Over the past decade, the Dow Jones Global Exchanges index has produced total returns of 163 per cent, more than double the 79 per cent return for the MSCI World Banks index.But is this about as good as it gets? Like the banks, which have had a very rocky time of it since the financial crisis, squeezed by all kinds of tougher regulations, exchanges could soon be facing challenges of their own.In recent years, exchange groups have benefited from rising demand for market data that investors can use to benchmark their portfolios and to manage risks. Regulatory winds have been largely favourable, while futures volumes have received a big boost from bets over the direction of interest rates.The combination of cheap debt and highly-valued equity has underpinned dealmaking, too. The London Stock Exchange’s planned $27bn purchase of Refinitiv, announced last month, is the biggest of a wave of transactions that has seen CME buy Nex for $5.5bn and ICE take on IDC for $5.2bn. Nasdaq, for its part, has spent $1bn on new investments over the past few years.Investors tend to like exchanges and trading venues because of their defensive characteristics. Such businesses take years to build; and then customers find they cannot do without them. That stickiness is reflected in valuations, with exchanges’ shares trading on punchy multiples of historic earnings in the high 20s — much better than the typical financial services firm.But the steady accumulation of assets across the trading spectrum raises risks. Those issues include not only being “too big to fail” but also technological reliability and, perhaps most pressingly, pricing power.Markets regulators in the US and Europe are now looking hard at the commissions that exchanges charge, and the fees they ask for services such as market data.An FCA study into asset management in 2017 concluded that price competition was weak and profits were high, based on average operating profit margins for the asset managers of 35 per cent. But over in the land of market infrastructure, equivalent margins are typically in excess of 50 per cent.Analysts are alert to threats to the top line: Atlantic Equities, for example, estimates that revenue growth at CME, ICE and Nasdaq will only be in the mid-single digits by 2020.But for many banks, hedge funds, high-frequency traders and asset managers, pressure on profits has become the norm. In that context, the exchanges look like an outlier. Calls for closer regulatory attention may only grow louder.This article has been amended to clarify Atlantic Equities’s earnings forecasts"
5;CME;CME Group Inc;2019-07-05T07:13:10Z;Aquis Exchange to expand into listings with Nex deal;UK share trading venue to buy exchange from CME Group;Aquis Exchange, the UK share trading venue, is to expand into corporate listings with a deal to buy Nex Exchange, the market for fledgling shares, for a total of £2.7m.Aquis struck the deal with Nex’s owner CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, for a nominal £1 plus around £2.7m based on Nex Exchange’s current working capital levels.The purchase will hand Aquis one of the UK’s licences to operate as a Recognised Investment Exchange — the highest standard for running a trading venue. Other licences are owned by the London Stock Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, London Metal Exchange and Cboe Europe. There are 89 companies listed on Nex, with a market capitalisation of around £1.9bn.CME had been looking to offload the unit since its purchase of its parent, the trading and technology group run by entrepreneur Michael Spencer for $5.6bn. A planned sale to Oliver Hemsley, the retired founder of Numis Securities, fell through.“We have a successful blueprint of proven technology and are confident that we can not only deliver growth but we can also positively address the current issues in small and mid-cap trading,” Alasdair Haynes, chief executive, said.Nex made a pre-tax loss of £2m on revenues of £1.5m in the year to March 2018. Aquis said it could deliver significant cost savings in the short term. The deal will be subject to approval from the Financial Conduct Authority.
6;CME;CME Group Inc;2019-06-27T15:40:56Z;EU plans to tighten derivatives rules rankles in the US;Americans call it over-reach and a direct challenge to the authority of the CFTC;Donald Trump arrived in Osaka for the G20 summit firing out barbs at a range of targets, including hosts Japan, India and the head of the EU’s antitrust unit, Margrethe Vestager.But other broadsides from Washington this week, aimed at Brussels, also have implications for the world’s financial markets.At a meeting held by the House agriculture committee on Wednesday US lawmakers lined up to tear into plans by the European Union to tighten supervision of its derivatives markets after Brexit. Brussels wants more direct oversight of clearing houses, which safeguard the financial system by acting as counterparties between sellers and buyers of shares or derivatives.The EU’s rules are aimed at London, because the city handles the vast majority of the €450tn market for interest rate contracts, denominated in euros. But the UK capital has become a flashpoint because it handles most US dollar-denominated derivatives too. As a result, US executives and policymakers see something more sinister in the Brussels’ move.As Terry Duffy, the abrasive head of CME Group, the Chicago futures exchange, put it at the hearing: “We are discussing a regulatory over-reach by the EU that is in direct challenge to the authority of the United States Congress and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to set rules and to regulate the US futures market.”US complaints about over-reach may bring a wry smile to compliance officers around the world, many of whom struggle with US-conceived rules, but there were other frank comments.One proposal to raise fees for supervision, as part of the EU’s reform package, “is an egregiously bad infringement under US sovereignty,” said Neal Dunn, a Florida Republican. There were sharp words too for a senior EU official who recently suggested the US “fell for” a March accord between the sides.“The EU is messing with the wrong tiger here,” snarled David Scott, committee chair.Brussels has said it is working in good faith and that its proposals would allow local regulators to police their markets.CFTC head Christopher Giancarlo has delivered similarly strong views to Brussels before, on its plans to expand oversight. Given the lack of action from the US so far, EU officials have tended to regard tough talk in public as Trumpian posturing, and the CFTC looking to pick a fight.But Mr Giancarlo has tried to reset relations in the past, conceding that Obama-era rules for swaps market oversight, for example, had gone too far. The House meeting should therefore send a message to the EU that unease over its plans is felt across Washington. Mr Duffy suggested Congress could stop US investors trading German sovereign debt, if the EU were to follow through.Calmer heads pointed out that such retaliatory moves hurt all markets. But what the EU proposals lack — two years after they were first aired — is details, especially over who should take charge of a clearing house in a crisis. Providing an answer to that question this summer could cool temperatures down — or possibly raise them further.
7;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;CME gains boost with new ‘micro’ futures contracts;Success for financial infrastructure industry despite investors turning more cautious;The Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s record-breaking launch of “micro” e-mini equity index futures contracts provided a shot of optimism this week.The new contracts trade in smaller increments than the exchange’s normal e-mini futures, which are widely used by investors to speculate or hedge against movements in the S&P 500. Those longstanding contracts traded an average of 1.8m a day in March.In comparison, the 1m traded in the new contracts’ first three days is relatively modest. Still, the debut marks the CME’s most successful contract launch — a notable success for a financial infrastructure industry in which investors are turning more cautious.The concern is that the heavy-hitting exchanges’ formidable post-crisis “supercycle” may be fading, a worry already visible in their stock prices. The DJ Global Exchanges index has risen 7 per cent this year, while the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 15 per cent.It is easy to forget that the sector fell out of favour after the 2008 financial crisis because investors were worried that more onerous capital and trading rules for banks would curb growth.Instead the opposite happened. The business of exchanges has been resurgent since 2012, along with growing demands for pricing data and benchmarks.Enthusiasm for electronic marketplaces remains high. Shares in Tradeweb, a US fixed income trading venue, have risen 50 per cent since the company’s stock market debut last month.But the worry is that the biggest operators have become beasts with more limited growth prospects. The market capitalisation of CME Group, the world’s largest exchange, has swelled from $14bn to $64bn since 2012. The London Stock Exchange Group has grown from £800m to £17.8bn.Exchanges often argue that they are increasingly providers of data, rather than simple venues for trading. By that measure, they are lagging behind: the exchanges industry has an average price-to-earnings ratio of 22.5 times 2020 earnings, according to broker Berenberg. Pure-play data services, meanwhile, such as FactSet, S&P and MSCI, trade on a forward p/e multiple of 32 times.Analysts are now paying greater attention to the industry’s revenues and operating margins. But turgid market conditions at the start of this year mean that is not a flattering exercise. “[In the first quarter] volumes and volatility have failed to materialise to any significant degree, making us increasingly cautious,” said Rosenblatt Securities, before the latest round of earnings results in the past two weeks. Like others, the brokerage is cutting its full-year forecasts.Exchanges could alleviate concerns over growth with a fresh round of supersized M&A deals, boosted by cheap debt and their high share prices.Alternatively, investors may have to brace themselves for a period of underperformance and take comfort from quick, small wins, such as CME’s micro contracts.
8;CME;CME Group Inc;2019-03-19T14:10:58Z;Former Numis boss Hemsley pulls out of deal for Nex Exchange;;Oliver Hemsley, the retired founder of Numis Securities, has pulled out of a deal to take over Nex Exchange, which sought to revitalise the UK market for fledgling shares.Nex Exchange has struggled to attract new listings as investor appetite for shares in emerging companies has contracted internationally. London’s market for junior listings is dominated by the London Stock Exchange’s Aim, one of the world’s largest markets for early-stage ventures.CME Group, the $60bn Chicago derivatives venue, took over Nex late last year when it purchased its parent, the trading and technology group run by entrepreneur Michael Spencer for $5.6bn.Prior to the CME’s purchase, Mr Spencer — who was chairman at Numis a decade ago — struck an accord for Mr Hemsley to lead a group of investors injecting £10.5m of cash in return for a 55 per cent stake in Nex Exchange. That deal valued Nex at around £20m.“CME Group can confirm that the previously announced transaction for a number of external investors to invest new funds in Nex Exchange will not now complete,” it said in a statement. “CME continues to support Nex Exchange and will be evaluating its strategic options moving forward.”Patrick Birley would now continue as chief executive of Nex, CME added. Mr Hemsley could not be reached for comment.
9;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
10;CME;CME Group Inc;2019-02-27T04:36:32Z;CME futures trading halted by technical hitch;Nearly 3-hour freeze underscores risks of purely electronic markets;CME Group, the largest futures exchange, suffered its longest outage in years, in an incident that underscored investors’ concerns at the dominant role the Chicago operator now has in the world’s equity, bond and commodity markets.Technical problems froze derivatives trading on the CME’s main platform for almost three hours from about 8pm New York time on Tuesday, disrupting a period in which thousands of futures linked to the S&P 500, US government bonds and West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for US oil, would have typically traded.Although global exchanges suffer glitches, in recent years many have succumbed to lengthy halts. In some cases they have triggered fines from regulators. The CME, which has a market capitalisation of more than $60bn, is a pillar of global markets that investors and traders use to hedge and speculate against moves in interest rates, forex and commodities. Trading on the exchange helps set the prices for the S&P 500, US Treasuries and the eurodollar.Larry Tabb, co-founder of Tabb Group, a capital markets consultancy in New York, described the disruption as “problematic”.“The CME and especially the S&P product set is a major issue,” Mr Tabb said. “It’s one of their largest and most important products that many, if not all, significant institutional managers use to manage risk. In the equities market there are 13 US exchanges and if one goes down the market can shoulder on . . . only the CME trades the S&P complex.” In January the CME’s newly-purchased BrokerTec, which dominates trading in US and European government debt, had a 90-minute outage.This week’s disruption occurred on Globex, the CME’s principal electronic marketplace. Of the 4.7bn derivatives contracts traded at the exchange last year, more than 93 per cent were handled electronically.All of its electronic futures and options markets were halted as of 7:07pm US central time and trading resumed at 9:45pm, according to a statement from CME. Price charts showed volumes suddenly vanishing in contracts such as West Texas Intermediate crude oil and e-mini S&P 500 stock index futures.Terry Duffy, chief executive of the CME, said the exchange had begun a minor upgrade to its systems an hour earlier. “It was just a routine upgrade,” he told reporters during a visit to London. “There’s never a good time to have an outage but there was no meaningful movements in the market. There was no impact to clients.”Yet the confusion that began in US trading hours spread to Asia, where Bursa Malaysia, which also uses the CME platform for its crude palm oil futures contracts, was halted.As trading resumed, futures moved in bursts of volume. The March e-mini S&P contract rose from 2,789.75 to 2,793 before giving up gains, while the April WTI crude oil contract fell to $55.93 a barrel from above $56.
11;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Exchange giants take their rivalry to Texas as shale oil booms;Battle of the contracts reflects Houston’s growing status as an energy trading hotspot;The world’s two biggest energy exchanges have taken their fierce rivalry to Houston, Texas in pursuit of business linked to the millions of barrels of shale oil arriving in the city every day.Last last year, exchange operators CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange introduced duelling futures contracts that track the price of West Texas Intermediate crude as delivered at the coastal city.The battle between the contracts — dubbed WTI Houston and Permian WTI — is a reflection of Houston’s growing status as an energy trading hotspot, as US oil production breaks records, Texas refineries add capacity and exports of crude soar.At the moment, oil markets in the Gulf coast region lack widely traded derivatives contracts, which is a potential problem for companies trying to hedge risks. Contracts culminating in physical delivery at Houston would be a purpose-built tool which reflect the city’s emergence as a gateway between domestic and international markets, exchange executives say.At stake is the chance to own the next major oil contract that some believe could be a major money-spinner for the two exchanges. CME of Chicago and ICE of Atlanta have earned billions of dollars in revenues since establishing the world’s two main oil benchmarks — WTI and North Sea Brent, respectively — three decades ago.US barrels are going to become more and more relevant to global oil flows.”“This is not our average contract launch,” says Jeff Barbuto, global head of oil marketing at ICE. “US barrels are going to become more and more relevant to global oil flows.”Exchanges owned by ICE and CME have competed in crude oil futures since the 1980s. ICE’s Brent crude benchmark is based on North Sea supply. CME’s light, sweet WTI benchmark is delivered to the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma — a small town about 500 miles north of Houston.At times, the price of oil at Houston disconnects from prices in the North Sea, Cushing or both, suggesting the new contracts could be useful to companies selling oil there. Volumes have picked up in recent weeks.“We are following the lead of the commercial customers that are telling us both with their investments and with their marketing where they need risk management,” says Peter Keavey, CME’s global head of energy.The contracts present somewhat different opportunities for each exchange group. At CME, Houston trading complements its flagship oil contract. “The key benchmark is still WTI-Cushing,” Mr Keavey says.For ICE, Houston is a potential beachhead in the US crude oil market, where its main contract is a “lookalike” that tracks the price of CME’s WTI. “ICE would love this to be a giant contract,” says Campbell Faulkner, chief data analyst at OTC Global Holdings, a Houston-based energy broker.Academic research has shown that new futures contracts are likely to fail unless they are substantially better at reducing risks than existing futures contracts, says Hilary Till, principal at Premia Research in Chicago.She cites the economist Holbrook Working’s conclusion that commercial traders would choose an imperfectly tailored futures contract — such as WTI-Cushing to manage risks at Houston — if it protected them against extreme losses, and if the cost of entering and exiting the market were small.CME’s WTI-Cushing and ICE Brent are already deeply traded markets with daily volumes hundreds of times higher than the Houston contracts.“The history of well-designed futures contracts not gaining traction is very long,” Ms Till says.The new CME contract is delivered at Houston terminals owned by Enterprise Products Partners. Its rules require oil with gravity, or density, that measures within a narrow band of 40-44 “degrees”. The oil may contain no more than 0.275 per cent sulphur content and four parts per million of the metals nickel and vanadium.ICE’s contract is delivered at Houston terminals owned by Magellan Midstream Partners, whose specifications allow oil with a wider gravity band of 36-44 degrees and a sulphur cap of 0.45 per cent.“We have a tighter spec,” CME’s Mr Keavey says.ICE, however, has been publishing monthly average readings of gravity, sulphur and metals to demonstrate the consistent quality of the WTI underpinning its contract. The unblended crude is tapped from pipelines running straight from oilfields in west Texas’s Permian Basin, according to the exchange company.“We're really betting that quality control all the way from the wellhead to the water is going to make the difference,” Mr Barbuto says.Dennis Sutton, executive director of the Crude Oil Quality Association, an industry group, says ICE’s reports “could lead me to believe that it is better quality,” but he noted that the figures were averages which could mask day-to-day variation.“If I had crude buyers asking me which ones should I buy and how much should I pay, I’d need to run the numbers through more sophisticated linear program models to come up with the answers,” says Mr Sutton, a former Marathon Petroleum executive.The push to establish a Gulf coast crude oil price standard comes as S&P Global Platts, whose North Sea price assessments form part of the physical trading market, is examining whether to incorporate other light, sweet oil streams into its daily snapshots of the north-west European market.This could include the light US crude oil captured by the Houston contracts, with Platts noting it has seen “regular trade flow” from the region. The Platts Dated Brent benchmark is intrinsically linked to ICE Brent futures, which together help form reference prices for the majority of the world's seaborne crude trade.
12;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-12-03T09:58:25Z;Eurex plans to appeal CME antitrust case ruling;;Eurex plans to appeal against the loss of a 15-year old lawsuit it brought against CME Group alleging the Chicago exchange had violated US antitrust laws to stop a rival venture from getting off the ground.The group, the derivatives bourse of Deutsche Börse, filed a notice confirming its intention in an Illinois district court late on Friday.It is trying to overturn a judge’s ruling month ago, which found against Eurex’s charge that the CME and its subsidiary, the Chicago Board of Trade, had broken rules in order to defend its home turf. Eurex declined to comment further.The move will prolong a case which dates back to 2003 but which the CME had felt was over. At the time under scrutiny, CBOT was independent but has been owned by the CME for more than a decade. CME declined to comment on Eurex’s filing.After the ruling was made public, CME said it was “extremely pleased to be vindicated from these baseless antitrust charges.” Eurex had, by its own admission, failed to compete in the US market “due to its own mis-steps,” CME added.The notice to appeal was filed by Morgan, Lewis and & Bockius, the law firm which has been representing Eurex during the case.After years of delays the case had been slated to be heard in early June and observers expected it to shed light on the influence of CME, which is worth more than $64bn, in both Chicago and Washington.But the trial was cancelled at late notice and Judge Thomas Durkin ruled in the CME’s favour by summary judgment, which is a ruling without trial.Eurex had tried to take market share in prized contracts like Treasury bond futures from the CBOT, via a venue called US Futures Exchange. It planned to use the same clearing house as CBOT, but CBOT later switched clearing of its contracts to the CME. Eurex could not win much market share.
13;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-11-07T05:00:27Z;Market cops step up fight against spoofing;After a slow start, regulators and exchanges take more action against market abuse;Criminal charges unveiled against a former JPMorgan Chase metals trader this week signalled that authorities are catching up with spoofing, a form of abuse that accelerated along with hyperfast markets.John Edmonds pleaded guilty to commodities fraud and spoofing conspiracy in gold, silver, platinum and palladium futures, the US Department of Justice said. His case reflects a broadening campaign to stamp out the practice of fooling other traders by quickly placing and cancelling orders.Spoofing is a manifestation of electronic markets. Bad behaviour that might have gotten a trader punched in the nose on an exchange floor years ago can now be furtively executed by algorithm. But such activity also leaves digital footprints. After a slow start, market cops have learnt to follow them. Mr Edmonds was the 10th defendant hit with criminal spoofing charges in 2018, the justice department said, a big jump in number. Prosecutors filed criminal spoofing cases against just two defendants last year, and before that just one each in 2014 and 2015. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the main US derivatives regulator, in its most recent fiscal year brought 26 enforcement actions involving manipulative, deceptive or falsely reported trades, the majority spoofing cases. The sum was more than triple the average number of actions over the preceding four years. CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, has this year brought more than 50 disciplinary actions under rule number 575, which proscribes spoofing and related offences, a Financial Times analysis of exchange notices found. This compares with 42 in 2017 and nine in 2016.Outside the US, Japanese financial regulators in 2017 fined a broker ¥218.37m ($1.9m) for spoofing the government bond futures market. The cases have nabbed perpetrators ranging from day-traders working from their homes to some of the biggest institutions on Wall Street. In January, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay  $30m to settle CFTC charges of spoofing in precious metals markets — the agency’s largest spoofing fine on record. The Dodd-Frank financial reform of 2010 explicitly outlawed spoofing, defining it as “bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution”. The CFTC issued formal guidance on the matter in 2013. CME expressly banned spoofing the following year with rule 575, though it said offences were previously prosecuted under a different rule. The rising number of cases in part reflects watchdogs’ efforts to improve their surveillance technology. CME’s automated systems can now detect spoofing more quickly than before, the exchange operator said. In February CME began sending detailed order data to the CFTC on a daily basis. “We have worked with the Department of Justice on one hand, and exchanges on the other, to make sure we’re uncovering as much of this conduct as we can,” said James McDonald, CFTC enforcement director. The agency’s actions, “we hope, ultimately will have a long-term deterrent effect”. Mr McDonald said the existence of spoofing causes others to retreat from a market, damaging liquidity. “We’ve talked to market makers who have turned off their algorithms or have withdrawn from the market when they’ve seen disruptive trading patterns,” he said.Spoofing charges are a lot easier for the government to prove than a more sophisticated manipulation caseConcerns about price rigging have long persisted in precious metals markets, with small gold and silver investors expressing the most vociferous complaints. But the CFTC in 2013 closed a long investigation into silver futures misconduct, announcing “there is not a viable basis to bring an enforcement action”. Standard market-manipulation cases require proof a trader caused an “artificial price”. That has historically been a high bar to clear. The spoofing statute is simpler, according to Aitan Goelman, who was CFTC enforcement director until last year. It only requires the agency to show an individual intended to cancel a bid before execution.“The anti-spoofing statue is really useful because as long as you can prove intent at that one moment in time, you don’t have to go any further” in terms of motive, said Mr Goelman, now a partner at Zuckerman Spaeder. “I think that’s why it’s been increasingly popular.” Or, as Paul Pantano, a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said: “Spoofing charges are a lot easier for the government to prove than a more sophisticated manipulation case.”A Chicago jury delivered the first criminal spoofing conviction in 2015. The defendant, Michael Coscia, lost his appeals and was sentenced to a three-year prison term for spoofing gold, soyabean oil and currency futures markets. He was previously found liable to civil charges of spoofing. Prosecutors have now turned their sights on the vendors to defendants accused of spoofing. In January they unsealed criminal charges  against Jitesh Thakkar, a Chicago technology consultant, for allegedly designing a computer program that helped UK day trader Navinder Singh Sarao to spoof the e-mini S&P 500 futures contract. “In this case, the government stretches the recently enacted ‘spoofing’ statute far further than it ever has before, charging the owner of a small software company with ‘aiding’ and ‘conspiring with’ a trader who used software created by the company years later to trade in the financial markets,” Mr Thakkar’s attorney, Renato Mariotti, wrote in a court filing. Mr Mariotti, in his previous job as a federal prosecutor, won the path-breaking conviction against Mr Coscia. Authorities may have more cases in the pipeline. The charging document against Mr Edmonds, whose lawyer did not respond to a request for comment, indicated he learnt his deceptive strategy from more senior traders at his bank, and that “he personally deployed this strategy hundreds of times with the knowledge and consent of his immediate supervisors”. JPMorgan declined to comment.

They also have regulatory approval from markets authorities in the UK, US, Germany, Italy and Sweden, they said.If completed CME, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, will also be the dominant player in the $500bn a day market for US government debt. It will also net Michael Spencer, Nex’s chief executive, biggest shareholder and driving force, more than £750m.The deal is now awaiting a formal ruling from the UK’s antitrust authorities, which is due on November 8.Under the deal, agreed in March, CME will pay 500p in cash and 0.0444 new shares for each Nex share, in a deal initially valued at around £10 per share, or £3.9bn. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.
15;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-09-12T03:01:27Z;Libor alternative streaks ahead of bitcoin futures;For CME, Sofr has had a cumulative notional volume of $711bn whereas bitcoin’s is $25bn;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, has launched two notable futures contracts in the past nine months.One, bitcoin futures in December, has received massive attention. To rather less fanfare, in April it debuted futures on Sofr, US authorities’ preferred alternative to the Libor interest rate benchmark. Less than five months on, and already the latter is beginning to show signs of strength.In 85 trading days, the Chicago exchange has had a cumulative notional volume in Sofr futures of $711bn, or 278,000 contracts. There has been more than $105bnin notional open interest on Sofr futures, with more than 6,000 contracts a day traded in August.Some of that early demand is because household institutions such as Fannie Mae, MetLife and the World Bank have begun issuing debt that uses Sofr, rather than Libor, as its reference rate.By contrast, in 181 days of trading bitcoin futures, cumulative notional volume is $25bn, from 624,000 contracts. There have been about 5,800 contracts traded daily in the third quarter, according to the CME.Undoubtedly, the collapse in the price of bitcoin has played a part. It was volatile again this week after US market regulators temporarily halted trading in two exchange-traded notes that track cryptocurrencies.Neither contract can yet challenge CME’s supremacy on the euro-dollar contract, which anticipates the interest rate offered on US dollar-denominated deposits held in European banks. It typically trades more than 2m contracts a day.The market’s switch away from Libor is only in its infancy. Nevertheless, it illustrates how far bitcoin futures have to go to break into the mainstream.Read more: CME pursuit of Nex reflects shift in US money markets
16;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-08-21T04:00:28Z;CME pulls ahead in race to control bitcoin futures;Rival Cboe relaxes trading rules in attempt to bolster cryptocurrency business;The world’s largest exchange group is pulling ahead in the nascent bitcoin derivatives market and its rival has retooled its product to stay in the race.Volumes of bitcoin futures listed by CME Group doubled in July and have continued to increase in August, even as the price of the digital currency collapsed.Such growth has been lacking at fellow Chicago exchange operator Cboe Global Markets, which last December launched its own bitcoin futures contracts one week before CME.The two exchanges are under pressure to gain traction because it is rare for similar futures contracts to flourish in more than one venue. A third company, Intercontinental Exchange, plans to offer its own bitcoin futures in November.Cboe this month quintupled the number of bitcoin contracts any one trader may hold to match the limits in place at CME. The move would “promote competition” and provide “more of a level playing field” between CME and Cboe, “enabling market participants to trade between the two products”, the company said in a regulatory filing. Cboe declined to comment further.CME’s bitcoin futures volumes now exceed volumes of spot bitcoin traded on San Francisco-based Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange.This month, daily futures volumes have averaged more than 30,000 bitcoin equivalent on CME and 5,000 on Cboe, according to data from the exchanges. Coinbase volumes have averaged more than 11,000 bitcoin, said Coinalyze, a cryptocurrency information service. Coinbase had no comment.Both CME and Cboe have sought to build liquidity by paying high-volume traders. Last week, CME extended a programme of rebates for bitcoin market-makers until at least February 2019, a regulatory filing showed.CME said more than 1,600 accounts have traded its bitcoin futures. The market remains tiny, however: CME’s total exchange volumes averaged 13.5m contracts per day in July.
17;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-07-26T14:10:11Z;CME profits miss despite bump in trading volumes;Concerns around global protectionism sparked higher trade, particularly in agricultural products;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, today reported mixed earnings, tempered by trade concerns fuelling volumes as investors sought to protect against price fluctuations.Despite reporting record growth in futures and options trading, earnings per share rose to $1.66, from $1.22 for the same period last year, below analyst expectations of $1.72 per share. Adjusting for special items, CME’s earnings per share rose to $1.74.Asked by analysts about the impact of ongoing trade disputes between the US and its trading partners, Derek Sammann, global head of Commodities and Options products, said it had boosted trading volumes, especially for agricultural products.He noted that on Thursday, volumes in agricultural contracts were twice the exchange’s average, following talks between President Donald Trump and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker in which they agreed to launch new negotiations to defuse rising transatlantic trade concerns. “The announcement yesterday . . . that had a very positive impact,” he said.Chief executive Terry Duffy added that he would like to see similar progression between the US and Asia on trade to help the US agricultural industry. “I am hopeful for US farmers that it will go the same way with Asia.”
18;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;Nex shareholders’ punchy payday protest;;More than 40 per cent of shareholders in Nex Group have voted against the UK financial technology company’s policy allowing management’s share bonuses to vest if a planned sale to Chicago’s CME Group goes ahead.Investors registered their protest against Nex’s remuneration report at its annual meeting in London on Wednesday. Just under half of shareholders who had voting rights cast their ballot. Nex chief executive Michael Spencer is the largest shareholder, and controls more than 17 per cent of shares.Based on feedback, Nex said the investors’ protests were because of provisions in its share plans related to options and awards if there is a change of ownership.Days before the end of the financial year, Nex agreed a £3.9bn sale to CME, the US derivatives exchange. It expects the deal to close in the second half of the year but the deal must first receive antitrust approval in the US, UK, Hong Kong, Germany, Italy and Sweden.Nex typically awards its executive management team shares as part of a long-term incentive scheme. If the CME deal is completed, 75 per cent of the executive managements’ shares will effectively vest and the rest will be replaced with a cash award six months later. ISS, the shareholder advisory group, had urged investors to vote against the proposal.Nex said it was “disappointed” by the reaction and said it “would review and respond to the feedback from shareholders” if the CME deal did not proceed.The vote means Nex directors have faced successive rebellions from shareholders over their actions. Last year they barred Nex Group’s board from making political donations after it used shareholder money to back five Conservative candidates at the general election. Shareholders overwhelmingly voted in favour of the CME deal at a meeting in May.
19;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-05-30T15:01:35Z;Italy jitters spur record Treasury futures volume for CME Group;;Options and derivatives trading on US Treasuries hit record levels yesterday as investors fretted about the political outlook for Italy.CME Group said interest rate futures and options volume reached a record 39.6m contracts on Tuesday, thanks to a hefty rally in Treasuries as investors scampered to the relative safety of US government debt. That was nearly 50 per cent more than the previous record on November 9, 2016, the day after the US presidential election.That took daily volume across the exchange operator’s suit of Treasury contracts above 50m for the first time, to 51.9m.The moves come in what has already been a year marked by high volume. CME said six of the company’s 10 highest-volume days have occurred during 2018.On Tuesday, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury fell 16.7 basis points to 2.768 per cent for its biggest one-day drop since the UK voted in June 2016 to leave the EU. Bond prices rise when yields fall. On Wednesday, yields were up 7.4 bps to 2.8423 per cent.As well as a swift market sell-off in February that saw investors pile back into US Treasuries, bets on the outlook for US interest rates and the march of the 10-year Treasury yield, albeit briefly, above 3 per cent have kept the government bond market firmly in the spotlight.
20;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-05-18T10:08:08Z;Nex shareholders vote in favour of CME deal;;Shareholders of Nex Group have voted in favour to sell the UK trading and technology company to the US’s CME Group for £3.9bn.At a meeting in London on Friday more than three-quarters of Nex shareholders approved the deal, passing the threshold it needed to proceed.The deal, which is expected to close later this year, will make Chicago’s CME the dominant market operator in the $500bn-a-day US Treasuries market. CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, also expects to generate annual cost savings of $200m by 2021 from the deal.“We are delighted that the proxy votes of our shareholders have overwhelmingly voted in support of our transaction with the CME,” said a spokesperson for Nex.The final tallies are expected to be published later on Friday. Michael Spencer, Nex’s chief executive and 16 per cent shareholder, had already committed his holding. More than 99 per cent of proxy votes cast by shareholders voted in favour of the scheme.The deal must now pass antitrust tests from regulators in the US, UK, Hong Kong, Germany, Italy and Sweden.CME is paying £10 a share, structured as 500p in cash and 0.0444 new shares for each Nex share. The price was at the high end of analysts’ expectations and expected to deter others from trumping the agreed bid.“We are pleased that our proposed acquisition has received overwhelming support from Nex shareholders. The combination of Nex and CME Group will allow us to create significant value and efficiencies for our clients globally,” said Terry Duffy, chief executive of CME, in a statement.Nex’s shareholder base has changed radically in recent weeks as long-time big shareholders like Schroders and Silchester have sold down their holdings to less than 3 per cent. In its place have come hedge funds like Marathon. Nex shares have largely traded 10-20p below the offer price since it was confirmed at the end of March. In recent days Nex shares have risen to 998p.The advisers to CME and Nex Group are expected to share nearly £110m for their efforts in negotiating the deal. Nex reports full-year results on Tuesday.
21;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-05-15T04:00:37Z;Exchanges face share price test from lower volatility;Earnings vulnerable to fewer consolidation deals and quieter summer of trading;With a few exceptions, it has been a good year to be an investor in the shares of companies at the heart of global markets trading.Daily activity in buying and selling equities, futures, fixed income and foreign exchange on global markets passes through a series of intermediaries, including exchanges and computer-driven market makers.Exchanges such as Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange Group alongside electronic market makers Virtu Financial and Flow Traders have all enjoyed double-digit share price gains this year, comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 and Euro Stoxx 50.Some of the upswing reflects industry consolidation, with high-profile deals such as Blackstone’s $17.3bn purchase of Thomson Reuters’ Financial and Risk division, and the CME’s £5.4bn deal for the UK’s Nex Group. Playing a key role has been the boost to profits from heightened market volatility seen during the first quarter, especially in equities and related products such as futures and exchange traded funds.A strong first quarter still resonates with the share prices of the global intermediaries remaining near their highs of the year. That may not last as, barring another bout of markets volatility, the first-quarter earnings boost shows no sign of being repeated.Cboe Global Markets’s Vix index — a measure of the S&P 500’s volatility — has returned to the levels seen before its unexpected spike in February.CME average daily volumes in interest rate contracts have eased to 7m in April from 15m in February. In the same period the average number of US shares traded per day fell from 144m to 117m. UBS estimates that monthly European share-trading volume growth has fallen from nearly 30 per cent in February to flat two months later.Even allowing for the traditionally slower Easter, that leaves some corporate earnings forecasts exposed, and a downturn may be more prolonged than the market is betting.If so there could be some painful adjustments on the way.
22;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-05-10T13:30:25Z;CME looks to bolster presence in US rates market with Eris deal;;CME Group is taking another step to claim market share in the US rates market, entering an exclusive licencing agreement to list Eris Exchange’s swap futures, a derivatives product that replicates an interest rate swap as a futures contract.The move, announced today, comes after the world’s largest futures exchange entered into a deal to acquire Michael Spencer’s Nex Group, which runs the largest inter-dealer trading platform for US cash Treasuries as well as a dollar interest rate swaps platform.Pending regulatory approval, the latest tie-up effectively brings Eris’s product in-house to the CME, without the need for an acquisition. CME has already built a dominant position in US dollar denominated interest rate products, like Treasury futures and eurodollar futures. The deal with Eris, along with the proposed acquisition of Nex Group, is seen as an attempt to claim new ground.“The CME interest rate business that has been primarily comprised of futures has grown in the last five years… from our perspective there is a lot to celebrate,” said Agha Mirza, global head of interest rate products for CME. “There is opportunity to bring additional products under the CME umbrella.For Eris, the deal brings exposure to CME’s larger base of clients.“We have built out our client base over the past several years and we are proud of what we have built,” said Neal Brady, chief executive of Eris.“But to connect to Eris you have to connect to an entirely new exchange. What this deal does is open us up to a much wider group of clients. It places the Eris swap futures on the same trading engine and trading platform as the world’s dominant US dollar rates complex. It’s right alongside Treasury futures, eurodollar futures and other correlated products.”
23;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-05-08T17:50:04Z;Cryptocurrency creeps into the mainstream;Institutionalising bitcoin lowers risk — but sends an unsettling signal;The irony is delicious. Bitcoin, biggest of the cryptocurrencies, was heralded as a technology that would set us free from the sclerotic institutions of a fetid financial system: central banks, commercial bank oligopolies, bought-and-paid-for regulators.What has happened instead? As an alternative medium of exchange, bitcoin has gone essentially nowhere. It has thrived only as a speculative asset — and, in that capacity, trading in bitcoin is being pulled slowly into the very edifice it was meant to pull down.It started in December, when two big exchanges, the CME Group and the Cboe Global Markets, launched bitcoin futures trading operations. This week, the assimilation continued: Goldman Sachs, most prestigious of the major Wall Street banks, announced that it would start a futures trading operation and is looking into the direct trading of bitcoin. The New York Stock Exchange, part of the Intercontinental Exchange, is reportedly setting up an online platform for buying and holding bitcoin.Why would major institutions support the trading of an asset that has no intrinsic value, no aesthetic value, no government backing, and is a nearly useless medium of exchange? There can be only one reason: clients are asking for the service.This is fine. Goldman and the NYSE exist to facilitate trading wherever there is demand for a market. Are credulous cryptocurrency investors going to get hurt? It seems likely. But so long as bolstering the market does not increase systemic risk, that is not a problem for the public or regulators to worry about. And as of now, bitcoin is too small to pose a systemic risk. Its market capitalisation is $156bn, half what it was in December, before some of the froth blew off. To the degree the market is rational, that figure will eventually arrive at zero, and there will be no systemic risk whatsoever. On the Cboe and CME, average daily volume in the most liquid futures contracts comes to a nominal value of less than $250m. The actual money at risk is much lower than that because positions net against each other. Fewer than 10,000 contracts are traded on a normal day. Across asset classes and venues, the CME alone traded 17m futures contracts a day in April. Bitcoin is tiny.Does bitcoin trading at venerable institutions give a veneer of respectability to what is, in effect, a casino — and therefore increase the chance the market will grow to a threatening size? It makes sense that it would, but this risk is offset by the advantages of institutionalisation. If bitcoin trading and futures trading is done on proper exchanges, then the volume of the trading becomes publicly known. If volumes become dangerously high, action can be taken. On counterparty risk (which, cynics will note, is a kind of risk that bitcoin was meant to eliminate), if the exchanges take normal precautions to separate trading from asset storage, that will provide a measure of safety.Finally, exchanges have clear rules governing the segregation and handling of client assets. Not so with bitcoin exchanges, where the holding of clients’ money is largely unregulated.Those of us who do not own bitcoin do not need to worry about it yet. And the institutionalisation of the bitcoin trading is, on balance, a systemic risk-reducer. That said, this phenomenon — major financial companies getting in on the trading of a nonsense asset — is disquieting all the same. It is just the kind of speculative activity, unrestrained by common sense, that one would expect to see at a market top.It is one more piece of evidence for those who argue that this long cycle is turning over. Do not worry about bitcoin. Worry about everything else.

The parties will have to wait for the court’s written opinion on the pending motions for a summary judgment, the document said. A summary judgment is a ruling without a full trial. The opinion could come in a month’s time.The move was unexpected after both sides had prepared intensely for the public hearing, and may shift its outcome in CME’s favour, as it has repeatedly failed to get the same outcome previously. Deutsche Börse and CME both declined to comment.The case had been expected to shed light on the influence of CME, which is worth $56bn, in Washington and the local Chicago market, and may have seen some of the industry’s top executives testifying.The CME’s political activity is well known in the futures industry. It has long been one of the bigger donors in Washington and Terry Duffy, chief executive, is a regular visitor to the capital. In the two-year election cycle to 2018, it has spent more than $2m on lobbyists and contributions, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics, which monitors US political spending.Eurex alleges its plan to wrest CME and the Chicago Board of Trade’s market share of prized contracts like Treasury bond futures, via a venue called US Futures Exchange, was undermined by the Chicago companies’ tactics. CBOT is now owned by the CME.The US Futures Exchange was a joint venture with Switzerland’s Six Exchange and initially planned to use The Clearing Corporation to process trades. CBOT later switched to clearing via the CME.Eurex alleges CME “violated antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with the business relationship and contract between Eurex US and The Clearing Corporation”, according to the CME’s 2017 annual report.The German exchange also alleges CME and CBOT threatened traders that supported the rival and pushed for delays to regulatory approval, in a bid to create doubt over the project’s viability among customers, court filings show. It had been seeking damages worth up to $1.5bn, the filings show. In its report, the CME said it “believes that it has strong factual and legal defenses to the claim.”It has historically been difficult to move liquidity in actively-traded futures contracts from one venue to another. However Eurex was seen as a credible threat to Chicago because it had successfully prised the lucrative Bund contract away from London rival Liffe in the late 1990s.Eurex had a faster electronic system while CBOT, like Liffe, still relied on trading by humans in noisy pits. Now all-electronic, Treasury bond futures have become one of CME’s biggest businesses, trading nearly 3m contracts a day.
25;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;CME and Nex to pay advisers £110m for negotiating £3.9bn takeover;;Chicago’s CME Group and Nex Group will pay their advisers nearly £110m for their efforts in negotiating the US exchange’s £3.9bn planned purchase of its UK trading and technology rival.The CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, will become the dominant market operator in the $500bn-a-day US Treasuries market with the purchase. It expects to generate annual cost savings of $200m by 2021 from the deal.The deal, unveiled in March, is constructed as a scheme of arrangement and requires shareholder approval at a meeting next month. Documents posted on Wednesday showed Nex will pay a total of £45.4m to its bankers, lawyers and PR advisers. Financial and corporate broking advice accounting for £37.9m of the total, with £6.6m to lawyers.CME will pay £21.9m to corporate brokers and £32m in financing costs. It will pay its lawyers £7m.Nex is being advised by Citigroup, Evercore and Goldman Sachs. Barclays and JPMorgan are advising CME on the deal. Clifford Chance are legal advisers to Nex while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom represent CME Group.The documents also show that Michael Spencer will remain as chief executive of Nex for up to six months after the deal is completed.He will then move to a special advisor role and would be nominated to the CME board for 2019. Shareholders will vote on the proposals on May 18.
26;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-04-02T04:00:27Z;CME rules out asset sales after Nex deal;Terry Duffy’s exchange is confident it can satisfy antitrust regulators;CME Group does not expect to sell any assets after its £3.9bn purchase of the UK’s Nex Group to satisfy antitrust regulators or meet cost savings targets, according to chief executive Terry Duffy.The US group, the world’s largest futures exchange, expects to generate annual cost savings of $200m by 2021 from the deal, which will create a dominant market operator in the $500bn-a-day US Treasuries market. Nex, run by Michael Spencer, operates the biggest venue for the securities, while CME runs the main futures markets that is pegged to it.Mr Spencer, Nex’s chief executive and 18 per cent shareholder, and his board have committed to the deal, which still must receive approval from shareholders and antitrust regulators.The two groups expect competition authorities on both sides of the Atlantic to wave through the deal and expect it to close in the second half of the year. However, other exchanges, such as Euronext, are watching its progress.Terry Duffy, chief executive of CME, told the Financial Times the exchange had “done its homework”. “To have what Michael has built with Nex, it’s the purest fit for CME to grow in coming years. I don’t anticipate having to divest anything.”CME is paying 500p in cash and 0.0444 new shares for each Nex share, which is at the high end of analysts’ expectations and expected to deter others from trumping the agreed bid.The Chicago exchange expects to incur a one-off cost of $285m to achieve its cost targets. It plans to reduce staff numbers at the combined company by 16 per cent, with jobs lost in IT, administration and sales. That could translate to about 750 jobs cut at Nex, out of 1,900 employees.Both managements have said there are no plans to sell Nex assets such as its EU repo trading business, which trades about €250bn a day. It is one of the biggest venues in a market that is a crucial source of short-term funding and collateral for banks. The European Central Bank also sees the market as a critical mechanism for transmitting monetary policy.“Selling that would be selling a crown jewel,” said Mr Spencer.Analysts expect CME to make deep cuts into Nex’s cost base, which Mr Spencer struggled to control last year. Nex has plans to switch more of its business on to cloud computing and make redundant most of Nex’s six data centres and thousands of servers around the world.Mr Duffy also said he was confident that rivals such as the London Stock Exchange Group or Blackstone, the private equity group buying Thomson Reuters’ trading assets, would not gatecrash the deal, even though the two parties have not agreed a fee if the deal is broken. “Whatever they want to do or not do I am prepared to compete,” he said.
27;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;CME/Nex: premier crew;UK fintech group looks like a big gulp for CME to drink down;A weaker pound and strong economies have boosted UK fine wine prices in recent years. They may yet pop further. Oenophile Michael Spencer should just about be able to keep up. CME Group has agreed to buy his Nex Group for $5.4bn. As with Mr Spencer’s favourite vintages, the deal bears a premium price.The world’s largest futures exchange will pay 50/50 in a cash and shares deal for the UK financial technology group. That should net Mr Spencer almost $1bn. CME dominates in US futures market trading, having bought Nymex for $11bn in 2008. Nex would add to this position.The Chicago-based group covets Nex’s US Treasury and foreign exchange dealer business, over half of which (by revenue) come from the US. The UK company will also give it more access to the $500bn daily cash trading of US government bonds. The other half of Nex’s revenues come from UK forex, European bond repurchase financing and some Asian business.Mr Spencer did not sell off his collection of trading platforms cheaply. It went for 40 times earnings. To cover the 49 per cent premium over the undisturbed price, CME promises to cut $200m of overheads. That looks needed, given that Nex’s operating margins are a third that of the bidder. Even so, and ignoring the expected one-off restructuring costs ahead, the taxed and capitalised present worth of those reductions falls short of the premium to the tune of $500m, a meaningful sum even for a company worth $54bn.Regulators will have to approve this, of course. Whatever they decide, Nex still looks like a big gulp for CME. One idea might be to sell the European bond repurchase unit. This could fetch a multiple of its proportion of Nex revenues, estimated at about $90m.Mr Spencer’s shareholders should raise a toast to this deal. But without an asset sale it looks pricey for CME.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Sign up at ft.com/newsletters
28;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-03-29T08:51:36Z;CME to shake up bond and forex markets after buying Nex Group;Chief executive Michael Spencer to net £670m from the sale;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, has agreed to buy Michael Spencer’s Nex Group for £3.9bn in a deal that heralds a shake-up in the world’s bond and foreign exchange markets.The deal was confirmed on Thursday after several weeks of talks and the price is at the top end of analysts’ forecasts. If completed, the deal would be the CME’s largest overseas acquisition and its largest since it bought Nymex for $11bn in 2008. A combination would put CME in pole position to potentially reform trading on the $500bn-a-day US Treasuries market, the main market for US government debt.The CME dominates futures trading in its home US market but has few assets overseas. The deal “will transform our international profile and broaden our distribution network in spot and futures FX products as well as cash, repo and futures products in US Treasuries”, said Terry Duffy, CME chief executive.CME said it would pay £10 a share for Nex, structured as a cash payment of 500p and 0.0444 new CME shares per Nex share. Nex said it would recommend the deal to shareholders.It would also represent another big payday for Mr Spencer, who will net about £670m from the deal as Nex’s largest shareholder. He will also join the CME board and serve as a corporate ambassador. Mr Spencer, one of the City’s best-known entrepreneurs and former Tory party treasurer, has ridden the changes in the City since founding Nex’s predecessor ICAP in the mid-1980s.It began as a punchy interdealer broker start-up in the nascent global swaps market and his brokers played a critical role as intermediaries in facilitating deals between banks in the over-the-counter market. Profits soared as markets globalised.However, he saw the market changing after the financial crisis, and in the regulatory clampdown ICAP was fined £55m for its brokers attempting to manipulate Libor. Mr Spencer earned £200m from the sale of the broking business to longtime rival, Tullett Prebon. Nex was founded at the end of 2016 to focus on electronic trading and the arcane and crucial mechanics of market plumbing.A CME purchase would mark the first time the same company owned the dominant markets for fixed income and forex futures, and their underlying securities. Nex operates some of the world’s largest currency and sovereign debt markets, and owns assets that process millions of derivatives, equities and currency deals.Mr Spencer described the deal as “unique” and a “signal of tremendous support for Britain’s financial services sector”.CME said it expected to generate cost synergies of $200m by the end of 2021 and to incur a one-off cost of $285m to achieve it. This would be in addition to the £40m of costs Nex is planning in coming years. Most will fall in IT and administration, which could affect about 750 jobs at Nex.The deal would also unite CME’s FX futures business with Nex’s currency trading venue, as the CME targets the global FX swaps and forwards market, which trades a notional $3tn a day. Nex shareholders will also receive a final dividend for the year to March 2018, which will not exceed 7.65p per share. Nex senior executives will also receive share options they are due to receive for the same financial year. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year.

FX derivatives have also been one of the biggest growth markets in clearing. Last year CME’s big rival LCH cleared $11tn in notional contracts compared to $3.2tn in 2016.
30;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Record ‘megadeals’ push global takeovers beyond $1.2tn;More than half of acquisitions in the first quarter were worth in excess of $5bn;More than $50bn worth of takeovers were being lined up on Wednesday, in a final flurry of dealmaking that saw global volumes exceed $1.2tn in a record-breaking quarter.In the latest sign of how eager boardrooms are sparking a record number of “megadeals”, Japan’s top drugmaker Takeda revealed it was weighing a $40bn takeover of Irish rival Shire.Concho Resources, a US oil and gas producer, agreed to buy rival RSP Permian for $9.5bn including debt and CME Group, the Chicago exchange, agreed to buy Nex Group, in a deal that valued the UK group at nearly £3.9bn.Despite a heightened level of political uncertainty, a potential US-led trade war against China and fraught Brexit negotiations, companies have embarked on an unprecedented number of big acquisitions this year. The value of $5bn-plus deals is more than triple year-ago levels, according to data provider Thomson Reuters.More than half of the $1.2tn worth of acquisitions in the first quarter — the fastest start to a year ever — have been worth in excess of $5bn.The overall level of activity is up more than 67 per cent from a year earlier and about a third ahead of 2007, the previous high-water mark for takeovers.The surge of big transactions — with more than 20 deals worth at least $10bn — has been bolstered by a desire by boards to head off disruptive technological threats and accelerate growth, according to bankers and lawyers who spoke to the Financial Times.The deals have been spurred by quickening global growth and robust business confidence, as well as tax cuts passed in the US last year that have added to the firepower for marquee acquisitions.“In an environment where growth is back, companies feel the pressure to justify the multiples they are trading on,” said Alison Harding-Jones, Citigroup’s Europe, Middle East and Africa M&A head.Dealmaking in Europe has more than doubled from year-ago levels, led by accelerating activity in the UK, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. Some bankers and lawyers expect the pace of divestitures to accelerate, opening the door for private equity groups.That was apparent in a €10.1bn deal, including debt, clinched this week between Carlyle and Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel for the latter’s speciality chemicals business. The acquisition is one of the largest European private equity deals agreed in recent years.Stephen Arcano, head of M&A at Skadden, said companies were being vigilant about potential political risks but for the time being there was no evidence that the pace of deal talks would slow down later in the year.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi and James Fontanella-KhanHere are some of the significant themes that have emerged in the first quarter of dealmaking in 2018.Morgan Stanley dethroned its rival Goldman Sachs from the top of the world’s M&A rankings in the first quarter of 2018, due to a consistent pipeline of megadeals in the first three months of the year, writes James Fontanella-Khan.Morgan Stanley advised buyers and sellers around the globe for a total of $385bn worth of deals, about a third more than the $264bn worth of transactions Goldman advised on during the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.The advisory division led by Robert Kindler, Morgan Stanley’s vice-chairman and global head of M&A, worked on fewer deals than Goldman during the same period — 65 compared with 85 — but on significantly more big-ticket transactions.Morgan Stanley advised on six out of the 10 largest deals, including US health insurer Cigna’s $68.5bn acquisition of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts and European media group Sky, which was approached by US cable company Comcast in a deal worth $39.8bn.Although the data for Morgan Stanley were slightly skewed by the inclusion of Unilever choosing Rotterdam over London for its single legal base — which Thomson Reuters valued as a $90.5bn transaction — the New York investment bank would have still ended the quarter at the top.JPMorgan Chase and Citibank followed the two investment banks in third and fourth position in the rankings, respectively.Centerview Partners, which jumped from 21st to fifth in the ranking, was the only boutique investment bank to make it into the top 10.The firm co-founded by Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan advised Express Scripts in its sale to Cigna and Thomson Reuters in the $17bn sale of the majority of its financial and risk assets to Blackstone.Bankers and lawyers are blaming regulatory uncertainty and jittery relations between the US and China for a 15 per cent decline in Chinese cross-border dealmaking so far this year, writes Don Weinland.Chinese companies spent just $25.2bn on overseas assets in the first quarter, while the number of deals fell to the lowest mark since 2005, according to data from Thomson Reuters.The only sizeable negotiation so far in 2018 was Geely’s unsolicited $9bn investment in Germany’s Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz.Behind the low deal count is a deterioration of relations between China and the US and more resistance against China’s acquisitions of US technology.“For me the biggest challenge is the regulatory uncertainty in the US and the future of US-China relations,” said Miranda So, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Davis Polk. “It’s this risk that has subdued some of the appetite for overseas deals.”In a report for new tariffs on Chinese exports last week, the US named several companies that have repeatedly bought US businesses and technologies. The accusation from the US administration is that Chinese policy and cheap loans from state banks were behind the flurry of deals over the past three years.But M&A activity is expected to pick up in coming months as China’s political situation firms up, although the focus could fall outside of the US.“The government’s new economic team is in place in Beijing and everything has settled down,” said Tang Zhenyi, chairman of Hong Kong-based investment bank CLSA. “Now the corporations can focus on going out, on going global. I think that means it will be a big year for Chinese companies doing overseas deals.”A series of sensitive political meetings kicking off in October of last year had disrupted deal flows in 2017, with companies such as HNA Group waiting for clarity on what types of outbound investment would be allowed.The crackdown was swift, just as much as it was unexpected. In short order earlier this month, the US government acted to, in effect, block the prospects of the largest technology acquisition of all time: the $142bn takeover of chipmaker Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom, writes Arash Massoudi.The use of national security concerns by President Donald Trump to block a takeover that had yet to be agreed was unprecedented and spooked dealmakers around the world at a time when the US government is pursuing more protectionist policies.It is uncertain whether a further freeze in global dealmaking will take a hold, but for now cross-border mergers and acquisitions account for more than $511.7bn in overall activity in the first quarter of this year. That is up 76 per cent from the same period a year ago and advisers see no sign that a slowdown is coming.“M&A dialogue remains robust despite concerns about the potential impact of changes in America’s trade and national security policies on deal activity,” said Stephen Arcano, head of M&A at Skadden.One area where the US actions did have an effect however was in deals from China, with companies from the country registering just 4 per cent of the activity so far in 2018.US companies launched more than $101bn worth of overseas deals, with the largest move coming from cable group Comcast as it tries to break up a takeover of UK pay-TV broadcaster Sky.Other significant cross-border transactions in the period include Italy’s Atlantia and Spain’s ACS teaming up to jointly take over Abertis, the Spanish highway concessions group.The largest European deal into the US came in January when privately held consumer group JAB Holding agreed to pay $18.7bn in cash to acquire soft-drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple and combine it with its Keurig Green Mountain coffee business.Global private equity deals have enjoyed their strongest start in five years, buoyed by the record amounts of cash flowing into the sector as institutional investors look for ways to boost their returns, writes Javier Espinoza.Buyout-backed transactions totalled $79.7bn in the first quarter, a 30 per cent rise from a year earlier. The figure represents 7 per cent of overall global dealmaking activity, according to Thomson Reuters data.The US saw the biggest increase in private equity transactions with a 52 per cent rise in deals led by buyout funds, accounting for a total of $46.4bn so far this year. In Europe dealmaking jumped 27 per cent, totalling $19bn and the most active year since 2007. Asian deal flow shrank slightly.The two largest transactions for the first quarter were Blackstone’s $17bn acquisition of the financial terminals and data unit of Thomson Reuters and Carlyle’s €10.1bn acquisition of Akzo Nobel’s speciality chemicals unit.Rob Pulford, head of financial sponsors for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs, said he expects activity levels to surpass those of 2017. He said: “This year is as good as last year and I think 2018 will be even more active. We are seeing the biggest deals in a long time.”Mr Pulford expects a bulk of the deals to come from private equity groups acquiring listed companies following a doubling in the value of such deals last year. “The level of dialogue and conversation around public to private transactions has accelerated from last year. Boards of companies have decided that what’s on offer is compelling,” he said.But as the pace of dealmaking speeds up, advisers to buyout funds have warned that there is a risk of overpaying for assets as multiples have already surpassed the record highs of before the financial crisis.* This article has been amended since original publication to correct the denomination of the Nex Group acquisition from dollars to pounds

A formal announcement could come as soon as Thursday, according to two people close to the talks. The two companies declined to comment,The price is at the high end of analysts’ forecasts and would value Nex, which runs some of the world's biggest fixed income securities markets, at nearly £3.8bn. Mr Spencer, whose near 18 per cent stake makes him Nex’s biggest shareholder, stands to make about £670m from the deal.A combination would put CME in pole position to potentially shake up trading on the $500bn-a-day US Treasuries market — the main market for US government debt. Nex operates the biggest venue for trading securities between banks and high-frequency traders.The CME owns the biggest market for Treasury futures, which has for decades catered to a broader spectrum of traders and institutional investors who use futures to hedge and take advantage of price swings in bonds.Banks have long favoured keeping the two pools of trading separate but are increasingly being forced to recognise that post-crisis banking and markets regulations have raised overall trading costs.In recent years volumes in the Treasury securities market have been flat while volumes on the CME’s Treasury futures markets, which offer a cheap alternative, have surged. Market participants are hoping the combination will allow them to save on the amount of capital they must use to back their deals.Nex shares rose 9.7 per cent to close at 972p in London on Wednesday as investors anticipated that a deal was imminent. CME shares were trading up 0.4 per cent at $159 in morning trade in New York. Nex confirmed the £10 offer price.After the CME’s approach was confirmed two weeks ago, Nex shares soared more than 35 per cent, partly on expectations that a rival such as Intercontinental Exchange, the London Stock Exchange Group or Deutsche Börse would make a counter-offer. Analysts had forecast bidders could pay about 850p to £10 a share for Nex, and make savings of 30-50 per cent from Nex’s cost base.Nex was formed at the end of 2016 in a split from ICAP, a start-up voice broker that Mr Spencer founded in the nascent swaps markets in the 1980s. He sold the global broking assets to rival Tullett Prebon in 2016 and earned more than £200m from a subsequent share sale.
32;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-03-28T04:00:55Z;Chicago’s CME eyes pole position in biggest bond market;Deal for UK’s Nex Group would bring together cash and futures trading in US sovereign debt;Shake-ups are rare in the world’s largest government bond market. But a successful bid from Chicago’s CME for London’s Nex Group could herald the biggest change in the trading of US government debt in a decade.The audacious approach by the CME’s hard-charging chief executive Terry Duffy for Nex, run by veteran City entrepreneur Michael Spencer, would for the first time unite the trading of the cash bonds — dominated by Nex’s BrokerTec platform — with an interest rate futures market that is in the CME’s grip.Analysts say the CME’s contemplation of a takeover underlines how the post-financial crisis landscape has forced banks — who have long favoured keeping the two pools of trading separate — to recognise the cost benefits of a common platform.For most of its history BrokerTec, the crown jewel in Nex, only handled trading by banks before more recently allowing nimble, electronic firms like Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial and DRW to use the platform. In contrast, the CME has for decades catered to a broader spectrum of traders and institutional investors who use futures contracts to hedge and take advantage of price swings in bonds.“There are a lot of buyside firms who trade derivatives with CME. If BrokerTec were to ever open up to the buyside, CME could provide institutions with seamless clearing and settlement for cash Treasuries,” said Jim Greco, co-founder of Direct Match, a start-up trading venue that failed to break into the Treasury market.Banks and high-frequency trading firms say a combination of the two companies should lower their overall trading costs as they will be able to make more efficient use of the capital that regulations require them to back their bond and futures trades with.According to a person close to the deal, the rationale for the acquisition lies in the tougher capital requirements banks face, their inability to offer market financing and the savings they can make from processing deals through clearing houses. Under UK takeover rules, the Chicago group has until April 12 to firm up its interest in Nex.If it does it will be the CME’s first overseas acquisition, its first major deal since it paid almost $10bn for Nymex, the commodities and metals exchange, in 2008 and only strengthen Mr Duffy’s position as one of the most powerful executives in financial markets.Banks and traders will be hoping a deal improves a market that even the US Treasury admits is inefficient and presents potential risks, such as non-settlement of bonds.A reshaping of the plumbing of the Treasury market comes at a pivotal time. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and shrinking its balance sheet, increasing the chance of divergences in the value of futures contracts and cash bonds.Many banks still perform the crucial role of underwriting the US national debt via huge and growing sales of Treasury bonds each month. But Kevin McPartland, an analyst at Greenwich Associates, a consultancy, points out that banks have also adapted their trading, and are as likely to trade futures as they are the cash market.As much notional business is traded on CME’s Treasury futures today as on the underlying bond market. In 2004, futures volumes were only 35 per cent of the cash market. “[It] now heavily relies on futures prices when trading in the cash markets,” says Mr McPartland.Bringing both markets together at the CME’s clearing house could also cut the amount of margin that institutions need to post to back both their futures and securities trades. A clearing house sits between the counterparties to a trade and manages the risk to the market if one side defaults. A deal enabling more centralised clearing would also hold an attraction for regulators who have been pushing for that since the financial crisis.“If we can settle at a clearing house, that helps make the market more efficient,” admits a cost-conscious head of rates trading at an investment bank.A transaction could also serve electronic traders, who complain that banks still control access to clearing and repo markets. Nex operates the main venue for the $5tn repo market, which investors use to finance their positions in the US Treasury market. Access is controlled by the banks.That leaves others relying on banks’ membership of the FICC, a unit of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, to clear their securities deals. The FICC is owned by its members, who are the investment banks.With a potential combination of Nex and the CME, one executive at a principal trading group suggested CME “could effectively be an independent prime broker to the Treasury market”. Prime brokerage is best known in the hedge fund world where it refers to a mix of securities lending, cash management and trading services an investment bank offers a fund.The analogy only underlines the pole position the CME Group will assume in the world’s most important bond market if Mr Spencer and his fellow Nex shareholders decide to sell.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
34;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-03-22T10:55:35Z;Spencer says he would be willing to stay with Nex in CME deal;;Michael Spencer has told staff at Nex Group he would be willing to stay on in a senior role even if his financial technology company is bought by CME Group.His comments came in an internal memo earlier this week and seen by the Financial Times.US futures exchange CME, one of the biggest exchange operators in the world, is weighing up whether to turn its preliminary talks with Mr Spencer, chief executive and largest shareholder of Nex, into a firm offer. Under UK takeover rules the Chicago exchange has until April 12 to make a decision.Mr Spencer said that any deal “was of great importance to me personally that any deal must be for the benefit of staff as well as shareholders (and indeed our clients). I can also assure you that, in the event that Nex is acquired, I will offer to continue to serve as CEO of Nex if so requested by any buyer.”Shares in Nex soared as much as than 36 per cent on Friday to a record 903p, in part on expectations that Nex will prompt a battle for its fixed income and foreign exchange trading assets.In the memo Mr Spencer added for the present, it would be “business as usual” at Nex and no projects in the pipeline would be cancelled. Nex declined to comment on the memo.Analysts have speculated Intercontinental Exchange and Deutsche Boerse could be among the bidders. Justin Bates, an analyst at Liberum, said a bidder in a competitive market may offer more than £10 a share for Nex. At that price Mr Spencer would stand to earn more than £660m from the deal.A CME-Nex deal would bring together the biggest electronic markets for trading fixed income futures as its underlying cash securities markets for the first time. “It would set a unique precedent,” said Rich Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill.
35;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME pursuit of Nex reflects shift in US money markets;Deal would strengthen Chicago exchange’s hegemony of US dollar-denominated trading assets;CME Group’s potential purchase of the UK’s Nex Group looks like a contrary move.The world’s largest exchanges operator’s influence in Washington remains undimmed while it has retreated from London. International investors prefer to trade CME’s Treasury futures, which track the prices of the US government debt, and eurodollar futures, which are a proxy for US interest rate moves, in Chicago.Analysts forecast operating cost cuts of 30 per cent by matching CME’s futures market with Nex’s fixed income and foreign exchange businesses. But CME made $2.3bn in operating income last year, and hardly needs Nex, which likely to make operating profits of £145m in the year to March, to grow. A stronger rationale for this deal is the changing structure of US money markets.Next month the US will begin publishing alternative reference rates for dollar Libor. US authorities are very keen for the derivatives market to adopt a new reference rate as some $45tn of futures and options business references dollar Libor. It is all traded at CME. Virtually all of it will mature by the end of 2021, when banks will be no longer compelled to submit to Libor.The new benchmark, called Sofr, is based on the overnight Treasury repo market, which trades more than $700bn a day. The CME will be the first to offer futures and options on Sofr as it seeks to build the new market.Among Nex’s assets include US fixed income and repo trading venues that both trade on average more than $250bn a day and a data unit that supplies analytics on those markets.Shifting away from Libor may also require more spring cleaning of banks’ derivatives portfolios. This can be done by tearing up billions of dollars of old, fully-hedged, derivatives trades — a process known as compression. Nex owns the market leader.A deal would strengthen CME’s hegemony of US dollar-denominated trading assets as the Fed continues on the path of rate rises in the coming years. In past times this push into money markets might have angered the big investment banks, who feared the growing power of the CME. The Chicago exchange’s bold stance shows how far their priorities have shifted.

The same goes for heavyweight bidders for strategic assets. The prospect of Michael Spencer, a City entrepreneur and rhino conservationist, auctioningNex Group has therefore excited minority investors. The price could be steep if a herd of pachyderms joins the stampede.The shares nosed up 30 per cent to 870p on news that CME Group had made an approach for Nex, valuing it at £3.3bn. Bosses at the US exchanges group should warily remember Mr Spencer is as shrewd an observer of business cycles as he is of wildlife. He sold out of voice broking last year.This meant saying goodbye to ICAP, the business he built up through the nineties and noughties, for an estimated personal gain of over £200m. The thrill had gone. ICAP had paid a £55m rate-rigging penalty. The rise of automated trading had made voice brokers — shouty folk who trade weird investments by phone — as endangered as rhinos.This left Mr Spencer with a legacy business presciently stuffed with financial technology assets. CME will be greatly interested in an electronic trading platform for US Treasuries. This would sit sweetly alongside CME’s Treasury futures trading operation. A Nex unit that nets derivatives exposure to reduce the outlay of banks is an attractive asset to numerous buyers.Nex warned on profits recently. This means the midpoint of the acquisition price range estimated by Liberum — 885p per share — would be a steep 37 times current year earnings. This becomes a thriftier 26 times, in line with large quoted exchange groups, at next year’s forecast earnings.Besides, Nex has fintech glitz. It could sell for north of £10 per share if big beasts such as CME’s Terry Duffy and Jeff Sprecher of Intercontinental Exchange lock horns. Mr Spencer would make £650m at that price.Critics of the City say intermediation is useless. Not to Michael Spencer.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

37;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-03-16T14:10:31Z;Decision time for Michael Spencer and his ‘beautiful’ creation Nex;Preliminary bid from CME comes after harder than expected first year for new business;Michael Spencer has not always admired CME Group, the $56bn US futures exchange considering a bid for Nex Group, the trading company he runs.In the past he has railed against CME’s stranglehold on the US futures markets that, he felt, shielded it from competition with Icap, a previous incarnation of Nex that he founded in 1986.But employees past and present are also keenly aware that Mr Spencer, one of the City’s best known entrepreneurs, is never too swayed by emotion.He built ICAP from a start-up voice broker in the nascent swaps markets in the 1980s before selling the global broking assets to rival Tullett Prebon in 2016.But he is also well known for his wine cellar, 20th century art collection, corporate scrapes, such as Icap’s involvement in Libor rigging and feuds with rival bosses. The charity day he inaugurated — when a day’s revenues are donated to good causes — is the best-known in the City and has raised nearly £140m over 25 years.Mr Spencer saw the way the wind was blowing as technological advances and new rules after the financial crisis ushered electronic trading into a world where deals had generally been negotiated over the phone. He sold the voice broking part of his business and, in late 2016, created Nex from the electronic trading assets of ICAP to build “something really beautiful”.Now the question is whether an irresistible bid will persuade him to sell, either to the CME or another exchange that covets Nex’s assets.“For Michael Spencer, this is the end game,” said Jake Pugh, an industry consultant.Since its creation, Nex’s share price has been underpinned by speculation that it would eventually be purchased by a large global exchange.After news of CME’s interest filtered out, shares soared as much as 35 per cent on Friday to more than £9, giving the company a market capitalisation of about £3.4bn. At that price, Mr Spencer’s 18 per cent stake — he is the largest Nex shareholder — would net him close to £600m.Staff at Nex have been speculating for months that Mr Spencer may have become a willing seller, particularly after the first year of the new business was harder than expected.In October, the company issued a first-half profits warning — Mr Spencer’s first in seven years — after it spent heavily to restructure its post-trade division, which accounts for about half of group profits. Its other main business — markets — has also underperformed.We are not just looking to acquire to acquire. We will only look at things that we think that will benefit our shareholders and our clients“Given the early stumbles, I’m not surprised the Nex board has been willing to enter into discussions and, frankly, they should lock the CME representatives in the room until they table an offer,” said Paul McGinnis, an analyst at Shore Capital.In recent days, Mr Spencer has been attending an annual derivatives industry conference in Florida where the heads of the world’s main exchanges meet and mingle with customers and the industry’s top M&A bankers.His counterpart at the CME, Terry Duffy, was not there but because news of the CME’s interest has become public, under UK takeover rules, it must clarify its intentions — “put up or shut up” — by April 12. Analysts and industry executives expect it to also draw out offers from rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange, Singapore’s SGX and the London Stock Exchange.“If I were an exchange, I wouldn’t be hiring bankers right now,” said one industry banker. “CME will have to show their hand in public. Michael will be very comfortable with this. In negotiations with Michael, if you don’t know who the sucker in the room is, it’s you.”For the CME, a deal would be its largest since its $11bn purchase of Nymex in 2008 and its first major purchase outside its US stronghold. Its dominance of the US futures market makes Nex an affordable target. In spite of the flat markets, it reported a record $3.6bn of revenues in 2017 and operating income of $2.3bn.It retreated from London last year, closing its UK exchange, but is working on initiatives that link off-exchange and futures markets.As Mr Duffy told analysts last month: “We are not just looking to acquire to acquire. We will only look at things that we think that will benefit our shareholders and our clients.”CME sees the FX swaps markets, which relies on prices from both cash and futures markets, as a growth business. Nex’s EBS trading venue is one of the world’s biggest cash FX markets.CME’s US Treasury futures business has also grown rapidly in the past five years, while Nex’s BrokerTec accounts for about 80 per cent of the market for US government debt securities.CME also wants to build markets around Sofr, an alternative dollar benchmark rate to Libor that is based on the cost of borrowing US government debt.Philip Middleton, an analyst at Nex house broker Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said industry deals typically offer 10-30 per cent cost savings. “Nex might offer savings towards the bottom of this range, as it has few overlaps [with CME],” he said.But others point out that exchanges are always in search of scarce assets. Daniel Fannon, an analyst at Jefferies, said the bigger long-term risk for the CME is “the alternative of doing nothing or doing something of greater size that will probably involve greater regulatory scrutiny. It’s an opportune time for them to be looking to diversify.”
38;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-03-16T08:17:49Z;Nex shares rocket 36% on CME takeover talks;Sale negotiations spark speculation of auction for UK financial technology business;Shares in Nex Group, the UK financial technology business headed by Michael Spencer, soared more than 30 per cent to a record high on Friday after it confirmed it had held preliminary talks about being purchased by CME Group, the US derivatives exchange.The shares rose as much as 36 per cent to 905p in the first few minutes of trade in London on speculation the Chicago group would make a firm offer for the London group. The price gave Nex a market capitalisation of more than £3.3bn.Later on Friday, CME Group confirmed that it had made a “preliminary approach regarding a potential acquisition of Nex.” It added that the two groups are “working together to allow CME to complete due diligence and determine whether a firm offer can be made.”Analysts also speculated the talks may start an auction for Nex, with other global exchanges such as Intercontinental Exchange, Deutsche Börse, Singapore’s SGX or even an outsider such as IHS Markit may be interested in making an offer.Nex operates some of the world’s largest currency and fixed income trading venues, and owns assets that process millions of deals in off-exchange derivatives, equities and currency markets.Since its creation Nex’s share price has been underpinned by speculation that it would eventually be purchased by a large global exchange. The company was formed out of the sale of ICAP’s global broking assets to rival Tullett Prebon for around £1.3bn. It was admitted to trading on the LSE in late 2016 at around 250p per share.

In the past he has said a hostile takeover would be “very difficult”.Nex has a market capitalisation of about £2.55bn.CME Group shares rose more than 2 per cent in morning trade in New York. It declined to comment but Nex said its statement had been made with CME’s consent.A combination of CME, which has a value of more than $56bn, and Nex would concentrate trading for US Treasuries. CME dominates futures in US government debt while Nex owns BrokerTec, the world’s largest platform for trading in the securities market. The two also compete in the spot foreign exchange market, although they have only a small slice of the notional $5.3tn a day that is traded.Shares in Nex closed at 670.5p compared to its record high of 676p.Arnaud Giblat, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said CME’s approach could spark a competitive auction as Nex owned many assets that were used every day in global financial markets.Intercontinental Exchange, Singapore’s SGX, the London Stock Exchange Group and Deutsche Börse “are credible and highly likely interested acquirers”, he said.Mr Giblat suggested that the CME deal stood a good chance of being approved by antitrust regulators, which have blocked several high-profile deals recently, notably the LSE’s proposed merger with Deutsche Börse a year ago.Many of the heads of the world’s largest exchange groups are at the annual derivatives industry meeting held by the FIA in Boca Raton, Florida. Mr Spencer is present but Terry Duffy, his counterpart at CME, is not there.News of the discussions were reported first by Bloomberg.Nex was formed at the end of 2016 in a split from ICAP, the interdealer broker Mr Spencer founded in the 1980s.The UK company has deepened a cost-cutting programme after a first-half profits warning. It spent heavily to restructure its post-trade unit, which runs the plumbing for deals in fixed income and derivatives markets. The business accounts for nearly half of group profits.

41;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Melamed, Sandner to retire from CME Group board;;Two grandees of the listed derivatives industry have announced their departures from the board of CME Group, having built it into the world’s biggest futures exchange.Leo Melamed and Jack Sandner will retire as directors when their latest terms end in May, CME said.Mr Melamed, 85, has served on the board since 1967, when the company was the member-owned Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Mr Sandner, 76, joined the board in 1978.Both men led CME’s transformation from a backwater that listed butter and egg futures to the dominant futures exchange for interest rates, stock indices, currencies and commodities.Mr Melamed fled the Nazi invasion of Poland as a boy and joined CME as a “runner” in the 1950s, according to his memoirs. In 1972, as CME chairman, he introduced the International Monetary Market, which listed contracts on foreign currencies and paved the way for other financial futures.Mr Sandner, a clearing firm executive, was CME chairman for three separate terms. Both men oversaw the 1992 debut of Globex, CME’s electronic trading technology, which opened it up to traders around the world and now handles the vast bulk of volumes on the exchange.They will serve as consultants to the company for two years after they retire. Mr Melamed has already been drawing a consulting fee of $300,000 per year from CME, a payment that will continue “until his death or until his termination of the agreement,” according to a CME proxy filing.
42;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-01-31T20:29:16Z;US derivatives regulator looks to calm cryptocurrency fears;Chairman of CFTC eyes measures to protect futures markets from volatile price swings;The main US derivatives regulator has moved to assuage brokers worried that explosive swings in cryptocurrency prices could destabilise conventional futures markets.Exchanges listing new futures on virtual currencies would be required to disclose the steps they have taken to receive input from parties including brokers and trading firms, said Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Commission staff would also examine the governance of clearing houses that handle virtual currency products and may recommend changes, he said.His comments follow a controversy sparked by the December launch of bitcoin futures at Cboe Global Markets and CME Group, two exchange companies. FIA, a trade group for futures brokers that includes Wall Street banks, complained that its members were left out of the approval process even though they bear the risk of a trader default.Prices of the contracts have been volatile. Cboe bitcoin futures have fallen by 47 per cent since their December 11 debut to $9,910 on Wednesday. Yet bitcoin volumes have so far been thin on both Cboe and CME.Mr Giancarlo, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, spoke at a meeting on Wednesday of the CFTC market risk advisory committee called to address “self-certification” for new futures contracts. The process allows exchanges to list new products without prior approval from the CFTC.On December 1 the CFTC announced that Cboe and CME had self-certified their bitcoin products, allowing them to be listed a day later. FIA wrote an open letter to Mr Giancarlo saying the process “did not allow for proper public transparency and input”.Rostin Behnam, a CFTC commissioner who sponsored the meeting, said the issue deserved discussion.“While the self-certification process does not expressly provide for public input, that does not mean that public input in the process of launching new and novel products is impossible or undesirable,” said Mr Behnam, the lone Democrat on the three-member commission.Self-certification has the support of exchanges because it gives them flexibility to compete in a global market. Cboe and CME bitcoin futures were listed within a week of each other in a race to take advantage of public fascination with the cryptocurrency.Kathleen Cronin, CME’s general counsel, warned against adding layers of rules, noting it had consulted with CFTC staff before listing bitcoin futures.“That informal process has worked well over the years. To impose a formal process, I think, unnecessarily creates administrative burdens,” she told the meeting.However, Kristen Walters, global chief operating officer of risk at BlackRock, the asset manager, suggested a more formal review was appropriate given the “extreme volatility” of cryptocurrencies.“Given the nature of this product, which is very different than anything we’ve seen cleared on futures markets, I feel that it’s dangerous not to go down that path,” she said.Even before the latest steps, Mr Giancarlo has said his staff was giving a “heightened review” of bitcoin futures. In addition to the new measures, trading was subject to seven special requirements such as higher margin deposits on the contracts.
43;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-01-17T18:09:55Z;Bitcoin plunges below $10,000 in worst 2-day rout in 3 years;Price fall accompanied by record trading in 2 competing futures contracts;Bitcoin plunged below $10,000 on Wednesday, marking its worst two-day rout in three years, only hours before the first monthly futures contracts on the controversial cryptocurrency expired.The most widely held digital currency has fallen almost a third in the past two days, reducing its total market value to about $165bn, on fears that global regulators will intensify their crackdown on market activity.The falling price was accompanied by record trading on the two Chicago derivatives markets that offer trading in bitcoin futures. About $325m of bitcoin futures changed hands at CME Group and Cboe Global Markets on Tuesday, equivalent to just under 30,000 bitcoins.Both futures contracts were down about 10 per cent in US early afternoon trade on Wednesday.The expiry of the first monthly futures contracts, listed by Cboe Global Markets, will be closely watched as professional investors examine ways to trade the volatile bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies inside the walls of a regulated exchange.Bitcoin prices have fallen to roughly the same level as early December, when US market regulators allowed futures contracts to be traded. However, some traders expressed doubt that there was a link between the two.“I don’t believe there is enough volume or open interest in futures to have any meaningful impact on the spot price of bitcoin,” said Garrett See, chief executive of Chicago-based cryptocurrency trader DV Chain.Settlement of Cboe contracts is based on data collected from the Gemini Exchange. By Wednesday morning on Cboe, 4,431 January-expiry bitcoin futures contracts — of one bitcoin each — had changed hands at $9,780 per contract.That compared with a price per bitcoin on cash exchanges of about $9,421.13. CME, the world’s biggest exchange operator by market value, traded more than 3,000 contracts on Tuesday. Each CME contract is for five bitcoins.
44;CME;CME Group Inc;2018-01-16T04:00:31Z;Filings reveal DRW’s climb into top rank of trading firms;A subsidiary of Don Wilson’s firm pulled in nearly $1bn in revenue in two years;A unit of DRW pulled in almost $1bn in revenue in the space of two years, underlining the Chicago-based firm’s ascent to the upper rank of global proprietary trading companies.The firm, founded by Don Wilson, reported $454.8m in revenue at its DRW Investments LLC subsidiary in 2016, according to accounts made public this month by UK Companies House, a business registry.The figure came on top of $470.2m in 2015, and provides an indication of the size achieved by DRW at a time when trading firms are finding it hard to make money in financial markets experiencing historically low levels of volatility.Proprietary trading firms bet their own capital on the world’s exchanges, often using ultrafast computers to execute deals in fractions of a second. Like most firms, DRW is privately owned and does not announce financial results. Yet the company has discreetly filed years of accounts for DRW Investments at Companies House, going unnoticed by the industry.The accounts put the subsidiary in the same league as top traders whose finances are known. Virtu Financial, one of the few publicly listed proprietary trading firms, in 2016 had adjusted net trading income of $414.1m, a figure that subtracts brokerage commissions and exchange fees from revenue. DRW Investments’ trading expenses totalled $76m in 2016.John Lothian, a markets newsletter publisher, described Mr Wilson and his colleagues as “absolute leaders” in the trading community. “Don not only has tremendous personal influence within the community, but he also has tremendous business influence,” said Mr Lothian, a Chicago-based former futures trader and broker.DRW has become an important source of volume on the world’s largest futures exchanges, and Mr Wilson has pushed the traditionally low-profile industry to advocate for its interests.DRW Investments’ trading activity includes fixed-income derivatives and other futures, according to a company legal filing, and it runs three types of strategies — making markets as a liquidity provider, taking risks on the direction of prices, and high-frequency trading — people familiar with the company said.In 2008, DRW took over Lehman Brothers’ book of foreign exchange, interest rate and agriculture futures when the investment bank collapsed. It was the only non-bank to participate in the fire sale.The same year DRW Investments generated $656.5m in revenue, the most in at least the past decade, according to its accounts.The statements filed at Companies House offer an incomplete picture of the overall business of the DRW parent company, which includes several other subsidiaries. They do not reflect gains or losses at those businesses. A DRW spokeswoman declined to comment.As well as financial figures, the accounts also provide information on DRW Investments’ battle against allegations it manipulated interest-rate contracts. A civil case brought by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission went to trial in 2016 but has not been adjudicated.The regulator is seeking steep penalties, including a possible trading ban, but DRW Investments’ accounts said management believed the case was without merit and “the ultimate resolution of the matter will not have a material impact on the ongoing operations of the company”.
45;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-24T16:05:45Z;Bitcoin swings wildly after its biggest reverse of 2017;Mirrored 30% moves cap volatile week of regulatory warnings and problems at exchanges;Bitcoin suffered a day of wild swings on Friday, tumbling more than 30 per cent for its biggest reverse of the year before a similarly steep rally. The frantic trading brought one cryptocurrency exchange to a standstill as investors reacted to warnings from global regulators and concerns about security in the nascent market.The cryptocurrency, whose meteoric rise has been labelled a bubble by many critics, fell as much as 31.8 per cent from its Thursday evening peak to $10,775 per coin, according to Bloomberg data, before climbing more than 34 per cent to $14,400 by Friday afternoon in New York.Bitcoin reached a peak of $19,666 on December 17. Friday’s lurch downwards was the biggest since the currency began its ascent from $1,000 at the start of this year.In a sign of the tumult, Coinbase, the most popular US exchange, “temporarily disabled” buying and selling midway through the trading day on Friday, citing “today’s high traffic”.It warned customers trying to withdraw funds into accounts denominated in euros to expect delays of up to 10 days owing to the “extremely high volume of transactions”.Steven Englander of Rafiki Capital Management said the moves underlined “a fundamental problem in trying to pick a bottom price for bitcoin”.“My guess is that there will be efforts to push bitcoin higher, and create a ‘buy the dip’ mentality,” he said. “But today’s moves reflect the issues that likely make the long-term equilibrium price much lower than today’s.”Other digital currencies also fell on Friday morning, according to coinmarketcap.com which tracks them. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, was 22.9 per cent lower at one point, before making up most of the day’s losses.The moves followed a surge in bitcoin prices over the past month that evoked comparisons with the dotcom bubble of the late-1990s. The rise intensified concerns that some consumers may not be aware of the risks of speculating in cryptocurrencies and companies related to them.Wall Street has also tried to capitalise on the fervour. Chicago futures markets operators CME Group and Cboe Global Markets both launched bitcoin futures this month.Data released on Friday by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission provided a new glimpse of the forces in the market. Its weekly report on futures positions showed that, as of Tuesday, small investors held nearly four bullish positions for every bearish one on Cboe. Their long positions constituted a third of the open interest in the market.In contrast, professional traders — believed largely to be proprietary trading companies — held bearish positions four times the size of their bullish ones, with a total short position that was 65 per cent of open interest.Hedge funds had only modestly entered the Cboe market, while Wall Street banks and asset managers were virtually absent, according to the report.Friday’s swings were accompanied by the highest daily volumes in the two-week history of bitcoin futures. On Cboe futures volumes surpassed 12,000 bitcoin equivalent, more than double any previous day since their December 10 launch. Volume at CME Group, where bitcoin futures were listed this week, were the equivalent of more than 11,000 bitcoin by Friday afternoon.The advent of futures made it easier for traders to take bearish positions in bitcoin. However, the futures volumes were eclipsed by the more than 1.5m bitcoin that changed hands on cash exchanges, according to coinmarketcap.com.Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, which runs a platform that allows traders to speculate on bitcoin, said: “We’re seeing the first stirrings of a two-way market thanks to the futures now [being] available.”Heightened investor interest in recent months prompted the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s self-regulator, to warn investors on Thursday to be “cautious when considering the purchase of shares of companies that tout the potential of high returns associated with cryptocurrency-related activities”.Those worries were sharpened when small US-listed soft-drink maker called Long Island Iced Tea Corp surged as much as 500 per cent after changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp, echoing similar events that have played out in recent weeks.Earlier in the week, South Korean bitcoin exchange Youbit announced that it had been hacked, causing it to lose 17 per cent of its assets and forcing it into bankruptcy. Youbit told investors they could withdraw only about 75 per cent of their digital currency. Coinbase also said it was investigating staff after a sudden jump in the value of bitcoin cash.Additional reporting by Emma Dunkley and Alice Woodhouse in Hong Kong

The cryptocurrency had dipped as low as $14,311 earlier in the day, its weakest level since December 10.It has been a mixed week in the cryptocurrency world. A South Korean cryptocurrency exchange was forced into bankruptcy on Wednesday following a cyber attack and San Francisco-based Coinbase, one of the world’s most popular exchanges for trading digital currencies, said it was investigating its staff over a sudden price surge for “bitcoin cash”.On Thursday, the US securities regulator warned investors against “potential scams” following a surge in stock prices for a series of companies that announced a switch of strategy into cryptocurrencies. The warning came as soft drinks maker Long Island Ice Tea Corp surged 500 per cent after changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp. Blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs is said to be setting up a cryptocurrency trading desk and CME Group launched bitcoin futures on Sunday.
47;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-18T16:16:23Z;Duelling bitcoin futures go head-to-head as CME launches contract;More than $80m in bitcoin futures changes hands on CME, giving it edge on rival;The bitcoin futures race began in earnest as exchange operator CME Group challenged a Chicago competitor that had launched the first digital currency futures a week before.In the first session on Monday more than $80m in bitcoin futures changed hands on CME, the world’s biggest exchange operator by market value. The trading value gave it a slight edge on rival Cboe Global Markets as they vie to be the main hub for the nascent bitcoin futures market.Their arrival came in response to soaring cryptocurrency prices and demand from professional investors seeking exposure inside the walls of a regulated exchange. Success in launching futures contracts could confer legitimacy to bitcoin and add a revenue stream for Cboe and CME.Investors will closely watch how CME’s contract fares because the more than 100-year-old exchange runs several of the world’s most liquid futures markets in interest rates, currencies, equity indices and commodities. Futures listings tend to be a winner-takes-all business.By Monday morning in Chicago 847 January-expiry bitcoin futures contracts had traded on CME and the price of the future was $19,050. That compared with a price per bitcoin immediately on cash exchanges of about $18,890. Each CME contract is for five bitcoins. At Cboe the January-expiry contract was $19,020 per bitcoin, while volumes had exceeded 3,000 contracts of one bitcoin each.Prices for the CME and Cboe were different because they used different bases from which to calculate the daily price change. CME’s bitcoin futures prices are based on a composite of trading information from four cash cryptocurrency exchanges — Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken. Cboe’s data are collected from the Gemini Exchange.Bobby Cho, head of trading at Chicago-based cryptocurrency trader Cumberland, said futures volumes were dwarfed by activity on the cash exchanges.He added that the price of bitcoin, normally volatile, had been relatively subdued in the past week because “a lot of the action has been in other cryptocurrencies”. One of them, called Ripple, rose more than 50 per cent in just 24 hours last week, according to CoinDesk.CME executives say its contract is aimed at institutional investors who have been calling for futures. The larger size of the CME contract means investors will have to pay five times more margin money to backstop their trades.Advocates of bitcoin call it a disruptive alternative to the global monetary system, while critics say the market has become a bubble.Exchange executives say they intend to generate interest slowly. Several banks that broker futures transactions have been wary, and have tightened risk controls around potential customers or refrained from participating in the launches.TD Ameritrade, one of the US’s largest retail brokers, said it would permit some customers to trade Cboe bitcoin futures starting on Monday, but would not immediately open its platform to CME bitcoin.
48;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-15T09:56:37Z;Race to launch bitcoin futures stirs anger;CME and Cboe listings have raised concerns among regulators and brokers;"“Get Exposure to Bitcoin Price Moves without Holding Bitcoins,” the website of Cboe Global Markets says about the exchange’s new bitcoin futures, which began trading this week.Why someone would voluntarily seek out bitcoin’s gyrations might not be obvious. When it suddenly fell 10 per cent on Wednesday morning, investors might have felt safer getting exposure to skydiving.But in an era defined by the absence of volatility, many trading firms are desperate for something that moves — and whatever its intrinsic value, bitcoin moves. Trading on a futures exchange promises all the excitement within the sturdy walls of a regulated venue. Cboe rival CME Group will make its own bitcoin futures full trading debut on Monday.The question for traders and regulators is whether the futures listings represent the coming of age of cryptocurrencies, the peak of a silly fad or a danger to critical bulwarks of the financial system. The answer will play out in live trading.Bitcoin has emerged from its 2008 creation into a medium of payment and, more prominently, the object of a speculative frenzy. Its price has gained 1,600 per cent this year, with double-digit percentage daily swings not uncommon.US futures exchanges date to the 19th century. After decades of experience and occasional scandal, the industry has developed time-worn rules to protect customers from violent price moves and broker defaults.But in the view of some, bitcoin is uncharted territory. The manner in which the US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, greenlighted the new contracts has led to concerns about potential perils ahead.Among those worried is Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers. “I started in the futures industry in 1968. I’ve seen many futures brokers go bankrupt and customers losing all their money. So I know how this works,” he says.As a futures broker, Interactive executes deals for customers and collects margin money to ensure they make good on losing bets. As a member of exchange clearing houses, it is also on the hook if another broker defaults.When he learnt that the exchanges were pushing ahead with bitcoin futures, Mr Peterffy spoke to Terry Duffy, chief executive of CME, and Christopher Giancarlo, CFTC chairman. Mr Duffy told him “there’s nothing you can do about it”, while Mr Giancarlo said, “Look, my hands are tied”, recalls Mr Peterffy.CFTC representatives did not respond to requests for confirmation; the CME refused to comment.Mr Peterffy then wrote a letter to Mr Giancarlo, which he also published in the Wall Street Journal. In it he urged the regulator to require a separate clearing house for bitcoin futures so customer losses do not infect brokers who do not want to be involved.He was unpersuasive. “I think that people believe that more and more people will be believers in bitcoin. It’s only a matter of belief; it’s practically a religion,” he says.While Mr Peterffy was pleading, the CFTC was in the middle of back and forth talks with the exchanges over the shape of their proposed futures, people involved in the discussions say. Agency staff first engaged with Cboe in late July and CME in mid-October, Amir Zaidi, director of the division of market oversight, said in a podcast on the CFTC website.Getting approval for new contracts is usually a routine matter. Not for bitcoin. Regulators spent more time scrutinising the issue. CME initially sought margin collateral of 27 per cent of the value of the contract, according to Brian Bussey, director of the CFTC division of clearing and risk, speaking on the podcast, but “based on discussions with us, they moved it to 35 per cent”.This week, CME further increased the margin requirement to 43 per cent.“You can rest assured the CFTC was assertive,” says Chris Concannon, president of Cboe.The discussions were private. On December 1 the CFTC announced that both Cboe and CME, as well as Cantor Exchange, which is listing bitcoin binary options, had “self-certified” their new derivatives products, meaning they were free to list them within one business day.That did not sit well with the Futures Industry Association, whose 64 members — including Interactive — are most of the brokers needed to backstop the new contracts. The process did “not align with the potential risks that underlie their trading and should be reviewed”, Walt Lukken, chief executive of FIA, wrote to Mr Giancarlo.Prompted by their complaints, the CFTC’s Market Risk Advisory Committee plans to meet and discuss bitcoin, novel products and their risks, and the self-certification process, according to CFTC officials. “There have been a lot of questions about the process and transparency,” says one official.CME and Cboe both had reason to be first to market. Listing futures tends to be a winner-takes-all business because the contracts cannot be transferred between exchanges. Once volumes build up at one exchange, traders have little reason to go elsewhere. After CME announced it would list its bitcoin futures this Sunday night, Cboe stole a march and announced a December 10 launch date.The first week at Cboe featured volumes of several thousand contracts, tiny compared with the most popular futures but higher than forecast by some.Exchange executives say they developed the contracts in response to demand. CME, in its regulatory filing to the commission, claimed that bitcoin had “increasingly garnered public acceptance as a store of value”.Since disclosing its plans to list futures it has “fielded hundreds of calls and emails” from traders including asset managers, trading firms and companies that create exchange traded funds, which could make bitcoin available to investors on stock exchanges.“We’ve been at this a little over a year,” says Tim McCourt, who manages CME’s bitcoin product. “It’s just that in the last several months there’s been an upwelling of interest and demand from customers. They wanted a futures product on bitcoin on a regulated exchange. We finally reached that point of critical mass.”Sceptical as he is, even Mr Peterffy’s brokerage is clearing bitcoin futures for about 200 accounts. “We have no good reason to say, ‘No you can’t,’” he says. “They could say, ‘I will find another broker who will do this for me.’ We don’t want to lose these clients.”"
49;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-12T21:59:44Z;Bitcoin futures broker to allow negative bets;U-turn by Interactive Brokers could shift trading dynamics for soaring cryptocurrency;The biggest broker for bitcoin futures says it will start to allow customers to bet against the cryptocurrency, in a move that could change the dynamics of the nascent market.Interactive Brokers will by the end of this week give its customers the opportunity to take bearish “short” positions on bitcoin futures, said Thomas Peterffy, its chairman, reversing a decision to only allow bullish, long trades.Interactive was among the handful of brokers that cleared the futures upon their debut this week, handling what it estimated to be 53 per cent of total bitcoin volume on Cboe Global Markets during the inaugural session.The move could influence the balance of trading at Cboe, where bitcoin futures began trading on Sunday, and at CME Group when that exchange operator launches a rival contract next week.Mr Peterffy said he made the decision after the bitcoin futures maintained a premium to the cash bitcoin they track, suggesting the market is out of balance.“We realise that we have to open the ability to short it,” Mr Peterffy said in an interview on Tuesday.Speculators wanting to short bitcoin futures this week have had to execute trades through other brokers.The arrival of futures on established exchanges has given a stamp of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency, which evolved outside Wall Street and the purview of regulators.Mr Peterffy has been a sceptical voice as bitcoin prices have climbed by more than 1,700 per cent in 2017. He unsuccessfully urged regulators to require separate clearing houses for cryptocurrency futures to prevent any market blowout from destabilising derivatives brokers.Interactive indicated it would move to protect itself by requiring short-sellers to deposit five times the value of their futures contracts to cover potential losses, making negative bets significantly more expensive than positive ones. There is no limit to the potential losses on short positions if prices continue to shoot higher.And Mr Peterffy expressed his doubts about the wisdom of the positions he is allowing clients to take. “I think it’s suicidal to sell this contract, because it can run away with you. How much a bitcoin is worth, nobody knows,” he said.He added that the market did not contain many “natural shorts” such as those in commodities markets where, for example, farmers sell in order to hedge the prices of their crops.“On the short side, there could be people who have gotten into bitcoin at a much lower price and they may want to realise some of their gains,” Mr Peterffy said.Accounts placing long bitcoin trades through Interactive must post 50 per cent of the contract value as margin. With Cboe January-expiry bitcoin trading at $18,020 per contract on Tuesday, that would mean a deposit of more than $9,000, including margin required by the exchange.Given the higher risk of being short, Mr Peterffy said that, at today’s prices, margin for a single bitcoin short position would be “in the neighbourhood of $100,000” at Cboe. At CME, where the contract size will be five times larger, margin for short traders would be around half a million dollars.Separately, CME late on Tuesday raised clearing house margins for its bitcoin futures to 43 per cent from an original plan of 35 per cent, citing a “normal review of market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage”.
50;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-11T16:21:38Z;Bitcoin futures: naked position;The exchanges are giving customers what they want — tools with which to speculate;Sometimes a mask slips. The launch of bitcoin contracts by US futures platforms are one such lapse. Here, as if it were needed, is proof that regulated exchanges function as casinos as well as investment markets.Fans think bitcoin futures legitimise cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin may equally tarnish futures, instruments of real utility for hedging real assets.You cannot fault Cboe Global Markets’ opportunism. By launching a week ahead of larger rival CME Group, Cboe’s volatile, thinly traded bitcoin contracts have grabbed the attention of the financial world. The objection that both groups are facilitating speculation rather than investment is implicit. Explicit criticisms mostly cite financial risk. They are exaggerated.Take systemic risk. At the overheated price of $18,850 per bitcoin, which marks the peak so far for Cboe’s January contract, the cryptocurrency would be capitalised at $315bn. If bitcoin were a company, it would slot into the S&P 500 between Exxon and Bank of America. Such worth is impressive. It is still only a drop in the ocean compared with the trillions in other underlying assets that futures markets comfortably trade daily.The volatility of the cryptocurrency worries unbelievers, too. It can rise or fall 20 per cent in short order. Futures margins will be correspondingly steep, which should reduce clearing house risk. Cboe Global’s clearing house demands 44 per cent of exposure to open a position. CME Group currently expects to ask for collateral equivalent to 35 per cent.This is where the aims of both groups begin to look questionable. Steep margins have steep costs. That reduces the utility of futures for hedging underlying bitcoin positions and leaves speculation as an undimmed motive. Appropriately so. Bitcoin exists only for this purpose. Dollars are a safer medium of exchange. Andy Warhol prints are as useful for money laundering, and can decorate a swanky apartment too.Moral irreproachability wins you few admirers if you cannot afford a shoe shine. Exchanges are keen to meet customer demand. But it is piquant that Chicago-based groups spawned by trade in the most tangible of commodities should offer cash-settled contracts in the most insubstantial. Revealing, too, that they should do so just as memories of the last financial crisis start to fade.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

51;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-08T12:17:43Z;Big banks not willing to support launch of bitcoin futures;JPMorgan and Citigroup will not clear contracts ahead of Cboe and CME trading;Some of the largest US futures brokers, including JPMorgan and Citigroup, will not immediately clear bitcoin trades for clients once futures contracts in the cryptocurrency begin trading next week, according to people with knowledge of the banks’ plans.Many big global banks that are allowing such trading, such as Dutch bank ABN Amro, will clear for customers only after implementing strict standards that will make transactions very difficult. Others, such as Société Générale, are still considering their stance, leaving smaller brokers like Wedbush and Interactive Brokers as some of the few firms where trades will be executed.Goldman Sachs said it would clear futures contracts for certain clients, and is also considering whether to become a market maker to help build liquidity. “In response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them in the space,” it said in a statement.Chicago’s Cboe Global Markets plans to initiate derivatives trading late on Sunday evening, jumping ahead of cross-town rival CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, which debuts its own offering on December 18. They are the first traditional exchanges to jump into the volatile bitcoin market.The decision by the Cboe and CME has divided the world’s largest investment banks who play a central role in facilitating such derivative transactions.While many of clients hope to begin trading bitcoin futures, some banks are worried about managing the risk associated with the contracts, particularly given the manic swings seen in recent weeks. The trading system’s infrastructure has also come into question after bitcoin’s price diverged between the main private cryptocurrency exchanges this week.On Thursday alone the price of bitcoin on the largest private exchange swung just under a fifth in around 40 minutes. There is also a backlog of unconfirmed transactions on the exchange, leading to concerns about the accuracy of settlement prices for bitcoin trades.Bitcoin retreated back below $15,000 from a record price of $17,027 on Friday, having begun the week around $10,500, according to Bloomberg.Typically, the futures broker acts as a middleman in a trade, executing orders and supervising the margin calls that backstop the contract. Some futures brokers are worried they will bear the brunt of the risk associated with bitcoin futures, because the margin that backstops the contract is placed in a clearing house.Clearing houses stand between two parties in a futures trade, managing the risk to the rest of the market if one side should default. They are mutually funded in part by banks to guard against the failure of their largest members.For potential buyers and sellers of futures, another question is whether the volatility in bitcoin prices will trip the buffers — known as circuit breakers — that calm wild swings in the derivatives market.Exchanges can apply temporary freezes on trading, usually lasting seconds or minutes, which act as a breather for investors and the exchange to assess if there is any particular problem.B2C2, a UK cryptocurrency broker planning to trade the futures contracts, warned that the circuit breakers would be one of the key issues for trading.“No settlement mechanism is perfect especially in such a nascent market. It’ll be interesting to see if a contract ever settles outside the circuit breaker range,” said Max Boonen, founder of B2C2.
52;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-07T18:21:59Z;Don’t worry about bitcoin — at least not yet;A bubble, yes, but not a dangerous one until leverage is piled on top;Bitcoin prices are in a bubble. To recognise this, one need only look at the cryptocurrency’s vertiginous path to its current peak of more than $16,000 — and then recall that it has no intrinsic value. It is not productive like oil, and no government stands behind it. It is not even physically attractive, as paintings, gold and tulips are. As of today, the sole legitimate reason to buy bitcoin it is to sell it later for a higher price.Should anyone care about this? There is now quite a bit of nominal value behind bitcoin. Multiply the price by the number of bitcoins and the result is more than $270bn — roughly the market capitalisation and double the book value of Wells Fargo, the third-largest bank in the US. There is reason to think still more money is going to flow to bitcoin. Two major exchanges, the CME Group and Cboe Global Markets, are about to launch bitcoin futures exchanges. Historically, asset bubbles ascend to their wildest heights after derivative trading is introduced. Such trading is easier and less capital intensive than cash trading and delivery of the underlying asset.It is telling that Wall Street banks, usually keen to cash in on the sudden popularity of innovative derivatives — mortgage-backed credit default swaps, say — are encouraging regulators to review bitcoin futures more carefully. They have reason to be nervous. Any bitcoin futures trades will have to pass through clearing houses, where defaults are covered by member institutions, such as the brokerage arms of the big banks. If a mass of trades go bad, for example because a crash in the bitcoin price leaves lots of traders unable to make good on their trades, the clearing house could end up holding the bag.It may also be that the banks simply do not want to be involved. As demonstrated by the spiking price, the bitcoin market lacks natural sellers (other than bitcoin “miners” who need to sell bitcoins to pay the electricity bills on their computerised mines). This would leave the brokers either taking the “short” side of trades themselves, a big risk, or refusing to take clients’ trades and potentially losing business.It may be that the futures markets will simply flop for lack of people willing to bet against bitcoin while the price is still rising. If so, good. Speculation in bitcoin (or any other arbitrary thing) should be allowed in a free society — so long as it does not put others at risk. If this collective waste of time and energy fails to take hold, that is likely to be for the best.But will no one else get hurt? Of course, bitcoin could crash to zero. A lot of paper wealth would disappear. But bitcoin is not a bank. It is not highly leveraged, and it seems to have been used as collateral in only a limited number of cases. Much of its nominal value is in essence “found money”. So there is limited cause for worry — until the value gets much higher, or much more leverage seeps into the financial ecosystem surrounding the cryptocurrency. This could happen. Regulators need to follow events closely, and insist on high-margin requirements and tight risk controls for trading in derivatives.While there are no legitimate, non-speculative reasons to buy bitcoin, there are of course significant illegitimate ones. So long as it retains value, bitcoin is a useful tool for tax evaders, money launderers, and anyone who wishes to avoid the rules and regulations that govern traditional fiat currencies. So while it is not necessary to put up regulatory barriers to trading bitcoin, the points where it connects with traditional currencies, banking systems, and tax regimes should be carefully controlled. Innovative technology is not a licence to break the law.

It was also trading above $15,000 on two other less-known exchanges, according to data from bitcoinity.org.Traders have bid-up the currency relentlessly this year, sparking growing mainstream interest. Two major US exchange operators – CME Group and CBOE Global Markets – are set to launch futures trading in bitcoin over the next two weeks amid demand from investors seeking a regulated platform to trade on.But a string of financial industry veterans have warned that the meteoric gains — bitcoin sat at about $1,000 at the start of this year — resemble a bubble. The concerns are amplified since many market participants find themselves unable to explain what causes the sometimes dramatic price swings (it swung in a roughly $500 range in three minutes on Wednesday).Read more:Wall Street banks push back on launch of bitcoin futuresWhat happens when bitcoin’s market cap overtakes world GDP?Bitcoin frenzy in South Korea pushes payment premiums to 23%
54;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-07T01:10:50Z;Bitcoin rises above $14,000 to fresh high;;Bitcoin hit yet another fresh record high on Thursday as it rose above the $14,000 threshold for the first time.The cryptocurrency, which started the year at around $1,000, touched an intraday high of $14,047 in morning trading in Asia, bringing its gain for the week to 24.9 per cent, according to Reuters data.The soaring price of bitcoin has fuelled interest from investors and companies that trade cryptocurrencies, despite repeated warnings from regulators that it is unregulated.Bitcoin has received support in recent days after CBOE Global Markets said it will launch trading in futures tracking the cryptocurrency from December 10 and CME Group will begin listing bitcoin futures contracts on December 18. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission gave the greenlight for bitcoin futures trading on Friday.Despite the support from regulators, the world’s largest banks are pushing back, raising concerns with US regulators that the financial system is ill-prepared for the launch of the contracts as the value of the volatile cryptocurrency has soared. The Futures Industry Association, the main futures industry lobby group, plans to send a letter to the CFTC that will be published on Thursday.
55;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-06T16:29:17Z;CME fee rises vex struggling high-speed trading industry;Lobby group weighs options amid mood ranging from anger to resignation;A rise in transaction fees for futures contracts at CME Group is angering the exchange operator’s most active customers at a time when their business models are being challenged by subdued market volatility.CME, which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other derivatives bourses, is forecast to generate a record $3.6bn in revenue this year, mainly from transaction and clearing fees. Proprietary trading firms that fuel massive volumes at the CME complain those fees have risen too high.The issue reached boiling point in the past week, after the CME disclosed plans to raise transaction fees in US Treasury futures, one of its most actively traded contracts. Top CME executives have also made private visits to the offices of the biggest traders to reveal that lucrative discounts for energy futures would be revamped, industry executives said. On Tuesday the FIA Principal Traders Group, an industry association, met in Chicago with CME fees on the agenda. Participants discussed asking a lawyer to study their options, according to two attendees. The group’s members include such established trading firms as DRW, Jump Trading and XR Trading, all of which declined to comment. At the meeting, “there was anger,” one participant said. But another added that the tone “was resignation”.As most traders use automated programs to execute thousands of orders per day, small transaction fee increases add up. “You have significantly less opportunity, and the CME is just reaching in and taxing everybody more aggressively than ever,” said a senior executive at one big exchange customer. Starting in February, CME will raise the member rate for trading longer-dated Treasury futures to 13 cents a contract from 12 cents. “Just that one cent is a multimillion-dollar hit,” the senior executive said.In energy futures, qualifying for fee discounts will now require reaching separate volume thresholds in individual products such as crude oil or natural gas, whereas previous discounts rewarded aggregate volumes in a broad basket of energy futures. “That’s going to cost us a meaningful seven-figure amount,” another trading executive said. CME, the world’s biggest exchange company by market value, has enjoyed a strong year. Its adjusted operating profit margin was 66.4 per cent in the third quarter and its share price has risen 32 per cent since January.John Pietrowicz, chief financial officer, told an investor conference on Tuesday that CME has increased fees about 1-2 per cent per year over the past four years. “The key thing for us is to make sure that we don’t impact volume levels. We want to make sure we have as much volume going across our platform 24 hours a day as we can,” he said.CME said fee changes were the result of “increased costs for technology, licensing, infrastructure and functionality,” such as moving options on futures on to its electronic platform. CME derives pricing power from dominant positions in benchmarks such as US interest rate and commodity futures. In investor materials it advertises a “network effect similar to large technology companies”. 
56;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-06T03:57:49Z;Bitcoin jumps above $12,000 to record high;;Bitcoin sailed pass $12,000 for the first time on Wednesday as appetite for the controversial cryptocurrency continued.Bitcoin rose as much as 5.1 per cent to $12,275, according to Reuters data, extending its gains for the year after starting 2017 at around $1,000.The soaring price of bitcoin has fuelled interest from investors and companies that trade cryptocurrencies, despite repeated warnings from regulators that it is unregulated.Bitcoin was given a boost on Monday after CBOE Global markets said it will launch trading in futures tracking the cryptocurrency from December 10 after receiving a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.CME Group will begin initial listings of bitcoin futures contracts on December 18.The cryptocurrency’s critics include Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan, who in September called bitcoin a “fraud” and threatened to fire any traders who traded bitcoin.
57;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:29:19+0000;CBOE to launch bitcoin futures trading on December 10;;Bitcoin futures trading is almost here. CBOE Global Markets said on Monday it will launch trading in futures tracking the controversial cryptocurrency next week, giving many mainstream investors their first shot at speculating on its price.The group said trading will begin at 5pm in Chicago (11pm GMT) on Sunday, December 10, with Monday representing the first full trading day.CBOE said trading will be free through December — a move likely aimed at drumming up interest ahead of the launch of bitcoin futures on December 18 by rival CME Group.Both exchange operators received a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the primary US futures market regulator, to launch the contracts. Nasdaq, the New York-based exchange operator, is to launch bitcoin futures next year.Futures let investors speculate on and hedge against the price of assets. The futures market is well developed for currencies, providing analysts with an important proxy for the $5tn a day global foreign exchange market.“Given the unprecedented interest in bitcoin, it’s vital we provide clients the trading tools to help them express their views and hedge their exposure,” said CBOE chief executive Ed Tilly.Bitcoin rallied in Asia trading on Monday to a new record high of $11,800 per coin, according to Reuters data. It is the best performing asset this year, having posted gains of around 12-fold, but many professional investors have warned that the frothy returns resemble bubbles of days past.
58;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-04T13:34:44Z;CBOE and CME battle for bitcoin futures bragging rights;Venues offer competing contracts as they seek to exploit rising Wall Street interest;Chicago’s two largest derivatives exchanges are going head to head in coming weeks to become the US market of choice for bitcoin futures trading.Cboe Global Markets said on Monday it would begin trading its bitcoin futures contracts, known as XBT futures, next week, on December 11, offering free trading for the rest of the month to help spur transactions.That will steal a march on its rival, CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, which will launch its futures contracts the following Monday.Both exchanges are seeking to exploit rising interest from Wall Street in the controversial cryptocurrency, whose value has mushroomed this year. Earlier on Monday it hit a record $11,800, having been less than $2,000 only in April.Institutional investors have been keen to trade the asset in a more recognised, regulated market. Shares in both CME and Cboe have risen nine per cent since the end of October as they firmed up their plans.Ed Tilly, chief executive of Cboe, said there was “unprecedented” interest in bitcoin. “We are committed to encouraging fairness and liquidity in the bitcoin market.”In a rare head-to-head race to dominate a new market, the exchanges are offering traders competing types of contract.CME’s prices are a composite derived from four bitcoin exchanges. It is also planning to limit the amount of contracts investors can hold to 1,000. That would be equivalent to less than 1 per cent of the market available to trade, the CME estimates.Cboe’s contracts are based on a daily auction price from Gemini, the virtual currency exchange run by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Investors may not own or control more than a net 5,000 contracts, long or short combined, and the global market will be open for more than 23 hours.Both exchanges are insisting that deals will be settled in cash the day after contracts expire. Some investors, such as electronic market makers, have expressed an interest but also made public their reservations.DRW of Chicago, one of the world’s largest proprietary trading companies, has a subsidiary named Cumberland for buying and selling bitcoin.“Although DRW and Cumberland haven’t been directly involved in the design of these contracts, our recommendation to any exchange that has asked is to list a physically-delivered bitcoin futures contract,” a spokesperson for DRW and Cumberland said.“Products indexed to a spot exchange or related auction will be inherently flawed due to the constraints that currently exist on these spot exchanges.”The market’s main regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has had concerns that futures correlated to the highly volatile bitcoin price could create instability in clearing houses, the market buffers that act as counterparties to a trade and prevent any defaults from infecting the rest of the market.To counter this, traders will also have to pay higher-than-normal amounts to both backstop their bitcoin trades and provide continuous funds for their positions.CME will demand from investors an initial margin of 35 per cent to back the trades in its clearing house, while traders using Cboe will need to pay 33 per cent of the trade price upfront.In a speech in London last week Brian Quintenz, the CFTC Commissioner, said the agency had the powers to raise the margin levels if it felt the amount held by a clearing house was inadequate.“It is incumbent on market participants to conduct appropriate due diligence to determine whether these products, which have at times exhibited extreme volatility, are appropriate for them,” he noted.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York
59;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
60;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-01T19:30:43Z;US regulator gives green light for bitcoin futures trading;CME, CBOE and Cantor pass hurdle in preparing derivatives on volatile cryptocurrency;Two of the world’s largest futures exchanges, CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, have been given a regulatory green light to list bitcoin futures, a significant step in allowing mainstream investors to buy and sell the highly volatile cryptocurrency.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the main US markets regulator, said on Friday that the CME and Chicago rival CBOE had agreed to operate under a self-certified regime for their upcoming contracts. Cantor Exchange, run by Cantor Fitzgerald, has opted to self-certify bitcoin binary options, the CFTC added.Futures exchanges under such rules are required to monitor for potential market manipulation and market dislocations like sudden drops and trading outages.The price of bitcoin has surged in recent weeks as leading US futures exchanges have announced their plans to list contracts for the currency. This week its price rose above $11,000 for the first time, only to drop more than a fifth, and then rebound. Bitcoin was trading below $2,000 as recently as May.The exchanges’ moves to self-certification meant the CFTC had only limited time to review the products formally. While they did not require approval, the regulator had the opportunity to reject the plans. The announcement helped push both CME and CBOE shares to record highs, above $151 and $124 respectively.Chris Concannon, president of CBOE Global Markets, said his company had made the decision to self-certify after taking advice from the CFTC.In a separate statement CFTC chairman Christopher Giancarlo said bitcoin was unlike any other product the commission had dealt with. The agency held extensive discussions in recent months with the exchanges over surveillance and oversight, he added.But he warned investors that the emerging cryptocurrency markets “remain largely unregulated markets over which the CFTC has limited statutory authority. There are concerns about the price volatility and trading practices of participants in these markets.”As global securities markets are becalmed by low volatility and interest rates, investors and banks have increasingly turned their attention to the mushrooming prices of cryptocurrencies, still more often associated with money-laundering and cyber theft. Bitcoin is the biggest and best-known of several emerging digital currencies.“There are a number of factors driving the [bitcoin] price right now,’’ said Mr Concannon. ‘”You can’t hedge against bitcoin, you can’t hedge in a fully regulated market.” He added that a future brought more regulatory oversight to the nascent market. “We can get price equilibrium . . . tying it into the cash market does have the potential to reduce the volatility.”CME said it would begin initial listings of bitcoin futures contracts on December 18. Mr Concannon said CBOE would make an announcement on its launch date “soon”.“We trade derivatives on all of those exchanges and we plan to trade bitcoin derivatives on them as well,” said Garrett See, chief executive of DV Chain, a crypto trader in Chicago.Executives acknowledge they also need to create a market infrastructure that can safely handle bitcoin’s hair-raising swings. CME will demand from investors an initial margin of 35 per cent to back the trades in its clearing house.CBOE, which does not own its own clearing house, will use OCC, a mutual US clearer. The regulators “were very adamant about the type of margin and risk controls” for the product, Mr Concannon said.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York
61;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-12-01T13:47:50Z;Bitcoin futures trading to start in time for Christmas;;Trading in bitcoin-related derivatives will begin before Christmas after CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, and two other venues said they had self-certified their planned products with US markets regulators.The Chicago group and rival CBOE Global Markets said on Friday they had self-certified the contracts they plan to offer investors with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Cantor Exchange, run by Cantor Fizgerald, has opted to self-certify bitcoin binary options.The move means the US agency has only limited time to formally review the product. CFTC chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo said the product was unlike any other the Commission had dealt with in the past.He said the agency had extensive discussions in recent months with the exchanges over surveillance and oversight and links with the exchanges that traded the underlying bitcoin.He warned the the relatively nascent underlying cash markets and exchanges for bitcoin remain largely unregulated markets and the CFTC has limited statutory authority.He added:There are concerns about the price volatility and trading practices of participants in these markets. We expect that the futures exchanges….will be monitoring the trading activity on the relevant cash platforms for potential impacts on the futures contracts’ price discovery process, including potential market manipulation and market dislocations due to flash rallies and crashes and trading outages. Nevertheless, investors should be aware of the potentially high level of volatility and risk in trading these contracts.CME said it would begin initial listings of bitcoin futures contracts on December 18. It will demand from investors an initial margin of 35 per cent to back the trades.

Over just the past few days, it has swung into and out of bull and bear markets, trading on Friday morning at $9,600.Given the market-leading price returns, bitcoin has garnered increasing levels of attention from retail investors and professionals. Nasdaq, CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, all large exchange operators, are launching futures products that will let investors speculate and hedge on the price of bitcoin. In Asia, Shinhan Bank, South Korea’s biggest bank by assets, is planning to launch a bitcoin vault service.But amid all of the hype, many financial industry veterans remain wary. JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a “fraud”, while BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said it is an “index of money laundering“.
63;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-11-29T15:47:24Z;Exchange operator Nasdaq aims to launch bitcoin futures in 2018;;Nasdaq plans to launch bitcoin futures next year as it looks to tap into burgeoning interest from professional investors in the cryptocurrency, said a person familiar with the exchange operator’s plans.The decision by Nasdaq comes after CME Group, a rival exchange operator focused on currencies and commodities derivatives, said in October that it will launch bitcoin futures this year.Futures enable traders to hedge against and speculate on the price of assets. They are widely used in the foreign exchange and commodities markets.Nasdaq plans to roll out the futures in 2018, the person briefed on the discussions said, while cautioning the group will plan to talk to industry partners to vet the product before launching it.The New York-based group already uses blockchain, the ledger system that underlies bitcoin, in its private securities market. Chief executive Adena Friedman said earlier this year that blockchain “has a huge ability to change the way settlement occurs and the transfer of ownership.”Bitcoin has come into focus on Wall Street since it has surged 11-fold to more than $11,000 a coin since the start of this year. Some veteran investors and finance executives have warned that the gains resemble bubbles of the past. However, others have sought to tap into the growing market.The news of the bitcoin futures was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
64;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-11-29T14:28:01Z;Bitcoin passes $11,000;;Bitcoin’s recent surge showed no sign of stopping on Wednesday, despite growing warnings from traditional marketplaces and market-watchers, breaking through the $11,000 barrier for the first time.The digital currency was trading at $11,395 per coin at publication time, according to Reuters data. A 15 per cent increase from yesterday brings its gains for 2017 to date to more than 1,000 per cent.Adherents praise the cryptocurrency’s decentralised infrastructure and traceability, but critics have suggested its volatility makes it unsuitable for use as a real currency, and say it is largely used as an avenue for money laundering and fraud.Its massive climb has prompted no shortage of unfavourable commentary and comparison to historic bubbles such as the 17th century tulip craze or Victorian railway mania.Earlier this week IG Group, the online trading platform, suspended trading in some of its bitcoin derivatives, while other marketplaces have raised the fees they charge to hold positions in bitcoin, as fears grow about their exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency.In a further sign that retail brokers are increasingly concerned by the boom, Neil Wilson – a senior market analyst at CFD provider ETX Capital – on Wednesday described bitcoin’s rise as “a massive speculative bubble”. He added:It’s hard to say precisely where we are in the curve, but the shape of the chart is parabolic and this sort of thing never, ever lasts. So far it’s following the playbook for a speculative bubble to the letter.The big question is whether we have reached the euphoric stage or are still in the boom phase. The other question is when to get out before panic sets in. Whilst this appears like a classic bubble, Bitcoin could have a lot, lot further to run before it blows.However, moves such as the introduction of bitcoin futures contracts by CME Group, the world’s largest exchange operator by market value, have lent more legitimacy to the currency.
65;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Bitcoin futures face safeguards to tackle wild gyrations;Exchanges insist on higher collateral and price caps amid calls to ringfence trades;Traders eagerly awaiting the debut of bitcoin futures will face tougher risk standards says the chief executive of the CME Group as the exchange operator plans to launch contracts on the highly volatile cryptocurrency.Terry Duffy, CME chief executive, told the Financial Times he wants to lure a new generation of futures traders attracted by the cryptocurrency boom, although he acknowledges the challenges of creating a market infrastructure that can safely handle the hair-raising swings of bitcoin.That may entail traders of CME bitcoin futures having to deposit close to 30 per cent of their value as collateral, says Mr Duffy, who is competing with a rival offering from Chicago neighbour, Cboe Global Markets.The exchanges’ moves represent a first step by traditional institutions to take a serious look at a cryptocurrency, often associated with money-laundering and cyber theft. There are, however, worries that the launch exposes new risks to important financial bodies such as clearing houses that guarantee futures markets. “Listen, it’s no mystery, this is a different product,” says Mr Duffy. “We want to get out something that’s safe.” At CME, no bitcoin futures trading will be permitted at prices 20 per cent above or below the prior day’s settlement, according to exchange literature. That is similar to its circuit breakers for stock-index futures. CME will also require bitcoin futures traders to post greater margin, or good-faith collateral, held against a losing position. “The margin is yet to be decided, but it’s not going to be standard futures margin. This margin is probably going to be closer to 30 per cent,” Mr Duffy says. Typical futures margins are in single-digit percentages. Some are concerned about the dangers posed by such a market to massive clearing houses that help curtail systemic risk.Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers, this week took out a full-page advertisement in the Wall Street Journal to argue that bitcoin futures endangered the CME clearing house where his company has money at stake as a member. He urged regulators to require separate, ringfenced clearing houses for cryptocurrencies. “Margining such a product in a reasonable manner is impossible,” Mr Peterffy wrote, adding that “a large cryptocurrency price move that destabilises members that clear cryptocurrencies will destabilise the clearing organisation itself”. Prices for the two rivals’ bitcoin futures will be based on spot bitcoin transactions at cryptocurrency exchanges whose record raises concern among financiers.CME intends to use the CME CF bitcoin Reference Rate, a daily dollar price of bitcoin derived from prices at four bitcoin exchanges: Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken.Six bitcoin exchanges underpinned the index as recently as April, when CME removed the Bitfinex and OKCoin exchanges after banks blocked their customers from wiring dollars in and out. Last year, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex lost more than $60m worth of bitcoin to hackers and was fined by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission “for offering illegal off-exchange financed retail commodity transactions in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies” and failing to register. A message sent to Bitfinex chief executive J L van der Velde received no response. San Francisco-based Kraken yesterday told customers its platform was seeing slow response times, connection timeouts and delays in withdrawals. A CME official says the problems did not interrupt the calculation of its bitcoin rate. Kraken did not respond to queries. John Lothian, a former futures trader and broker who publishes a markets newsletter, says of CME’s venture: “They’re giving legitimacy to bitcoin and to these exchanges. They’re sharing their credibility with them. Whether they will be hurt by this or whether they profit by this is yet to be seen.” The Cboe contract will be based on bitcoin auction prices at Gemini Trust, a New York-based cryptocurrency exchange. “The Gemini bitcoin auction is an incredible liquidity event for bitcoin,” says John Deters, Cboe chief strategy officer. Yet Don Wilson, chief of DRW, a leading derivatives and cryptocurrencies trader, expressed concern about Gemini at a futures industry conference in Chicago last month. “Some of the auctions are pretty thinly traded,” he says, noting a recent one did not take place. A person close to Gemini blamed a glitch that has been fixed. Most banks and asset managers have avoided the $120bn bitcoin market, given its intense volatility and evolving mechanics. Vincent Viola, founder of Virtu Financial, another proprietary trading group, says: “We have stayed away from bitcoin at Virtu . . . we didn’t understand it enough and it wasn’t regulated enough.” However, futures industry executives say if any venues are able to handle the gyrations of bitcoin it is futures exchanges, which routinely manage contracts that make cryptocurrencies seem tame, such as electricity derivatives. “The industry has long experience with managing volatility and managing products that move around a lot,” says Carl Gilmore, president of Integritas Financial Consulting, who formerly led futures clearing firms. Mr Duffy also sees bitcoin as a way of finding another generation of customers. “I . . . look at it as a client-acquisition play,” he says. “There’s clients who trade our products, but may not trade as often, who are intrigued by this. There’s a lot of young people that will like this type of marketplace, and they don’t even know what futures are today.” 
66;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-11-14T17:36:00Z;Statoil pays $4m to settle claim it tried to manipulate price index;;Statoil, Norway’s biggest oil company, has agreed to pay $4m to settle a US charge that it tried to manipulate a price index to offset a losing position in Asian propane markets.The case from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission highlights the connections between physical and derivatives markets for energy. It also underscores the importance of price reporting agencies, which collect and distribute prices of physical commodity transactions, in setting benchmark values.The CFTC said in an order issued Tuesday that Statoil attempted to manipulate the Argus Far East Index to boost the value of its propane positions in October and November 2011. The index tracks propane prices in east Asia and is published by Argus, a leading price reporting agency. Statoil is majority-owned by the Norwegian government.The order said that Statoil tried to avoid major losses in its gas liquids business by purchasing propane cargoes during the November 2011 period in which Argus gathered prices for the Far East Index.“By purchasing cargoes in the Argus window, Statoil was hoping to signal that demand was high and put ‘upwards pressure’ on the November Argus FEI propane price,” the CFTC said.Statoil’s plan to profit by creating an artificial propane settlement price backfired, the CFTC said, as the purchases were not big enough to buoy prices.Nevertheless, the order found that Statoil intended to manipulate the Far East Index to benefit side positions in markets including swaps that cleared on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the CME Group unit whose derivatives markets are regulated by the agency.A Statoil spokeswoman said the company could not comment further than the settlement beyond saying it had worked “with the CFTC to resolve the matter”.The settlement is small compared with some past cases of energy price-rigging. In 2007, BP agreed to pay $303m to settle charges of manipulating the US propane market. In 2012, a federal court ordered trading firm Optiver to pay $14m relating to charges of manipulating oil markets.
67;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Fangs futures debut as tech stocks boom inspires a new market;The launch by ICE of a futures contract made up of big tech stocks seeks to tap investor enthusiasm;A leading exchange operator is getting in on investor enthusiasm for Fangs, a small basket of highly valuable technology stocks, with the launch of a futures contract branded with the catchy acronym.The Fangs — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, the parent company of Google — are joined by six other tech names in the futures contract that began trading Wednesday on Intercontinental Exchange. “Trade the top of tech,” said ICE in an announcement to customers.ICE, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange, created the NYSE FANG+ stock index in September. The equally-weighted basket is up 58 per cent in the year to date, compared to a 16 per cent gain for the S&P 500 stock index.It is the latest instance of a derivatives market trying to cash in on excitement happening outside its gates. Last week CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange operator, said it planned to offer bitcoin futures as prices for the cryptocurrency soar.ICE will next year lose the right to list futures on the Russell 2000 small-stock index as they migrate to CME. The Russell index family is owned by London Stock Exchange Group, an ICE competitor. The FANG+ index is controlled by ICE.Trabue Bland, president of ICE Futures US, said his company invented NYSE FANG+ in response to customer demand. Futures volume had topped 40 contracts at midday in New York.“We were out talking to customers about equity indexes, and this was the product that came back the most. It was the stocks that people were most excited about, and most excited about trading in one basket,” Mr Bland said.In addition to the four stocks captured by the Fang acronym, the equally weighted ICE index includes Apple, Alibaba, Baidu, Nvidia, Tesla and Twitter. The total market value of the 10 stocks is $3.5tn.Nicholas Colas of DataTrek, a research company, said it was unclear what question the product was supposed to answer or who the main users of the product would be, and called the US-listed stocks in the index “remarkably geo-centric”.He was amused by the “trade the top of tech” announcement. “Is it really the top of tech, like 1999?” he asked.Equity investors can already trade the stocks individually or gain similar exposure through exchange traded funds, baskets of securities that trade as a single name on a stock exchange. Last summer an ETF launched with the ticker “FNG” holding many of the same names.In contrast to ETFs or cash equities, trading futures only requires traders to post margin against their positions, tying up less capital. ICE described its products as a “hedging mechanism to quickly increase or decrease tech exposure in equities portfolios”.
68;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-10-31T16:52:55Z;CME to offer bitcoin futures;Cryptocurrency to join stable at world’s largest exchange group by year-end;CME Group, the world’s largest exchange operator by market value, is readying plans to offer futures on bitcoin, giving momentum to cryptocurrencies’ move away from the fringes of finance.The Chicago-based trading venue said it intended to add bitcoin to its stable of futures on interest rates, stock indices, commodities and currencies by the end of the year.Bitcoin, the biggest of the cryptocurrencies, is controlled by computer algorithms rather than central banks, unlike mainstream currencies. Advocates applaud its traceability while critics say it is an avenue for money laundering and fraud.The price of bitcoin has exploded by 570 per cent this year, luring traders bored by the lack of volatility across other markets. Hedge funds, family investment offices and proprietary trading companies are dipping their toes into cryptocurrency markets now worth more than $170bn, while banks and traditional asset managers have mostly steered clear.A lack of futures contracts has made it difficult to hedge exposure to bitcoin’s wild fluctuations. Terry Duffy, CME chief executive, said the exchange made its move “given increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets”. His exchange was a “natural home” for the vehicle.The gambit puts CME in competition with Chicago-based exchange operator Cboe Global Markets, which in August announced plans to launch derivatives on bitcoin based on data from virtual currency exchange Gemini Trust in late 2017 or early 2018.“The business case for us is the desire for exposure to crypto, period,” Ed Tilly, Cboe chief executive, said at a conference in October.Both CME’s and Cboe’s contracts require approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. A third company, LedgerX, opened a bitcoin derivatives venue two weeks ago, reporting more than $1m in trades in its first week.The CFTC declared bitcoin and other virtual currencies a “commodity” in 2015, enabling it to police futures contracts based on them. The agency recently warned that unregistered cash bitcoin markets are susceptible to “bucket shop” schemes, “Ponzi schemers” and “fraudsters seeking to capitalise on the current attention focused on virtual currencies”.Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, last month called bitcoin a “ fraud” that is used mostly by murderers, drug dealers and other miscreants. Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, said bitcoin was an “ index of money laundering”.The warnings have not dissuaded traders. Garrett See, chief executive of DV Chain, a Chicago-based trader, said CME’s announcement showed that “cryptocurrencies are gaining more legitimacy in the financial marketplace. It’s really exciting. I think it’s going to bring a lot of liquidity.”Bobby Cho, head of OTC trading at Chicago-based Cumberland — the leading cryptocurrencies market maker — said the announcement “potentially accelerates the pace of involvement of more traditional financial firms. Many already have connections into exchanges like CME, and this is just another product they can plug into.”Most new futures contracts fail for lack of volume. CME has in the past succeeded in introducing novel products, however, including interest rate and currency futures. Last year the notional value of its transactions topped $1,000tn.The new CME Group contract would be cash-settled, based on the CME CF bitcoin Reference Rate, a once-a-day index based on prices at the Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken bitcoin exchanges.Additional reporting by Philip Stafford in London
69;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-10-31T13:59:29Z;US exchange operator CME Group to launch bitcoin futures;;CME Group, the US exchange operator, has announced plans to launch bitcoin futures in the latest sign of the cryptocurrency’s growing prominence in mainstream financial circles.The Chicago-based company plans to roll out the new futures contracts in the fourth quarter of this year, pending “relevant regulatory review periods”.“Given increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets, we have decided to introduce a bitcoin futures contract,” said Terry Duffy, CME chief executive.The move puts CME into competition with its cross-town rival CBOE Global Markets, which is planning to launch options and derivatives on bitcoin.CBOE will take data from Gemini Trust, the virtual currency exchange run by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. They would be cleared via the Options Clearing Corporation, but the project is still awaiting regulatory approval.The CME group offers a slew of futures products that allow investors and businesses to hedge against and speculate on fluctuations in the price of assets. Well known examples include West Texas Intermediate, the US oil marker, euro-dollar currencies futures, agriculture products like corn and US stock-index futures.Bitcoin has surged from about $1,000 to the US dollar at the start of this year, to more than $6,000 on Tuesday. The massive price gains have attracted great interest, and also significant criticism.Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, last month called bitcoin a “fraud” that is used mostly by murderers, drug dealers and other miscreants.The new CME Group contract will be cash-settled, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, a once a day reference for the US dollar price of bitcoin.
70;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-10-10T03:59:12Z;From ranchers to fund managers, ‘algos’ cause a stir;Automated systems push up exchange volumes but traders still debate the benefits;Computers do not eat bread, wear jewellery or, for the most part, drive cars. Yet computer algorithms rather than humans are increasingly setting the prices of wheat, gold and fuel.Automated trading systems account for large volumes of transactions in commodity futures markets. In grains and oilseeds they account for 49 per cent, precious metals 54 per cent and crude oil 63 per cent, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Such systems range from sophisticated black-box algorithms to simple programs that execute an order when prices reach a set level. At CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange operator, orders have to be tagged as automated or manual to ease identification.Automation has fuelled a rise in volumes and fee revenue for commodity futures exchanges. But it has also sparked a debate over whether the mechanics of determining prices has changed for the better. Specifically, there are concerns that “fundamental” information such as weather or crop conditions is less useful in guiding short-term prices.“The whole notion of fundamentals on any given day, for weeks at a time, months at a time, has completely gone out the window these days,” says Doug Duquette, an executive at Chicago-based Vertex Analytics, whose software analyses automated market orders.“You get momentum of algos playing upon algos upon algos, and it will just drive markets to extremes that don’t seem to correlate or line up with fundamentals on any given day or time period,” he says.John Saucer is vice-president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group in Houston, which helps oil and gas producers hedge their sales. He says that “trending” energy markets, in which prices lock into long paths, are a thing of the past. Volatility is instead measured in short bursts.“It makes it more difficult to be a purely fundamental trader. In the past you had to take into account fundamental considerations, technical considerations and seasonal considerations — I do think you have to take into account transactional considerations and algos,” he says.We don’t demonise and we are not as apprehensive about it as we used to beIn early 2016, a trade group for US cattle ranchers confronted CME Group with concerns that fast computer traders were causing costly price gyrations in the cattle market.“We’re now in an electronic marketplace. The speed of computer advancement and technological advancement has absolutely exceeded our ability to adjust,” says Sarah Calhoun, government affairs manager of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.The exchange group has since made amendments to its cattle futures contracts and changed how it regulates order messages, by limiting the number of messages a trader could enter per transaction.Some beef producers use automated systems to manage their risks, Ms Calhoun acknowledges, but she says markets have become more volatile as automated trading grows. “We don’t demonise and we are not as apprehensive about automated traders as we used to be. But we are not saying that algorithms as a whole are not an issue.”By adding to volumes, automated systems should make markets more liquid. Traders, though, say these volumes are concentrated in contracts with imminent delivery dates, such as natural gas for December 2017 rather than December 2020. “Long-dated” futures remain illiquid, traders say.Some also complain that algorithms withdraw standing offers to buy or sell when another trader tries to transact with them, creating a mirage of market depth. “They’ve become a bit of a nuisance,” says Ernest Scalamandre of AC Investment Management. “They add volume but they don’t add liquidity.”Misgivings aside, there is no nostalgia for the days when trading consisted of people shouting and waving hands on old exchange floors. There, information about the identity and size of orders was apparent to the privileged few who held exchange seats, often at the expense of others calling in orders by telephone.“Electronic trading, from the point of view of a fund manager like me, is a hell of a lot better than pit trading because [automated trading systems] don’t screw you,” says John Bondurant, a fund manager in Memphis. “It used to be if I wanted to do 200 or 300 lots [contracts] of cotton it would take me all day. Now I can do it sometimes in 30 seconds. The liquidity is much deeper.”He says it seems unfair that traders using fast algorithms can jump in front of his orders, obtaining a better price. But the larger size of markets has made it easier to trade.FIA, the futures industry trade group, says automated trading has many benefits. Greg Wood, FIA senior vice-president of global industry operations, says: “It’s important to note that automation isn’t driving prices — fundamentals are still doing so, and automation makes price discovery more efficient.”
71;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:29:19+0000;Market odds of December rate rise climb above 90%;;Investors on Friday ratcheted up expectations for a December rate rise after the latest US jobs report pointed to a significant gain in wage growth.The implied probability of a Federal Reserve rate increase in December, which would be the third this year, climbed as high as 98 per cent on the heels of the report, before slipping to 93 per cent, according to CME Group calculations based on federal funds futures.Either way, the reading is up substantially from Thursday, when it registered at 77.5 per cent, and a month ago, when the odds were less than 40 per cent.Wall Street economists eyed data that showed US average hourly earnings accelerated at an annual pace of 2.9 per cent last month, up from 2.7 per cent in August. The strong gains in salaries comes as good news for the Fed, which has been frustrated by tepid wage growth despite an otherwise robust labour market.“The implications for Fed policy is all over this rise in wages as the market starts to not just fully price in a rate hike in December but at least another one next year,” said Peter Boockvar, chief market strategist at the Lindsey Group.Other asset markets also responded to Friday’s jobs report. The dollar added modestly to its gains, while Treasury yields pushed higher.Read more:US economy sheds 33,000 jobs in September, but wage growth picks upUS stock futures dip after payrolls dataDollar rises, Treasury prices fall after rise in hourly earnings growth
72;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-10-06T12:34:04Z;US economy sheds 33,000 jobs in September, but wage growth picks up;;The US economy shed jobs last month for the first time since 2010 as the labour market was hit by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma but the monthly assessment also showed that wage growth gathered steam.Employment dropped by 33,000 jobs in September the Labor Department said on Friday, against economists’ estimates in a Thomson Reuters poll for non-farm payrolls to grow by 90,000. That compared with 169,000 jobs created the previous month, After revisions job gains have averaged 91,000 over the past three months.The report noted a sharp decline in food services and drinking hubs last month, with employment falling by 105,000 as many workers were off payrolls due to the storms. However, healthcare jobs rose by 23,000 in line with the average monthly gain over the past 12 months.In a positive sign, average hourly earnings of private workers grew at a year-over-year rate of 2.9 per cent, up from 2.7 per cent in the previous month. The September reading was significantly stronger than the 2.5 per cent that Wall Street was expecting.“Hourly earnings rose sharply, probably because the people who temporarily dropped off payrolls are lower paid than average,” Ian Shepherdson, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted.The US dollar rose to its highest level since July after the report showed that wages posted their biggest gain since December 2016 bolstering the odds that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time this year.Indeed, the implied probability of a rate rise in December climbed as high as 98 per cent after the report, before slipping to 93 per cent, according to CME Group calculations. That compared with 77.5 per cent odds of a move registered on Thursday. And the DXY dollar index, a gauge of the buck against a basket of six peers, rose as much as 0.3 per cent to 94. 27. However US stocks slid from record levels, with the S&P 500 down 0.2 per cent to 2,547.27.Meanwhile, the data also showed that unemployment rate fell to a fresh 16-year low of 4.2 per cent against estimates for it to remain unchanged at 4.4 per cent.Ahead of Friday’s release, economists had cautioned that the data would probably be distorted by the hurricanes that Goldman Sachs estimates affected more than 10 per cent of the population and caused over $100bn in damages. However, they expect the underlying picture of the US labour market remains solid and that September’s weak reading could be discounted.

It rose 0.58 per cent on Monday.Tuesday’s gains for the greenback were broad: the euro dipped slightly $1.1721 and the pound slipped 0.12 per cent to $1.3260. The buck rose 0.26 per cent on the Japanese yen to ¥113.04.After posting a torrid performance for much of this year, the dollar has embarked on something of a rebound rally. The dollar index has climbed 2.2 per cent over the past month, but it is still down 8.3 per cent for the year-to-date, Reuters data show.“The recent bounce in the US dollar should continue,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs this week.The New York investment bank said that although the hurricanes that have slammed into America will “likely weigh on some upcoming data … the US economy otherwise looks in good shape.” That notion was underscored on Monday, with a closely-watched survey on the American manufacturing sector exceeding Wall Street expectations.Meanwhile, on the fiscal front, the drumbeat for corporate tax reform is growing louder. If enacted by Congress, many economists reckon it would rev-up US economic growth.In a sign of the bullish economic sentiment, the market odds for a December Federal Reserve rate increase, which would be the third this year, have jumped to 70 per cent from 42 per cent a month ago, according to CME Group calculations based on federal funds futures.Goldman notes, too, that the other side of the ledger is looking less sturdy than it was a few weeks ago. Political anxiety has crept back into the eurozone, pressuring the euro, which is the largest weight in the dollar index. A surprisingly weak election victory by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, coupled with the strong performance of separatists in the Catalan referendum have both undermined the common currency.Euro downside is “our preferred expression of [dollar] strength in the near-term,” Goldman said.
74;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Commodities markets swell in size despite price slide;Record open interest hints that buyers may be returning after seven lean years;Commodities prices are heading for their sixth loss in seven years. But commodities markets have never been bigger.Open interest — the number of commodities contracts outstanding — has been booming on futures exchanges this year. From crude oil to soyabean oil, the markets’ size has increased by nearly 1.4m contracts in the first nine months of 2017, the most in seven years.Just this week, open interest in US crude futures hit a new record of more than 2.4m contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In London, low-sulphur gasoil futures surpassed 1m contracts for the first time. Total open interest in contracts tracked by the benchmark Bloomberg Commodity Index is 14.3m, the most on record, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.The increase may seem puzzling, given commodities’ status as one of the decade’s worst-performing asset classes. The Bloomberg index has lost investors 38 per cent since 2010, compared to a 164 per cent total return from the S&P 500 stock index. Volatility has also been subdued, robbing fund managers of opportunities to make big profits.Some believe higher open interest shows investors are once again flirting with commodities. Assets under management in commodity products recently jumped above $400bn for the first time in more than a year, according to Aakash Doshi, an analyst at Citigroup. While the Bloomberg index is lower for the year, it has gained 2.9 per cent in the quarter ending this week.“If you look around, bonds have had a good run, stocks have had a good run. Commodities are one of the few asset classes that have gotten crushed,” says Tim Atwill, head of investment strategy at Parametric, a Seattle-based asset manager with $3bn in commodity funds. “People say, ‘Well, it may not be a bad entry point’.”Arithmetic suggests lower prices themselves may have pumped up open interest. One hundred dollars can now buy roughly two barrels’ worth of US crude oil, which was trading on Thursday at $52.55 a barrel, compared to one when it still traded above $100.The low volatility pervading financial markets these days is also a factor, says Greg Sharenow, a commodities portfolio manager at the fund manager Pimco. Smaller price moves mean exchange clearing houses generally demand less margin, or collateral, to be held against outstanding futures positions. This enables fund managers to make bigger bets.“The increase in open interest has been a function of both the lower volatility as well as lower prices. For a dollar at risk to be in the market, you end up with higher amounts of contracts at play,” he says.Mr Sharenow also points to the increasing prevalence of systematic investment strategies that follow price trends or trade commodities against other asset classes. Managed futures funds, one type of investor in this category, have taken in $5bn in new investment in the year to date, bringing their assets under management to $126bn, according to eVestment.Companies that typically use futures markets to hedge price risks have also stepped up activity in some commodities markets. US shale oil producers have unleashed a wave of forward sales to lock in a recent rise in crude oil prices, deals that filter into the futures market.Derek Sammann, global head of commodity and option products at Chicago-based futures exchange operator CME Group, says that at a time of relatively stable commodity prices, “it might seem counterintuitive to see increases in open interest”. CME lists such commodities as corn, gold and US crude oil on four exchanges, including Nymex and the Chicago Board of Trade.He questions the idea that investment funds sparked growth in open interest, saying that commercial businesses such as miners, oil companies or farmers typically come first.Indeed, a number of the biggest commodity exchange traded funds, such as the $2bn PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund or the $2.3bn United States Oil Fund, have suffered outflows this year, according to ETF.com.In the past three years, CME has “made the end-user commercial participant central to all of our sales and new client engagement strategies”. If commercial traders come, “the financial players tend to follow”, Mr Sammann says.Open interest has not climbed uniformly across all futures contracts. In US oil futures on Nymex, the sum has plunged for contracts to be delivered years from now. One reason is because Wall Street banks are taking less risk in illiquid markets. Another, says Mr Sammann, is because the shale industry that has transformed US oil production operates on much shorter timescales than megaprojects, reducing their need to hedge in the distant future.Investors wading back into commodities tend to hold contracts for delivery in the near future, where open interest is highest, rolling them into new contracts as they expire. Mr Atwill calls commodities “a very liquid asset class that at the very least is not as overvalued as everything else.”
75;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:29:19+0000;US Treasuries slide after Yellen’s bullish economic assessment;;US government bonds faced broad selling pressure on Wednesday after Fed chair Janet Yellen remained steadfast in her view that gradual rate rises are needed despite soggy inflation.In early trading, the benchmark 10-year yield jumped almost 7.2 basis points (0.072 percentage points) to 2.301 per cent, crossing above 2.3 per cent for the first time since August 1, according to Reuters data. The more policy-sensitive two-year yield also rose, climbing from 1.44 per cent on Tuesday to 1.4707 per cent on Wednesday, setting the highest point since 2008. (Yields rise when prices fall.)Ms Yellen said late on Tuesday that despite tepid inflation, the US labour market continues to tighten at a rapid clip. As such, the Fed should be “wary of moving too gradually” in tightening monetary policy.The Fed has already raised interest rates twice this year, and unveiled plans to begin winding down its vast balance sheet that it built-up during the 2008-09 financial crisis.Confident comments from the Fed chief, as well as other top policymakers, have prompted Wall Street dramatically to increase its expectations for whether the Fed will lift its main interest rate again in December.Federal funds futures now point to an 83.1 per cent chance of a December rate increase, up from 73 per cent a week ago, and 40 per cent a month ago, according to CME Group calculations.“Fed Chair Yellen added to her hawkish message from last week, warning of the risks of tightening too gradually and emphasizing that temporary factors appear to be holding down inflation,” said analysts at BNP Paribas.Economists at UBS added: “we see this speech as consistent with our call for a hike in December.”Other assets also responded to Ms Yellen’s remarks. The US dollar index, a gauge of the buck against six major trading partners, climbed 0.4 per cent, adding to its gains this week. Gold, which provides no yield, slipped 0.3 per cent to $1,289 a troy ounce.
76;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-09-18T14:09:29Z;Dow, S&P, Nasdaq set new record highs ahead of Fed meeting;;Another day, another set of records broken on Wall Street.All three major US stock indices opened at fresh lifetime highs on Monday as investors moved to snap up riskier assets amid easing tensions with North Korea and as the markets wait for the latest Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday.The S&P 500 tacked on 0.3 per cent within minutes of the opening bell to hit 2,508.34. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by a similar margin to 22,334.72 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent at 6,471.91.A set of stronger-than-expected inflation readings last week has rekindled talks of further monetary tightening this year, with the odds of a December interest rate increase now seen at nearly 56 per cent compared to 37 per cent just a month ago, according to CME Group data.While policymakers are widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, the market is hoping for new details on the Feds’ plans to unwind its massive balance sheet. There will be keen interest in the new official economic forecasts.“These may be used to reinforce the message that, while there is little need for aggressive interest rate hikes, the market remains too complacent on the prospect of higher interest rates,” said analysts at ING.Haven assets came under slight selling pressure. Yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, edged up another 2 basis points to 2.2199 per cent. Gold fell 0.5 per cent to $1,312.28 per troy ounce. Utilities was the only sector on the S&P 500 to fall in the red.The dollar was largely unchanged, with the DXY index at 91.88.
77;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-09-15T15:24:10Z;CME to exit CDS clearing business, cedes ground to ICE;;"CME Group will no longer clear credit default swaps, ceding ground to rival Intercontinental Exchange in a business established after the financial crisis.
Credit default swaps offer investors protection against the default of a borrower or index of borrowers. Exchanges and policy makers moved to push the derivatives on to regulated clearinghouses after uncleared swaps sold by the insurer AIG necessitated its government bailout in 2008.In 2009, both CME and ICE began clearing credit default swaps, but the latter has absorbed more business. The average daily notional value of derivatives cleared at ICE’s US credit clearinghouse is $34bn, according to the company. CME clears about $1.5bn in notional credit default swaps daily.CME has been trimming businesses that don’t make money. Earlier this year it announced the closure of its loss-making London exchange and clearing house after failing to gain traction among European customers.The company said it will exit the credit default swap clearing business by mid-2018, returning $650m in clearing funds to members at the clearing house. Another $50m contributed by CME will be returned to its treasury.CME will continue to clear over-the-counter interest rate swaps and foreign exchange products, where margin money can be offset against margin held for similar futures contracts.Clearing interest rate swaps and credit default swap contracts has contributed 2 per cent of CME’s $3.6bn in annual revenue."
78;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-06-21T20:45:28Z;Cattle futures trades were bull, regulator alleges;Tennessee investment firm fined over scheme to bust position limits;Vast pens teeming with cattle were at the centre of an investor’s brazen scheme to dupe futures traders, a regulator has alleged.Feedyards are a common sight — and scent — in remote parts of the US Great Plains region. At last count, 11m cattle were fattening there on corn and soya meal before their journey to the abattoir.But in the winter of 2012-13, four unnamed feedyards also received money to enable one trading firm to secretly amass outsized positions in the cattle futures market, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.McVean Trading & Investments of Memphis, Tennessee — whose website says it is “best known as one of the more prominent traders of cattle futures in the United States” — used the feedyards as fake purchasers of hundreds of live cattle futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.That activity misled others into believing there was “wider market interest, participation, and fragmentation” of bullish traders than really existed, the CFTC said in an enforcement order.The futures regulator did not allege that McVean Trading created artificial prices for cattle futures, a criterion for bringing a charge of manipulation. Instead the agency found the company “intentionally or recklessly used a manipulative or deceptive device to inject false information into the market”, using a more expansive enforcement tool established by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010.McVean Trading will pay a penalty of $1.5m while its chief executive, Charles Dow McVean Sr, has agreed to a $2m penalty. Company president Michael Wharton was ordered to pay $1m, and Samuel Gilmore, accused of aiding the scheme, will pay $500,000. Mr Gilmore was affiliated with Chicago-based futures broker Rosenthal Collins Group at the time of the alleged scheme.In a statement, McVean Trading said it co-operated fully with the CFTC during its inquiry and added the settlement does not have an impact on its clients or capital. “McVean is pleased to resolve the investigation and put this matter behind it,” the company said. Rosenthal Collins declined to comment.Live cattle futures have moved erratically in recent years, sparking complaints from the ranchers, feedyard operators and meatpackers that use the market. Last year CME temporarily stopped listing new contracts amid the discontent.As futures contracts expire, investors face limits on their positions. In live cattle this starts at 450 contracts and decreases to 300 contracts in the month of expiry. One contract delivers 18 tonnes of cattle.As live cattle futures expired in December 2012, Mr McVean — with help from Mr Gilmore — enlisted two cattle feedyards to buy up additional cattle futures at his direction, the CFTC said. The feedyards were paid $100 per contract and eventually built up positions totalling 400 contracts, implying an inducement of $40,000.Mr McVean and Mr Wharton engaged in a similar scheme in February 2013, this time with four feedyards.“This enabled McVean and Wharton to exceed spot month position limits and conceal their control over excess positions not only from the live cattle market, but also from the commission,” the enforcement order said.This was not McVean Trading’s first regulatory punishment over cattle futures. In 1993, records show, the agency slapped the company and six people including Mr McVean with $2.2m in civil penalties, alleging they “engaged in a regular practice of exceeding speculative position limits” and then concealed the violations by filing false reports.
79;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-06-05T08:33:51Z;Automated trading of commodity futures accelerating;Use of algorithms is controversial as study finds rise in volumes of traffic;The machines are taking over markets for energy, metals and food.Automated trading systems now account for half the volume in many commodity futures after proliferating over the past two years, a government study has found.The rise of trading run without human intervention has sparked controversy among the farmers, ranchers, industrial companies and hedge funds that trade futures. Some contend prices have become disconnected from forces of supply and demand because of algorithms, while others welcome added volumes. “This is a charged debate,” said Rick Lane, chief executive of Trading Technologies, a software vendor.The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a derivatives watchdog, has suggested rules to lessen the risk of mayhem from a computer gone awry. Industry groups have pushed back.Automation can range from sophisticated black-box trading systems to off-the-shelf kit that helps execute large orders. As electronic networks replaced exchange floors, trading speeds have accelerated to the point that someone clicking with a computer mouse is considered slow.If you understand [automated trading] better you can use it as an extra tool to position yourself better. Don’t ignore itThe study, by two CFTC research analysts, found that commodities such as grains, oil and metals previously had a relatively small amount of automation compared to financial products such as interest-rate and currency futures.But “both the level of automation and the speed of trading continue to increase” in physical commodity contracts, the analysts wrote.The automation of grain and oilseed volumes rose from 39 to 49 per cent between the periods 2012-14 and 2014-16, the study found. Livestock futures went from 32 to 46 per cent automated, precious metals climbed from 46 to 54 per cent and crude oil increased from 54 to 63 per cent. The data came from futures exchange operator CME Group, which declined to comment.In soyabean and wheat contracts, more than a quarter of volumes now consist of two automated systems transacting with each other, with an even larger share coming from deals that match automated and manual traders, according to the study. The CFTC also had no comment.Automation has concerned some traditional users of agricultural futures markets, which date to the 19th century. Last year a US beef trade group complained that lightning-fast traders were undermining the usefulness of the market.A grain trader at a US hedge fund lamented that “fundamentals”, such as corn yields or exports, no longer had as much impact on prices. “The biggest reason for that is the amount of algorithmic trading happening inside our markets is dramatically greater than it’s ever been,” he said.Daan Vriens, chief executive of Cefetra, the biggest supplier in Europe to the animal feed market, said it had invested in two algorithmic trading funds. “If you understand it better you can use it as an extra tool to position yourself better. Don’t ignore it. Some of the people in the industry ignored it, saying fundamentals will prevail,” he said at the FT Commodities Global Summit in March.Mr Lane said: “We’ve seen a greater acceptance and willingness to use automation across our client base.”Additional reporting by Neil Hume

But banks and trading firms have resisted the idea of compensating exchanges for information gleaned from deals they have already paid once to transact.“The user community is in a difficult position. The exchanges hold all the pricing power around market data,” said Thomas Lehrkinder, senior analyst at Tabb Group, a consultancy.John Pietrowicz, CME’s chief financial officer, told analysts that several large customers had consolidated the number of data screens they purchased from the exchange in the first quarter, contributing to a 5.5 per cent decline in market data revenue to $96.8m.More unsettling to investors, executives said a new push to expand in “derived data,” which licences products based on CME market prices, and services such as cloud-based data would take a longer time to deliver than previously announced.Terry Duffy, chief executive, said: “We underestimated the complexity of resourcing our team.” Mr Pietrowicz warned market data revenue would be “range bound,” abandoning an earlier prediction of growth.The lower market data revenue contributed to a 0.5 per cent decline in total revenue in the first quarter to $929.3m. CME’s net income rose 8.7 per cent on year to $399.8m, or $1.18 per share.CME exchanges list leading futures contracts on US interest rates, equity indices, oil, grains and other markets. The company does not rely on market data as much as peers such as Intercontinental Exchange, which has acquired large data companies to become less dependent on the ebb and flow trading volumes.At CME, average daily volumes reached a record during the first quarter. Open interest, or the number of futures contracts outstanding, also reached a record of more than 123m contracts.
81;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-04-21T12:49:53Z;London Metal Exchange to table wide-ranging reforms;Members to evaluate proposals including overhaul of contract expiry dates;The London Metal Exchange, facing falling trading volumes and tougher competition, plans to ask its members to evaluate wide-ranging reforms that are intensifying a robust internal debate over its future.The 140-year-old institution is set to outline proposed reforms in the coming weeks, evaluating almost all aspects of its business, including whether it should become more similar to rivals such as the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator.The moves come as it was announced on Friday that a 35-year-old former investment banker, Matthew Chamberlain, has been appointed as the new chief executive of the LME from his current position as interim chief.Bought by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing in 2012 for £1.4bn, the LME faces tougher competition from derivatives exchanges that list standard monthly futures contracts, which all expire on the same day of the month and are electronically transacted.In contrast, the LME uses rolling three-month contracts that all expire on separate days, a structure that appeals to traders of physical metals, as they often prefer exact dates that allow them to hedge the price exposure of their shipments.Opinion among LME members is currently divided almost equally for and against a reform of the exchange’s date structure.Some members, who have seen a draft of the proposed reforms, told the Financial Times that the document was too broad in scope and that an actual concrete plan of action could take months to materialise.“It’s a sign of weakness,” a member said. “You [LME] don’t know what you want to do and you’re going go to ask everybody again and you’re going to get a bunch of views that you already have.”Another member said: “There’s a desire to say we’re a new open LME, whereas previously they were pushing things through, but I’m not really sure what that does. In the end you need a good plan. They are going to have to make a decision.”The announcement of a new chief executive comes after the abrupt departure of Garry Jones in January.His successor Mr Chamberlain led the exchange through a complicated reform of its warehousing system over the past few years.“We are committed to broad engagement with our stakeholders, to understand their perspectives, and to map out a development path for the LME which evolves together with the needs of our users,” LME said. “We will only make changes where and when we believe these to be in the best interests of the whole market.”

There will be some job losses although the bulk of its 400-strong UK staff, most of whom are based at its St Paul’s office, will remain. It will also keep its data repository, a spokesperson confirmed.The five-year old CME Europe and seven-year old CME Clearing were set up as a regulatory hedge amid uncertainty over its future and the application of new derivatives rules after the financial crisis.Senior executives had worries that European traders would balk at the Dodd-Frank rules, and also had some fears that an aggressive US regulator would look to break open its “vertical silo” business model, which confines trading in some widely-traded products to their venues only. The model is the basis for the CME’s $40bn market capitalisation.Terry Duffy, chief executive of CME, said in February he was “hopeful” that Washington would amend some post-crisis rules, such as the Volcker rule.After a delay of more than a year CME Europe began offering foreign exchange and energy trading, as well as over-the-counter interest rate swaps clearing.However, losses have totalled more than $110m since the businesses’ inception in 2012 and most customers in Europe preferred to trade and clear the CME’s most actively traded products, such as eurodollar and foreign exchange futures, which are all based in the US.CME Europe was the smallest of the UK’s four clearing houses and held £107m in initial margin from customers, up from £26m a year ago. The end of a market-making scheme for foreign exchange futures in February also hurt volumes.The exchange said it plans to transfer the open gas and foreign exchange futures contracts to its American operations, pending approval from US regulators.Its future had been under review by Mr Duffy, who took over from Phupinder Gill in November. Mr Gill had backed the opening of CME Europe.“Our customers have shown that they prefer to access our global products, deep liquidity and greater capital efficiencies through our US infrastructure,” said William Knottenbelt, senior managing director of CME’s international business.

84;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
85;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-02-02T18:09:22Z;CME Group results helped by political change and Trump;Futures bourses notch record volumes as unexpected poll victory fuels trading;CME Group, the biggest operator of financial exchanges, was the latest financial business to reveal results helped by political change and the election of Donald Trump.The group of futures bourses, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, notched record volumes in interest rate, energy and metals contracts in the fourth quarter of 2016 as Mr Trump’s unexpected presidential victory triggered a burst of trading.The group, which announced record 2016 daily volumes last month, on Thursday reported net profit of $373.4m, or $1.10 per share, in the fourth quarter, up 28 per cent from $291.7m, or $0.86 per share, in the same period a year before.Revenues climbed 12 per cent year on year to $912.9m. Investors bid CME shares up 2.2 per cent to $123.06.Elections in Germany, France and elsewhere in Europe in 2017 could stoke more action, according to Terry Duffy, chief executive. “It could be another volatile situation,” he said.Other institutions helped by Mr Trump’s victory include Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, which have enjoyed a trading surge in the fourth quarter.Virtu Financial, a New York high-speed trading firm whose founder is Mr Trump’s pick to be secretary of the US army, said Thursday that volumes and volatility were “upended” by the election, “with much more favourable market conditions” in November and early December even as it reported a drop in revenue and net trading income for the quarter.At CME, 84 per cent of revenue flowed from transaction and clearing fees in the quarter, underscoring its reliance on trading volumes. The Federal Reserve’s decision to raise US interest rates in December also gave trading a boost, although in January volumes declined 12 per cent from a strong month a year before, the company said.The US election put Republicans in control of the White House and both houses of Congress. Mr Duffy said he was “hopeful” that Washington would amend the Volcker rule — a ban on banks making bets with depositors’ money — to allow proprietary trading in futures.“The banks were able to proprietary trade in cash Treasuries [bonds]. But for some reason they omitted the futures contracts,” said Mr Duffy.A bill introduced last year by Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House financial services committee, would repeal the Volcker rule.Another prospective US policy change is so-called border adjustment, which would tax imported goods and exempt exports. The proposal by Kevin Brady, chief tax writer in the US House of Representatives, could spur more domestic US crude oil production by penalising imports, analysts say.Mr Duffy said the proposal could also shift the price relationship of the two main oil benchmarks, West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude. “That could be quite interesting for the energy complex,” he said.Additional reporting by Hannah Murphy in London
86;CME;CME Group Inc;2017-01-23T17:18:07Z;London Metal Exchange chief executive to step down;Garry Jones created tensions with LME brokers and traders by raising fees;The London Metal Exchange is searching for a new chief executive after Monday’s abrupt resignation of Garry Jones, who clashed with brokers and battled to stem a decline in activity on the 140-year-old bourse.In a short statement, the LME’s parent company Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing said that Mr Jones had “retired” with immediate effect after three years in the job. Matthew Chamberlain, the LME’s 34-year-old chief operating officer, has been appointed interim chief executive, it said.Mr Jones is the second top executive to leave in two months. In December, the LME announced that Stuart Sloan, its chief operating officer, would leave. It did not give a reason for either man’s departure.Appointed chief executive after the LME was bought by HKEx for $2.2bn in 2012, Mr Jones, 58, pursued a modernisation programme and oversaw efforts to break into the huge Chinese market, the world’s largest metals consumer.But attempts to attract more electronic users to the exchange failed to lift trading volumes, which were down 7.7 per cent in 2016 compared to 2015. Trading volumes at LME’s competitors, the CME Group in the US and Shanghai Futures Exchange in China, have risen.Tensions with brokers and traders, who work on the exchange and previously owned it, increased after the LME raised trading fees by 34 per cent in 2015. In a climbdown in August last year, it slashed some fees after a few of its brokers considered setting up a rival exchange.“He was increasingly becoming an incredibly square peg in a very round hole,” said Malcolm Freeman, director of brokerage Kingdom Futures. “The general perception was the LME was telling the market what it needed without listening to the market. The exchange needs to get in contact with its core members.”At the annual LME dinner in November last year, veteran trader and hedge fund manager Michael Farmer launched a blistering attack on the exchange and described the cost of trading as “prohibitive”. He also criticised the advent of high-speed electronic trading on the exchange, which he said might be deterring other traders and contributing to the decline in volumes.Charles Li, chief executive of HKEx, responded by calling on the LME’s members not to “rock the boat”. After the dinner, Mr Li stayed on in London to canvass the views of the metals community, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.Mr Jones earned £1.7m in compensation in 2015, including salary and bonus. He is a former chief executive of NYSE Liffe, and spent much of his career as a derivatives trader.“We thank Garry for the contributions he has made to the transformation of the LME over the past few years and we wish him the best in his new endeavours,” Mr Li said on Monday.Brokers said that the LME’s new chief executive would have to work with the exchange’s traditional user base of producers and traders while charting an electronic future for the LME, and expanding the exchange’s links with China.They said that Mr Chamberlain would be a frontrunner for the job, having overseen the reform of its complex warehousing network, following complaints of abuse and regulatory scrutiny.“Matt is very liked. He knows the industry and is a bit of a metals nerd. The question is whether he is CEO material,” said one senior metals executive. “This interim period will give everybody a chance to find out.”
87;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-12-16T05:50:27Z;Chicago retains role as capital of derivatives industry;Open-outcry pits are becoming a thing of the past, but the expertise has stayed;When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched its electronic transaction system, its chosen name of Globex was a clear indication of how it saw the business developing.Globex allowed people anywhere in the world to buy and sell futures as easily as the traders shouting in Chicago’s octagonal pits. The technology also signalled the beginning of the end of the open outcry system that had been operating in Chicago since the 19th century.Yet, while the marketplaces have largely become virtual, Chicago has retained its role as capital of the listed derivatives industry.The metropolitan area has 45,000 jobs in derivatives and related sectors — which includes trade in futures contracts and other financial products — about the same as 15 years ago, according to the Illinois Department of Employment Security.Including programmers, lawyers, accountants and other people in the services industries, the derivatives sector probably employs tens of thousands more, industry executives say.It has survived because many of the traders and brokers who learnt their business in the pits stayed on and embraced digital change. CME also acquired its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, and competitors in New York and Kansas City to become CME Group, a futures markets titan.The headquarters of proprietary trading firms such as Jump Trading, DRW, Allston Trading, Peak6, Spot Trading and Ronin Capital can all be found in a two-mile radius around the centrally located Chicago Loop district. Proprietary traders risk their own capital in markets from interest rates to oil and often generate the most volume on exchanges.“Many of the firms that were founded here have their roots in the pits, but we’ve all found ways to use technology to do this better,” says Donald Wilson, chief executive of DRW, which he established in 1992, the same year that Globex was launched.Many large independent futures brokers have chosen Chicago as their base, including ADM Investor Services, RJ O’Brien Associates, and Rosenthal Collins Group.Futures brokers provide crucial links between traders and listed derivatives markets, helping to ensure that financial commitments are met. CME says 70 per cent of its clearing brokers are located in Illinois.“You can feel it,” says Michael Creadon, chief executive of Traditum Group, a proprietary trader based in the Chicago Board of Trade building. “There’s still a very large trading presence in the city.”Trend of moving out to the suburbs is now being reversedThe network revolves around the exchanges, particularly CME and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, respectively the world’s biggest futures exchange and largest US equity options bourse.The majority of volumes at both CME and CBOE are now transacted electronically. But the city retains business networks of brokers, lawyers, accountants and the universities with their academic specialists in derivatives markets. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based exchange operator, also has an office and a data centre in the city.“By virtue of CME Group, CBOE and even ICE’s presence, there has been a concentration more than a dispersion of activity in Chicago,” says Craig Donohue, chief executive of Chicago-based Options Clearing Corp and former head of CME.However deep their roots, Chicago exchanges threatened to leave town several years ago after the state raised the corporate tax rate.Earlier this year, CME protested against plans to impose a financial transaction tax to alleviate state budget problems.“A transaction tax will absolutely drive our customers and customers of other exchanges not only out of the markets — but I assure you — out of Illinois,” Terry Duffy, CME chairman, warned in written testimony.Almost everyone you meet knows someone who has worked in the markets at some pointMr Duffy informed lawmakers that CME had just sold and leased back its data centre in the Chicago suburb of Aurora, a deal that allowed it to move the guts of the Globex system to another state. “We have 28 data centres to choose from,” he said.Despite threatened departures, Chicago remains a magnet. When GH Financials of London expanded to the US about five years ago, the futures broker chose Chicago for its base.“Almost everyone you meet who lives here knows someone who has worked in the markets at some point,” says Mr Wilson of DRW. “And it’s always been a place where you could find success without a pedigree or connections, as long as you were willing to work hard and chase things down.”Bernard Dan, who previously ran both the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago-based proprietary trading firm Sun Trading, says the city’s dense web of infrastructure, expertise and capital for the industry is “very hard to replicate”.“That’s really what has historically solidified Chicago as the derivatives capital,” Mr Dan says. “In my judgment it’s going to continue, because the talent’s there.”
88;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-11-17T13:21:11Z;Swaps industry balks at joining Trump in gutting Dodd-Frank;While US president-elect seeks to dismantle reforms, some hope for just a few tweaks;For much of the past decade the derivatives industry has been caught in the gravitational pull of the Dodd-Frank act, the sweeping piece of legislation meant to contain the risk of another financial crisis.Six years after its passage, US president-elect Donald Trump wants to dismantle the law. The industry, however is not racing to join him.At this week’s Global Financial Leadership Conference, a gathering of derivatives traders, discussions dwelled on topics such as the UK’s Brexit vote and artificial intelligence, not repealing Dodd-Frank.“You can’t dismantle something after it was just put into law, when the country was basically almost knocked into the Stone Age in 2007 and 2008,” says Terry Duffy, chief executive of CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange and host of the conference.Dodd-Frank contained specific remedies for over-the-counter derivatives markets, blamed for exacerbating the last crisis and the reforms sparked robust lobbying from banks and brokers at the start of the decade.Gary Gensler, then chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sought to break the bank-dominated dealer model and cut the web of interbank exposures. New rules mandated that generic swaps, with notional values in the billions, had to be traded on electronic marketplaces known as swap execution facilities (Sefs). More of the market, with a gross market exposure of $20tn, was pushed through central clearing houses and reported to data warehouses.“I haven’t seen calls to dismantle Title 7 [the derivatives section of Dodd-Frank]. Quite the contrary — what I’ve seen is a growing consensus that the reforms made sense,” says Timothy Massad, the current CFTC chairman.For some in the swaps industry, Mr Trump’s victory offers hope of minor but significant tweaks. Michael Spencer, chief executive of ICAP, calls the rules well intentioned but “overdesigned and overengineered . . . a repeal or review of Dodd-Frank would be a good thing for the market as a whole”.Even so, many executives think abolishing the law is a step too far. “I think there’s some fringe things that he can do on Dodd-Frank, [but] there’s no way in my opinion that he can go in there — I think it would even scare the Republicans — and say we’re going to dismantle it and have no laws and go back to what we had in 2007 and prior,” says Mr Duffy.One reality is that Dodd-Frank and a push to electronic trading have become embedded in markets.“In some respects it will be just as costly to take out as put in,” says the chief executive of a swaps trading venue who declined to be identified. “People have changed their methods for interacting with the market. Regulations have helped drive the changes. In Treasuries it took 10 years [to go electronic] but in swaps it was just one year.”There are also potentially limits to change as the mandate was part of a global G20 commitment to bolster over-the-counter markets with clearing and trade reporting. Many have recognised the US’s rules as equivalent. Complaints around the rules are legion, particularly for Sefs. Many market participants complain that these venues have split the global swaps market, particularly as traders in Europe shy away from interacting with US counterparts.Trading between European and US dealers comprised 28.7 per cent of market share at the time of the introduction of Sefs in September 2013. That had fallen to 7.6 per cent by the end of last year, according to data from Isda, the trade association.That bifurcated market creates pricing problems. Brokers at ICAP’s London-based Sef talk to dealers about prices “on-Sef” and “off-Sef”. “Every day there’s a conscious decision to switch trading to a Sef from a European platform,” says one broker.Others say Sefs are not the lightly-controlled markets they were intended to be. “There’s not a big gap between running a Sef and running a futures market,” says the chief executive of another Sef, who declined to be identified.Does the election victory of Donald Trump represent an opportunity or a threat to Europe? Gideon Rachman discusses the mixed reaction across the continent with George Parker, the FT’s political editor in London, and diplomatic correspondent Arthur Beesley in BrusselsBut industry executives say it’s possible for regulators to fix problems without ripping apart the law. Annette Nazareth, partner at Davis Polk in Washington, points out that “there’s an awful lot an agency can do outside the legislative process, via rules interpretations or amendments.”“Right now the US is on the bleeding edge in implementing this part of the 2009 G20 agreements . . . so the swaps execution mandate would be the easiest to roll back and most at risk,” says David Weiss, an analyst at Aite Group, a capital markets consultancy.Furthermore, a blueprint for reform already exists. Two years ago Christopher Giancarlo, a commissioner at the CFTC, published an 89-page white paper advocating reforms. As the sole Republican commissioner, he has also been widely discussed as a possible new CFTC chairman under a Trump administration. While he backed central swaps clearing and reporting trades to repositories, he also strongly criticised trading rules. They were overly prescriptive, had significant policy changes buried in footnotes, and had failed to achieve their goals by misapplying the futures market model to the swaps market.More critically, he argued that the rules had overstepped their mandate from Congress. Instead, he advocated more flexible regulation based on existing practices and allowing for greater choice for dealer and brokers. “It would promote healthy global markets by regulating swaps trading in a manner well matched to the underlying market dynamics,” he argued.Putting significant policy rulings into footnotes makes them easier to change, lawyers say.However, the changes may have other effects, particularly for global efforts to harmonise financial regulations to similar standards. The European Commission says it is too early to tell what the priorities will be and is continuing its daily contacts with counterparts in the US.“We very much hope that the future US administration will work with the EU to help consolidate the G20 financial reform agenda,” a spokesperson said.
89;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-11-11T04:19:31Z;CME Group chief to quit three years before contract ends;News of Phupinder Gill’s impending departure surprises investors and analysts;The chief executive of CME Group, the dominant US futures exchange, has resigned more than three years before the end of his contract.Phupinder Gill, 56, will retire from CME and its board at the end of the year, the company said in a statement late on Thursday. Terry Duffy, 58, executive chairman, has added the role of chief executive. The departure was announced just a year after Mr Gill renewed his employment contract to 2019. On Thursday his picture was missing from the leadership pages of the CME website. The news surprised investors and analysts. On Wednesday Chicago-based CME broke all-time volume records in contracts from interest rates to the Mexican peso as Donald Trump’s election as US president shook markets. Ahead of Mr Gill’s announcement, CME shares rose on Thursday to a near nine-year high of $117.05. “No one saw this coming,” said Ray Cahnman, a longtime CME shareholder and chairman of trading firm Transmarket Group. Known simply as “Gill”, he joined the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1988 and built its risk models for derivatives after the exchange got into severe difficulty during the crash of 1987. A workaholic, he is also known throughout the futures industry for mixing his knowledge with charm, wit and profanity.He was appointed chief executive of CME in 2012, replacing Craig Donohue. The exchange group at the time had been shaken by the failure of the futures broker MF Global, which CME was responsible for auditing. Transaction volume, the main source of exchange revenue, fell in 2012. Over the following years CME has rebounded, cut costs and improved profitability. It benefited from mandates for clearing derivatives laid out in the Dodd-Frank financial reform of 2010, a law the incoming Trump administration has said it will “dismantle”. CME exchanges have also been scrutinised for their level of oversight as regulators and prosecutors crack down on bad behaviour in futures markets. This week Navinder Singh Sarao, a London-based trader, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and “spoofing” CME stock index futures and agreed to co-operate with the US Department of Justice. Mr Duffy, a former hogs broker, has served as CME’s principal public face and advocate in Washington. Mr Gill had a more hands-on role. Bryan Durkin, CME chief commercial officer, has been named CME president. “Terry has been in charge of the political relationships with government in DC as well as strategy, whereas Gill has tilted more towards the operational side,” said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill. Mr Gill received $4.9m in total compensation in 2015, according to a securities filing. “It has been my greatest honour to have been a part of the transformation of CME Group,” he said in a statement. “I am extremely optimistic about the future of the company, due in large part to the unparalleled expertise of our talented employees across the world.” Mr Duffy said: “Going forward, our strategy remains unchanged.”CME Group declined to say why Mr Gill is retiring early.

That’s three times the average daily volume on the exchange. Gold was 1.7 per cent higher at $1296 per ounce, writes Gregory Meyer in New York.Treasury futures on the CME-owned Chicago Board of Trade also traded heavily, with 2.7m transactions in its 10-year note contracts, double the usual volume, as interest rates jumped.CME Group shares were up 3.6 per cent early in New York to $109.41 as the broader US stock market declined. Shares of Intercontinental Exchange, another futures bourse operator, were up 2.6 per cent to $56.02.John Lothian, who publishes a markets newsletter widely read in the exchange industry, wrote Wednesday: “The American voters just unleashed the greatest gift on the world of trading we could have ever asked for.

94;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-08-15T10:25:04Z;London Metal Exchange may need to look to China;Middle Kingdom may offer LME liquidity and volume as it adjusts to commercial operations;"If it’s been a tough time for commodity traders, it hasn’t been any easier for the exchanges on which they trade and hedge their exposures.The London Metal Exchange was bought in 2012 by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing for what seemed to many like an eye-watering sum of £1.4bn. Most of that went to its members, in direct proportion to the number of shares they held; the amounts received varied from around £30m-odd to approximately £100m for those who had the foresight to mop up the available shares as members quit the LME in prior years.These were big sums of money, particularly for the smaller brokers, but there was a price to pay.For more than a century the LME effectively operated as a members’ collective — any profits generated were redistributed to its members who then elected their own to the board. The board in turn ran the business in the twin interests of the industrial metal industry and, specifically, the member firms.That model disappeared after the sale to HKEx in 2012. The LME has become a commercial operation in its own right and one that needs to generate profits for its own shareholders as well as satisfy those previous members who are now its customers. That’s a big change in the relationship and the two sides have been feeling their way in the new world.Tensions between the LME and the market first erupted over warehousing and the appearance of large queues of metal waiting to leave storage — which led to the LME aluminium price falling badly out of sync with the prevailing physical market. This matters because globally accepted reference prices are the jewel in the LME’s crown. Sensing an opportunity, New York’s CME Group launched its own physical premium contracts to try and capitalise on the uncertainty.The LME since followed suit but tinkering around the edges of the tried and tested contract formula with regional premiums is highly unlikely to succeed.The LME’s reforms to the warehouse system appear to be bringing the problem under control. But again there has been a price to pay. More and more of the warehoused metal is being is shifted to (cheaper) private non-LME storage where it is more difficult to track.The other issue to feature prominently, and one which goes to the heart of the relationship between broker/members and the LME, is fees. The deal struck in 2012 was a cash lump sum for members in exchange for an increase in the cost of doing business in the future, as the LME’s new owners looked to make a return for its shareholders. That was pretty clear to everyone, so it was hardly a surprise when the LME jacked up the trading fees at the end of the moratorium period.Yet there was still much wailing and gnashing of teeth as well as criticism that the LME was becoming too expensive a venue to trade. Out there in the shadows are (at least) two groups investigating the prospect of setting up a competitor exchange — taking inspiration from the fragmentation of the US equity market, where these days you are just as likely to find liquidity in a black box in the corner of a warehouse in New Jersey as you are on the New York Stock Exchange.The LME has cut some of the fees, particularly in short-dated trades — essential to its particular date-trading system — and that has quieted some of the dissatisfaction. Will it be enough? That is difficult to say but one thing looks certain — there will be competition. Indeed a purely physical rival has recently announced itself ready to launch in September.The next challenge for the LME will be to find more liquidity and volume and for that it will probably have to look to the speculative world of its parent’s homeland. That may upset some traditionalists; but then, we all have a time of our lives that we see as the ideal and look at with rose-tinted spectacles.

The Federal Reserve’s regional banks will be permitted to accept customer funds from big derivatives clearinghouses operated by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Monday. The commission’s order exempted the Fed from liability under federal law, writes Gregory Meyer in New York.Derivatives customers post margin collateral to back trading positions at clearinghouses, which act as the buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer. But Lehman Brothers’ collapse in 2008, followed by the implosion of futures brokers MF Global and Peregrine Financial Group, shook confidence in the security of customer funds.Clearinghouses had previously received approval to place their own “house” cash with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, but until now customer money has been held at commercial banks or in US Treasury bonds.Timothy Massad, CFTC chairman, said:We hope that with today’s action, accounts for customer funds can be opened soon. Doing so will help protect customer funds and enhance the resiliency of clearinghouses.Sharon Bowen, a CFTC commissioner, said:I have long believed that, in order to protect customer funds, we need to keep that money at our central bank. In the event of a major market event, I, and I believe the rest of the American people, would feel much better knowing that investors’ money is at the Federal Reserve instead of at multiple central counterparties."

The ruse, known as spoofing, was outlawed by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act.Exchanges, regulators and prosecutors have sharpened their focus on spoofing in recent years amid frustration over erratic behaviour in increasingly automated markets.In a separate case on Tuesday, a judge rejected an attempt by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to shut down Igor Oystacher, a well-known Chicago trader facing civil charges of spoofing. In another case, London-based trader Navinder Singh Sarao is fighting extradition to the US after he was criminally charged with spoofing in stock index futures.Coscia, of New Jersey-based Panther Energy Trading, had already settled civil spoofing charges with the CFTC and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority in 2013, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, when he was indicted in 2014.His conviction by a Chicago federal jury raised the stakes in the spoofing fight.“Traders contemplating sophisticated scams will think twice if they know that there are more significant consequences than a civil lawsuit or a regulatory action,” Sunil Harjani, an assistant US attorney, argued as he recommended prison time for Coscia.“Hedge funds and proprietary trading firms will closely review their trades, and strike down get-rich-quick manipulation trading schemes because the cost is not worth the benefit.”Coscia’s lawyer, Stephen Senderowitz, said his client planned to appeal against the conviction and would seek permission to remain free on bond until the appeal was adjudicated.Traders contemplating sophisticated scams will think twice if they know that there are more significant consequences than a civil lawsuit or a regulatory action.“The sentence imposed was less than half of what the government requested,” Mr Senderowitz said. “Also, the government conceded at the sentencing hearing that it could not calculate a specific loss suffered by alleged victims and that some may have made money.”Prosecutors said Coscia spoofed gold, soyabean oil and currency futures markets on exchanges run by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, pocketing $1.4m in ill-gotten profits in 2011. They said he designed two different computer programs to carry out his scheme.Dan Waldman, head of the derivatives law practice at Arnold & Porter, called three years “a pretty substantial sentence” compared with past criminal market manipulation cases. “That’s a pretty strong message.”The sentence came down one day after another Chicago court turned down the CFTC’s attempt to bar Mr Oystacher from futures markets. The CFTC filed civil spoofing charges against him and his company, 3Red Trading of Chicago, in 2015. He has not been criminally charged.Judge Amy St Eve wrote that 3Red’s self-imposed compliance tools, along with additional court-ordered restrictions, rendered an injunction unnecessary before the case goes to trial.
97;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-07-13T07:33:53Z;Oil traders’ love affair with Yahoo Messenger nears end;Alternatives sought to replace dominant instant messenger service;An unsettled oil market is grappling with a new challenge: the retreat of Yahoo’s smiley-faced instant message service.Yahoo Messenger has long been oil traders’ favourite tool for blasting out orders and gossip. But Yahoo on August 5 will change the service in ways that inhibit monitoring chats as required by financial rules. Other message platforms are now wooing traders searching for compliant alternatives.“It’s a land grab,” said Morgan Downey, a former oil trader who is chief executive of Money.net, a financial information company. “Chat is like oxygen flowing through Wall Street. If you are able to capture that information flow, it’s very difficult to undo.”The financial world uses a hodge­podge of messaging tools such as Instant Bloomberg and the bank-backed Symphony. Yahoo Messenger, with its jangling chimes and grinning emoticons, debuted in 1998 and quickly caught on with oil traders.The redesigned version will allow users to “unsend” messages, which troubles energy compliance officers. The London Energy Brokers’ Association said the new Messenger “encrypts all communications such that firms are unable to record this media in a straightforward manner”, adding that its members were “reviewing specialised third party solutions”.Companies waiting in the wings include Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of London’s oil futures bourse. ICE said users on its instant messaging platform have increased 30 per cent this year to more than 11,000. The oil trading division of Glencore, the Swiss-based commodities company, recently selected the service, ICE said.CME Group, which also runs an oil exchange, and Thomson Reuters plan to announce they have agreed to connect their two messaging networks to allow traders on each to communicate with one another, the companies said. They identified a “surge” in new messaging account registrations in June as traders prepared for Yahoo’s switch.ICIS, a market research group, surveyed 58 energy trading companies and found they leaned towards the ICE platform for oil and Thomson Reuters’ Eikon Messenger in European power and gas.But as August 5 approaches, which service wins is an open question.Yahoo links banks, brokers, producers, consumers and others in the oil market. Victoria Attwood Scott, global head of compliance at Swiss-based energy trader Mercuria, said: “At the moment it’s not clear what is going to be the best system to enable communication with all those different parties. Anything we use needs to be surveillable and recordable.”Yahoo is neutral on the structure of oil markets. The California-based company — which is exploring a sale of its core business as part of a separation from its $29bn stake in Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba — said oil traders constituted “a small fraction” of Messenger’s users.ICE and CME derive hundreds of millions dollars of revenue from their oil markets. While their message services allow unfettered negotiations, each eases the execution of orders on its own exchange. For example, CME’s Pivot message system has a feature called parsing, which for certain markets allows users to click on a message to fill in a CME trade ticket.Yahoo may yet survive in the oil market. GreenKey, a technology company, has developed a computer “skin” that wraps around Yahoo and other message platforms and removes the ability to delete messages.Paul Christensen, GreenKey chief executive, said: “What everybody wants is a platform that is open, neutral and compliant. That would be nirvana, but it doesn’t exist.”

The deal must also pass antitrust scrutiny in Brussels, the UK and the US.In spite of the UK’s “leave” decision, both companies are pressing ahead with the deal. The referendum “does not impact the compelling strategic rationale of the merger,” the companies said in the aftermath of the vote.Owing to the structure of the deal and local regulations, Deutsche Börse will not hold a shareholder meeting but will make a tender offer for shareholders that closes on July 12.
99;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-06-24T12:47:07Z;Trading in sterling futures hits record high – CME;;"Trading volume in British pound futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange broke records early Friday in the aftermath of the UK’s vote to leave the EU.
By 7:10am Chicago time, CME contracts tracking sterling’s value against the dollar had changed hands more than 400,000 times, blowing past a previous volume record from 2014 as the pound fell to a 30-year low, reports Gregory Meyer in New York.Kenneth B. Worthington, an analyst at JPMorgan said:CME activity is poised to reach record trading levels today, as investors hedge equity, interest rate, FX and energy risks. So far this morning, CME has executed 14mn contracts, which puts trading at ~4.5x normal levels. We see the potential for today to be a 50mn contract day, its highest ever. Given we expect volatility will remain elevated near term, CME should benefit from higher activity levels and elevated earnings.CME earlier in the week took what it called “emergency action” by adjusting maximum price bands for currency and interest rate contracts in anticipation of big swings.Investors in the exchange’s parent company, CME Group, seemed pleased with the volatility. In pre-market trading, they pushed its shares up 0.8 per cent even as CME’s S&P 500 stock index futures declined 3.5 per cent."
100;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-06-24T00:21:44Z;Yen, bonds and gold: Havens rally as doubts over Brexit outcome grow;;The Japanese yen, Treasury bonds and gold, used by investors as shelters during times of tumult, were all rallying as results from the UK’s EU referendum painted a mixed picture about the outcome.Private polling initially suggested the Remain camp had a modest lead. But as regional results have trickled out, that premise has been thrown into doubt, writes Adam Samson. The news caused intense volatility in many parts of the financial market. Indeed, the UK pound sustained its steepest intraday fall since 2008, according to Bloomberg data.The ructions sent investors scurrying for safety. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the bond’s price, skidded to 1.68 per cent, after closing the previous session at 1.746 per cent.“This is just an appetizer,” said Giovanni Pillitteri, global head of foreign exchange trading at GTS, an electronic market maker. “If the vote remains so split, [the pound] is going to be even more volatile.”The dollar fell against the yen by 1.1 per cent to 104.99 in tumultuous Asian trading. Gold prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9 per cent to $1,268.40 a troy ounce, shedding gains from earlier in the day.Market strategists expected volatility heading into Thursday evening as many groups, ranging from UBS to the CME Group, issued notes to clients indicating trading could be affected by large swings.Nicole Bullock contributed reporting from New York.
101;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-06-23T14:33:36Z;CME tweaks price-change limits on Brexit volatility;;Futures exchange CME Group has taken “emergency action” as the UK casts votes in its historic EU referendum.In a notice late Wednesday, Chicago-based CME said it had raised special price fluctuation limits in currency futures and benchmark interest rate futures, writes Gregory Meyer in New York.Fluctuation limits serve as circuit breakers in futures markets, temporarily locking trading after extreme price moves. Limits for dollar-sterling futures normally range from 400 ticks to 1,600 ticks, in escalating progression.The emergency action, in place to Friday, will double limits for currency contracts, bringing the range for the pound from 800 ticks to 3,200 ticks.“The exchanges determined that there is a strong likelihood that the ‘Brexit’ vote may result in increased price volatility in CME FX and CME and CBOT Interest Rate futures products,” CME said in a notice to traders. “The emergency action is being taken as a precautionary measure and is intended to ensure fair and orderly trading in all these products”.As CME was taking emergency action, it was also using the Brexit vote as a marketing opportunity. In an email blast sent out early Thursday London time, the exchange operator touted its contracts.“As markets remain uncertain and volatility builds, trade British pound futures and options on the largest regulated FX market in the world and mitigate your currency risk,” the email said.Early Thursday in Chicago, CME’s September pound-dollar futures were up 0.9 per cent, while September euro-pound futures were down 0.3 per cent.Separately, Intercontinental Exchange’s London-based futures exchange said it was amending “reasonability limits” for sterling and gilt, Euribor and Libor interest rate futures on Friday.“These changes are in light of potential increased volatility as a result of the EU Referendum to be held in the UK on Thursday 23 June 2016,” ICE said in a circular.
102;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-06-07T15:51:55Z;Deutsche Börse chief says LSE merger would be good for rivals;German group’s chief says planned $30bn tie-up meets market ‘obligation’ for Europe;Deutsche Börse’s planned $30bn merger with the London Stock Exchange Group meets an “obligation” by Europe to help develop global markets for trading, the German group’s chief executive has argued.Carsten Kengeter, the former UBS banker who became head of Europe’s largest exchanges operator a year ago, said that the tie-up would help rivals such as CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange to grow, just as much as it would be a threat.The LSE deal could create a European derivatives trading and risk management powerhouse whose market capitalisation would match its US rivals, and that of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.Both parties are to put the deal before shareholders next month although it also needs regulatory approval from Brussels.A British vote to leave the European Union later this month could also undermine the agreement, which envisages locating the holding company in London. It is expected to close by the first quarter next year.Europe has some catching up to do, Mr Kengeter said at the annual IDX derivatives industry conference in London on Tuesday.He said that the region’s markets were more fragmented than rivals in the US and Asia, and Europe had an “obligation” to develop markets in the interests of these other continents.“Market participants across the financial industry . . . have always benefited when global market development has been thrown forward by individual market segments that have been fragmented, then achieve a certain harmonisation,” he said.He added that the deal was needed for Europe to compete with rivals. “If you look around the world, you have to notice US and Asian exchanges have grown significantly over the past few years. The bulk of European exchanges have not been able to keep up.”On a panel featuring the heads of some of the world’s largest exchanges operators, Phupinder Gill, chief executive of CME Group, agreed that the LSE-Deutsche Börse deal “had the potential to be quite exciting”.The Chicago exchange, the world’s largest futures operator, has also been linked with a bid for the German group. “But Carsten refuses to take my calls till the deal is done,” he joked.However, Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, which considered making a counterbid for the LSE before withdrawing, cautioned that “who knows what the outcome [of the bid] will be”. Others are closely watching the proposed merger’s passage through shareholder meetings and antitrust approval, particularly if the LSE and Deutsche Börse have to shed assets to meet competition rules.“There are assets we think are pretty interesting,” said Hans-Ole Jochumsen, president of global trading and market services at Nasdaq.
103;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-05-18T18:56:19Z;Futures market pins 1-in-4 chance of June rate rise;;The odds that the futures market pegs of a Federal Reserve rate rise in June doubled to more than 25 per cent on Wednesday after a round of hawkish minutes from the central bank’s April meeting.Federal funds futures implied a probability of 28 per cent that the Fed will increase interest rates in June, up from just 12 per cent on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg calculations based on CME Group data. Moreover, futures pointed to odds of 75 per cent that the central bank increases rates at least once this year, up from two-in-three on Tuesday.Minutes from the Fed’s April meeting provided the latest bit of evidence to suggest policymakers are seriously considering a June rate rise as inflation ticks higher and the labour market remains strong. Central bankers, however, remain concerned about the influence developments abroad may have on the domestic economy.Still, the more hawkish tone points to increased confidence among Fed officials that the economy will strengthen after growth slowed dramatically in the first three months of the year.The performance in other financial markets also showed the changing winds on Wall Street: The 10-year US Treasury yield rose the most since December 2015 as traders sold the bonds, while the shares of US banks that are seen as beneficiaries of higher rates rallied sharply.
104;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-05-10T18:53:30Z;Goldman trims US Treasury yield outlook;;Goldman Sachs has reduced its forecast for 10-year US Treasury bond yields over the next few years as it responds to dimmer expectations for Federal Reserve rate rises.The New York investment bank said it sees the yield on the 10 year paper ending 2016 at 2.4 per cent, and ending 2017 at 2.75 per cent, down from its previous guidance of 2.75 per cent and 3.3 per cent, respectively. It does not see the yield ending a year above 3 per cent until 2018.The benchmark 10-year note yielded 1.75 per cent on Tuesday, down sharply from 2.27 per cent at the end of 2015.Many strategists expected yields, which move in the opposite direction of price, to rise this year after the Federal Reserve increased interest rates in December for the first time since 2006. However, expectations of further rate rises have not borne fruit as turmoil in the global financial markets early in the year, coupled with sluggish growth in many developed economies around the world, prompted the Fed to rethink its plans to increase rates.Indeed, Goldman last week revised its expectation for the next rate increase to September from June, after a report showed US job growth cooled substantially last month. Futures markets handicap the odds of no rate increase at all this year at 52.1 per cent, according to CME Group data.Goldman noted, however, that Treasuries are over-priced at current levels, and yields are “unlikely to be sustained unless the macro outlook deteriorates materially”.
105;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-04-28T17:50:49Z;Derivatives houses to open accounts with Federal Reserve;Brokers will be able to park margin money at the US central bank;Derivatives brokers choosing where to park their margin money will now have the option of the world’s most powerful central bank.The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has authorised three of the US’s largest clearing houses, run by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, and the Options Clearing Corporation, to open an account at the central bank. ICE’s permit is for its US credit derivatives clearing house.The change at the CME applies only to house cash belonging to brokers, its executives said on a conference call on Thursday. Margin posted by their customers will continue to be walled off and held by commercial banks or in US Treasury bonds, they confirmed. The switch has been made possible by clearing houses’ designation as systemically-important utilities, which recognised the dangers to the financial system if they failed and gave them access to the Fed’s cash in an emergency. Tougher regulation of markets means they must now handle billions of dollars of futures and swaps trades every day. Traders who use derivatives must safeguard their deals against defaults with margin and collateral. For clearing brokers whose business has been damaged by years of low interest rates, keeping cash at the Fed could yield better returns. New market rules also authorised a regional Fed bank to maintain an account for designated clearing houses and pay earnings on any balance, as it already does for US banks subject to Fed oversight. “When effective, we expect to pass a higher rate to clearing members for their house positions than we do today,” John Pietrowicz, CME’s chief financial officer, told analysts on CME’s earnings call. Mr Pietrowicz said the accounts would open in the “next month or so”. While the majority of the returns would be passed back to clearing members, CME would also be able to “earn more” as cash balances increased. CME applied for access to a Fed account in 2014, a spokeswoman said, and would direct funds into an omnibus account for collateral and settlement services. The derivatives industry and its regulator have argued in recent years that tougher banking laws have hurt the brokerage business by making clearing uneconomical. “The resulting industry consolidation would increase systemic risk by concentrating derivatives clearing activities in fewer clearing member banks,” Walt Lukken, chief executive of the FIA industry association, testified to a US House agriculture subcommittee on Thursday. Mr Pietrowicz said 20 per cent of the $138bn held as collateral, or roughly $28bn, was related to house accounts. Kim Taylor, CME’s president of global operations, technology and risk, said the amount of broker house positions held in cash was $3bn. The details came as the CME reported record revenue of $934.2m in the first quarter, up 11 per cent from a year before, as it harvested bumper trading volumes and fees for market data. The company’s net profit was $368m, or $1.09 a share, up 11 per cent from $330.4m, or $0.98 a share a year earlier. The CME also pointed to growing amounts of business from outside the US being transacted on its markets. A quarter of volume in the period came from outside America while volume during European hours, between 11pm and 7am US central time, rose 60 per cent.
106;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-04-28T12:18:47Z;CME grabs record revenues from bumper trading volumes;;Record revenue poured into CME Group as the world’s biggest futures exchange harvested bumper trading volumes and fees for market data.Chicago-based CME, which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and affiliated bourses, had $934.2m in revenue in the first quarter, up 11 per cent from a year before. The figure missed Wall Street expectations of $943m.The company’s net profit was $368m, or $1.09 per share, up 11 per cent from $330.4m, or $0.98 per share a year earlier, writes Gregory Meyer in New York.Adjusted for factors including cash held in British pounds, net income would have been $1.15 per share, CME said. That matched the analyst consensus.The boost in revenues came as average volumes on CME’s exchanges reached 16.9m daily contracts in the quarter, up 13 per cent from the same quarter a year before. Trading activity has increased in commodities markets including CME’s West Texas Intermediate crude oil contract.Volumes in options on futures, once largely confined to exchange floors, have also soared as more trading migrates to computers. Earlier this month CME said it would close down its New York trading floor, essentially leaving all energy and metals options to the electronic platforms and voice brokers.CME’s market data fees increased 5 per cent in the quarter to $102m, in line with executives’ prior guidance. On its earnings call in February, CME said it planned to double data fees for customers who previously had waivers to $85 per month per screen.With pay and some other expense lines declining, CME fattened its operating profit margin to 61.3 per cent, up 1.2 percentage point from a year before.
107;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-04-22T11:22:52Z;Quick View: Bats follows exchange playbook with data push;US’s newest listed stock market looks like copying rivals as it maps out long-term growth plans;Bats Global Markets has banished memories of its ill-fated IPO four years ago. Now investors have to weigh up what the investment case is.Early share price moves have put Bats on a forward price/earnings ratio of about 18 times, according to Bloomberg data. Compared with other listed US exchanges, it is on a chunkier valuation than Nasdaq (17 times) but marginally lower than CBOE (18x), Intercontinental Exchange (19x) and CME Group (24x).Bats has changed considerably since 2012. Positions in both US and European equities trading have been consolidated — the former by merging with Direct Edge in 2013, the latter by launching over-the-counter trade reporting.Chris Concannon, chief executive, has moved into new markets, namely US equity options, exchange-traded products and foreign exchange trading. The latter was via a $365m purchase of Hotspot from KCG, which has pushed out debt to $937m, although $687.5m is long-term debt, and it will pay dividends.These markets are likely to provide the growth. Bats’ 20 per cent share of the US equity market is its highest ever and is likely to face new competition from a regulated IEX Group, and renewed attacks from Nasdaq and NYSE. European equities only account for less than a fifth of earnings, and trading volumes on the continent have been dire this year.That creates a potential weak point. Net transaction fees were 44.6 per cent of Bats’ revenues — less cost of revenues — in the year to December 31. And it noted turnover “may be reduced due to declines in our market share, trading volumes or regulatory changes”. Furthermore, nearly half of its total transaction fees were generated by affiliates of its principal investors, some of whom are selling down.Bats’ answer is to follow the exchange playbook and move into new markets or more stable and lucrative revenue streams.Mr Concannon calls the changes in the FX market a “once-in-a-career structural change” as banks withdraw from some aspects of trading. Bats estimates that even if banks give away just 5 per cent of their business, that would unlock close to $100bn of FX daily turnover that electronic venues could fight over. FX swaps and forwards are also on the agenda. Here Bats faces a battle with other venues like CME, EBS and Thomson Reuters.Subscription to market data and access/connectivity was 55 per cent of net revenues last year and has had compound average growth rates of 30 per cent in the last five years. Nasdaq made $282m market data, Bats just $21m. Tellingly, Mr Concannon said: “We will continue to monetise this position and close this sizeable gap.”Further pushes into ETFs, where Bats has a third of the market in the US, is also possible. NYSE Arca is the market leader. Soberingly, Mr Concannon predicts there are likely to be more ETF listings than corporate ones this year. Bats’ play here is to pay issuers to list on its market, hoping it will be a thrust at the heart of NYSE’s model.Making Bats the home for the main symbol would give it the lion’s share of trading fees. It may well also begin calculating its own intraday net asset values for its exchange-traded listings. At present it relies mainly on NYSE Arca, whose parent ICE has just strengthened its market position with the $5.2bn purchase of Interactive Data Corp.But that will probably take several years as customers get used to/complain about annual data fee increases. In the meantime Bats appears to be following the path led by Bob Greifeld and Nasdaq, the former colleagues that Mr Concannon likes to gently rib in public.Nasdaq’s share price has comfortably outperformed all of its rivals and the S&P 500 in the past 12 months. But Nasdaq is distinguished by its technology division, which provides corporate solutions and market technology and accounts for 27 per cent of revenues. That makes it more truly insulated from the vagaries of market volumes to which Bats is exposed. Bats is on its way but not there yet.
108;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-04-19T11:31:22Z;Treasury futures fly high as bond market fragments;Sustaining the success of a new ‘Ultra’ Treasury future will depend on the buy in of asset managers;A new futures contract at CME Group that tracks the world’s primary government bond benchmark has flourished since its launch in January as investors adjust to a world of low interest rates and heftier capital costs for holding bonds.The new contract from the CME Group, the world’s largest futures market, has “gone like a bat out of hell”, according to a senior executive.The “10-year Ultra Treasury note” contract tracks the US government security used as a benchmark all over the world, and has traded more than 1m contracts in the first seven weeks of life.The success of the contract — already the fastest-growing product in the CME’s 148-year history — reflects a growing shift in the structure of the US interest rate market, between cash and futures products, in the wake of post-financial crisis regulation. The long standing 10-year Treasury futures listed contract at the CME remains very popular, indicating that the market is not simply switching to the Ultra.After a strong debut, the ultimate success of the contract will rest on broader market participation from asset managers, who tend to wait and see before committing to a new product.“As liquidity grows there will be more pull to switch to the ultra 10-year,” says James Ong, a derivatives strategist at Invesco Fixed Income. ‘’We would like to see liquidity grow. As it does I think we will be using it more frequently.”The Ultra contract fills an important gap for investors and traders who transact in Treasury futures. Such derivative trades are often closed out near the expiry of the contract, by finding an old cash Treasury security and delivering that to the other party in the transaction. The Ultra contract provides greater flexibility in settling futures trades in the current climate of low interest rates.The crucial element of trading, however is cost, particularly in the wake of post-financial regulation as the effects of banking and markets reforms resonate for investors.As banks face higher capital charges for trading over-the-counter derivatives, the use of futures offers a cheaper alternative, according to a recent report by Greenwich Associates, a capital markets consultancy. Using futures also appeals greatly to high-frequency traders, who have become bigger players in the US bond market in recent years.“Financing is a really, really important part of the ecosystem that has been a little bit overlooked and that is where we will almost certainly see innovation. It’s where many investors are substantially more focused,” says Paul Hamill, global head of fixed income, currencies and commodities at Citadel Securities.That concern is being exacerbated by a breakdown in the fundamental industry tool: market activity that links Treasury bonds and OTC derivatives, notably interest rate swaps.The vast US fixed income market has long supported a variety of ways for buying and selling interest rate exposure, via OTC and listed derivatives and cash Treasurys. A crucial area of trading and one that is often overlooked, is how positions have long been funded via the repurchase or repo market. New rules on capital ratios make it more expensive for banks to undertake such activity. The US repo market is 40 per cent smaller than it was at the height of the financial crisis.That has triggered a dislocation between government bonds and swaps, with Treasury yields being quoted above swap rates, a negative relationship that upends financial theory. Under normal market conditions this would be swiftly reversed but it has been entrenched for nearly six months, indicating how higher capital costs are reinforcing dislocations.“Total cost analysis is going to become very, very complex. The question of how they’re best going to use their margin will determine which trade they do. The tail may start to wag the dog, so to speak,” says Mike du Plessis, global head of execution services at UBS.Some people envisage a shift away from using swaps for hedging in certain circumstances, or a move to using futures like the CME Ultra, rather than just cash Treasuries.RJ O’Brien argues that this situation may continue for several years. The futures broker believes the answer lies in using futures like the Ultra, which can be cleared at the CME and offset against other Treasury futures. Others, however highlight how swaps can be customised for specific rate exposure, whereas futures are a blunter tool.David Clark, chairman of the Wholesale Markets’ Brokers Association, a trade body, says the repo market problem is too short-term focused to affect swaps trading. “But it’s much more important down the curve. Increasing capital costs aren’t going to get magicked away.”ClarusFT, an OTC swaps data provider, says the acceptance of the Ultra contract has coincided with an increase in swaps trading.“You’ll have futures and OTC markets working symbiotically, as they always were,” says Mr Clark.

110;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-04-13T19:25:55Z;Mercuria cuts out the futures middleman;Energy trader becomes a clearing member as new capital requirements bite;Mercuria, a leading energy trading house, is cutting ties to the middlemen of futures markets as they raise costs in response to tougher regulation.The Swiss-based company, active in markets from oil to power, has become a member of the European clearing house run by Intercontinental Exchange and plans to join the clearing house of CME Group, executives said. In doing so, it will no longer use outside clearing brokers.Clearing houses act as a buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer in derivatives markets, spreading the risk of a trader default among its members. Most members are clearing brokers, which collect good-faith margin deposits from traders.But Mercuria executives said new European capital requirements were set to make more expensive to clear trades through third-party clearing brokers. Instead, it chose to become a clearing member itself.Guillaume Vermersch, Mercuria’s chief financial officer, told the FT Commodities Global Summit on Wednesday that the company would move all of its futures and over-the-counter derivatives positions “in-house”.The move is a sign of the upheaval across derivatives markets as regulators impose changes in response to the financial crisis. Banks, which own the biggest clearing brokers, face new capital requirements and are passing some of the costs on to customers.Low interest rates have also depressed what clearing brokers can earn on customer collateral, forcing them to find other sources of revenue. In the US, the number of registered clearing firms has plummeted in recent years.Mercuria will only handle its own trades and does not plan to offer clearing services to customers. As a member, the company must contribute to clearing houses’ guarantee funds.Victoria Attwood Scott, Mercuria’s global head of compliance, said: “We have the expertise. We looked at self-clearing, and over time it will create efficiencies and save on costs after the initial investment.”Mercuria is not the only non-broker to be a clearing member. ICE Clear Europe’s membership includes companies as diverse as Mars Chocolate and Jump Trading, a Chicago-based proprietary trading firm, as well as bank-owned brokers such as Goldman Sachs and Société Générale.Glencore, the commodities trading house, last month resigned its membership at ICE Clear Europe, according to a regulatory notice. A reason wasn’t given.Derek Sammann, global head of commodities and options products at CME, said: “As commodity trading firms look at their rising cost of capital, we are looking at a form of access model that preserves the agency of the [clearing firm] but provides capital efficiencies to the firms as well.”http://www.ft.com/intl/indepth/ft-commodities-summit

Based on CME’s closing share price, the sale netted Bovespa about $1.3bn.The two parties have been talking for six months but disagreed on price. Local media in São Paulo has reported a deal between Bovespa and Cetip, the country’s largest fixed income clearing house, is imminent, with Bovespa offering R41 per share for its rival.A combination would create a company worth R$40bn ($10.9bn) and consolidate Bovespa’s position as Latin America’s largest exchanges operator. It would also provide a windfall for Intercontinental Exchange, the US derivatives exchange, which owns a 12.5 per cent stake in Cetip.The CME stake sale also brings to an end a near decade-long cross shareholding agreement between the two exchanges. Following the disposal Edemir Pinto, chief executive of Bovespa, resigned from his position on the CME board, although the two exchanges will continue to work together on technology and developing and cross-listing products, the statement said. The CME will not reduce its stake in Bovespa.The move would extend Bovespa’s strategy of increasing its influence across the continent. It is seeking to acquire large enough stakes in the national exchanges of Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru and Argentina to ensure a seat on the board of each one.On Wednesday it bought a 4.1 per cent stake in Bolsa Mexicana de Valores for 640 million Mexican pesos (R$136m).
112;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-04-07T23:03:34Z;Dimmer rate rise view pressures US bank shares;;Cash poured out of bank stocks on Thursday as investors dialed back expectations for interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year.With a 1.9 per drop, financial company shares were the worst performers in the S&P 500, which itself lost 1.2 per cent, writes Nicole Bullock in New York.“The expectations over the last few days have really faded to they [the Fed] may not do anything at all in 2016,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade.As of Thursday, fed funds futures were reflecting expectations of the next rate rise not coming until January 2017, according to Bloomberg calculations based on CME Group data. Less than a month ago, futures showed more than a 50 per cent chance that the Fed would hike rates as early as June.A rise in interest rates increases the amount that banks can charge on loans versus what they pay customers for deposits.The spread between two and 10-year US Treasuries slid 2 basis points to 100 basis points on Thursday continuing a general flattening of the yield curve of late, another factor that squeezes banks’ margins.Among the large US banks, Citigroup took the biggest hit, shedding nearly 4 per cent. Market participants said it was also being punished for its large international business which exposes the bank to flagging global growth more than its peers.JPMorgan Chase stock fell 2.5 per cent, Wells Fargo was 2.4 per cent lower and Bank of America lost 3.2 per cent.The poor performance of bank stocks was a factor weighing on the stock market rally that took US shares back to black for the year after brutal selling in January and February. Year to date, the S&P 500 is down 0.1 per cent.“You really need the financials to be one of the top performing areas of the market in order for us to continue in a rally,” Mr Kinahan said.

Analysts expect S&P 500 profits to have remained lodged in a recession for the third-straight quarter, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Meanwhile, expectations for the next Federal Reserve rate raise have pulled back. Futures markets are currently predicting only one rate increase this year, according to CME Group calculations based on fed funds futures. That compares to the central bank’s own forecast in March of two quarter-point rate increases.
114;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-04-05T15:10:10Z;Two traders fined over gold spoofing;;A US financial regulator has slapped two more traders with fines in a widening crackdown on “spoofing,” a form of market trickery.The traders, Heet Khara and Nasim Salim of the United Arab Emirates, were each ordered to pay more than $1.3m in civil penalties to settle charges that they spoofed New York gold and and silver futures markets, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.Spoofing – rapidly placing and cancelling orders to mislead others into buying higher or selling lower than actual market prices – was made illegal by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. The rise of spoofing reflects the speed, anonymity and geographic reach of electronic markets, reports Gregory Meyer in New York.A court order said Mr Khara and Mr Salim spoofed markets between February and April 2015. Both alone and together, they placed large orders for gold and silver opposite smaller orders, then cancelled the larger orders once the smaller ones were executed. They traded through an broker called Zonyx DMCC, owned by Mr Salim.The commission brought civil charges against Mr Khara and Mr Salim in May 2015.They had previously been suspended by CME Group, which lists gold and silver futures on its Comex futures exchange.The court order listed Dubai addresses for both traders. Aitan Goelman, CFTC’s enforcement director, said: “The CFTC will protect the U.S. futures markets regardless of where those who engage in illegal spoofing practices are located. Spoofing undermines public confidence in our markets, and the CFTC will continue to aggressively pursue wrongdoers.”The CFTC is also pursuing spoofing cases against Chicago-based 3Red Trading and its co-founder, Igor Oystacher, as well as UK-based trader Navinder Singh Sarao.The order, signed last week, also permanently bars Mr Khara and Salim from futures markets. A lawyer for the two traders could not be reached for comment.
115;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-04-01T14:40:27Z;Fed ’16 rate rise odds climb after upbeat US data;;Futures traders are more confident that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least one time this year after upbeat data was released on the US labour market and factory sector.The odds of at least one rate increase in 2016 climbed 10 percentage points on Friday from Thursday to 65.4 per cent, according to a CME Group calculation based on movements in fed funds futures.Futures still peg one rate increase as the most likely option, but the two-rise category saw the sharpest increase.The move comes just days after Fed chief Janet Yellen reinforced her cautious stance on rate increases, after the central bank earlier in March issued a more dovish policy statement than many economists forecast.A jobs report that showed the US economy continued adding jobs at a swift clip last month, while wages and labour force participation increased, helped bolster investor optimism. As did data released later in the morning that indicated the US factory sector expanded for the first time since August 2015 as production and new orders increased.
116;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-03-29T13:38:15Z;LSE chief Xavier Rolet warns rivals must adapt as markets reshape;LSE/Deutsche Börse merger driven by need to change;The London Stock Exchange Group says its rivals have to adapt to rapidly changing global financial markets or face losing customers, and the shifting sands have driven its proposed $20bn all-share combination with Deutsche Börse.That reshaped market included greater demands from banks to ease the overall cost of their vast derivatives portfolios, and more benchmarks for passive investment funds, which trade irregularly.“The way we look at this is we’ve got to be pushing a little bit ahead of the rest of the industry,” says Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the LSE, who adds that his German partner had “figured out” it needed to change.“The real question is not so much how long it is going to take Deutsche Börse. What about the others, the rest of the industry who are refusing to change because they feel that currently in their regulatory environment they’re quite protected?”The two exchanges are seeking to convince sceptics among shareholders, local politicians and regulators to allow the creation of a London-based European trading, data, settlement and risk management behemoth. It would compete globally against US duo CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.The all-share deal terms, coupled with indications from ICE that it may make a counter-offer, has led analysts at Citigroup to describe the choice for shareholders as ‘jam today versus jam tomorrow.”For some shareholders it is a tricky choice since many are also users of exchange services. “When all is said and done, the industry needs to be structured for customers, not just shareholders,” says Rob Boardman, chief executive of ITG Europe, an agency broker.As Mr Rolet acknowledges, market infrastructure doesn’t work like other businesses. ”You offer your customer a significant economic benefit from centralisation. But the weakness is . . . you derive a sense of entitlement that ultimately customers have had to do and pay whatever you tell them to and when you get there, you lose your customers.”But he argues there is a way to generate long-term shareholder value and keep customers happy. That lies in the LSE’s policy of allowing rivals access to its clearing house, and to license its intellectual property, he says.That policy, known as “open access” runs like a faultline through the exchange and trading industry. Most of the world’s big exchanges, including CME Group, ICE, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing and Singapore’s SGX, confine trading in some widely-traded products to their venues only, a model known as a “vertical silo”.The LSE accepts rivals as customers and promises customers such as fund managers and banks more choice over what they trade and on which venues they trade it.Open access has not been a popular stance with other exchanges — Deutsche Börse and ICE argued that it could destabilise markets and inhibit innovation — but it has won backing in the City of London. Banks and asset managers in the UK capital lobbied hard and won the battle for mandatory open access to markets in forthcoming European regulations.It is more of a mix-and-match offer that new Deutsche Börse boss Carsten Kengeter and customers prefer, Mr Rolet argues. “I think this is very intuitive to young people who live in the age of internet. It's less intuitive to sometimes relatively hidebound exchange organisations that are steeped in the past and are used to their silos.”The LSE and Deutsche Börse also hope that policy will be the clinching argument for prudential and antitrust regulators in Brussels. In the background of the deal hangs the decision by EU competition authorities to block a tie-up of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse in 2012.Jean-Pierre Mustier, former head of corporate and investment banking at UniCredit, is among many concerned that connecting two of the world’s biggest clearing houses could create a risk to global markets if one fails. Mr Rolet says the risk is overplayed and the two utilities will not be fully combined. “The regulators would never countenance that sort of project.” Eurex instead will just become a customer.Bringing together the mostly over-the-counter franchise of LCH.Clearnet with Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing would allow customers to benefit from netting the margin they have to post to back their derivatives trades.The two exchanges hope to offer banks up to $7bn in relief from regulatory capital requirements by combining their clearing houses, which reduce counterparty credit risk.It will reduce the number of clearing houses in Europe processing interest rate swaps to just two, although the LSE says it will clear for any of its rivals.Mr Rolet says: “Open access is fundamentally pro-competition . . . which is why analysing this transaction in the sole context of the past is not illegitimate but it’s not sufficient, it doesn't give you the full picture.”But rivals have little desire to boost a competitor’ revenues, no matter how well-intentioned. “Futures exchanges are electing not to cross-margin at LCH this time, we believe due to competition for clearing and trading revenue,” says Rich Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill in New York. “We believe the [antitrust] question could come down to weighing the cross-margining benefits against an anti-competitive reduction in clearing assets.”Mr Rolet believes European regulation is on his side. “It’s the modern world,” he says.
117;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-03-21T12:14:21Z;Algo rules could catch commodities trades;Regulators’ efforts to tighten up on high-speed trading have wider reach;Olam is nobody’s idea of a high-frequency trading firm. The Singapore-based agricultural commodities merchant grows almonds, processes cocoa and deals bales of cotton.But Olam worries it may soon be classed alongside the world’s fastest market participants as the US government tightens controls on computerised trading. That is because it uses automated systems to trade futures. “Requiring a human interface in all instances in the 21st century trading environment is impractical,” Olam’s chief compliance counsel wrote to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week.Olam’s comment reveals the extent to which automated trading has spread beyond the high-speed trading firms of Chicago. More than 70 per cent of all futures trading is now automated, according to Tim Massad, CFTC chairman. So it was no surprise that letters came from far and wide ahead of last week’s deadline on Regulation Automated Trading, the CFTC’s plan to create a more defined risk and trading regime for all futures contracts traded using algorithms on US exchanges. Mr Massad’s goal of completing the rule this year will be tested by critics. Automated systems have occasionally set off earthquakes, as when an algorithm’s massive sales of S&P 500 stock index futures reverberated in stock markets during the “ flash crash” of May 2010. “There is a real risk that can happen when operational systems malfunction. It’s appropriate to have safeguards around those systems,” Sebastian Pujol Schott, associate director of the CFTC’s market oversight division, told last week’s annual meeting of FIA, the futures industry group. The proposed rule would impose new obligations on market participants. Automated traders would for the first time have to register with the commission if they trade directly on an exchange. CTC Trading Group, a Chicago-based proprietary trading firm, said most of the CFTC’s recommended risk controls had already been adopted by the industry and that exchanges, not the commission, should oversee traders. “It is the primary business of exchanges to stay abreast of state of the art technology, acquire a deep knowledge of the characteristics of market participants, and recognise and nimbly respond to new risks in the marketplace,” wrote Eric Chern, CTC chief executive. Likewise, the National Grain and Feed Association warned that grain merchants could wind up being required to register as automated traders, as some have invested in direct exchange access “simply to attempt to respond to the speed of today’s marketplace”. Exchanges and FIA raised questions about a CFTC provision which would require exchanges to have tools to prevent a firm from trading with itself. Such trading can be illegal if it is intentional. CME Group, the exchange group, said that the percentage of self-trades was less than 0.2 per cent of its total volume, while Intercontinental Exchange — which mandated self-trading blockers for proprietary traders since 2013 — said the proportion was even less. “These numbers clearly signify that the impermissible self-trading the proposal seeks to prevent is an inconsequential portion of the market,” CME said. The rule would also enable the CFTC to examine proprietary traders’ computer “source code” without a subpoena — a prospect that horrifies traders. Citadel, the Chicago hedge fund, compared code to a secret recipe. “Disclosure of a firm’s source code to other market participants would reveal not only the firm’s current investment portfolio, but also its expected future trading activity, exposing its most sensitive proprietary information and leaving it defenceless against the rest of the market,” it said in its letter. Chris Zuehlke of DRW Trading, a big Chicago trader, said source code was “how we make our money”. He warned an audience at the FIA meeting that Reg AT’s source code language as proposed “may not jibe with the fourth amendment”, the US constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. To overcome the issues, some are looking at examples from Europe, which has gone further than its US counterpart in crafting tighter rules for automated and high-speed trading.Many of the rules proposed by the CFTC are similar but there are nuanced differences. While both the US and EU also focus on testing and pre- and post-trade risk management, the US is unique in wanting traders to store their source code and make it available to regulators. Jaffray Woodriff, chief executive of Quantitative Investment Management, a commodity trading adviser with $2.2bn in assets under management, called for the US regulator to follow Europe’s approach in making a clear distinction between algorithms used for investment and those used in more automated trading. The former tend to be entered into trading systems by a human and present less systemic risk, he argued.
118;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-03-16T16:03:49Z;Fed’s March meeting is coming: key points;;After raising the central bank’s key interest rate in December, Federal Reserve officials are expected to leave it unchanged as they conclude a two-day meeting later on Wednesday.However, that doesn’t mean the meeting will be without interest. The Fed will release fresh forecasts and Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, will hold one of her four press conferences a year.The action starts at 2pm Washington time and here’s what to watch for.It’s all about the forecastsTurmoil in financial markets at the start of the year have probably left Ms Yellen and other members of the Fed’s policy-setting board too queasy to add to December’s rate rise, writes Adam Samson in New York. That means the upper bound of the Fed’s key rate will likely be left at 0.5 per cent.But economists, investors and traders will be keen to gauge policymakers’ views on the economy, and their expectations for future rate raises. Officials primarily provides its analysis through a statement, economic forecasts (including the ever-popular dot plots) and Ms Yellen’s press conference.The Fed’s last dot plot, released in December, projected that the central bank will add four rate rises this yearCurrently, interest-rate futures markets are pricing in a roughly 80 per cent chance that the Fed raises rates at least one time this year, according to Bloomberg calculations on CME Group data. The Fed’s guidance will “remain skewed toward tightening, albeit at a ‘gradual pace’”, James Sweeney, chief economist for the investment bank at Credit Suisse, reckons.Meanwhile, Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank, says officials are likely to feel less anxious given the rally in stock markets since the middle of February. He says ” the easing of financial conditions means the FOMC can credibly claim that risks to the outlook are ‘nearly balanced.’ However, the Fed will probably reiterate that it is closely monitoring global and financial developments.InflationWith the unemployment rate closing in on what many economists consider to be the “natural” level for the US ecoomy, and other measures of labour market slack tightening, inflation has emerged as the key wildcard.On one hand, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index ticked up to an annual rate of 1.7 per cent in January, a bigger pick-up than many economists forecast, and not far off the Fed’s target of two per cent.But inflation expectations are painting a more mixed picture. The 10-year breakeven rate, which is a measure of inflation expectations in the Treasury market, has bounced back to 1.5 per cent from as low as 1.2 per cent just a few weeks ago. That rise has offered some cheer, but the level still remains depressed.A February survey of consumers by the the New York Fed was more upbeat: The median one-year ahead inflation rate came in 2.7 per cent, up from 2.4 per cent the month prior.Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius says the Fed will probably increase its median core PCE inflation forecast for this year to 1.7 per cent from 1.6 per cent. That would be the first increase of 0.1 percentage point or more since 2012, according to Mr Hatzius.Still, Michael Feroli , JPMorgan’s chief US economist, says he expects the Fed to “retain a tone of caution about the inflation outlook, particularly as it relates to the state of inflation expectations”.Financial marketsThe Fed news will ricochet across global financial markets. These are a few key places to watch:

The world’s biggest futures exchange operator opened it in 2010 as the shouting on the floor was giving way to high-speed electronic trading.CME on Tuesday reached an agreement to sell its data centre for $130m to CyrusOne, a real estate investment trust.Chicago-based CME said it would lease back the space for 15 years and continue to run its electronic trading platform on the premises. It is the company’s third big sale and leaseback transaction, after raising about $200m from its New York Mercantile Exchange building in 2013 and $151.5m from the Chicago Board of Trade building in 2012.John Pietrowicz, CME chief financial officer, said: “This transaction allows us to enter into a long-term lease to meet our data centre needs while focusing our resources on what we do best — running our exchanges, providing global risk management and offering a broad range of technology services.”The data centre is a hub for “co-location”, in which exchanges rent computer cabinets near the matching engine to traders and brokers seeking to be fastest to market.This transaction allows us to enter into a long-term lease to meet our data centre needs while focusing our resources on what we do bestTwo per cent of CME’s revenues came from its co-location business in 2013 through 2015, according to its annual report. That would suggest co-location revenue of about $65m last year, based on $3.3bn in total revenue.CME closed its open-outcry futures pits in Chicago and New York last July. Electronic trading now makes up more than 80 per cent of its clearing and transaction fee revenue.The Aurora data centre contains 428,000 sq ft of floor space, security features such as biometric hand scanners and an electrical substation with enough power for 100,000 homes, according the CME website.As it leases the space, CME said will still be able to expand co-location services in Aurora.CyrusOne, of Texas, owns more than 30 data centres in the US, Europe and Asia.Gary Wojtaszek, CyrusOne chief executive, said: “With this facility, and with CME Group as our tenant, we are excited to have the opportunity to expand the global risk management campus in Chicago — the pre-eminent financial services co-location hub in the industry — which will be a cornerstone of our unique and rapidly growing data centre platform.”

Open interest in the $50 call option for December 2017 has risen more than sixfold to around 13,000 contracts since the beginning of the year.Another indication that producers have been selling contracts for later delivery is that spreads have narrowed. The price difference between WTI contracts for immediate delivery and December 2017 has shrunk to around $8.40 a barrel, from more than $12 a barrel in mid-February.The price recovery is also complicating efforts between major producing countries to agree to freeze production.While oil remains well below the $100 a barrel level it averaged between 2010 and 2014, the recent recovery has reduced the pressure on Opec and non-Opec countries to reach a quick deal.Plans to meet in Moscow on March 20 have reportedly been pushed back, as countries disagree over the location, date and how to include Iran, as sanctions targeting its exports were only lifted two months ago.Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, slipped 3 per cent to below $40 a barrel yesterday while WTI fell 2 per cent to $37.50 a barrel as traders took profits after the recent recovery.

Chicago’s CME Group has also been linked with bids for its two European rivals.The deal gives Nasdaq about 40 per cent of the market for US equities options where more than a dozen exchanges fight for business. ISE operates three equity options markets with a combined market share of 15 per cent. Nasdaq said bringing the two options businesses together will mean more competitive pricing in the industry.“The main concern here is that this is the options market and, at the end of the day, it has been very competitive,” said Ashley Serrao, market structure analyst at Credit Suisse. “Other competitors are on the horizon who may be entering the space and are we going to trigger a price war.”Rivals are competing over a shrinking pie. Options volume in 2015 totalled 4.14bn contracts, a 2.9 per cent decrease from 2014, even as volatility returned to the stock market, according to Tabb Group.Mr Serrao said these concerns were somewhat mitigated by the potential to exceed cost savings projected in the deal, which Nasdaq targets to be at least $40m on an annualised basis by the time the deal closes in 18 months.At midday in New York, Nasdaq shares were down about 1.5 per cent.The purchase is Nasdaq’s biggest acquisition since it bought Nordic stock market operator OMX for $3.7bn in 2007.Nasdaq said that it did not expect the deal to have a significant effect on its leverage, dividend or share buyback programmes, but some analysts were unconvinced.The deal will raise Nasdaq’s leverage to 3.1 times gross debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation, but the company has put a priority on reducing that to 2.3x to 2.7x.Nasdaq “has a strong history of deleveraging and we expect it to reach its target within a year of transaction closure, but until then we do not expect any meaningful shares repurchases”, said Peter Lenardos, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a note.The exchanges operator suspended share buybacks in 2013 when its leverage rose after acquisitions, but resumed them the following year.As part of the deal Nasdaq will double its stake in The Options Clearing Corporation, the world’s largest equity derivatives clearing corporation, to 40 per cent. The deal excludes Deutsche Börse’s stake in Bats Global Markets, the exchanges operator, and Digital Asset Holdings, a US blockchain start-up.

ISE operates three equity options markets with a combined market share of 15 per cent.The move comes as Deutsche Börse is closing in on a merger with the London Stock Exchange Group, although Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange has signalled that it may make a bid to try to break up the deal. Chicago’s CME Group has also been linked with bids for its two European rivals.The ISE sale will mean a loss for Deutsche Börse which paid $2.8bn in 2008. However, the German group has already taken impairment charges of more than €800m on its investments after a downturn in trading after the financial crisis.“We are pursuing the goal to become the number one or two player in every business in which we operate. This goal requires an active management of our business portfolio,” said Carsten Kengeter, chief executive of Deutsche Börse. “In areas where we are not able to meet this goal, we are evaluating other options.”Deutsche Börse said it expected to register a gain of hundreds of millions of euros with the deal.The transaction will give Nasdaq a market share of around 40 per cent in a battle with Bats Global Markets and the CBOE.“We are number one with respect to market share [in US equity options],” said Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive. “For us to extend that lead, that …is a great opportunity.”We are pursuing the goal to become the number one or two player in every business in which we operate …In areas where we are not able to meet this goal, we are evaluating other optionsMr Greifeld said Nasdaq had had its eye on the ISE for several years but that it became “actionable” in the past few months. The sale was not conditional on the LSE-Deutsche Börse deal going through, he said.Nasdaq will pay with a mix of debt and cash, but does not expect the deal to have a significant effect on its leverage, dividend or share buyback programmes.The deal will yield at least $40m of annualised cost savings within 18 months of closing in the second half of the year.The acquisition is Nasdaq’s largest in nearly a decade.

123;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-03-04T15:37:44Z;Dollar in broad retreat after mixed jobs report;;Dollar bulls are finding less things to cheer about in the latest report on the US labour market than they initially thought.Having risen against most currencies after fresh data showed that the US added a bigger-than-expected 242,000 jobs in February, the greenback has given up all those gains to trade lower against many major developed and emerging markets currencies.Limp wage growth appears to be behind the reverse ferret move. While job growth jumped, average hourly earnings climbed just 2.2 per cent year-on-year, compared with a 2.5 per cent gain the previous month. On a monthly basis, the figures slid 0.1 per cent.The mixed picture in turn is fueling the view that while the US economy is weathering the global slowdown well, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to rush into hiking interest rates again at its monetary policy meeting later this month.Indeed, market expectations for at least one Fed rate rise this year held steady at about two-in-three, according to Bloomberg calculations on CME Group data.

However, at the same time, wage growth unexpectedly cooled in February.That underscores the dilemma for Federal Reserve policymakers who need to carefully balance the risk of a tightening labour market causing inflation to accelerate too quickly, with the deflationary affect of low energy prices.“An upbeat US jobs report raises the possibility that the Fed will hike interest rates again at its March policy meeting,” Chris Williamson, Markit’s chief economist wrote in a note to clients.“However, current signs of rising inflationary pressures and a tightening labour market need to be viewed alongside indications that the pace of economic growth may be slowing, and possibly sharply, amid growing concerns about the outlook.”Financial markets appeared to be mixed on the implications of the latest data: The dollar recently slipped by 0.1 per cent against a basket of major currencies, while the yield on the US 10-year Treasury bond continued its push higher.Meanwhile, market expectations for at least one Fed rate rise this year held steady at about two-in-three, according to Bloomberg calculations on CME Group data.The brighter economic outlook has been a boon to risk assets. The S&P 500 is down less than three per cent for the year, having been off more than 11 per cent on February 11. Strains in credit markets have eased, too, with junk bond funds logging their biggest inflows on record this week.
125;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-03-01T19:59:46Z;ICE eyes bid for London Stock Exchange to rival Deutsche Börse deal;US exchange offer would scupper planned ‘merger of equals’ with German operator;European ambitions to establish a dominant exchange to rival the US were thrown into doubt after Intercontinental Exchange said it was considering bidding for the London Stock Exchange, just days after Deutsche Börse revealed friendly merger plans with the UK bourse. ICE, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, said on Tuesday it was looking at a proposal, but had not yet approached the board of the LSE and that “there can be no certainty that any offer will be made”.The LSE is already in advanced talks with Deutsche Börse over a £20bn deal, which would create a globally competitive European champion in derivatives, clearing and financial market data.News of ICE’s interest also fuelled speculation that other leading exchange operators, including Chicago’s CME Group and Hong Kong’s HKeX, could also enter the fray and spark a transatlantic bidding war.“We are in the endgame for the LSE. The question now is how we manage the process,” said one top 10 shareholder in the London bourse.Shares in the LSE soared 7.8 per cent, adding to a recent surge in its stock price and marking the first time the company has been valued at almost £10bn.ICE’s entry could ignite a political storm over who should own the LSE and regulate its activities. A deal with the German bourse would increase London’s prominence as a financial capital, creating a UK-based holding company with dual headquarters in the UK capital and Frankfurt.The LSE said in a statement it had not received a proposal from ICE and that discussions between it and Deutsche Börse were progressing.A takeover by Atlanta-based ICE would hand LSE’s desirable clearing house to the Americans, which bought Liffe, the derivatives exchange, in 2013. The potential deal would also unite two of the world’s most high-profile venues for stock market listings.ICE, which was established in 2000 to challenge the now-defunct energy trader Enron has grown at an astonishing pace under chief executive Jeff Sprecher. The company is now worth $27.8bn after a series of deals, most recently paying $5.2bn for Interactive Data Corp.Shares in ICE were down 4.1 per cent just after midday in New York.Deutsche Börse deliberately launched its bid for the LSE amid the political uncertainty surrounding Britain’s “Brexit” vote to steal a march on US rivals.Under rules guiding UK takeovers, Deutsche Börse has until March 22 to table a firm offer for the LSE or walkaway and ICE has until March 29.“Never to be left out, ICE has taken a half-step forward for the LSE, though there is not much downside to letting the public know of their interest,” said Rich Repetto at Sandler O’Neill.Owen Jones, an analyst at Citigroup, added Deutsche Börse would not want to find itself in a bidding war.“Its balance sheet is stretched already . . . and a revision to its offer would see either a higher proportion of the combined entity go to LSE shareholders, or it would involve an equity raise, we think.”Listen to the podcast2000 — Intercontinental Exchange founded in Atlanta by a group of seven banks and energy companies as an online electronic market to trade over-the-counter energy, metals and other commodities contracts2001 — ICE buys London-based International Petroleum Exchange2005 — Floats on the New York Stock Exchange2007 — Acquires New York Board of Trade, a physical commodities exchange trading futures and options on sugar, cotton, coffee, cocoa and orange juice, in addition to interest rates, currencies.

126;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-03-01T18:09:36Z;Futures price-in even odds of Sept Fed rate rise;;Getting better all the time…A report showing the US manufacturing sector is deteriorating at a slower rate than many economists forecast has raised the odds of a September rate increase by the Federal Reserve to 50-50.Federal funds futures implied a probability of 51.3 per cent that the Federal Reserve increases interest rates at least one time by the end of September, according to a calculation by Bloomberg on CME Group data. That is up from 42.5 per cent on Monday, and just 1.9 per cent on February 11.Data released recently have given economists increased hope that while the US economy may be slowing, it is not headed for an outright recession. In turn, that has left investors feeling more confident that the Fed will continue increasing rates this year, after its first rate rise in nearly a decade in December.
127;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-03-01T14:17:13Z;Boom time for exchange options trading;Human factor being reduced as the market embraces an electronic approach;Investors and traders are increasingly buying and selling options on futures contracts for managing their portfolios, rather than spending precious cash reserves, spurring a boom in activity for the sector.Along with other areas of finance, technological change and deep-seated structural reform is sweeping through the listed options market.For many investors, the use of options represents a cheaper and more flexible method of altering their portfolio exposure to various asset classes, without moving the market price against themselves.Option contracts provide investors with the ability to pay an insurance-like premium that can protect their portfolios against changes in asset prices within a defined period.Sellers of options receive the premium and are required to pay out should the underlying market price move in favour of the buyer.“For the most part, regulatory reserve requirements for options on futures contracts are lower than for regular futures contracts,” says Andy Nybo, partner and global head of research at Tabb Group, a capital markets consultancy.“For example, asset managers seeking to effect rebalancing programs will have greater costs when purchasing a basket of underlying equities or bonds in terms of fees and market slippage.”The use of options has long followed activity in futures contracts — however, that relationship has been subverted in the last year.Electronic options volumes on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, including trading in the vast eurodollar interest rate options market, has climbed 15 per cent to more than 1.4m contracts a day.In January alone, the numbers soared 37 per cent year on year to an average 4.3m contracts per day, marking an acceleration of a trend across other exchanges in recent years.“That mix — always goes up and down, but this is something that I have never seen in my 36-year history to see the options growth outpace the futures growth,” said Terry Duffy, executive chairman of CME Group on a recent analyst call.Options on futures contracts in all instruments — interest rates, energy and equities — have seen a compound annual growth rate of 12.8 per cent since 2009, according to Tabb Group.Options markets have long been a haven for the human trader, as the instruments entail a greater complexity than other markets — like Black-Scholes modelling — and are often only part of a trade that can include many components.But inexpensive computer software that is able to crunch vast quantities of data has reduced the human factor.As the market embraces an electronic approach, traders across the world can transact outside of regular US business hours.Indeed, electronic trading on CME and Intercontinental Exchange accounted for 56 per cent of total trading in the first nine months of last year, up from just 18 per cent in 2009.In turn, greater activity also begets more options trades, bolstering growth within the sector.“Synthetic long futures requires two option positions [long call and short put] in order to establish the same exposure. More complex option structures would just enhance the pattern,” says one options trader in Chicago.The effect of the Basel capital rules on banks’ balance sheets is beginning to have an effect on the market. Increased electronic market activity is encouraging new market makers to sidestep banks and quote to wholesale counterparties.Start-ups like Akuna Capital, XTX Markets and Dash Financial are beginning to move in alongside bigger and more established options trading firms like Spot Trading and Wolverine Trading.But whether that means that the market is replacing the role historically taken on by banks’ market-making desks is another question.Thomson Reuters says there are equally radical changes on bank-dominated foreign exchange markets. Trades on its options platform between banks and their customers soared 166 per cent last year to record volumes. The number of market makers on its dealer-to-client venue rose 38 per cent last year to 36.It attributes the growth to scandals over the FX market and Libor lending rates, together with tougher requirements that force both banks and fund managers to show they got the best price for their trade.“Over the past two years, banks have reached the point where they can make an electronic price,” says Phil Weisberg, global head of FX, rates and credit at Thomson Reuters. “Customers are at the point where many need to compare prices from more than one source.”He argues that the rising numbers are not representative of overall OTC market volumes, but that “there are more exchange things happening, it’s more automated”.While liquidity and pricing may change, off-exchange markets may remain different. “People using exchanges are alternative market makers,” says Mr Weisberg. “Trading listed versus OTC is very different. Corporate hedgers would prefer an OTC transaction.”
128;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-03-01T08:18:06Z;ICE confirms potential rival bid for LSE;;Intercontinental Exchange confirmed on Tuesday it is considering making a bid for smaller rival London Stock Exchange Group and breaking up the UK group’s planned merger with Deutsche Börse.The US group said it was considering making a bid but “no approach has been made to the board of London Stock Exchange Group, and no decision has yet been made as to whether to pursue such an offer”, writes Philip Stafford.It added that:There can be no certainty that any offer will be madeThe story was first reported by Bloomberg. The news comes amid growing speculation that either ICE or its big US rival CME Group was considering a rival offer to that of Deutsche Börse, which is set to be in the form of an “all-share merger of equals”.“Neither comes as a huge surprise,” said Owen Jones, an analyst at Citigroup. “The LSE is an asset that has received rival bids before and, despite the Brexit risk, it is a sought after asset.”However Mr Jones said that Deutsche Börse would not want to find itself in a bidding war:Its balance sheet is stretched already…and a revision to its offer would see either a higher proportion of the combined entity go to LSE shareholders, or it would involve an equity raise, we think.A move by ICE for the LSE would also see the US group again return to London for a high-profile deal.ICE chief executive Jeff Sprecher has frequently purchased the city’s financial market infrastructure as he has built ICE over the last 17 years, including the International Petroleum Exchange in 2001, Liffe, the London derivatives exchange in 2013, and Trayport, the energy trading platform last year.Purchasing the LSE, would, like for Deutsche Börse, allow ICE to offer investors billions of dollars of savings on their derivatives trades.Global regulations have forced more deals to be backed by collateral and margin as insurance.As a result, billions of dollars of capital are being held at clearing houses such as Deutsche Börse’s Eurex, ICE Futures Europe and LCH.Clearnet. However, bringing them under one roof would allow customers to net their margin for swaps and futures.ICE is currently integrating its $5.2bn purchase of Interactive Data Corp, which it bought at the end of December. However it may receive a windfall in coming months from its 12.5 per cent stake in Cetip, a Brazilian fixed income clearing house. Brazil’s BM&F Bovespa may return with a bid for Cetip in coming days. ICE paid $512m for the holding, although took a $190m impairment charge two years ago.Shares in LSE are up 7.8 per cent at publication time to £28.71.
129;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-02-26T17:28:13Z;Expectations for Fed rate rise in 2016 leap;;A round of stronger US economic data data on Friday has sharply increased bets the Federal Reserve will lift rates at least once this year.Federal funds futures now imply roughly 50-50 odds of at least one rate increase this year, a calculation by Bloomberg on CME Group data show. That’s up from 35.8 per cent on Thursday, and a low of just 11.3 per cent earlier this month.Taken together with the reaction to GDP, personal income and inflation data in other parts of the financial markets, the instant verdict from investors appears to be a strengthening in confidence for the outlook for the US economy.The dollar rose sharply against both the yen and the euro, with the latter under pressure from the prospect the European Central Bank will add fresh stimulus measures as the Fed tightens policy.In equities, the defensive utilities sector fell by 2.6 per cent, compared with a broader market that was largely unchanged.A report from the US Commerce Department showed consumer spending and income both ticked up in January, as the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge heated-up more swiftly than many economists forecast.“The bottom line remains that after 19 months of falling oil and higher dollar there are so far no signs of the problems in energy and manufacturing and [the high-yield credit market] pushing the broader economy into a recession,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank. “Instead, the data today suggests that the positive effects of lower oil prices continue to outweigh the negative effects.”
130;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-02-10T15:01:13Z;CME to shorten livestock trading hours;;Cattle traders are about to have more time on their hands.In response to complaints about erratic prices, exchange operator CME Group has announced it would shorten trading hours in livestock — specifically, in cattle and lean hogs futures.“Based on customer requests,” Chicago-based CME said, “CME livestock futures and options trading hours will be reduced to align with the period of greatest liquidity in these markets.” Futures and options listed on CME’s electronic platform trade between 8:30 a.m. and 1:05 p.m. US central Time starting February 29. As it stands, the markets close at 4 p.m., except on Fridays, writes Gregory Meyer in New York.CME came under fire last month from the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, which represents a million US cattle farmers and ranchers. The group publicly complained that high-frequency traders were making the rather small cattle futures market useless as a hedging tool. CME’s two main cattle futures contracts closed down locked at the daily price fluctuation limit on Monday, the latest instance of an increasingly volatile market.The new hours wouldn’t appear to have any effect on the computerised trading strategies that have exercised the ranchers, but CME also committed to forming a cattle market “joint working group” with the cattlemen’s association to discuss other possible fixes to the cattle markets, including circuit breakers.CME also said it’s reviewing its live cattle futures delivery point in Worthing, South Dakota, to study if a discount was warranted for cattle sold there. Earlier this month, CME imposed a new policy for order messages in cattle futures.Tim Andriesen, CME managing director of agricultural products, said in a statement:Nothing is more important to us than the integrity of our markets, which help farmers and ranchers to discover prices and transfer risk.We believe these actions will further enhance our cattle markets for all participants.
131;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-01-29T10:11:10Z;Silver price fix diverges from spot price;;The daily price setting process for global silver prices in London diverged from the spot market price yesterday, in a sign that banks are becoming unwilling to adjust orders due to compliance fears.The London Bullion Market Association silver price, which last August moved to an electronic platform after 117 years of being set between banks, was set at $13.58 an ounce yesterday, compared to spot silver at $14.4 an ounce, according to data on Reuters.The system is run by CME Group and Thomson Reuters. It was overhauled last year as part of increased regulatory scrutiny over how benchmarks were set. Gold price setting also moved to an electronic system, writes Henry Sanderson, Commodities Correspondent“Everyone is extremely nervous regarding a benchmark, (adjusting an order) might be construed as untoward or front running clients,” Tom Kendall, an analyst at ICBC Standard Bank, said.
132;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-01-25T17:49:41Z;Blockchain backers urged to consider protecting users from fraud;Greg Medcraft, head of regulator Iosco, says ordinary investors need to know transactions are safe;Financial groups betting on the promise of blockchain technology should consider covering the cost of fraudulent transactions, much as banks already do for credit cards, one of the world’s most powerful markets regulators has urged.Greg Medcraft, who chairs the International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco), a global standards body for the world’s securities watchdogs, said the technology was potentially “good for investors and issuers” but it still needed to reassure ordinary investors that their transactions are safe.“One way to get consumer confidence is that someone has to look after the issue of fraud,” he told the Financial Times on Monday. “At least at the start, exchanges will have to guarantee the customer behind [the trade].”Mr Medcraft’s comments come as the world’s largest exchanges step up their experiments with a technology few were even contemplating a year ago.Blockchain is a marriage of computing power and finance. It allows a digital asset to be moved electronically between counterparties without using a central ledger to record the transaction. The technology aims to prevent fraud by using a shared digital public database that is continuously maintained and verified by all the other computers involved in a chain of transactions.Proponents say the technology could speed up slow and inefficient back offices and save billions in the amount of collateral that is currently required by the global financial system. Blockchain databases could also cut transaction costs and potentially remove the need for market middlemen including banks and settlement houses.To date, blockchain has been used primarily for transactions involving the digital currency bitcoin.Use of the technology in more common financial products took a big step forward last week when the Australian Stock Exchange said it would become the world’s first market to settle equities trades using blockchain.The US start-up Digital Asset Holdings, which will supply the project’s technology, has drawn investment from JPMorgan, Citigroup, Deutsche Börse, CME Group and ICAP, among others, in its $52m fundraising.One way to get consumer confidence is that someone has to look after the issue of fraud. At least at the start, exchanges will have to guarantee the customer behind [the trade]Mr Medcraft oversees the ASX as chair of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. He said that Iosco would meet next month to discuss its next steps on blockchain. They range “from thinking about setting up working groups to possibly setting global standards”, he said.The meeting in Madrid next month will also have presentations from Blythe Masters, chief executive of Digital Asset Holdings and from Setl, a UK-start up that is currently raising funds to commercialise its technology.Separately, the DTCC, which settles payments in the US securities market, also said on Monday that blockchain technology may not be a cure-all for financial markets infrastructure. The industry may achieve improvements by standardising industry workflows and using cloud computing to manage vast amounts of data, it said in a white paper.Blockchain technology “is immature, unproven, has inherent scale limitations in its current form and lacks underlying infrastructure to cleanly integrate it into the existing financial market environment”, the DTCC warned. It also called for common standards to avoid “a new jumbled, disconnected maze” of blockchains around the world.
133;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:34:32+0000;Cattlemen lock horns with futures exchange over market volatility;Industry group urges crackdown on high-frequency trading, proposing a delay between trade actions;Cowboys and Flash Boys are headed for a showdown as savage price swings whip Chicago’s cattle futures market.A US beef industry already squeezed by plunging prices has become aggravated by gyrations on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The cattlemen’s prime suspect: high-speed trading firms that have marched into futures markets as the old pits fall silent.The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association this week plans to query CME Group executive chairman Terry Duffy at its annual convention outside San Diego. The group, dating back to 1898, says it represents a million cattle farmers and ranchers. Half the senior leaders on its website are pictured in cowboy hats.The rise of high-powered computerised trading has drawn the ire of many traditional investors, who blame sudden and unexpected market moves on automated systems.Earlier this month, the association fired a letter off to Mr Duffy claiming the usefulness of CME’s cattle futures contracts, 16m of which changed hands last year, “is being called into question” because of high-frequency trading, in which traders place and cancel orders in nanoseconds.“We’re not going to be as fast in Amarillo, Texas as someone who’s right next to the server in Chicago,” said George Enloe of Amarillo Brokerage, a futures broker.Last year, CME’s live cattle market was locked 31 times at its daily price limit, up from nine in 2014 and one in 2013, exchange data show. Three of the first 14 trading sessions of 2016 have closed at limits, too.Almost a third of volumes in CME livestock futures come from automated traders, according to a white paper by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.“We’re seeing these limit-up and limit-down [moves] with no changes in the fundamentals. There’s nothing that would otherwise be driving that kind of action outside of just computers. That’s what concerns us,” said Colin Woodall, vice-president of government affairs at the cattlemen’s association.After peaking in late 2014, slaughter-ready live cattle futures have declined more than a fifth to $1.32 per lb. The price of “feeder” cattle — younger animals delivered to feedlots for a final fattening — has also slumped.People in the US beef industry acknowledge that there are sound reasons for the price fall. Feedlots gorged herds on cheap corn for an “atypically long” time last year, according to the US Department of Agriculture, boosting supply when they delivered record-heavy steers to market. The strong dollar also attracted US beef imports and crimped exports.Cattle futures represent less than 1 per cent of CME’s futures and options volumes, but exchange officials often invoke farmers and ranchers to advocate policy positions in Washington.CME said nothing was “more important than the integrity of our markets.” It added it monitored the activity of all market participants and sought to identify “bad behaviour” through its regulation department. “We will continue to work directly with our customers and industry groups to address their concerns about recent cattle market volatility,” it said.CME has made some changes to cattle futures contracts, including raising the weights of cattle in its feeder index. From February 1, CME will impose a new policy for order messages in cattle futures.The daily turmoil has proven hard to navigate. Commodity index investors have been unable to shift out of expiring futures contracts because the market was locked, a broker said.Cargill, which owns feedlots and packing plants, noted difficult conditions in North American cattle feeding in its latest quarter. “We’ve seen not only a very volatile cattle futures market, but prices were coming down a lot,” a spokeswoman said.
134;CME;CME Group Inc;2016-01-06T18:18:33Z;Derivatives activity slips on Fed rate rise;Volumes in US interest rate contracts fell in December;The Federal Reserve’s long-awaited move to lift US interest rates last month landed with a thud in US derivatives markets, as fresh data revealed that trading slowed around the landmark policy shift.Volumes in US interest rate contracts fell 14 per cent in December from the same month a year before on CME Group, the exchange operator said on Tuesday. Trading in swaps tied to US interest rates declined by a third in December from a year before, according to data from Clarus FT.The declines show that a return to normality after years of US interest rates pinned at zero will not necessarily spark activity in derivatives, where traders use futures, options and swaps to negotiate swings in interest rates. On December 16 the Fed increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 0.25-0.5 per cent, the first rise in nearly a decade.Interest rate products made up a quarter of revenues at Chicago-based CME last year, according to UBS. The bank said higher rates were an “upside scenario” for CME’s business, as it eyed a “likely uptick in volatility that should accompany Fed actions to move towards a normalised rate environment”.But last month an average of 5.7m CME interest rate contracts were traded per day, down from 6.6m contracts per day in December 2014. The average daily volume was the lowest since April 2015.Volumes in CME eurodollar futures, one of the most widely traded interest rate contracts, dropped 28 per cent, while Treasury futures volume dropped 15 per cent in the month. CME declined to comment.In the over-the-counter swaps market, the gross notional value of fixed-to-floating US dollar interest rate swaps trading in December 2014 stood at $3.3tn but fell to $2.2tn in December 2015, according to Clarus FT.At the rival Chicago Board Options Exchange, futures and options contracts fell 20 per cent year on year in December to 90m contracts. Total average daily volume also fell 20 per cent, to 4.1m contracts.The CME’s share price has fallen 10 per cent in the past four weeks, underperforming rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange and the CBOE.Traders and analysts said the trading slowdown reflected the fact that the Fed’s December move was largely a foregone conclusion.“The market really expected this hike, so the relative lack of trading activity around a broadly expected move by the Fed makes sense,” said Josh Younger, derivatives strategist at JPMorgan.Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said: “The rate increase was so well telegraphed that there wasn’t that much uncertainty.”Volumes in December 2014 were also relatively strong as traders reacted to the Fed’s decision that month to stop saying it would keep interest rates low for a “considerable time”. Last month’s volumes were weak by comparison, they added.

The new Star Wars movie is about to be relea … wait, the Fed, what?Asian markets look set to climb ahead of the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate decision in the US on Wednesday, where the central bank is expected to raise the Federal Funds rate for the first time since June 2006.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 is up 1.5 per cent within the first hour of trade, having fallen for six consecutive sessions beforehand. Japan’s Nikkei 225 opened 1.9 per cent up and futures tip Hong Kong’s Hang Seng to rise 1 per cent.That follows gains for Wall Street, where the S&P 500 rose 1.1. per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.9 per cent as the price of oil rebounded and concerns over the high-yield bond market eased.The implied probability of the Fed raising rates is sitting at 81 per cent, according to CME Group. That had the dollar index, a measure of the US currency versus a basket of global peers, 0.6 per cent higher at 98.217 overnight, while US Treasury yields also rose as investors priced in a likely rate rise.Plenty has been written about whether the US economy and the global financial market is ready for a US rate rise. One way or another, investors will start to find out in less than 24 hours. Although Asian markets look set for gains, trading volumes could remain light if investors stick to the sidelines.The economic calendar today is light (all times Hong Kong):
136;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;CME losing ground to LCH.Clearnet in swaps clearing battle;SwapClear claws back market share in OTC derivatives fight with US rival;CME Group is losing ground to its main rival LCH.Clearnet in the battle to be the world’s pre-eminent clearing house for investors using interest rate swaps.The US group, the world’s largest futures exchange, has seen its market share of investors’ cleared US interest rate swap activity fall to its lowest level to date, according to data from Clarus FT, an industry data compiler.The Chicago-based group has spent two years attempting to break into a market dominated by LCH’s SwapClear business, a utility set up by a consortium of investment banks 15 years ago but now controlled by the London Stock Exchange Group.Clearing houses, which aim to manage counterparty credit risk in the over-the-counter derivatives market, have shot to prominence after the financial crisis as one of the bulwarks against systemic risk. The venues sit between two parties in a trade, and aim to ensure a counterparty is paid in the event of a default.However, CME’s global market share dropped to 30 per cent in November from 38 per cent in October according to Clarus. The rest of the market went to LCH, the world’s largest interest rate swaps clearer, it said.The stark drop is being driven by a disparity in the way banks price the same interest rate swap at the two risk management houses, creating a price difference, or “basis”, between them.“Although a swap may have exactly the same features, the clearing house used may mean different funding costs, so they will probably be priced differently to reflect this,” said Stuart Giles, managing director at interdealer broker Tradition. “Although they both may be fruit, they are apples and pears.”Each clearing house collects collateral, or “margin”, to cover losses. Margin requirements can be reduced by other offsetting, or “hedged”, trades.Banks have cleared swaps to LCH for many years, even before the crisis. As new rules requiring mandatory clearing came in, some investors in the US favoured CME, with an accompanying significant demand to pay a fixed rate of interest.Traders say that this meant forking out both for margin on their trades with clients at CME, and also for their hedges with other banks at LCH, amplifying costs which are now being priced in. The difference on a single swap can amount to millions of dollars.The trend first became noticeable around May but has recently touched its widest-ever level, making it more expensive for many clients to trade at CME.“The basis has blown up since September,” said Amir Khwaja, chief executive at Clarus. “CME’s market share is changing and unless the basis tightens, I can’t see it coming back.”CME attempted to fix the problem by providing a CME-specific yield curve, allowing for more accurate pricing and accounting of trades on an ongoing basis.“We believe the CME-specific curve solved a problem in the marketplace by providing transparency in an area where there hadn’t been clarity before,” said a CME spokesperson. “We continue to focus on developing our clearing solution overall.”A similar basis is also showing early signs of developing in Europe, between LCH and German clearing house Eurex, this time turning negative, due to many investors preferring to pay a floating rate of interest.Traders say they are keen to price in the difference in cost early, to avoid building up losses as investors seek to start clearing trades ahead of European rules set to come into force in June 2016.“The street has to be more sensible in how it lets trades get backloaded,” said an interest rate swaps trader at a European bank.
137;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-12-04T21:28:37Z;Europe drops antitrust probe into banks’ CDS market activities;Brussels cites ‘lack of evidence’ as investigation into 13 institutions ends;A four-year investigation by Europe’s antitrust authorities into allegations of collusion in the credit insurance market has suffered a major blow after clearing 13 of the world’s largest investment banks, citing “a lack of evidence”.Brussels had spent four years trying to build a case that the investment banks — including Citigroup, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan — had illegally shut out exchanges from creating rival trading platforms in the credit default swaps (CDS) market.Investigators had filed a charge sheet running to 400 pages alleging the banks colluded to ensure the insurance-like contracts remained a lucrative “over-the-counter” (OTC) product where the banks would remain indispensable, and competition from CME Group and Deutsche Börse, two of the world’s largest futures exchanges, was muscled out.They also alleged that Markit, which provides financial information to the market, and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, may have also played a role.However, the commission said on Friday that “the evidence was not sufficiently conclusive to confirm the commission’s concerns with regards to the 13 investment banks”.It added it would “continue monitoring the practices of investment banks in financial markets”, in a decision quietly announced at the bottom of a daily circular press briefing.However, the commission said it was still investigating Markit and Isda. In response, Isda said it “believes it has acted properly at all times. We will continue to co-operate with regulatory authorities to resolve this matter.” Markit said it “believes it has acted properly and will continue to co-operate fully with the European Commission”.The decision comes only two months after some of Wall Street’s biggest banks agreed to a $1.87bn settlement in the US to resolve investors’ allegations that they clubbed together to inflate prices and keep new entrants out of the market.EU investigators had homed in on the market as policymakers repeatedly blamed the lack of transparency in the derivatives markets for exacerbating the global financial crisis, as well as speculation in credit default swaps for worsening the eurozone sovereign debt crisis of 2011. CDS provide insurance against a default on bond payments and are used by investors to insure against risk and speculate on creditworthiness.However, the CDS market has fallen out of favour with investors since the financial crisis. The market’s gross notional outstanding — a broad measure of all outstanding derivatives positions — is currently about $14tn, approximately two-thirds of its size at its peak. Attempts by Intercontinental Exchange — a US exchanges operator that was named within the scope of the initial investigation because it runs a credit swaps clearing house — to turn the market into an exchange-traded market have also foundered. The investigation into ICE was informally dropped several years ago.The 13 banks were Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Bear Stearns, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS.
138;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-11-24T16:26:26Z;US traders’ algorithms face tougher scrutiny;Regulator seeks to curtail market disruptions from increased use of automated strategies;As many as 100 trading groups that generate more than a third of volumes on futures exchanges would have to register and let the government inspect their secret source code under a US regulator’s plan to patrol the frontiers of electronic markets.“Reg AT,” or Regulation Automated Trading, would impose further rules for transactions in derivatives amid concerns that if a computer program went awry it could spread chaos in benchmarks such as oil or stock indices.The regulation was unanimously released for public comment on Tuesday by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Tim Massad, the CFTC chairman, said automated strategies constitute more than 70 per cent of all trading. They are usually undertaken in split-second increments.While the rise of such trading has lowered costs for market participants, it has also led to mishaps, such as in 2011 when a Chicago firm’s automated system mistakenly generated more than 6,000 crude oil orders in three seconds.“We know that a faulty algorithm at a single firm, regardless of size, can potentially cause a significant problem,” Mr Massad said.The proposal would place more requirements on trading groups, futures clearing brokers and exchanges such as those run by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange.Aspects of the proposal, such as controls on the frequency of order messages, are already standard practice.But other features of the proposal are new. One looming point of conflict is that the rule would require traders to maintain source code repositories that are open to examination by authorities.“It is highly unusual for this intellectual property to be shared with anyone,” said Leslie Sutphen, president of Financial Markets Consulting in Chicago.Chris Giancarlo, the lone Republican on the three-member commission, raised concerns that the repositories could be examined by both the CFTC and the US Justice Department without a subpoena.“I am unaware of any other industry where the federal government has such easy access to a firm’s intellectual property and future business strategies,” he said.‘Systems risk’ arrives after black-box trading lifts speed of marketsRead moreExchanges would be required to publicly disclose certain aspects of their electronic trade matching systems, which have replaced floor-based pits as the futures market hubs of the 21st century. Exchanges would also have to disclose more about incentive rewards for high-volume traders.These schemes “could have the potential to spur market participants to trade in ways designed to collect programme benefits, independently of any contribution they may be making to liquidity or price discovery,” the CFTC said.For the first time, the CFTC provided a legal definition of algorithmic trading, though it refrained from trying to define a more controversial subset known as high-frequency trading.Algorithmic trading, it said as part its more than 200-word definition, is when “one or more computer algorithms or systems determines whether to initiate, modify or cancel an order, or otherwise makes determinations with respect to an order”.The proposal comes more than two years after the CFTC outlined possible reforms for automated trading under a “concept release”.
139;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-11-18T18:49:39Z;CME Group: Political clout counts;The company is set to profit from a US rate rise but it must fend off regulators and jealous rivals;Terry Duffy is wearing a dark suit, a Movember moustache-beard combination and gold cufflinks shaped in the octagonal logo of his company, CME Group. He sits back in his office beside the Chicago river and glances at framed snapshots on some shelves: his twin sons, the actor Mark Wahlberg, three former US presidents, a grinning Hillary Clinton and himself.“I’ve been blessed to know a lot of interesting people and become friends with them. I think they like my no-nonsense attitude. I don’t bullshit people,” he says.Mr Duffy’s blunt manner and deep understanding of Washington politics have helped CME emerge from the financial crisis as one of the most lucrative US businesses. As Wall Street banks scale back, the world’s biggest exchange group racks up operating margins of 60 per cent. This ranks CME among the three most profitable members of the S&P 500 index, alongside Visa, the card network, and Gilead Sciences with its $1,000-a-day hepatitis pill.But the Chicago colossus also faces challenges to its business model. As its wealth grows, the brokers and traders on which CME depends for liquidity are chafing under cost pressures. The Obama administration wants a cut of its transaction revenue to boost the budget of the group’s main regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The clout of Mr Duffy, CME’s 57-year-old executive chairman and president, whose flattering emails to Mrs Clinton were recently released by the state department, is being put to the test.Once a member-owned club, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange became a for-profit company in 2000 and went public two and a half years later. In 2007 it embarked on an acquisition spree, buying the Chicago Board of Trade and later the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Kansas City Board of Trade. Most US futures and options on futures now trade under CME’s banner. In contrast, US stock trading has become ever more fragmented, with business once dominated by the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq split among more than 40 exchanges, dark pools and bank desks.CME’s futures exchanges are walled communities in which it both collects fees from customers and enforces good behaviour. The banks, hedge funds, farmers and others who trade day and night set reference prices for US interest rates, currencies, stock indices and commodities in deals worth $1,100tn last year. Challenges such as Intercontinental Exchange’s attempt to list grain futures have been flicked away.The walled design is central to its profitability. Because the exchange controls its own clearing house, contracts traded on CME cannot be transferred to another exchange. This inhibits participants shopping around for the cheapest marketplace since traders gather where the action is. Legislators in Brussels want to break open this architecture, known as the “vertical silo”. But in the US, home to four of the CME’s five exchanges, remodelling the silo is a political non-starter.The power of this arrangement came into view after the US justice department allowed CME to take over the Chicago Board of Trade. Since the $12bn deal, CME has captured 99.97 per cent of US interest rate futures and options volumes, according to the FIA, an industry group. In January 2008, the justice department’s antitrust division took a different view, warning that exchange-controlled clearing houses “inhibited competition among financial futures exchanges”. It urged the Treasury department to review the set-up.The recommendation, however, went nowhere. Eight months later, Lehman Brothers failed and CME’s smooth liquidation of the investment bank’s positions made its clearing house a model, not a problem. Mr Duffy told Congress that futures markets “operated flawlessly” in the crisis, warning lawmakers not to strip exchanges of control of clearing houses. They acquiesced.Interest rates provide a third of CME’s clearing and transaction fee revenue. As the Federal Reserve looks likely to raise benchmark rates next month — CME futures this week implied a 68 per cent probability — the market swings that follow should generate more fees.CME tightened its grip on the interest-rate futures business after it saw off an upstart exchange. ELX, backed by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other banks, sought to force CME to accept transactions from other venues, such as its own, and allow trades made in Chicago to be cleared elsewhere. CME pushed back and in 2011 Washington took its side, spelling the end of ELX.CME executives are proud of its dominant position. For the third quarter it reported an operating margin of 62.7 per cent, the highest since 2011.Yet the exchange operator’s healthy share of the spoils troubles the very people whose participation makes its markets deep and liquid. Among those feeling short-changed are clearing brokers, who are responsible for handling customer orders and collecting margin payments to ensure the safety of exchange clearing houses. Their numbers have dropped by half to 73 since 2008.While low interest rates are partly to blame, brokers are squeezed by the cost of collecting fees on behalf of exchanges, executives say. In January, CME will raise transaction fees for the third time in three years and it has begun charging for market data used in trading.“We are in a very competitive environment. The exchange isn’t in a very competitive environment,” says one brokerage executive. “Find a [broker] with 60 per cent profit margins. I don’t know of any. I’d like to be one.”Some of CME’s customers, too, are feeling pressure. As high-speed technology fuels CME volumes — automated trading accounted for 62 per cent of CME’s interest rate futures, according to a March CFTC white paper — proprietary trading groups are in an expensive arms race for algorithms and microwave communications. The proliferation of these groups has whittled profit opportunities.“This might not be a popular view in Chicago, but my personal belief is that the vertical integration in the futures markets that causes . . . monopolies is dangerous. Lack of competition leads to higher costs for the trading community,” says Isaac Chang, global head of fixed income at trading group KCG.CME collected $3.4bn in revenue over the past 12 months, 13 per cent more than the same period a year before.CME’s main regulator, the CFTC, complains of funding shortfalls. This year it sought $322m from Congress but got $250m. Its inspector-general warned that the agency must “effectively triage operational tasks in order to deliver on its strategic mission with limited budgetary resources”.The White House wants a futures user fee to fund the CFTC. “Some system of fees to fund the agency has been proposed by every president since Ronald Reagan, including Ronald Reagan. And other agencies have this. So I think it can be done in a way that doesn’t hurt liquidity,” says Tim Massad, CFTC chairman. CME has beaten back such proposals. The latest transaction-fee legislation is stuck in a House committee.CME does not hide its political clout. Mr Duffy runs the Washington office, which employs three in-house lobbyists and has 15 more under contract, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. During “Pac drives”, senior employees are asked to stump up for CME’s political action committee with promises of matching gifts to charities of their choice, former employees say. CME spends more than $2m a year on lobbying, CRP data show.CME’s board of directors has boasted plugged-in figures such as Dan Glickman, a former Clinton administration official, and former House speaker Dennis Hastert who resigned upon his recent indictment on charges of lying to the FBI about bank withdrawals. Before he was Chicago mayor, Rahm Emanuel served on the board. The photos in Mr Duffy’s office include those of former presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and his father, George HW Bush.“They cultivate political relationships,” says Neal Wolkoff, former chief executive at ELX. “Businesses generally have some kind of Washington arm, but it’s not one of the central core functions of your business. In the case of the futures world, in many instances your business is your relationship with Washington.”Mr Duffy — grandson of an alderman from the Chicago’s Irish 19th ward — says he has testified before the government “probably close to 80 times” in the past 15 years. In July he argued that the US should abolish its ban on crude oil exports, a move experts say would also benefit CME’s main oil contract.“He’s got a diplomatic style when he needs it, and he can bring down the hammer,” says Robert Holifield, a former Senate and CFTC official now with Lincoln Policy Group, a lobbying firm.CME also wields a softer influence: its charitable foundation has given grants to scholars who concluded that transaction taxes had ill effects, records show.As reforms force more off-exchange derivatives to be backed by clearing houses, the safety of the financial system will rest more heavily on Chicago’s shoulders. When regulators designated CME’s clearing house as a systemically important financial utility in 2012, CME successfully argued it needed access to cash from the Fed in an emergency.Wall Street’s off-exchange derivatives industry and CME are wary partners. In 2012 Chris Giancarlo, then chairman of the Wholesale Markets Brokers’ Association, an off-exchange derivatives group, and now a Republican commissioner of the CFTC, described what he called “the anti-competitive, single silo, monopolistic structure of the futures market”.Mr Duffy, a former hogs broker whose total compensation was $6.7m last year, bristles at the idea. “The competition is fierce and brutal,” he says. “And if it was a monopoly, we’d have 60 per cent operating margins but we’d also have an average rate per contract a hell of a lot higher than 80 cents per trade. So I’ve never seen a monopoly charge 80 cents a trade.” CME’s average rate per contract is in fact lower than five years ago.It does face serious competition in one market: oil and gas futures. The screen-based ICE raided the turf of hidebound Nymex, whose members had resisted electronic trading before the CME takeover. The market operator Nasdaq has now launched energy contracts that clear at the Options Clearing Corporation, a utility shared by several exchanges.“Monopolies don’t make it over time,” Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, said earlier this year.Mr Duffy does not sound overly fearful. He notes Nasdaq lacks its own US clearing house and says of Mr Greifeld’s energy futures: “He had to go somewhere with them. He could have come here. I would have cleared it for him.”Fees paid by traders generate the majority of CME Group’s revenue. At the same time, CME is in charge of policing traders’ activities. For Terry Duffy, the exchange group’s executive chairman, this arrangement makes sense.“It’s not a conflict, but it’s a perceived conflict of interest and I can see why people would think that,” he says. “But you will see that no one has a bigger interest than CME to make sure the credibility of our market is at the pinnacle, the gold standard.”CME is known as a “self-regulatory organisation” authorised to enforce trading and clearing rules. Its credibility as an SRO has been put to the test.In April, prosecutors brought manipulation charges against Navinder Singh Sarao, a trader from London they say helped prompt the 2010 “flash crash” in US stocks. The complaint alleged his misbehaviour continued to 2014, years after his trading first raised red flags inside CME.In 2011 the futures market underwent a dire crisis after broker MF Global collapsed with a $1.6bn gap in its customer accounts. CME audited MF Global, which was then the top broker by volume on its Nymex metals and energy exchange.CME’s own regulator acknowledges it needs SROs to keep watch over markets worth trillions of dollars. Tim Massad, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, says: “The SROs have always played a very important role in our regulatory system, and they continue to play an important role. Certainly, I’ve increased the things that we’ve asked them to do.”The CFTC and the exchange are battling in court after the government agency sued CME’s Nymex unit and two former employees for allegedly leaking secret customer trading information to a broker.“Nothing is ever hunky dory with the regulator, nor should it be,” Mr Duffy says. “We should always have a little tension in there, because I think that is good.”Additional reporting by Demetri Sevastopulo

Buying the barely profitable Naked Wines cost about £70m. The annual interest, plus a rise in costs associated with new store openings, dripped through to a 70 per cent fall in Majestic’s first-half earnings per share. Some analysts cut earnings forecasts by as much as a quarter to about £14m for the year.Unsurprisingly perhaps, Mr G’s language has become, well, more majestic. A few months ago the talk was all about raising Majestic’s online presence. Now it is all about rebuilding customer loyalty in store and investing in staff, marketing and IT to restore Majestic’s returns on capital to above 25 per cent. The goal is to lift sales to £500m, or by about 10 per cent annually, by 2019. The South African is cutting down on opening new stores, but not the store estate. And he refuses to break out how much of Majestic’s sales should come via the web. He says “that is irrelevant in a multichannel environment”.He may be proved right — in time.

Its hopes of buying GFI were blocked by shareholders, allowing Mr Lutnick to steam in and take control.The disposal means BGC got the voice broking arm of GFI, which it will retain, for a slim multiple of sales. Admittedly, ICE is paying for Trayport in shares rather than cash and BGC’s voice broking arm is losing money. But if BGC turns the operation round by combining it with its own voice broking unit, the GFI purchase will look smart.Mr Lutnick has a knack of extracting high prices for disposals. In 2013 he sold an electronic US Treasuries trading business to Nasdaq OMX for $1.2bn, which was around BGC’s market capitalisation at the time.

141;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-11-16T13:08:34Z;ICE beats Chicago rival with deal for energy platform;Exchange operator acquires Trayport from BGC Partners for about $650m in shares;Intercontinental Exchange has won out over its great rival CME Group and bolstered its position in European energy trading markets by agreeing to buy Trayport, an electronic energy trading platform, from BGC Partners for about $650m in shares.ICE, which operates exchanges in the US and Europe, will take control of an asset that has been owned by BGC, a US interdealer broker, for just seven months when it bought Trayport’s parent company GFI Group for $750m.The deal adds to a wave of asset reshuffling and consolidation involving exchanges and interdealer brokers in recent weeks as regulation, low interest rates and technology reshape the global marketplace.Last month ICE bought IDC, a corporate fixed income data provider, in a deal worth $5bn and last week BGC’s rivals Tullett Prebon and ICAP agreed to combine their voice broking businesses. Tullett will take more than 1,500 voice brokers in an all-share deal that analysts at Barclays say values the operations at £1.1bn.Howard Lutnick, chief executive of BGC Partners, said its pursuit of GFI was in part because of the likely price it could receive from the sale of Trayport.“While in many ways we would have loved to continue owning Trayport, the proposed transaction is ultimately the best way for us to unlock value for our shareholders,” he said. “This translates into BGC paying approximately $100m for $640m of GFI’s remaining revenues, or a multiple of just 0.16 times sales.”ICE’s purchase means Chicago’s CME has been beaten to an asset the latter first tried to buy 16 months ago by purchasing GFI. It then got into a bidding war with BGC and was unable to garner sufficient shareholder backing to complete the deal.The deal will give ICE a dominant position in the hybrid energy trading markets, in which markets such as oil and coal remain brokered over the phone although they are traded in blocks of futures.Trayport is a London-based software platform that allows traders, brokers, utilities and resource companies to conduct both voice and electronic trading and clearing of gas, coal, power and emissions markets in Europe.Howard Lutnick has burnished his credentials as a deal-doer with the disposal of Trayport, writes Jonathan Guthrie.Full storyRevenues at the subscription-based business have grown at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20 per cent since 2007, and generated revenues of $80m in the year to September 30, with margins of 44 per cent. Electronic trading accounted for a greater proportion of volume on the platform each year in that period and BGC has committed to using it for the next two years.“This is a business that has counted both BGC and GFI as customers for many years, and we expect to continue to use it for the foreseeable future,” said Mr Lutnick.It also adds to a long list of London-based assets it has bought in its 16-year history, including the International Petroleum Exchange, the Liffe derivatives exchange, Climate Exchange and SuperDerivatives. It has also taken over responsibility for the Libor lending rate.The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016 and if it is delayed, ICE may pay an extension fee to take the total price for Trayport to $675m.
142;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-11-05T11:09:11Z;Regulators step up efforts to stop spoofing;Michael Coscia found guilty of market disruption;Only months after the first trader was found guilty in court of manipulating a key reference rate for over-the-counter derivatives markets, the futures market now has its own criminal conviction.New Jersey-based Michael Coscia, of Panther Energy Trading, on Tuesday joined Tom Hayes, the former UBS trader, in being found guilty by jury of disrupting some of the world’s most important and closely scrutinised markets.Mr Hayes’s crime of manipulating the Libor interbank lending rate — the benchmark on which around $350tn of derivatives contracts are referenced — led to a global multiyear investigation, billions of dollars of fines for banks and a profound overhaul of the system.However, in the futures industry, long known for its freewheeling and aggressive behaviour in the trading pits, that period of introspection may only be about to begin. Mr Coscia had been charged with fraud and so-called “spoofing”, which involves rapidly entering and cancelling orders to intentionally trick other traders into buying above or selling below the market price.Exchanges had long prohibited disruptive behaviour but spoofing was explicitly banned by the US Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010, as authorities grew concerned that anonymous computers could repeat it hundreds of times a second.Indeed, Timothy Massad, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said on Wednesday the agency had made it “a priority” to look at spoofing.“We’ve been very aggressive in going after situations that we feel are violations of the law, and implementing our new authority in this regard. We will continue to do that,” he told reporters on Wednesday at the FIA Expo conference in Chicago.Last year, futures exchanges also issued new rules formally proscribing spoofing. “We can prevent spoofing now that we have a legal definition of what that is,” Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange, said on a conference panel.But many traders were dumbfounded as news of Mr Coscia’s conviction spread. Mr Coscia had already settled civil charges with the CFTC, the main derivatives regulator, as well as CME Group, which operated some markets he traded such as gold, copper and soyabean oil. The speed of the verdict, issued after just an hour of deliberation, surprised many.“Ultimately, an hour is barely enough time to elect a foreman, take a straw poll on 12 counts and fill out the jury-verdict form. Clearly, no one in the jury found the defendant’s narrative to be compelling. There are lessons in that for both prosecutors and defence lawyers going forward,” says Trace Schmeltz, a lawyer with Barnes & Thornburg not involved in the trial.For some, the practice is hard to distinguish from legitimate trading dominated by rapid-fire computers that spit out numerous prices instantly.On a trading screen, traders are presented with the buying price, known as the “bid”, and a selling price, known as the “ask”. The difference between the bid and ask is the spread. To complete a trade, a buyer or seller must bridge the spread to fill the order. The market goes back and forth before meeting somewhere in the middle. Such activity also explains why market prices can jump around, typified by buy and sell prices being quickly adjusted or cancelled.Walt Lukken, chief executive of FIA, the futures association, says the industry would welcome more precise guidance on what constitutes spoofing. “Clarification by enforcement is not the ideal way to clarify regulations,” he says.Mr Coscia’s lawyer, Steven Peikin of Sullivan & Cromwell, has indicated his client would pursue all of his legal options.Gregory Mocek, lawyer at Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft and a former CFTC enforcement director, says: “If this goes up on appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals has proved in the past that it is not fond of government cases filed pursuant the Commodity Exchange Act, and it may find a way to overturn this decision.” The Commodity Exchange Act is the law that governs futures markets.Clarification by enforcement is not the ideal way to clarify regulationsTerrence Duffy, CME executive chairman, declined to comment on the facts of the case but said of the verdict: “I think there’s a lot of lawyers, a lot of back office people and others who want to understand this to make sure everybody’s in compliance.”Asked if traders would need to change their practices in light of the verdict, Mr Massad responded: “It depends if they’re engaging in spoofing, doesn’t it?”He added: “Look, if they’re entering a lot of orders without intention to consummate then they should go talk to their lawyers.”www.ft.com/tradingroom
143;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-11-04T00:41:47Z;US trader found guilty in landmark ‘spoofing’ case;Jury hands down verdict in first criminal case over computer-driven deceptive trading;A US trader has become the first to be found guilty of “spoofing” some of the world’s largest commodity futures markets in a landmark criminal case for authorities attempting to clamp down on deceptive trading driven by computers.A jury in Chicago on Tuesday found Michael Coscia, 53, guilty on 12 counts, including intending to defraud other traders by flooding gold, corn, soyabeans, foreign exchange and crude oil futures markets with small orders with the intent of cancelling them.The criminal case was a test of authorities’ attempts to stamp out computer-driven misleading trading on some of the world’s most active markets.Spoofing is rapidly placing orders with the intent to cancel them before they trade in order to trick other investors by creating the illusion of demand. While long prohibited by authorities and exchanges, it was explicitly banned under the US Dodd-Frank financial reforms of 2010.The tactic has risen to prominence in futures markets with the emergence of electronic trading that has taken the place of face-to-face trading.Coscia faces a maximum sentence of 25 years and a $25,000 fine on each of the six counts of commodities fraud and 10 years and a $1m fine on each of the six counts of spoofing. Judge Harry Leinenweber set sentencing for March next year.“We’re disappointed by the verdict,” said Coscia’s lawyer Steven Peikin of Sullivan and Cromwell. “We believe this case presents many novel and complex issues, and Mr Coscia intends to pursue all of his legal options.”The jury deliberated for about one hour before reaching a verdict after a seven-day trial.Federal prosecutors alleged Coscia made $1.4m in three months of 2011 at Panther Energy Trading with an algorithm custom designed to “bait and switch” investors.What practices are 3Red Trading accused of and how harmful are they?Read moreProsecutors alleged that on occasion, Coscia’s Panther Trading was the largest participant in the market in spite of only having seven traders.Coscia’s attorneys argued the law under which he was charged was hopelessly vague.Trace Schmeltz, a partner with Barnes and Thornburg and a securities and commodities legal expert who was not involved in the trial, said the case had provided clarity around what constitutes as spoofing.“We have learned what is considered legitimate price discovery in terms of the size of the trades and how quickly they are being pulled. And if you have an algorithm designed to cancel itself if any part of the trade is touched, it is deemed to be spoofing,” he said.“If you were a trader in high-frequency trading and had an algorithm that automatically pulls trades, this [verdict] would be of serious concern to you.”Officials at CME and Intercontinental Exchange’s London futures market discovered unusual trading by Panther Energy Trading in 2011 after receiving complaints from traders.Employees from CME and ICE, as well as rival high-frequency traders at Citadel and GSA Capital, were on the government’s witness list in the trial.The verdict came at the start of the FIA Expo, a big annual trade show for the futures industry taking place in Chicago. Among the companies showcased at the show’s “innovators pavilion” were some that use software to detect fraud.Prosecutors allege Coscia defrauded others with algorithmRead moreThe guilty verdict is expected to be closely scrutinised by lawyers for Navinder Singh Sarao, the London-based trader who is fighting extradition to the US after becoming the second person to be criminally charged with spoofing futures markets.Coscia’s criminal case was notable, lawyers have said, because he was charged by prosecutors after already agreeing to settle civil charges of spoofing markets in 2013. The gravity of the prison sentence he could face over spoofing may give other traders pause before they settle with civil authorities, lawyers have observed.Zachary T. Fardon, US attorney for the northern district of Illinois, said after the verdict that federal criminal prosecutions were an important tool in protecting fairness and integrity in the markets for legitimate traders and investors.“The jury’s verdict exemplifies the reason we created the Securities and Commodities Fraud Section in Chicago, which will continue to criminally prosecute these types of violations,” he said.
144;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Commodity indices split on crude oil weighting;Brent to overtake West Texas Intermediate in Bloomberg index;The world’s two main commodities indices have staked out diverging views on the price of oil, with one elevating Brent crude in its weighting scheme and the other demoting it to second place.The Bloomberg Commodity index and the S&P GSCI index have a large impact on money flows in futures markets, together attracting more than $100bn in assets, according to Barclays.Bloomberg said on Thursday the target weight of Brent, the international oil benchmark, would next year overtake West Texas Intermediate, the US indicator, in its index for the first time since Brent was included in 2012.By contrast, managers of the S&P GSCI index have outlined plans to restore WTI’s status as the biggest component of that index in 2016 after trading volumes rebounded in the US contract.The contrary moves reflect the somewhat different rules by which each index is constructed. Both take into account volumes in underlying futures markets and the scale of world production, but the Bloomberg index — launched in 1997 as the Dow Jones-AIG — caps the weights of individual commodities and commodity groups.The rivalry between Brent and WTI intensified as US shale production surged, temporarily depressing the price of the American benchmark and prompting some global oil groups to turn to Brent to hedge their energy risks.CME, whose New York Mercantile Exchange is the main venue for trading WTI futures, touted GSCI’s planned shift on a conference call on Thursday.Phupinder Gill, CME chief executive, said: “The WTI futures are now the largest component and represent 23 per cent of the total index, which clearly reflects our client’s choice in risk management tools among our crude oil liquidity pools.”Nevertheless, both WTI and Brent would shrink relative to the overall size of the GSCI, with the WTI target of 23 per cent down from a target of 24.5 per cent this year, and Brent falling to 20.4 per cent from 24.7 per cent.S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the GSCI, is a joint venture of McGraw Hill Financial, the controlling member, and CME, the minority partner.The Bloomberg index’s targets would raise Brent crude’s weight from 7.16 to 7.53 per cent, surpassing WTI crude as it declines from 7.84 to 7.47 per cent.In the nine months to September, volumes in WTI futures on the Nymex were up 46.3 per cent from same period of 2014. Brent volumes on Intercontinental Exchange’s ICE Futures Europe exchange were 19 per cent higher.The footprint of index investing in futures markets has faded with the collapse of commodities prices.Barclays estimated $139bn tracks indices today, down from a peak of $221bn in 2010. The GSCI — formerly the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index — has a 47 per cent share. The Bloomberg index has 44 per cent.
145;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-10-28T17:25:05Z;CME experiments with real-time margin payments;US futures exchange backs service that could dramatically speed up time to back margin calls;CME Group, the US futures exchange, is to test a new digital payment network at the heart of its trading operations that may dramatically speed up the time it takes for customers to pay for their trades.The Chicago exchange on Wednesday unveiled a deal with Dwolla, a small Des Moines start-up, that will allow its users to send and receive margin and payments to their customers in minutes compared with the current system, which can take several days.The trial is one of the first to apply newer payments technology to the network of exchanges that underpin trading, clearing and settlement of global markets. The CME operates the world’s largest futures markets, and products like the eurodollar and US Treasury futures are widely traded by investors around the world.To access its market, investors such as hedge funds and asset managers have to post margin and collateral for their futures trades to members of its clearing house, and calls are made several times a day. However payments to those users — known as futures commissions merchants — can take more than a week to be fully recognised. The new service will sit alongside existing CME systems.Ben Milne, chief executive of Dwolla, said the introduction of real-time technology to the derivatives market could “enable faster access to liquidity and funding for the industry”.Payments for derivatives trading in real-time could overhaul the industry by potentially reducing risk in the financial system. Global regulations have forced more trades to be processed through clearing houses, which aim to reduce counterparty credit risk. However that move also creates daily contingent liabilities at clearing houses, especially if struggling members are potentially unable to post the margin for trading.“Dwolla’s technology provides CME Group with an innovative platform to deliver secure and sophisticated payment services to our clearinghouse member firms,” said Sunil Cutinho, president of CME Clearing in a statement.The CME’s own venture capital arm has invested in Dwolla, along with private equity groups Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.

Monday marks the scheduled opening of the first criminal trial over “ spoofing”, a deceptive tactic that emerged with the rise of electronic trading in futures markets. The trial will be a big test of a clampdown that also includes charges against Navinder Singh Sarao, the London-based trader fighting a US criminal spoofing case.Federal prosecutors in Chicago allege Michael Coscia made $1.6m in three months of 2011 by defrauding others with an algorithm custom-designed to spoof. Mr Coscia’s attorneys have argued the law under which he was charged is hopelessly vague. Defence lawyer Steven Peikin did not respond to a request for comment.Papers filed in court illustrate how broad concerns about manipulative trading have become. They include the emailed query from JBS, the largest meatpacker, and notes from an FBI interview with Citadel, the hedge fund based across the street from the courthouse where Mr Coscia will be tried.The documents do not reveal whether JBS or Citadel knew who was behind strange patterns of orders made and cancelled, but show that traders are forced to respond.A quantitative trader at Citadel told federal investigators that on some occasions he “has shut the algorithms off completely and temporarily ceased trading in certain markets due to apparent manipulative trading by others”.At HTG Capital Management, a Chicago-based proprietary trading firm, a former trader told investigators she observed “‘pretty obvious spoofing behaviour” in US Treasury bond futures in October 2011.What practices are 3Red Trading accused of and how harmful are they?Read more“The spoofing activity by the market participant was significant enough that it caused HTG to adjust the settings on its trading algorithms active in the T-Bond market in order to avoid being triggered by the rapidly cancelled large trades,” she said.Mr Coscia was indicted last year on charges of spoofing and commodities fraud. Spoofing — intentionally making, then cancelling, orders to mislead other traders into buying higher or selling lower than actual market prices — was made illegal by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.Officials at CME and Intercontinental Exchange’s London futures market discovered unusual trading by Mr Coscia’s Panther Energy Trading in 2011 after receiving complaints from traders including Alex Gerko, a London hedge fund manager, court filings show. Mr Gerko, employees from CME, ICE and Citadel and the former HTG trader are on the government’s witness list in the trial.An ICE oversight official told investigators that “several hundred times per day”, Panther entered small orders on one side of the Brent crude oil market and much bigger orders on the other side cancelled less than a second later. The order-to-trade ratio for Panther “was approximately five to six times higher than the very largest high-frequency trading firms trading on ICE”, according to a court filing.In addition to Panther, ICE identified 3Red Trading of Chicago as another firm entering trades that fit the criteria for spoofing oil, the notes said. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week accused 3Red and its co-founder, Igor Oystacher, of spoofing US futures markets.Modest background of UK man facing US charges over ‘flash crash’See full articleGreg O’Connor, chief compliance officer of 3Red, said: “The Coscia case is solely about other market participants and not 3Red, but broad market surveillance is a limited and cursory method of order activity review and it has frequently and unintentionally captured the activity of legitimate trading behaviour, such as that of Mr Oystacher.”Mr Coscia in 2013 settled civil and exchange charges with the CFTC, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and CME. His lawyers in the criminal trial have noted that CFTC did not publish guidance on the legal definition of spoofing until May 2013, almost two years after the trading in dispute.Prosecutors sought to exclude the CFTC guidance as evidence in the trial, arguing the case must be judged by the law, not CFTC’s statements. US Judge Harry Leinenweber granted part of the request.“The status of Mr Coscia’s alleged conduct was an open question from the outset,” Mr Peikin, the defence lawyer, has written.
147;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-10-15T16:35:04Z;Dennis Hastert expected to plead guilty in hush money case;Former House Speaker accused of lying to FBI over bank withdrawals;Dennis Hastert, a former Speaker of the US House of Representatives, is expected to plead guilty in a case where he is accused of lying to the FBI about why he made $952,000 in bank withdrawals.Mr Hastert, once one of the most powerful politicians in the US, had pleaded not guilty to the allegations in June. A guilty plea would allow him to avoid a trial.The bank withdrawals were part of payments made to an unnamed Illinois resident, who was to receive $3.5m to hide previous “misconduct” that occurred years ago against that person, according to the indictment.A lawyer for Mr Hastert on Thursday indicated his client would plead guilty during a status hearing at a district court in Chicago, the US Attorney’s office in the city said.A hearing is scheduled for October 28, when Mr Hastert is expected to formally change his plea to guilty. Mr Hastert was charged with one count each of structuring currency transactions to evade regulatory reporting rules and lying to the FBI.The US Attorney’s office declined to comment on the terms of the plea agreement and Mr Hastert’s possible sentence. Each of the charges carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.The payments were allegedly made to conceal sexual misconduct dating from when Mr Hastert was a teacher and wrestling coach in Yorkville, Illinois, according to people familiar with the case.But the charges against Mr Hastert do not relate directly to any allegations of sexual misconduct. Mr Hastert’s lawyers declined to comment.Mr Hastert, 73, was the Republican leader of the House from 1999 to January 2007, and he represented Illinois in Congress for 20 years.Since the indictment was announced in May, he has resigned from his position as an adviser at Dickstein Shapiro, a law and lobbying firm in Washington. He has also stepped down from the board of the CME Group.From 2010 to 2014, Mr Hastert withdrew $1.7m in cash to pay the unnamed individual, according to the indictment. In the first two years, he made withdrawals of $50,000 each until he was questioned about the transactions by bank officials.US banks are required to file reports to the Treasury department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000.Starting in 2012, Mr Hastert began making withdrawals in sums of less than $10,000, allegedly to avoid the reporting rules, according to the indictment.He is accused of lying to federal agents in December 2014 when he told them he was storing the cash because he did not feel safe using the banking system.
148;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-09-30T11:44:22Z;Incentives in futures markets attract scrutiny;Calls for greater transparency over volume discounts, rebates and payments offered by exchanges;If the energy market was a vast sea, Nasdaq’s new futures exchange would be a puddle: it handles one in 500 US oil futures transactions.Nasdaq wants to improve its status. It is doing so partly through a fee holiday and, for a select group of 20 market-making companies, monthly payments for volume.Such incentives may be the only way to wrest business from established exchanges that enjoy powerful network effects.But incentives in futures markets such as volume discounts, rebates and payments are now attracting scrutiny. Sharon Bowen, a commissioner at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, recently said exchanges should reveal more about them.Among her concerns: incentives could induce a firm to trade with itself just to rack up exchange payments. The CFTC “should set more concrete restrictions on market maker programmes”, she says in the text of a recent speech in New York.The stakes of the debate are huge. A total of 21.87bn futures and options contracts were traded worldwide in 2014, according to FIA, the industry body — more than double the volume of 10 years before. At exchange operator CME Group, $1,100tn worth of derivatives changed hands last year.“We understand the CFTC will be issuing a new rule designed to further improve transparency, and we look forward to reviewing it and responding,” CME says.Exchanges commonly offer incentives to bring liquidity into a fledgling contract. CME offers them to customers ranging from electronic trading firms to central banks, in products from innovative interest rate “ swap futures” to grain.The existence of incentive programmes highlights the interdependency of exchanges and traders.Exchanges need market makers to provide an attractive “spread” between prices at which they would buy or sell a commodity or financial index. For example, an Intercontinental Exchange programme in US oil futures obliges applicants to show the bid-ask spread they would maintain and commit to trading 20,000 contracts of the product.For market makers, the opportunity to collect incentives comes with a cost. Prices can move violently against them in thin, erratic markets.“Market making is a risky and complex activity that requires significant time, resources and skilled human capital,” says Jim Overdahl, partner at lobbyists Delta Strategy Group and an adviser to the FIA PTG, an industry group of proprietary traders. “Exchange incentive programmes aren’t perks — they are one of a variety of tools that exchanges use to encourage the activity required to build and sustain healthy, successful markets.”Not all activity has been healthy. To capture rebates from ICE, a manager at Chicago-based Gelber Group directed his stock index traders to “trade opposite each other until they reached the necessary volume”, then had an employee create a computer program that automatically matched the two traders’ orders, the CFTC said in 2013. Gelber was fined $750,000 over the so-called “wash sales” and other alleged abuses.“The main concern is that the programmes don’t lead to non-bona fide trading, where there are just people executing trading for the sole purpose of getting the incentive and not really assuming risk,” says Richard Shilts, who was director of CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight between 2004-13.Mr Shilts says commission staff discussed putting out rules or guidance on what might constitute an acceptable incentive programme. “That wasn’t done,” he adds.Participants in exchange incentive programmes are required to comply with exchange rules that prohibit wash sales and other violations. After the Gelber case, ICE imposed mandatory self-trade prevention functionality for proprietary traders.The use of incentives is not limited to new contracts such as the energy futures Nasdaq launched in July to challenge CME and ICE. ICE recently extended two dozen oil market maker and liquidity provider programmes that date as far back as 2006, an exchange notice shows.A proprietary trader says that participants who back nascent contracts will sometimes do so only if incentives are guaranteed for years, so they can reap the benefits if a contract succeeds.Ms Bowen of the CFTC called for more public transparency on exchange incentive programmes. She said exchanges should provide the public with “fairly granular” information including who is and is not eligible.Exchanges already file basic details of programmes to public databases, though they withhold juicier nuggets such as who participates and how well they are compensated.ICE says: “We currently file details for our market making programmes with the CFTC and will work with the commission as they consider any changes to that process.”
149;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-09-14T17:21:01Z;3Red set for ‘spoofing’ legal battle;Proprietary firm queries market expertise of CFTC lawyers as it tests rules on disruptive trading;3Red Trading, a proprietary trading firm, is girding for a court battle with a US regulator as it awaits charges over “spoofing” — duping other traders by quickly entering and cancelling orders.The Chicago-based firm active on futures exchanges expects to be charged by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission even as it questions the market expertise of the agency’s lawyers, according an internal note seen by the Financial Times.3Red’s defiant stance will test new rules against disruptive trading as exchanges and regulators begin to crack down. The note blasted exchange rules as “vague” and the investigation process as “one-sided”.“Because we have decided to fight, the charges that will be listed against us will attempt to cast us in the worst light possible,” Steve Strohmer, 3Red’s chief operating officer, wrote in the note emailed to employees last Friday.If charged, 3Red would join an expanding group of traders accused of disrupting bona fide deals in futures, where values of things from stock indices to oil are negotiated in millions of daily transactions. Both 3Red and the CFTC declined to comment.Spoofing involves the rapid placement and cancellation of orders to trick others into making trades. London-based trader Navinder Singh Sarao is contesting an indictment alleging his spoofing hastened the 2010 “flash crash” of US stocks.In the US, Michael Coscia of Panther Energy Trading is fighting criminal spoofing allegations brought after he had already settled a civil case brought by CFTC, the derivatives regulator.3Red’s co-founder and head trader, Igor Oystacher, settled disciplinary cases from CME Group-operated futures exchanges in 2014 and Intercontinental Exchange in June, paying a total of $275,000 in penalties and agreeing to a one-month trading ban at CME.The exchanges said Mr Oystacher had entered orders in crude oil, gold, silver, copper and the Russell 2000 stock index, only to cancel them when his orders on the opposite side of the market had been filled. He neither admitted nor denied the rule violations.The note from Mr Strohmer said the previous settlements, media attention and “pressure from Washington to attain results” will make CFTC legal charges “inevitable”.“In some ways I empathise with the CFTC,” he wrote. “They are a group of ambitious lawyers trying to do the right thing with inadequate resources and limited to no experience in trading. It’s a broken process. As we all know trading is complicated and without experience in market dynamics you end up with oversimplified analysis about complex trading”.3Red, Mr Oystacher and Mr Johnson were subpoenaed by the CFTC in 2012, Bloomberg News has reported, citing filings in a Chicago state court.In the past year, both CME and ICE exchanges have enacted new rules banning spoofing in their markets, after the Dodd-Frank financial reforms of 2010 explicitly outlawed the practice.“We have put processes in place in an effort to continually align our trading with the current interpretation of the vague rules of each exchange and the new language under Dodd-Frank,” Mr Strohmer wrote.
150;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;CME turns its guns on US oil export ban;Exchange operator uses Washington lobbyists to help crudel groups;CME Group, the biggest exchange operator, has deployed its powerful Washington lobbying operation to aid oil companies fighting curbs on exports of crude.The move is a rare foray outside derivatives and tax policy that usually occupy the CME’s lobbyists, and highlights how high the stakes are over energy trading rules for some companies in the financial sector.Surging shale production has driven down US net oil imports and fuelled debate about a four-decade-old ban on most exports of domestic crude. A bill to repeal the ban advanced through a House of Representatives’ subcommittee last week.Lifting the ban is a priority for oil producers struggling with low prices. Freer trade could narrow the gap between US and international crude benchmarks and buoy production, they argue.CME’s economic interest in the issue is less direct: its flagship West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures contract could attract more volume if the oil blend is better tied to world markets.The $460,000 that CME spent on federal lobbying in the second quarter included work on the House bill, sponsored by Representative Joe Barton of Texas, a filing showed. Other companies registered to lobby on the bill include BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Hess and Royal Dutch Shell, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks money in US politics.In May, CME ran newspaper advertisements saying North America was on track to export more oil than it imported. This summer Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, testified in support of repealing the ban on Capitol Hill.“We care about the issues that are most important to the users of our markets, who operate in the world’s most important industries including agriculture, energy and finance,” said Mr Duffy. “Removing the oil ban is also about free markets of which we are avid proponents.”CME spends more than $2m per year on lobbying, according to the CRP. Its political action committee contributed $826,750 to federal candidates in the 2014 US election cycle, ranking it fourth among such committees run by securities and investment groups, CRP data show.1975The year crude oil export ban was passed after US was hobbled by Arab oil embargoThe crude export ban was passed in 1975 after the US was hobbled by the Arab oil embargo. It was irrelevant as a policy issue until recently, when rising shale output led to warnings of a domestic surfeit of light oil. Some companies shifted away from West Texas Intermediate as a basis for hedging as it fell to a discount against other grades.Craig Pirrong, finance professor at the University of Houston, said rescinding the ban could help CME’s futures business by boosting US crude output and reconnecting US oil prices to the world market.“To the extent that connection is tighter and more reliably tight, then WTI will be a better hedge for non-US hedgers and that could generate more business for CME,” said Professor Pirrong, who in 2010 wrote a paper on oil benchmarks commissioned by CME.
151;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-08-18T13:28:01Z;Navinder Singh Sarao part 2: scapegoat for a crash?;Depiction of malevolent trader who masterminded market mayhem has received scepticism;"On May 6 2010, in the course of just five minutes, US equity markets spun out of control, collapsing by as much as 6 per cent before rebounding rapidly. This unprecedented market event quickly became known as the “flash crash” — and, according to US prosecutors, it was mainly driven by one man: 36-year-old British derivatives trader Navinder Singh Sarao.For Mr Sarao that fateful day had begun in familiar fashion. He received another warning from CME Group — the operator of the exchanges he traded on — about his behaviour. However, like other traders, he was focused on the volatility that was expected across world markets as investors fretted over Greece’s debts and future in the eurozone.In early afternoon trading, the US markets soared and swung. Briefly, household names such as Procter & Gamble and Accenture swapped hands as penny stocks, before springing back up. To the outside world, despite the crisis in Greece, there were no fundamental events to explain why any of this had happened.US authorities now allege that the sheer size of Mr Sarao’s activities — at one point, his orders were almost equal to the total of all buy trades on the book, they say — played a large role in the mayhem.But Mr Sarao continued to trade over the ensuing years, with some gaps as he regularly switched clearing brokers. He was active right up to the moment of his arrest in April 2015, when he was charged with attempted manipulation of markets. US authorities have highlighted 12 days up to March 2014 in which his actions created artificial prices in e-mini S&P futures, derivatives contracts based on the S&P 500 index of US shares.Unable to pay the £5m bail set by a UK court, because his assets had been frozen, Mr Sarao was held in custody for more than three months this year — until his bail requirement was reduced to £50,000 last Friday.Yet the depiction of Sarao as a malevolent, highly confident trader who masterminded the flash crash, has been received with plenty of scepticism by market observers. “The idea that a $1tn crash was caused by $200m of cancelled trades raises more questions than it answers,” said Ben Rose, a criminal defence lawyer at Hickman Rose in London.“And it took five years for the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to realise that there was a link — when someone else drew Sarao’s spoofing adventures to their attention,” he added.Mr Sarao’s activity and profits that day were also different to the preceding 10 days, in which he was executing buy and sell trades with a notional value of as much as $11.3bn and sometimes making more than $800,000 from exploiting the price fluctuations — none of which resulted in the May 6 moves.Portrayed as either a reclusive trader or a criminal mastermind, Navinder Singh Sarao has polarised opinion on both sides of the AtlanticMuch of the US Department of Justice’s case relies on one day in the life of Sarao: May 6 2010, when US equity markets spun out of controlThere have been competing theories about the cause of the flash crash. The joint Securities and Exchange Commission and the CFTC report later that year detailed a perfect storm of events, in which the European debt crisis contributed to increased volatility and an “unusually turbulent day for the markets”.The agencies focused on the impact of a rapidly and poorly executed sale of $4.1bn of e-mini contracts by a single institutional investor, Waddell & Reed, which began at 1.32pm Chicago time. A trade of that size went well beyond what Mr Sarao could have done. According to the complaints, Mr Sarao switched off his layering program that day, several minutes before the S&P 500 really started to plummet.The CME, which has said the flash crash origins did not lie in the futures market, can shed little new light. By law it cannot release information about individual trading behaviour.Legal experts say the evidence indicates Mr Sarao may have committed an offence or crime by influencing the markets, but not to the extent the US authorities allege.The allegation that Mr Sarao never wanted his order to be first is key to the prosecution’s case. Traders in the e-mini market can see the 10 best prices on each side of the market, so if he placed large-volume orders at several price points in the middle of the order book on the sell side, then constantly modified them to stay above the best offer, he could drive down the price of the futures, they say.By repeatedly modifying and cancelling his orders, he would ensure they would not be filled. US prosecutors say the constant cancellation of orders is a clear sign he was manipulating the market.“If you’re putting a bid or offer into the market, you want it to trade, why would you put a bid or offer in that you don’t want to go through?” says one London-based criminal defence attorney. “If you want your offer to always only be the third-best offer, that implies that you intend that your offer will never get filled. To me it’s pretty compelling evidence that you’re misrepresenting your intention to the market.”Mr Sarao told UK regulators he sometimes traded between 4 per cent and 7 per cent of the e-mini market, thus making his order a target for high-frequency traders. Specialised software was his attempt to hide his intentions and resting orders from what he termed “manipulative” practices by other traders, he said.The idea that a trillion-dollar crash was caused by $200m of cancelled trades raises more questions than it answersMr Sarao told regulators: “I trade very large but change my mind in a second . . . My orders are 100 per cent at risk, 100 per cent of the time.”Some say the fact that his own capital was at risk is evidence that he was not spoofing.Mark Spanbroek, vice-chair of the European Principal Traders’ Association, says what Mr Sarao did was “not good ethical behaviour” but, because of the complexities involved in defining spoofing, “no spectator is in a position to determine whether or not market abuse has occurred here; only the authorities can do that”.Privately, the CFTC admits more clarification is needed. “Spoofing on all our markets is against the law, but what’s spoofing and what’s ‘changing your mind a lot’? We’re working with regulators to find common ground,” Phupinder Gill, chief executive of CME Group, told a conference in London in June.Then there is the issue of the alleged gains from his activity. US authorities have outlined a network of offshore accounts for Mr Sarao that would allow him to move millions between Switzerland, Dubai and the Caribbean.It took months for Mr Sarao’s parents and brother to scrape together their life savings to come up with £50,000 for bail. But the courts refused to reduce the amount until his lawyers were able to guarantee that all of his assets had been disclosed. His parents had also offered to raise further funds by mortgaging their home.4%-7%Size of the e-mini market that Sarao told UK regulators that he sometimes tradedWith no spouse or children and “no real ties to prevent him from upping and leaving the country”, Mr Sarao was a “quintessential flight risk,” the lawyers for the US had claimed. But they dropped their objection after Mr Sarao disclosed £25.5m in a Swiss bank account, in addition to £5m that is already being held by US authorities.On the morning of Thursday June 18, Mr Sarao appeared in court by video link from Wandsworth. Wearing the same well-worn grey tracksuit and canary yellow sweatshirt, his demeanour was calm and displayed no sign of a man potentially facing years in a US prison.In a note to the court that day Mr Sarao’s lawyers began to lay out their arguments for a hearing in September over his extradition.It is an abuse of process, they will say, because he would face “a sentence far in advance of anything that might be imposed in this jurisdiction, combined with the pressure to admit guilt created by the plea bargaining system”. Plus, his conduct took place in the UK, so he should be tried there.But their primary point is that the case hinges on a “potentially misleading contention”, they said.“The defendant is being scapegoated for a large-scale financial crash, the blame for which initially had been apportioned elsewhere.”"

However, it began with a third warning from CME Group to him and his then-broker MF Global about his trading behaviour. The world’s largest futures exchange had again contacted him about placing, then quickly cancelling orders — a practice known as spoofing.Mr Sarao turned down an offer to speak to the exchange, and later that month bragged in an email to the broker he had called the CME back “and told em to kiss my ass”. To underline their depiction of his confidence, US regulators say he established an entity only weeks beforehand in the Caribbean island of Nevis with the provocative title “Nav Sarao Milking Markets Ltd”.US authorities allege Mr Sarao used unlawful trading tactics that same day, beginning at about 9.20am Chicago time. The pattern of placing orders, modifying them, then cancelling them was another unlawful trading technique known as layering. That gave the impression there was substantial supply in the market. Each time, he cashed in by buying contracts at the artificially low price and selling them when the market corrected itself. In that period, the price of e-mini S&P futures contracts fell 39 basis points in just six minutes, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleges.In the two hours before the flash crash, he intensified his activity. In that period, he placed six e-mini orders, which were replaced or modified 19,000 times before cancelling them without completing a single trade. Those orders, worth up to $200m, accounted for between 20 and 29 per cent of the entire sellside of the order book for e-mini contracts on CME, regulators allege. Altogether, he traded more than 62,000 e-mini contracts with a notional value of $3.5bn.Aitan Goelman, enforcement director for the CFTC, calls Mr Sarao “a significant factor in the market imbalance” as his orders alone were almost equal to the amount of orders to buy on the CME’s order book.By then, the scene was set. A poorly executed large order was offloaded into the e-mini futures market, which moves in lockstep with the underlying S&P 500 — although the futures market usually moves a fraction of a second quicker. When the e-mini futures market collapsed, the equity markets followed. As the market plummeted in front of the world’s eyes, a five-second pause in the CME’s systems halted the slide and markets recovered.

BATS Global Markets bought Hotspot, a currency trading network, for $365m in January.“Our intention [with the 360T deal] is to broaden our capture of asset classes,” said Deutsche Börse. “This is an interesting asset class.”The dramatic strengthening of the dollar against all of its peer currencies since the middle of 2014, registering its quickest growth since 1985 as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise US interest rates, has increased volumes and revenues in currency trading.Exchanges are looking at taking a greater role in the forex market, which is expected to become more heavily regulated following the market-rigging scandal.360T, founded in 2000, provides a web-based trading platform for over-the-counter financial instruments. Its network is used by more than 1,700 buyside clients worldwide, according to its website.360T had average daily volume of $70bn in 2014, according to an Aite Group report cited by Bloomberg.Electronic trading accounted for more than half the total forex market this year, up from 38.5 per cent in 2012, according to Euromoney surveys. Clients are seeking a cheaper and quicker alternative to brokers, and electronic trades limit the scope for malpractice.The acquisition will be financed with a mix of debt and equity and is expected to add to earnings per share “immediately”, Deutsche Börse said in a statement.German exchange in discussions with venture partner SIX Group about index compiler holding.Continue readingThe exchanges operator expected “double-digit million euro” revenue synergies in the medium term from the deal.Private equity group Summit Partners took a majority stake in 360T in 2012. Other shareholders in the platform include German private equity group Brockhaus. Deutsche Börse, which like 360T is based in Frankfurt, said shareholders in the forex trading platform had signed a “definitive agreement”.Mr Kengeter, the former head of UBS’s investment bank, left UBS last year after the Swiss bank decided to wind down its bond trading business.Since he took the helm, the exchanges operator has announced plans for two significant deals. Deutsche Börse said last month it was seeking to gain full control of joint ventures Stoxx and Indexium, companies that maintain indexes to track financial markets. The Euro Stoxx 50 is the leading index of European blue-chip stocks.Such businesses make money through licensing deals with creators of exchange traded funds. Acquiring them is an attractive way for exchange operators to diversify their revenues.Deutsche Börse’s last big deal was the acquisition of ISE, then the US’s second biggest options market, for $2.8bn in 2007. The European Commission blocked a merger with NYSE Euronext in 2012.
154;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-07-14T15:17:10Z;Proprietary traders ‘self trade’ in bond market chaos;Industry argues matching own trades largely “unintentional’’;A significant share of the $12tn US Treasury market consists of proprietary trading firms transacting with themselves.That was one of the more striking data points of the report by US authorities this week on the events of October 15 2014, when the normally stable US Treasury market whipsawed chaotically.During the massive swing, so-called “self trading” between principal traders’ own electronic systems surged to 14.9 per cent of the 10-year Treasury securities cash market and 11.5 per cent of its futures equivalent.That compared with more normal activity of 5.6 per cent in the cash market and 2.7 per cent in Treasury futures on 16 “control days” analysed by the report’s authors, using data from CME Group and ICAP’s BrokerTec, which run the industry’s two main venues.“Self trading” occurs when the same institution takes both sides of the trade so that there is no change in beneficial ownership. They can be unlawful if deemed “wash trades”, which carry minimal risk or economic purpose but generate extra fees for the broker.The findings highlight the difficulty for market regulators in a world where conditions change rapidly and thousands of price and trades are updated in fractions of seconds.As the report noted: “The bulk of self trading in cash and futures markets was observed among [principal trading firms], perhaps due to the fact that such firms can run multiple separate trading algorithms simultaneously.”Some exchanges have mechanisms to prevent self trading but their use is optional. Furthermore, US regulators on Monday did not make any findings on self trading’s legality.“The purpose of the report was not to make a judgment on whether the self trading we found was wash sales. That’s an enforcement question,” said one US official who declined to be identified.The trading was concentrated among proprietary traders, also known as principal trading firms. A “very small amount” was conducted by banks and hedge funds, the report said.On control days, 9 per cent of proprietary traders’ volume in 10-year cash Treasuries and 4.4 per cent of their volume in Treasury futures was self trading, the report said.“This is unintentional,” said Jim Overdahl, partner at Delta Strategy Group and an adviser to the FIA Principal Traders Group. “It’s something that firms try to prevent, but it happens because firms sometimes have different algorithms running from different parts of the firm. And it’s costly. No firm wants to trade with itself.”CME Group, the exchange operator that lists Treasury and other US interest rate futures, in 2013 introduced a voluntary self-match prevention function that stops matching buy and sell orders between the same owner. CME declined to comment. ICAP, which is the biggest venue for trading cash Treasuries, did not explain its procedures.Some trading firms maintain their own in-house systems to prevent self-matching, Mr Overdahl said.“It’s an industry-wide issue that firms have tried to deal with. It’s not in the interests of any firm to engage in unintentional self match,” Mr Overdahl said.In a “concept release” published in 2013, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission asked the public to comment on whether exchanges should require self trading controls for market participants.Tim Massad, CFTC chairman, recently said the agency was looking at the “potential implications and effects on the markets” of self trading.The report on the Treasury market said the effect of self trading on the rapid price movements of October 15 was unknown.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson in Washington
155;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CFTC stays ICE’s plan to raise position limits in power contracts;US futures regulator rejects request for eight futures contracts tied to deliveries in NY state;The US futures regulator has pushed back against an effort by Intercontinental Exchange to give speculators more leeway in electricity markets, a rare move in an area where exchange decisions generally go unchallenged.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Tuesday it would stay ICE’s request to increase position limits — caps on speculative holdings — in eight futures contracts tied to wholesale power deliveries in New York state.Outside of some agricultural commodities, US exchanges are empowered to decide position limits based on estimates of deliverable supply with the consent of the CFTC. In 2014, both ICE and rival CME Group dramatically loosened position limits for dozens of power contracts without drawing any objection from the regulator.This time, the CFTC determined ICE’s explanation for its proposed rule change was “inadequate” and “potentially inconsistent” with commodities law. Before approving the change, the agency seeks public input on ICE’s method for estimating the deliverable supply of electricity.The action comes as CFTC plods through the process of passing a new rule tightening position limits in 28 other commodities, excluding electricity. Under the proposal, the commission would take over the job of setting limits from exchanges. Market participants have criticised the CFTC’s own deliverable supply estimates as out of date.ICE proposed to raise position limits in eight power contracts for delivery in Nyiso Zone G — in the Hudson river valley north of New York City — in some cases by sevenfold. The exchange has said it set the spot month speculative position limits for Zone G contracts at 25 per cent of deliverable supply, estimated at 14,105 megawatts.Electricity is a notoriously volatile commodity where supply must equal demand because of the lack of affordable storage. This makes estimating deliverable supply a highly technical endeavour.“It is essential that the estimated delivery supply of these contracts effectively link futures trading to the underlying cash markets,” CFTC said.
156;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-07-06T07:57:51Z;Oil options pit empties on eve of CME futures shutdown;Brokers lament demise of noisy exchange as computer trade grows;New York’s oil options pit, once a boisterous holdout against electronic markets, has become a sleepy seat of what might be called low-frequency trading.One day last month 317 crude oil options changed hands on the New York Mercantile Exchange floor — less than one a minute — where traders using shouts and hand signals previously executed 50,000 options daily. In June the pit accounted for just 2 per cent of options on West Texas Intermediate crude, the world’s most active oil options contract, down from 40 per cent four years ago.The trend bodes ill for floor-based traders of options, which confer the right to buy or sell a futures contract at a set price by a given time. Exchange owner CME Group will on Tuesday close most of its futures pits in New York and Chicago, but it has pledged to keep options pits open as long as customers show a “viable preference” for them. Fewer oil market customers do.Ira Eckstein was a Nymex floor broker who closed his business in 2014 and now runs a digital marketing agency. “The volume wasn’t coming back to the floor,” he said. “It was sad.”Floor brokers had believed that the complexity of some options strategies made them poorly suited for computer screens. But CME’s screen-based Globex platform now handles more than two-thirds of WTI options. Rival Intercontinental Exchange, home to a smaller oil options market, has no floor at all.The disappearance of floor-based options also comes after the exchange made it easier to buy and sell options through private “block” transactions. Blocks were designed to let traders conduct large deals without tipping off the rest of the market. In 2012 CME dropped the minimum size for block trades from 1,000 contracts to 100 in US oil options in response to government derivatives reforms, and block trading flourished.Market veterans say the remaining action on the Nymex floor largely consists of brokers standing in booths and arranging block trades among their own clients — a transaction that doubles fees because they are broking both sides of the deal. If unsuccessful, brokers enter the pit to solicit public bids.“The pit is now a last resort,” said a broker who recently left the floor.The number of WTI options executed in the pit has collapsed by more than half this year even as total volume has shot up 26 per cent to 155,000 contracts per day, helped by sharp moves in crude.Derek Sammann, CME global head of commodities and options products, said in a statement: “Our global energy customers have demonstrated an increasing preference for electronic trading options at CME Group. We’ve responded to this specific customer need by significantly investing in our options technology and developing new and innovative products, which have provided them with the flexibility to significantly grow their electronic options trading.”As the floor empties, the price to lease a Nymex seat has fallen from $1,100 in 2011 to about $725.Alex Vugman, managing partner of Ulysses Commodities, an options broker, said: “People that will be coming into business 10 years from now are going to be educated about price formation in a completely different way.”
157;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-06-25T14:49:08Z;Rain delays to US planting lift corn and soya prices;Soggy conditions have also slowed the harvest of US winter wheat;Fields too wet to drive a tractor, corn stalks flattened by gusts, submerged silos: wild weather in the US Midwest has taken agricultural markets for a ride.In the past few weeks, grain futures have halted months of decline on fears that storms in the grain belt could trim otherwise ample supplies.The downpours and damaging winds have arrived just as the US Department of Agriculture prepares an official survey of farmers’ planting plans for the year. The report, to be released Tuesday, will help guide grain markets for the rest of the northern hemisphere growing season.When farmers were first surveyed in March, they intended to plant 89.2m acres with corn and a record 84.6m acres with soyabeans, the two most widely cultivated crops in the US. Many analysts believed these new numbers would be higher in Tuesday’s update. Now they are not so sure.“The adjustment in acreage the USDA imparts June 30 will be worth watching closely,” says Bill Lapp of Advanced Economic Solutions, a consultancy.As the top producer of both corn and soyabeans, the US crop is important in steering world grain prices. The two commodities are fed to livestock, processed into food and biofuels and exported around the world.The rains have delayed planting of soyabeans, which are generally sown after corn. Earlier this week 90 per cent of the crop was planted, 5 percentage points below average. In Missouri just under half the intended soyabean crop remains to be planted.Furious winds across Iowa and Illinois earlier this week knocked over young corn stalks in “garden spot areas, potentially the best-yielding areas, and the market is taking notice”, says Mike Zuzolo, president of Global Commodity Analytics. “Because soils are so saturated, hail and wind exacerbate an already bad problem for producers.”Soggy conditions have also slowed the ongoing harvest of US winter wheat, leading to worries that moisture could damage the quality of that grain before it reaches millers.Prices have jumped, with July-delivered corn futures gaining 6 per cent to $3.73¼ a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, CBOT July soyabeans rising 7.9 per cent to $10.01 a bushel and CBOT July wheat rising 6.1 per cent to $5.23¾ a bushel since June 1.June began wet and became wetter when tropical storm Bill barrelled through, dumping nearly four inches of rain in a day on southern Indiana. Further north, the agricultural trading house Bunge shut down a soyabean processing and oils packaging plant for four days as it was encircled by muddy water. Illinois is slogging through what is already its fifth wettest June on record, according to its state climatologist.The rains are consistent with long-term climate projections as the world warms. The US National Climate Assessment, published last year, said the Midwest’s annual precipitation increased in the past century with much of the rise due to “intensification of the heaviest rainfalls”, a trend set to persist.The rains are also stoking concerns more immediate than the autumn harvests: high water has hindered barges trying to reach silos along the Illinois river, the official delivery point for corn and soyabean futures. Futures exchange operator CME Group last week invoked a force majeure clause allowing traders to delay deliveries until the river subsides. If the situation persists, traders said it could push down July-delivered futures prices relative to later delivery dates.Archer Daniels Midland, the owner of some shipping stations on the river, says that while flooding has hampered barge operations, “our extensive rail and road assets allow us to continue moving grain”.The rainy spring has an upside: it will leave ample moisture in the soil to guard against any dry spell during July and August, when corn ears and soyabean pods fill out. This is a contrast to the US drought of 2012, when a dry spring left plants vulnerable to intense summer heat and soyabean prices shot to a record high.“There’s no correlation whatsoever between June rainfall and final yield,” says Dan Basse, president of AgResource, a consultancy. “This is a very good-looking crop, both corn and beans, albeit with some localised flooding in some areas.”The global supply picture is also ample: South America is reaping large soyabean and corn harvests, while the US is sitting on mounds of both commodities after two years in a row of huge crops.Ahead of Tuesday’s USDA report the forecast remains cloudy: Commodity Weather Group eyes more rain through Friday, with the heaviest amounts in Corn Belt states such as Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
158;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-06-24T17:35:57Z;US futures regulator in call to tackle industry ‘culture problem’;Derivatives market regulator seeks to follow UK and increase board accountability;A senior US regulator has advocated taking a page from the UK and passing a new rule tightening governance of derivatives marketplaces to cure what she called a “culture problem” pervading finance.Sharon Bowen, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said in written remarks prepared for delivery late on Wednesday that a proposed measure on governance and conflicts had languished too long at the agency, while large organisations had continued to violate market rules.“It is time for us to act on this rule,” Ms Bowen planned to say.The CFTC proposed its rule on conflicts of interest and governance in October 2010, soon after passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform. It would have required public directors and diverse ownership of futures exchanges, swap execution facilities and clearing houses — venues where derivatives are traded and processed.The commission had said futures exchanges had conflicts of interest between their commercial motives as for-profit companies and their responsibilities as self-regulatory bodies. This dual role has come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of complaints that traders have engaged in market ‘spoofing’— a form of deceptive trading — with impunity.Clearing houses could also face conflicts of interest over which companies may become members and which contracts may be held in the clearing house, the CFTC determined. Gary Cohn, president at Goldman Sachs, this week called it a “conflict between managing risk and winning new business”.Ms Bowen, scheduled to speak at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, said she was “heartened” by the Fair and Effective Markets Review (Femr) published by UK regulators earlier this month, particularly its proposals to raise standards and accountability in finance.“My staff and I are continuing to review these recommendations and I would hope that we can mirror some of them in the CFTC’s governance rule,” she said.The CFTC’s original governance proposal came under fire, with CME Group, the largest US futures exchange and clearing house, calling it “overbroad” and “extraordinarily burdensome”.Ms Bowen said the proposed rule contained good ideas but could be enhanced with “qualitative standards” for board membership in addition to a numerical requirement for 35 per cent of board members to represent the public.She said that US governance rules for trading facilities should be consistent with those elsewhere. Many of Europe’s governance requirements for British clearing houses, she noted, “could work for a variety of US registrants. Again, principles of governance are universal”.Ms Bowen, a Democrat appointed to the commission a year ago, also again called for much tighter oversight of retail foreign exchange trading, citing how the turmoil following Switzerland’s decision to depeg its currency in January almost sank one US dealer.“The time has come to comprehensively regulate this market,” she said. “Retail commodity trading should occur on regulated exchanges, just as retail securities trading does. Too much retail foreign exchange trading currently occurs over-the-counter.”
159;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-06-23T10:46:29Z;Moody’s to reassess clearing house risks;Industry worries about new ‘too big to fail’ entities;The credit quality of clearing houses involved in derivatives and whether they are a potential source of systemic risk is triggering a reassessment of the industry by Moody’s, the rating agency.Clearing houses have assumed a crucial role within the massive over-the-counter derivatives industry in the wake of the financial crisis. Regulators have mandated that derivatives move into clearing houses, so that the central authority can collect collateral from entities involved in a trade. This helps cover potential losses should a counterparty default, with the aim of reducing credit risk and averting the kind of derivative market turmoil that erupted with the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008.But some observers have warned concentrating risk in one place increases the systemic consequences should a clearing house fail, leaving taxpayers on the hook in a crisis. With some in the industry calling clearing houses “too-big-to-fail” institutions, regulators are on a fact-finding mission with the intention of eventually introducing global standards for stress tests, to assess their ability to cope in difficult market conditions.Against that backdrop, Moody’s has put out a request for comment from industry participants to create a new methodology and rating for clearing houses.“We believe these institutions have always had a very elevated systemic risk profile,’’ said Ana Arsov, associate managing director at Moody’s, who spearheaded the development of the methodology. “But now with the mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives their profile is even more elevated.”The agency currently produces ratings for some of the exchanges’ holding companies that also run clearing houses, such as CME Group, the London Stock Exchange, which owns LCH.Clearnet, and Intercontinental Exchange.But all of these ratings use existing securities standards and are not specifically designed for rating clearing houses that process large amounts of OTC derivatives trades.“[The new methodology] will reflect our opinion first and foremost on the ability of the clearing house to meet its clearing and settlement obligations to its members and then to determine the financial loss that could result if clearing houses were unable to meet these obligations,” Ms Arsov said.It divides the assessment of a clearing house into four broad categories: intrinsic credit strength, operating environment, qualitative adjustments and affiliate and systemic support.The last of these seeks to address the issue of a clearing house requiring government support if it failed.“What is the significance of the products being cleared, what is the market impact if a clearing house defaults and what kind of public involvement would be required,” she said. “These are all things that we would take into consideration to decide if a systemic support uplift in the rating is warranted.”
160;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-06-15T16:27:32Z;US crude futures volumes eclipse Brent;WTI trading volumes top daily average of 1m;West Texas Intermediate crude, once derided as a broken oil benchmark, is enjoying a comeback.Volumes of futures tracking the yardstick have averaged 1m contracts a day this year through May, up more than 45 per cent from the same period of 2014, exchange data show. WTI has also sped ahead of volumes in rival Brent crude, less than two years after Brent unseated WTI as the most heavily traded oil futures market.The resurgence of WTI trading follows a 44 per cent plunge in oil prices from a year ago. Big price swings invigorated trading in both Brent and WTI, but the latter has attracted more.WTI has also regained a more stable connection with global oil prices after suffering glaring discounts because of transport constraints at its delivery point of Cushing, Oklahoma. The gap led some to question WTI as a useful gauge of oil prices.“I guess the death of the WTI contract was greatly exaggerated,” said Andy Lipow of consultancy Lipow Oil Associates.But in the past two years, new pipeline capacity of more than 1m barrels a day has relinked Cushing to the US Gulf of Mexico coast, narrowing the discount between Brent and WTI to less than $4 a barrel.Mark Vonderheide, managing partner of Geneva Energy Markets, a New York trading firm, said: “With WTI once again well connected to the global market, there is renewed interest from hedgers outside the US to trade it. When the spread between WTI and Brent was more than $20 and moving fast, WTI was much more difficult to trade.”Futures exchanges CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange both list WTI and Brent. CME registers more than 80 per cent of WTI volumes, however, while ICE is dominant in Brent.CME said it’s “seen robust growth across all of our energy products,” particularly WTI. ICE declined to comment, but a first-quarter financial report noted its share of the total crude futures market had slipped to 50 per cent from 55 per cent in the same quarter of 2014.Atlanta-based ICE blamed the shift on “increased volatility in WTI crude oil prices relative to Brent crude oil prices, which drove more trading by non-commercial firms in WTI, as well as increased financial incentive schemes offered by competitors”.ICE and CME both offer fee discounts and other incentives to entice high-volume traders. Timothy Massad, chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said in a recent speech he was “looking at the adequacy of disclosure by exchanges” of incentive programmes.The exchanges will face a third competitor when Nasdaq launches energy futures including WTI and Brent in coming weeks. Nasdaq plans to undercut the incumbents on costs and is offering nine months without fees.In the first five months of 2015, average daily volume in WTI totalled 1m contracts on CME and ICE combined. Combined volume in Brent was 876,000 contracts a day, up 35 per cent from the same period a year before.The shale drilling boom that pushed the oil market into glut has also been driven by small and middle-sized energy companies that need to lock in forward sales with futures contracts.“The bulk of those are US companies with WTI-related risk,” said Paul Horsnell, head of commodities research at Standard Chartered. He said WTI “is still weak in terms of suitability as an international marker”.
161;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-06-09T16:01:04Z;Investors in switch from CME to LCH;Change in pricing practice by banks is encouraging switch of clearing venue;Investors are switching away from exchanges operator CME Group for clearing certain derivatives contracts because of a recent jump in costs compared with European rival LCH.Clearnet, driven by a change in pricing approach by banks.Clearing is a key tenet of post-financial crisis reform, where trades previously conducted bilaterally between banks and investors now go through clearing houses like CME and LCH, which collect collateral to cover potential losses should a client default.Chicago-based CME has been the popular choice for US investors since the introduction of mandatory clearing for certain derivatives contracts, such as interest rate swaps. But banks have historically favoured clearing to LCH.Recently, this bifurcation has been blamed for banks quoting materially worse prices to investors wanting to clear to CME, giving them an incentive to move to LCH, Risk.net reported. And some have done just that.“We are now consistently taking new trades to LCH because of that [price difference],” said a treasurer at a US regional bank.The price difference, or basis, between trades cleared to each clearing house has reached as much as 1.9 basis points, compared with 0.15bp in the recent past. On a $1bn notional 10-year pay fixed interest rate swap that amounts to around $2m for the life of the trade.Chatham Financial, a risk management consultancy, said one client is moving all its existing trades away from CME, while another is conducting all future business at LCH. LCH reported a 25 per cent increase in trade count from bank clients.“We have already had clients choose to move to LCH on account of the basis and it’s an active discussion with many others,” said Luke Zubrod, director of risk and regulatory advisory at Chatham Financial.But Mr Zubrod adds that some clients have chosen to remain at CME because of other cost savings.The issue arises because a lot of CME’s clients for interest rate swaps trade in a similar fashion, choosing to pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a variable rate.As a result, bank market makers have found themselves with big directional positions at the clearing house, receiving clients’ fixed rate of interest with no ability to offset the position with other banks, because they all want to do the same thing.Instead, banks have continued to clear offsetting trades between each other at LCH, where they already have large legacy positions from its history as the clearing house for interdealer volume.This increases costs for banks because they are required to post collateral for trades at both clearing houses, rather than these trades sitting in one clearing house and offsetting each other, reducing collateral requirements.That cost is now being reflected in banks’ prices to clients and many asset managers, hedge funds and US regional banks have said the change is affecting their choice of clearing house.CME said it had seen an increase in activity from clients who want to do the opposite trade and receive a fixed rate of interest, which is now cheaper than at LCH.The issue has captivated derivatives markets but Isaac Chang, head of fixed income at non-bank market maker KCG, said it was a “red herring”. Before the advent of central clearing, every interest rate swap was a bespoke agreement between a bank and its counterparty, he said. Now, instead of hundreds of different collateral agreements, there are two major clearing houses, CME and LCH. “Frankly it is an improvement over the situation that existed before the crisis,” he said at a public meeting at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
162;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-05-06T19:07:12Z;Jorge Montepeque, architect of oil-pricing system, to leave Platts;Montepeque, credited with bringing transparency to opaque trade, to quit after shake-up;The architect of the system that underpins oil pricing around the world has announced he is leaving Platts after a shake up at the reporting agency.Jorge Montepeque, the head of market reporting, is credited with bringing a degree of transparency to once opaque corners of the global oil trade and has fashioned a position as the de facto arbiter of a largely unregulated physical market.A Guatemalan-born US citizen with a fiery temper and sharp tongue, Mr Montepeque helped design the so called market-on-close system, which is used by traders to set the price of millions of barrels of crude every dayPlatts, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial, the US publishing group, said that after more than two decades of service Mr Montepeque had decided to leave the agency at the end of the year.“Platts is making an organisational change within our markets reporting group . . . at this time, we see many of the functions aligning with those of our existing commodity sector heads and our new chief of content,” the company said.Last week, Platts named Martin Fraenkel, the former global head of energy at exchange operator CME Group, as its new chief content officer with a brief to develop “strategies for price assessments and analysis.The market-on-close system was introduced by Platts in 1992 in Asia, and rolled into Europe in 2002 and the US in 2006.In the window — a tightly controlled 30-minute period at the end of the day — authorised companies electronically submit bids and offers to Platts reporters. If those bids are met, a company has to trade. Platts is free to publish all data.The system has faced increasing scrutiny since the global financial crisis due to concerns over the small number of deals sometimes used to establish benchmark prices that may underpin billions of dollars of oil contracts.Attention on financial benchmarks has increased since the Libor scandal, spilling from the banking sector into the oil market.Two years ago Europe’s leading antitrust authority visited the offices of Platts as well as oil majors Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Statoil in an investigation into the setting of oil prices — the latest probe into global benchmark rates.The European Commission said the May 2015 raids had taken place over concerns that “companies may have colluded in reporting distorted prices to a price reporting agency to manipulate the published prices”.However, supporters of the assessments say the Platts window has brought a degree of clarity and certainty to a previously opaque market. Many of the products priced by Platts are relatively niche, including petrochemicals and different diesel specifications for various regions.“Platts and the marketplace have benefited from Jorge’s insights and commitment to transparency within the energy and commodity markets. Transparency and the development of market-focused methodologies remain cornerstones of Platts’ price reporting and our commitment to those is unchanged,” the agency said.As a quasi-industry regulator, Mr Montepeque has clashed many times with large oil companies and traders. The company has often penalised companies for misbehaviour, banning them from the process, something known in the industry as “boxing”. Oil traders complain they cannot appeal against “boxing” as Platts is judge and jury.In the months before the financial crisis, Platts barred both Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley from trading contracts on its system because of concerns about creditworthiness. Mr Montepeque also clashed with Shell and BP about what was the best way to establish the price of North Sea Brent, the international benchmark used to price around two-thirds of all oil deals
163;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-05-06T03:41:34Z;Two traders charged with “spoofing”;US future regulator moves quickly in contrast to tardier investigation into UK-based trader;Two traders in the United Arab Emirates have been charged with “ spoofing” the New York gold and silver market after an unusually quick investigation by the US futures regulator.In increments of seconds, Heet Khara and Nasim Salim profited by tricking other market participants with orders they did not intend to execute, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleged in a civil complaint filed in a Manhattan federal court late Tuesday.The new charges of disruptive trading come as the CFTC and CME Group, the Chicago-based exchange operator and self-regulatory organisation, are under scrutiny over alleged spoofing by a UK-based trader whose massive numbers of cancelled orders allegedly contributed to the stock market “flash crash” that took place five years years ago.The UK-based trader, Navinder Singh Sarao, is fighting extradition to the US, where he was hit with criminal charges of manipulating stock index futures. CME was taken to task for allowing him to continue for years despite red flags.By contrast, both CME and and CFTC moved with alacrity against Messrs Khara and Salim. Both men were suspended from CME after a period of trading that ended last week. CFTC, which normally takes years to investigate possible violations, cited the “potential for dissipation of defendants’ assets” when it filed the case and sought to freeze their assets.The government watchdog also thanked CME for its assistance.Aitan Goelman, CFTC enforcement director, said: “Today’s actions make clear that the CFTC will partner with self-regulatory organisations to find and swiftly prosecute those who engage in such disruptive trading practices, wherever they may be.”Messrs Khara and Salim could not be reached for comment.The trading at issue began in February. CFTC said that Mr Khara entered orders for gold and silver contracts on CME’s Comex metals exchange in New York that he did not intend to execute – an action known as spoofing.Within a span of about 11 seconds on early February 18, Mr Khara placed 212 offers to sell silver at prices between $16.490 and $16.465 per ounce, CFTC said. When this drove prices down to the level of smaller purchase orders he had placed, he cancelled all 212 of the offers to sell, CFTC said.CME informed Mr Khara it was investigating his conduct, CFTC said. By February 25, Mr Khara’s futures broker had suspended his electronic trading access over concerns he was spoofing, the complaint said.Mr Khara then opened an account at a new broker, identified as a Comex clearing firm where Mr Salim already had an account. There the men “engaged in similar trading practices in a coordinated fashion,” as recently as April 28 when they entered and cancelled gold futures orders that caused other traders to fill Mr Salim’s orders, CFTC said.CME suspended the traders last Thursday. On Friday, CME was contacted by a representative of the second broker who said Mr Khara had sent an email falsely suggesting that CME had authorised a return of his funds, CFTC said.As screens supplant trading floors, CME has touted the globalisation of its customer base. More than 25 per cent of electronic volume in metals is from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, it said last week.
164;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-05-03T13:48:58Z;Nasdaq tempts energy traders with extended fee holiday;Exchange launches aggressive challenge to win share from rivals CME and ICE;Nasdaq is planning an extended fee holiday to tempt traders to its new energy market, mounting an aggressive challenge to the two reigning oil and gas futures exchanges.The upstart Nasdaq Futures exchange plans to launch 28 energy contracts at midyear as it diversifies beyond stock trading. Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, has argued energy markets are a “monopoly” dominated by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange.“The exchange will assess no transaction fees for energy products to any market participant during the initial nine months,” Nasdaq disclosed in a regulatory filing. Options Clearing Corporation of Chicago, which will settle the trades, will also suspend clearing fees for nine months, the filing said.According to FIA, the futures industry association, 1.16bn energy futures and options contracts were traded worldwide last year. CME and ICE together generated about $1.2bn in energy revenue last year.Nasdaq’s efforts illustrate the difficulty of grabbing market share from established futures exchanges. Traders tend to flock to the deepest markets where they can enter and exit without moving prices. CME and ICE also require contracts executed on their exchanges to be processed at their own clearinghouses, inhibiting movement across venues.CME and ICE are locked in a battle already in the energy market, both listing identical contracts such as Brent crude, Henry Hub natural gas and gasoline.Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said of Nasdaq’s venture: “It’s got an uphill battle. You have two strong incumbents in one of the few highly competitive product lines in futures.”A top CME executive told analysts last week he was “absolutely, acutely concerned” about the threat from Nasdaq. But Derek Sammann, CME’s global head of commodities and options, added that Nasdaq was moving into a sector “with two very robust, competitive, dynamic market participants already”. ICE declined to comment.Nasdaq will also pay a stipend to market makers committed to buy and sell energy futures above certain volumes, according to another filing. Exchanges commonly use incentives, such as volume-based rebates, to attract market participants.Energy futures tend to generate higher fees for exchanges than financial futures tracking interest rates and stock indices. The collapse of oil prices in the past year has also spurred airlines, energy companies and hedge funds to add positions. Open interest in ICE’s Brent listing last month topped 2m contracts.When Nasdaq announced its energy futures market in March, Mr Greifeld said he would halve costs for traders. More than a dozen brokers, proprietary trading firms and physical commodity traders including Goldman Sachs and Virtu Financial have signed on to support the exchange.“We certainly believe monopolies are against the natural order of competitive forces,” Mr Greifeld said in March.This article has been amended to correct the spelling of the surname of Derek Sammann.
165;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME suspends two gold futures traders;Pair face manipulative trading allegations similar to those against Sarao;US futures exchange CME Group has suspended two traders based in the Middle East that it says colluded to use manipulative trading strategies similar to those alleged against a UK trader last week.In a disciplinary notice issued late on Thursday, the Chicago exchange alleged that Heet Khara and Nasim Salim had been placing orders on its gold futures markets this year with no intention of trading. The two are based in the United Arab Emirates, according to a person close to the exchange.The two traders knew each other and “on multiple occasions co-ordinated efforts to engage in disruptive activity”, the CME alleged.This activity, known as layering, shot to worldwide attention last week following the arrest by the US Department of Justice of UK-based Navinder Singh Sarao for alleged market manipulation. Mr Sarao has been accused of using layering, and another technique called spoofing, over a four-year period.The CME came under scrutiny when it emerged that it had identified a high volume of cancelled orders by Mr Sarao as far back as 2009.Although the exchange was aware of Mr Sarao, who has since been charged with contributing to the 2010 “ flash crash”, it took no action against him in that period.The actions of Mr Khara and Mr Salim began in February and continued until last week, the CME claimed.It alleged that between March and April 28, Mr Salim repeatedly entered orders or layered multiple orders for gold and silver futures contracts without the intent to trade.“Salim entered these orders or layered multiple orders to encourage market participants to trade opposite his smaller orders resting on the opposite side of the book,” the exchange said in a notice.After receiving a fill on his orders, he would then cancel the resting order — an order that sits on the trading book — or the layered multiple orders he had entered on the opposite side of the order book, it said.In an example from April 28, Mr Salim entered small-lot orders on one side of the market in gold futures, after which Mr Khara entered large orders on the opposite side, CME said. When Mr Salim’s small orders were filled, Mr Khara cancelled the large orders, it added.The two traders have been denied access to all CME Group markets for 60 days from April 30, the exchange said.Mr Salim and Mr Khara could not be reached for comment. CME said Mr Salim has not responded to correspondence from the exchange. CME in London said it does not comment on disciplinary actions.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York
166;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:23:53+0000;Exchanges need to balance policing and profitability;The Sarao case highlights problems facing US organisations;Ordinarily, market abuse and manipulation cases take forever.More than five years after UK watchdogs dramatically raided Moore Capital, Deutsche Bank and a series of other London companies, most of the people who were charged following the insider dealing probe have yet to stand trial. Similarly, global investigations of the Libor scandal are still ticking on more than six years after the first information requests were sent out.But, this week, the CME futures exchange may well have set a record for investigative speed. Traders Heet Khara and Nasim Salim were suspended for 60 days for allegedly colluding to move gold futures prices by placing and cancelling huge numbers of orders — an illegal technique known as “layering”. The pair had allegedly misbehaved right up until April 28, just two days before the suspension was imposed.The CME’s rapid response comes at a time when it is under fire for its role in the case of Navinder Singh Sarao, the British trader accused by US prosecutors of contributing to the 2010 flash crash that sent American markets sharply down for 20 minutes.According to the criminal complaint, the CME knew as early as 2009 that Mr Sarao, who is fighting extradition to the US, was placing and cancelling lots of orders. But the exchange appears to have taken no action beyond sending a complaining letter, which happened to arrive on the day of the flash crash. Mr Sarao later emailed his broker that he had called the CME and “told ’em to kiss my ass”, the complaint said.The arrest of Navinder Singh Sarao raises fresh concerns about market regulationFull storyThe Sarao case highlights the potential problems with the current US system of relying on “self-regulatory organisations”, including the exchanges, to do much of the frontline policing of markets. They are supposed to make sure traders abide by the rules and refer serious misbehaviour on to government regulators.This system may have worked when exchanges were owned by their members, but now that they have to generate profits for shareholders, conflicts have emerged. A market that cracks down too hard or too quickly could drive away paying customers. The CME controls the futures market allegedly used by Mr Sarao, but the temptation to go soft could be far greater in areas where trading venues compete.A second problem with the new order was also highlighted this week when shareholder.com, a Nasdaq unit that manages investor relations for public companies, inadvertently released Twitter’s quarterly results early. Though the information was posted on Twitter’s website for just 45 seconds on Wednesday, an independent data gathering company called Selerity found it and put the information on, you guessed it, Twitter.The CME appears to have taken no action [over Navinder Sarao] beyond sending a complaining letter, which happened to arrive on the day of the flash crash. Mr Sarao later emailed his broker that he had called the CME and ‘told ’em to kiss my ass’It showed that the social media platform had missed revenue expectations, so Twitter’s share price tanked. Investors who were trading the shares at the time will want a thorough investigation into what went wrong, and whether anyone profited improperly. In this case, Twitter is listed on the NYSE and the high-profile snafu has caught the attention of federal regulators. But what if the company and the share price fall had been smaller and listed on Nasdaq?JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon often argues that exchanges and other central counterparties are the next big risk to financial stability. That’s definitely the pot calling the kettle black. But the pervasive and sometimes conflicted roles played by the various exchanges deserve greater scrutiny.brooke.masters@ft.com

The asset was coveted by CME Group, the US’s largest futures exchange by market capitalisation, but shareholders backed a rival offer by BGC to buy GFI earlier this year.“It’s a great product and has a great position in the marketplace. From the beginning [of bidding for GFI], we never felt that Trayport got the attention and valuation it deserved,” Howard Lutnick, chief executive of BGC told FT Trading Room.“We’ve been approached by multiple parties. Sometimes one makes a sad decision. I haven’t as of yet been able to get the market to look inside and understand the company to increase shareholder value. I hope this will create attention and create interest.”BGC paid $6.10-per-share to take a controlling stake in GFI, valuing GFI equity at around $780m. The financial advisers for GFI last year had put a prospective valuation range of between $650m and $728m for the unit.The asset is widely used by traders, brokers, utilities and resource companies to conduct voice and electronic trading and clearing of gas, coal, power and emissions in over-the-counter markets in Europe.Mr Lutnick also confirmed that BGC would retain Fenics, the risk analytics business that the CME also attempted to buy last summer. “We will still keep it. Fenics has growth whose time has yet to come.”BGC also confirmed it expected to cut costs of $50m by the end of March 2016 from the GFI deal by stripping out duplication of telecom lines, data centre costs, software suppliers and interest expenses.The article has been amended to clarify that BGC will cut $50m of costs in the first year of ownership of GFI
168;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-04-28T18:19:42Z;Centralised risk raises systemic worries over derivatives;Clarity needed on liquidity and clearing models;Six years after the financial crisis exposed the systemic dangers of derivatives, the industry faces questions as to whether risk management systems will contain the next major bout of market turmoil.On Tuesday FIA Global, the futures industry trade association, will add its voice to a growing debate about the role of clearing houses, the centralised risk managers charged with bolstering market stability. FIA will call for greater transparency and disclosure from clearers for banks and broker-dealers to help identify credit and operational risks.This comes after regulators put pressure on the global market since 2009 to push more swap trades into clearing houses, entities that stand between investors and banks, tasked with ensuring a deal is completed should one side default.However, uneasiness pervades this fundamental market shift, with some worried that global regulations have not created a resilient framework that could function in the event of a major financial institution failing. While the risk associated with derivative trades is being collected in one place, via clearing houses, the potential for systemic pressure, however remains in place.The Bank of England, for one, has expressed concerns that clearing houses are being asked to take on risk management for market liquidity, when they were built for managing counterparty credit risk.“It’s largely the reshuffling of risk — it’s not gone away,” says Craig Pirrong, an academic at the University of Houston in the US. “Regulators have not taken a truly systemic approach to analysing risk.”Market participants say that clearing houses’ differing and opaque risk models mean risks cannot be consistently compared. Chief among them is that clearing houses’ risk models are “procyclical” — meaning they require more margin for derivatives portfolios during times of market stress, which is also the most difficult time for traders to find more stable liquid assets.Neither regulators nor market participants want a replay of Lehman Brothers, whose failure in 2008 exposed a huge interlinked world of trades across the market and thus threatened other institutions.But now the majority of the world’s derivatives trades will be handled by just four clearing houses, owned by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange of the US, Germany’s Deutsche Börse and LCH.Clearnet, controlled by the London Stock Exchange Group.To insulate themselves against the next financial meltdown, two issues persistently dominate industry debate — greater financial participation by clearing houses and more transparency in their risk management models.Dennis McLaughlin, chief risk officer at LCH.Clearnet, the world’s largest swaps clearer, says customers worry: “What if Lehman happened again tomorrow?”He adds: “Customers want to know two things: how safe is my money in the default fund, and are you going to ask me for any more?”Users of clearing houses are “members” who contribute to a mutual default fund and are prepared to share losses. The clearing house also contributes to the fund — so-called “skin in the game” — but it grows increasingly expensive for large users. JPMorgan and Citigroup are leading the calls for more direct contributions, although it has been strongly resisted by CME, LCH and Eurex.“Clearing house skin in the game is generally a negligible percentage of the overall default fund,” says Mariam Rafi, US head of OTC clearing at Citi. “However clearing houses are for-profit entities. They decide the risk model, they determine what new products are going into the clearing houses. It brings up the question of misalignment of incentives.”Behind the FIA’s warning is a nagging fear of another Hanmag Securities. The South Korean futures broker went bankrupt in late 2013 when an errant algorithm racked up nearly $45m in losses in just 143 seconds. The local clearing house, KRX, dumped the losses on other users.Regulators are beginning to address concerns. Next year the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organization of Securities Commissions will require clearing houses to publish their models for calculating their users’ risk, in the hope it will assuage customers’ worries.“The bankers should be reassured as to the risk modelling when the quantitative disclosures are introduced. They’re going to go from a black box to southern French nudist colony,” says Thomas Krantz, senior adviser, capital markets at Thomas Murray, a markets consultancy.He, like the FIA and others, warns of the need for more vigilance. Banks and brokers are also calling for standardised stress tests, so they can compare the risks. CPMI-Iosco has promised a review, but it has only started a new debate as to which model would be deep and transparent enough to give users reassurance, without publicising sensitive market positions.Still, others worry that about a homogenised market in which the majority of derivatives trades are among a handful of clearing houses all using similar risk models, and deciding which instruments are introduced into the mutual default fund.“It’s never going to be an easy mix when you take an interbank market and stick it into capital markets,” says Mr Krantz.www.ft.com/tradingroom
169;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:34:32+0000;CME faces scrutiny over warning signs on ‘flash crash trader’;‘Spoofing’ charges against a UK trader turn spotlight on self-regulatory organisations once again;As far back as 2009, CME Group identified a high volume of cancelled orders by the UK trader charged this week with contributing to the 2010 “flash crash”. Now the operator of the largest US futures market is under scrutiny for letting his conduct continue into 2014.A criminal complaint unsealed this week offered limited details of CME’s communication with Navinder Singh Sarao, the UK citizen accused of manipulating the S&P 500 futures contract known as the E-mini, and his broker.Authorities allege Mr Sarao, who is fighting extradition to the US after his arrest, made $40m in profits from the illegal trading, sending out orders that were quickly cancelled to benefit other trading positions. This “spoofing” continued from June 2009 until April 2014, authorities say.CME sent a warning to Mr Sarao on May 6 2010, the day of the sudden plunge in US shares, saying that all pre-opening orders were “expected to be entered in good faith for the purpose of executing bona fide transaction”. CME had twice before raised concerns about the high volume of his cancelled orders.Mr Sarao emailed his broker two weeks later, on May 25, stating he had “just called” CME and “told ’em to kiss my ass”, according to the complaint.How Mr Sarao was allowed to continue trading despite raising red flags at CME has drawn criticism about its oversight.Self-regulatory organisations such as CME have dual roles. They profit from the volume of trading on their exchanges, but are also tasked with ensuring that traders abide by the rules.“It’s very, very difficult when you’re looking at that massive volume of data to catch someone where there is no indication of anything unusual or untoward. But that’s not the case with this guy. It’s flashing red lights around this guy,” said Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a non-profit group that promotes the public interest in financial markets.“What I do think is critically important is how he was not shut down years ago by the SRO responsible for surveillance,” said David Lauer, president of Kor Group, a market structure consultancy. “Someone should be watching the futures markets who is incentivised to police them.”CME on Wednesday declined to comment on Mr Sarao’s trading but said “the flash crash was not caused by the futures market”. It added that it looked forward to reviewing any new information with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the lead US derivatives regulator.When CME expressly banned spoofing last year, it noted that it had been cracking down on cancelled orders since 2002 using a previous regulation, Rule 432, which encompassed the practice without naming it.In the previous three years, it said, CME exchanges had brought more than 40 disciplinary actions under Rule 432 for “spoofing, misleading, or intentionally/recklessly disruptive” trading.Still, some traders complain, CME tends to impose small fines for minor infractions while ignoring patterns such as Mr Sarao’s cancelled orders, which CME does not appear to have referred to the CFTC. People familiar with the investigation say the CFTC did not begin investigating Mr Sarao until at least late 2013, possibly later.The lawyer representing a whistleblower said his client had given hundreds of hours of analysis on the trades to the CFTC, which, he said, kicked the investigation into high gear. He declined to say when the referral was made but said the CFTC referred the matter to the Department of Justice months later.The CFTC had no immediate comment.The conflict of interest at SROs has long been in focus. The NYSE was criticised for not aggressively policing specialist firms trading stocks on its floor a decade ago. Recently the Securities and Exchange Commission has fined several exchange operators for failing to enforce their own rules.CME has faced particular scrutiny since the flash crash. It was questioned over its oversight of MF Global, the futures commission merchant that filed for bankruptcy in 2011. It is also opposing a transaction tax on the industry, saying it could drive traders to other markets.But this latest case underscores the questions over how seriously it takes its regulatory role. Mr Sarao appeared on CME surveillance teams’ screens in at least March 2009. Then, the CME contacted him about orders he had cancelled before the markets opened, according to the criminal complaint. CME alerted his broker a year later with similar concerns.CME told the broker Mr Sarao “just had 1613 ‘This order is not in the book’ reject messages in the last 5 minutes”, according to the complaint. The broker forwarded the email to Mr Sarao stating the conduct was “not allowed”.Mr Sarao emailed his broker and the CME on March 31 2010 saying he wanted to “apologise for any inconvenience” and that he was “showing a friend of mine what occurs on the bid side of the market”.According to Better Markets’ Mr Kelleher, CME should have demanded a more satisfactory explanation. “It seems they think their duty begins and ends with sending a letter.”

China’s exports slumped 15 per cent in March, raising the prospect of disappointing first-quarter economic growth.The market capitalisation of Hong Kong-listed shares set a new record on Monday, passing the HK$30tn mark for the first time to close at HK$30.55tn. The Hong Kong share market has risen 17.6 per cent in the past month, making it the best performer in the world this year outside the Chinese mainland.The surge in valuations comes as investors, wary of increasingly frothy valuations in Shanghai and Shenzhen, switch into lower priced Hong Kong stocks. A move by the Chinese authorities to give mutual funds access to the Hong Kong market via Stock Connect has also boosted share volumes in the territory.As a result, a host of companies now eclipse their global rivals. CCB, China’s second largest lender by assets, has risen by a fifth in the past month, giving it a market capitalisation of US$248bn. It is now the 15th biggest company on the FTSE All World index, and the third ranked bank after local rival ICBC and US-based Wells Fargo.Other price changes have been equally impressive. Online games maker Tencent — up 27 per cent over the past month — is now larger than Amazon, Oracle, and Samsung Electronics, while Air China has a bigger market cap than Singapore Air and Cathay Pacific combined, following a 42 per cent rise.Citic Securities, China’s leadering brokerage, has gained 45 per cent over the past month. At $61bn, it now has a significantly larger market cap than either Blackstone or Credit Suisse. China Merchants Bank rose by 25 per cent on Monday alone, putting it ahead of Barclays, Mitsubishi UFJ, and Royal Bank of Canada, with a market cap of $91bn.The arrival of billions of dollars from mainland China has triggered a 65 per cent appreciation in the share price of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, valuing the operator at $44bn, comfortably above global rivals.The HKEx has now displaced the US’s CME Group, with a market capitalisation of $31bn, from its long-held position as the world’s largest exchanges operator in the past month.The Hong Kong bourse also outstrips fellow US derivatives exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange which owns the New York Stock Exchange and has a market valuation of $25bn. The London Stock Exchange Group is worth $13bn and Deutsche Börse $16bn (see chart below).The increase in activity has raised expectations for the earnings performance of HKEx and the Hang Seng index is now up 12 per cent since the start of the month, a rally that shows little sign of ending.Hong Kong’s benchmark index closed above 28,000 points for the first time since 2007 on Monday. At that time, China’s GDP growth had hit 14.2 per cent, whereas currently, data set for release on Wednesday are due to show GDP growth of 7 per cent for the fourth quarter of last yearSuch has been its success in recent weeks that HKEx executives are already talking about boosting the daily quota to allow more Chinese money to flow in.Illustrating the importance of China to its business, HKEx also said on Monday it had established a new corporate unit devoted to trading with the mainland.
171;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-03-25T11:30:58Z;CME urges tougher US response to EU clearing dispute;Chicago derivatives exchange suggests restricting European access;The head of the US’s largest derivatives exchanges has suggested European clearing houses be restricted from US markets, if a long-running regulatory spat between the world’s two main regions for derivatives trading is not resolved soon.Terry Duffy, executive chairman of CME Group, will tell an agriculture committee of the US House of Representatives on Wednesday that equivalent recognition of US clearing houses by European regulators is “the one overriding issue” facing the country’s derivatives markets.He will argue that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the main US derivatives regulator, should be more forceful in ending a year-long stand-off with its counterpart, the European Commission.“Currently, foreign boards of trade and clearing houses have full access to US markets,” he said in written testimony released late on Tuesday. “The CFTC has many tools at its disposal to restrict this access if forced to do so. I hope this does not prove necessary, but all options must be considered,” he added.The sometimes fractious dispute between the US and Europe has highlighted a faultline as each responds to new G20 rules that forced more over-the-counter derivatives trading through clearing houses. These entities stand between two parties in a deal and guarantee the trade stands in the event of a default and are at the forefront of post-financial crisis reforms for stabilising markets.The European Commission has yet to recognise the US as having rules “equivalent” to those for clearing houses in the EU, in part as Brussels sees the standards for margin— the funds investors post to clearing houses to back their trades — as favouring US markets.For European banks and hedge funds, the non-recognition of US clearing houses could mean applying onerous capital charges to their trades. That would particularly hurt the CME, as many banks rely on its flagship eurodollar interest futures contracts to hedge their risks. The CME has estimated that banks and hedge funds may be forced to apply a risk-weighted capital charge in excess of 30 times current levels for some deals.Mr Duffy said “time was running out” for a solution, a reference to a mid-June deadline for the EU to recognise the US. However it has already been pushed back twice and European officials have said they could extend it.However Ben Jackson, chief operating officer of ICE Futures US, said such regulatory conflicts were the exception, rather than the norm, before the financial crisis because oversight was based on a common set of principles.“The CFTC relied on foreign regulators to regulate foreign transactions and worked with regulators to adopt common principles that all regulated markets should adopt. Likewise, European regulators took a similar approach to U.S. markets. This approach was very successful, as it led to greater harmonization of regulation, yet allowed foreign regulators to oversee their institutions. We strongly encourage a return to this approach,” he said.The US committee is holding a two-day meeting to discuss the reauthorisation of the CFTC, which lapsed in September 2013. Clearing is one of a series of swaps markets regulations enshrined in the 2010 Dodd-Frank act to reform Wall Street have aroused contention and a growing political backlash from some Republicans on Washington.
172;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-03-23T09:49:52Z;CME and ICE to go head to head with new cocoa contracts;Market players say Big Chocolate will ultimately decide;Let the cocoa wars begin. On March 30, rival exchanges — the CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange — will go head to head in the cocoa futures market as they both launch their new euro denominated contracts.The winner will be responsible for one of the key commodity benchmarks, which affects the price of the chocolate bar as well as the incomes for millions of smallholder cocoa farmers.With almost 70 per cent of the world’s cocoa used by the $150bn chocolate industry coming from west Africa, cocoa is subject to high levels of volatility. This raises hedging needs as well as trading opportunities in the futures market.One large cocoa trader says it will ultimately be the big chocolate makers such as Nestlé, Mondelez and Mars at the end of the cocoa supply chain that decide the winner of the euro contracts.Cocoa, which is a relatively niche commodity compared with other agricultural contracts such as corn or soyabean, is already traded in two futures markets. In 2013, ICE, which operates the New York cocoa contract, took over NYSE Liffe, owner of the London cocoa futures, ending up with both products.But CME will introduce a new physically delivered euro cocoa contract — and another in dollars, which is settled in cash — while ICE, keen to protect its market position, is to also introduce a euro contract.The CME’s move is its first into physically settled “soft” commodities, which include coffee and sugar. If the launch is a success it would pave the way for the exchange to break ICE’s stranglehold on those markets.Jeffry Kuijpers, CME’s executive director of agricultural commodities, says the exchange had been in discussions with market participants, such as cocoa processors and chocolate makers, over the past 18 months.“The driver of the new contract is to fix the issues that affect the cocoa market,” he says.Users of the existing London sterling contract have been concerned about the lack of competition to ICE. They have also been frustrated over the queues in the physical warehouses, a situation that has dogged the metals markets, says the CME. The existing contract also represents bagged cocoa rather than loose lower grade cocoa, which comprises 65-70 per cent of the commodity traded in Europe.The CME’s new physically delivered contract will have an innovative prepayment of “delivery-out” charges, meaning the seller pays the costs when the cocoa is taken out of the warehouse, unlike in many other commodities where the buyer has to pay the fees.The CME contract will also have a 21-day load-out limit, compared with ICE’s 60-day limit, which was introduced last April. It will be priced against bulk cocoa and there will be a new grading process for the beans to guard against quality deterioration in the warehouse.A euro contract will also make trading easier for the big European chocolate makers, and many of the African producers whose currencies are linked to the euro, says Mr Kuijpers.ICE, meanwhile, says it has brought in changes to the existing contract since it took over Liffe, introducing new warehousing rules and building relationships with its contract users through “product committees” — something that large users also acknowledge.“We’ve made a concerted effort to spend time with the product committee and made significant changes in a very short period of time based on their feedback,” says Ben Jackson, chief operating officer of ICE Futures US.I am not looking forward to next week. The big fear is that there will be less trading due to the uncertaintyWith the new contracts coming into the market on top of the existing two, some are concerned about the impact on overall trading.Jonathan Parkman, co-head of agriculture at commodity brokers Marex Spectron, says: “I am not looking forward to next week. The big fear is that there will be less trading due to the uncertainty.”There have been plenty of new commodities contracts that have been launched only to fall by the wayside, the latest being the new Paris-based milling wheat contract introduced by Euronext this month.The CME acknowledges the difficulty in trying to change established habits, and has introduced an incentive scheme for users who commit to trading the new contract. Eight users and five market makers have signed up for the programme, where they will be offered incentives including fee discounts.“We have 13 companies who have a vested interest in making this contract work,” says Mr Kuijpers.Nevertheless, it is the big chocolate makers who are likely to dictate which contract comes out on top.“The critical mass will only come when chocolate companies show their support by referencing their prices against the new contracts,” says one cocoa trader, adding that he would not move his hedges on the existing ICE contract unless his customers demand a price against a new euro contract.Some market participants predict that the size of the cocoa market will mean here will probably be enough liquidity for two contracts — one in euros and another in dollars. Many expect the existing sterling contract eventually to cease trading.The big question is whether the new CME contract is attractive enough to take trading away from the incumbent operator ICE.Says Mr Parkman: ”Every dog has its own fleas. There’s no such thing as a perfect contract.”
173;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-03-20T09:44:54Z;ETFs pour into top US oil contract;Nearly a third of WTI futures owned by exchange traded funds;Almost a third of the most active US oil futures contract is now controlled by exchange traded funds, turning smaller investors into a muscular force on global commodities markets.ETFs track baskets of securities or commodities in a convenient wrapper that trades on a stock exchange. Money has flooded into funds tracking West Texas Intermediate crude this year as investors try to pick a bottom. The benchmark was $45.75 a barrel on Friday, less than half the price of a year ago.Analysts at ETF Securities said oil ETFs now hold between 175m-180m barrels equivalent of WTI for delivery in May, the most active futures contract. This is about 30 per cent of combined open interest in May WTI on the New York Mercantile Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange, the main energy futures bourses.The funds’ new heft in the global oil market is “attracting more and more attention” from professional oil traders, said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix, a Swiss-based consultancy. After oil staged a modest rally earlier this month, Goldman Sachs argued that “the key force pushing commodity markets higher has been retail investor inflows into oil ETFs”.Investors this year have pumped more than $2bn into the US Oil Fund, the largest oil ETF, bringing assets to $3.1bn. The fund now owns contracts for 64m barrels of WTI, a 10-fold increase from a year ago.Only a fifth of the fund’s shares are held short, or as bets on a decline, suggesting the “bulk of USO investors are either long or have some sort of complicated trade or hedge”, said John Hyland, the fund’s chief investment officer.Oil ETFs are not limited to retail: among the investors with a large recent position in the US Oil Fund was Kynikos Associates, the hedge fund founded by Jim Chanos, according to a filing.Investors buying and holding an oil ETF have the odds stacked against them. This is because WTI prices slope upward for future delivery dates, meaning the funds can afford fewer barrels of oil each time they sell an expiring month’s contract and buy a new one. Goldman Sachs warned that “any upside to price returns is being significantly eroded by losses on roll yields”.Oil ETFs last ballooned in early 2009 as crude prices bottomed out during the financial crisis. While the spot price of WTI more than doubled that year, the US Oil Fund rose only 50 per cent because the upward sloping price pattern, known as contango, ate into returns.“Contango is deadly. If you’re going to own one of these things that’s susceptible to contango you’ve got to be a trader,” not a long-term investor, said Herb Morgan of Efficient Market Advisors, a US money manager specialising in ETFs.The boom in oil ETFs has also boosted participation numbers on futures exchanges. The number of outstanding May 2015 WTI contracts on Nymex is 53 per cent higher than open interest in the May 2014 contract a year ago.

A 2013 CFTC lawsuit against the New York Mercantile Exchange, a unit of CME Group, over leaks of secret customer trading information is being litigated in federal court.Between October 2012 and at least May 2014, the ICE futures exchange in New York submitted trading reports containing “thousands of errors and omissions” to the CFTC, the agency said in the order, which was approved on Monday. These mistakes included missing daily reports on ICE’s energy markets and incorrect prices in futures contracts including coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton, orange juice, and the US dollar index. Natural gas settlement prices in October and November 2012 were reported at 1,000 times their real value, CFTC said.When the commission staff first notified ICE in 2012 about the errors and omissions, the exchange responded that the problems would be fixed with a conversion to a new data-reporting format. But many problems persisted into 2014, CFTC said.Aitan Goelman, CFTC enforcement director, said: “Today’s action makes clear that registrants who fail to meet their reporting obligations will be held accountable and that the CFTC takes a particularly dim view of reporting violations that continue over many months, especially after CFTC staff has repeatedly alerted the registrant in question to the problems in its reporting.”ICE, which neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, declined to comment.The violations began just after ICE moved its large over-the-counter energy swap derivatives market on to its regulated US futures exchange in a pioneering move towards what is now known as “ futurisation”, the order said. Other OTC swaps derivatives contracts have since been converted to futures, helping traders escape the burdens that come with trading swaps under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.The CFTC order is a black eye for ICE, known as a technological innovator in the exchange industry. The order also requires ICE to create a chief data officer and hire three additional quality assurance staff dedicated to regulatory reporting.The CFTC case against Nymex has entered a court-ordered mediation programme for settlement purposes ahead a trial scheduled later this year.

We could go to encryption, which takes time and capacity. So the idea that this is going to get faster, faster, faster and more and more open — because of ‘cyber’, the pendulum is going to have to go the other way,” he said. “The industry is going to have to follow that lead and get used to this.”The comments come as hacking metastasises into a more serious problem for large companies and exchange operators. CME Group, a rival futures exchange to ICE, disclosed it was hacked in 2013. US authorities have been investigating cyber attacks against American financial institutions, and Sony Pictures suffered a damaging hack, allegedly at the hands of North Korea.The idea that this is going to get faster, faster, faster and more and more open — because of ‘cyber’ the pendulum is going to have to go the other wayTim Massad, chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told the FIA conference cyber security was “perhaps the single most important new risk to market integrity and financial stability”, even as the regulator reviews the effects of automated trading strategies.Exchange executives outlined how they had tried to keep up with the main cyber threats, which Richard Clarke, the former White House security adviser, coined as CHEW — crime, hacktivists, espionage and war. Andreas Preuss, chief executive of Eurex, the derivatives exchange of Deutsche Börse, said that if exchanges did not work together to get cyber attacks under control they would pose “big systemic risks”.Mr Sprecher said ICE’s 2013 purchase of NYSE — whose colonnaded building is perhaps the ultimate symbol of capitalism — made the company “a much more front and centre target”.He added that ICE board’s risk committee used to be primarily preoccupied with financial risks to its clearing houses, which serve as a crucial backstop for derivatives trades. Now, “the bigger risk to the company is more likely a cyber attack. So when the risk committee meets, they still deal with economic risk, but it’s increasingly about cyber risk,” he said.
176;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:34:32+0000;Nasdaq looks to halve energy trading cost;Stock market operator plans low cost futures exchange;Nasdaq plans to halve the cost of trading energy with the launch of a new, low-cost futures exchange that executives believe will challenge the current dominance wielded by the CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange.The US exchange group, best known as a stock market operator, took aim at what it called a “monopoly” as it formally announced the launch of Nasdaq Futures, a commodity market that will list contracts in oil, natural gas and US power.Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, explained his view of the commodities market with a joke about Hillary Clinton, who is facing intense scrutiny over her personal email exchanges while serving as US secretary of state.“What do CME, ICE and Hillary Clinton all have in common?” he said at the annual Futures Industry Association conference. “They all think they have a monopoly on their exchanges. We’re here to disabuse people of that notion.”Energy futures are a rare market where competition does exist, albeit between two behemoths. CME and ICE battle over market share in oil and gas, with CME offering free trading in Brent crude, the global benchmark. However, energy is a lucrative business for futures exchanges. CME’s average rate per contract in energy is $1.272, compared with $0.711 for equity indices and $0.474 for interest rates.Volumes in oil are also picking up as big price swings return. CME reported record daily energy volume in February, including all-time high volume in its flagship West Texas Intermediate crude contract. Energy volumes on Intercontinental Exchange also rose in February from a year before, including a 61 per cent increase in volumes in its Brent crude contract.Energy futures are a rare market where competition does exist, albeit between two behemoths. CME and ICE battle over market share in oil and gas, with CME offering free trading in Brent crude, the global benchmarkTrades executed on ICE and CME are sent to clearinghouses owned by each exchange operator, an arrangement known as a “vertical silo”. Clearinghouses act as the buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer on an exchange, spreading the risk of a default across its members.Nasdaq’s trades will be cleared at the Options Clearing Corp of Chicago, which already offers clearing for other exchanges. Mr Greifeld said its “horizontal” clearing model would help deliver a “greater than 50 per cent reduction” in the cost of trading energy. Nasdaq hopes to gain 10 per cent of overall energy volumes, executives said.CME cast doubt on Nasdaq’s strategy, with Phupinder Gill, chief executive, saying it was hard to compete “if your value proposition is simply price”.Nasdaq has been aggressively trying to spread beyond equities trading, where profits have contracted amid tough competition. Previous initiatives include the $750m purchase of eSpeed, a government bond trading platform, and the launch of NLX, an interest rate derivatives platform in Europe. It also has a European power business.Nasdaq said a total of 19 brokers, proprietary trading firms and physical commodity traders had committed to support the exchange, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley as well as Virtu Financial, the proprietary trading firm.The Nasdaq contracts would be “lookalikes”, settling against physically settled energy contracts listed on CME and ICE.
177;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-03-11T15:24:51Z;Clearing houses get insurance policy;Potential ‘too big to fail’ entities gain extra protection;"A consortium of 20 top-rated global insurance companies are underwriting a policy for clearing houses that would limit losses for users of derivatives and possibly taxpayers in the event of market turbulence.The scheme aims to create an extra layer of protection for clearing houses, which have become a critical component of the global derivatives industry since the financial crisis.Clearing houses mutualise the risk between individual buyers and sellers of various derivatives and ensure deals are completed in the event of a default. They are viewed as being the next “too big to fail” entities in the event of a future financial crisis, potentially requiring a bailout from taxpayers.The insurance policy would create liquid securities in a bankruptcy-remote trust, and they could be drawn on immediately. GCSA, a US-based consortium, has been working on the plan for more than a year, and described it as a way to help resolve simmering tensions between market participants and operators that have grown out of new responsibilities for clearing houses.“It’s catastrophic risk that the insurance industry is well adept at providing,” said David Hardy, chairman. “Deploying the willing resources of the global insurance market rather than the finite resources of the members seems the most logical way forward.”The centrality of clearing houses at the heart of the financial system has not only fanned fears that they are a source of future vulnerability. Big customers like JPMorgan and Citigroup are fighting with clearing house operators such as LCH.Clearnet, CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange over how much each side should contribute to a mutual fund for defaults, while large asset managers like Vanguard are worried a failing clearing house could take a slice of the margin they post for their trades.It’s catastrophic risk that the insurance industry is well adept at providingThe issue of funds for clearing houses was among the chief topics at the annual Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton, Florida. Clearers also rely on “assessment powers” that allow them to call on members to stump up additional billions in a crisis — creating large and unquantified liabilities for banks such as JPMorgan and Citigroup.Emily Portney of JPMorgan said the assessment powers at CME’s clearing house totalled $19bn but the clearing house had only $100m of regulatory capital backing it. “Will the assessment layer be there in time or not? Is that enough to align incentives?” she asked. The CME disputed the figures.The GCSA scheme is called CoCo insurance but it is not a contingent convertible. “Ironically it’s about committed certainty of cash,” said Chris Cononico, co-founder. ""It’s a more cost-effective way than using a clearing house’s equity and it’s much better than leveraging up.”None of the insurance companies in the consortium are members of clearing houses and they are capable of offering up to $10bn in protection. Although not a new idea, it has not been tried on such a scale before.Under the intended scheme, the policy is written by the insurance consortium to the clearing house to cover losses if they exceed the monies in the default fund. The claim benefit is then sold by the clearer to a bankruptcy-remote trust via a sale and repurchase, which then issues securities to the clearer. The clearing house can sell the securities into the market immediately for cash. If a claim occurs, the insurers pay the cash amount of the claim and the clearer has no further liability."
178;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Fees: Volume discounts come under scrutiny;;You need volume to get volume. That is a mantra for the executives who run futures exchanges. Some futures contracts, such as those for crude oil and interest rates, change hands hundreds of thousands of times a day. But many others die for lack of trading volume.To ensure a minimum level of activity, exchanges give fee discounts to proprietary trading groups and others willing to buy and sell contracts steadily, especially fledgling ones. These incentive schemes have existed for years but are now drawing scrutiny.The most basic type of incentive ties discounts to volumes, rewarding the largest proprietary trading firms. CME Group, the US futures exchange operator, offers the most active energy traders rebates of $0.45 per contract from the standard $0.55-per-contract member trading fee. Bryan Durkin, CME chief commercial officer, says the goal is “really to provide deep, robust, liquid markets around the clock”.The risk is that incentives attract traders keen only to collect rebates.Proprietary traders are not the only participants with perks. Central banks earn CME incentives to trade financial futures. “Highly passive participants” are encouraged to take positions in metals price spreads. There are also incentives for groups based abroad.Marc Lagesse of Hertshten Group says: “Regulators are extremely strict in making sure that deals are fair, deals are transparent . . . Exchanges can’t just make up a deal as they go along.”A US Commodity Futures Trading Commission official last year noted that the number of market-maker and incentive programmes filed with the regulator had grown sixfold in three years, raising questions about whether they are still necessary.Jonny Aucamp, chief executive of OSTC, a London proprietary trading firm, says: “I think every business in the world subscribes to the relevance of some kind of volume discount.”
179;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Dealmaking saga over GFI nears conclusion;Shareholders vote down deal with CME to support BGC;The six-month saga over interdealer GFI appears all but over but there are many in the market who think the dealmaking is not done yet.Shareholders have voted down the GFI board’s structured deal with CME Group and tendered their support for BGC Partners’ $6.10-per-share offer, which values GFI equity at roughly $780m. Even the GFI board members such as Mickey Gooch, chairman and co-founder, who tried everything they could to direct their deal to the CME, have accepted their fate.The reality is that BGC will become the “largest and most profitable wholesale brokerage company”. Many think CME still has a part to play in this drama.Amid the stories about takeover tactics between interdealer brokers, it got lost that the initial deal involved the break-up of GFI. What CME really wanted, and has been pursuing for more than two years, is Trayport and Fenics, the electronic trading software and risk analytics businesses. A purchase could transform its fledgling European energy trading operations.These assets are the real crown jewels — especially Trayport. It is a software platform but it allows traders, brokers, utilities and resource companies to conduct voice and electronic trading and clearing of gas, coal, power and emissions in over-the-counter markets in Europe. Widely used in the market, it is a perfect fit for new regulations. There really is nothing out there quite like it.There is anecdotal evidence explaining why many people expect CME will own it. Most of the rhetoric from BGC to date has been about the brokerage — cutting IT costs and regulatory capital and increasing productivity per broker. There is very little about a push into electronic markets that dominates conversations with ICAP or Tradition, for example. Electronic may be the future but it also needs constant investment.BGC’s recent record does not suggest it is looking that way either. Deals, such as RP Martin, Smith Mack, Grubb Ellis Newmark and Sterling International Brokers, have all boosted their brokerage business. By contrast, its most high profile electronic trading businesses, eSpeed, was offloaded to Nasdaq 18 months ago for around $1.2bn.Furthermore Terry Duffy, executive chairman, told Reuters in November he believed the assets were available, even if BGC won. Plus, disposing of the units could be a smart financial move for BGC.Also lost in the takeover battle noise was that CME was potentially getting a steal with Trayport and Fenics. The valuation applied to the assets by Greenhill & Co for GFI’s special committee is illuminating.It came up with a prospective range of between $650m and $728m, based on the units making earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $52m for 2014 and an enterprise value/ebitda ratio of 12.5-14 times. That multiple was below the median valuations of 17.6 times it had calculated for similar technology companies, MarketAxess Holdings, Advent Software and UK duo Fidessa Group and First Derivatives. However you look at it, that is most of GFI’s total equity valuation.But Trayport is built for a hybrid OTC market. As Shaun Lynn, president of BGC, noted on Friday: “We also expect . . . to continue converting voice and hybrid broking to more profitable fully electronic trading, all of which should lead to increased revenues, profitability and cash flows.” Why would it be in a hurry to sell, unless it gets an offer it cannot refuse?BGC’s sale of eSpeed to Nasdaq may provide the blueprint. A hybrid market (US Treasuries) went fully electronic and BGC got out as newer and faster participants began to enter the market, which would have affected margins.That led to a hefty outlay for Nasdaq that it has yet to see the full benefit of. Indeed, Nasdaq’s market share fell to 30 per cent at the end of last year. However, if the commodities market stays a more hybrid OTC market, then BGC may hang on to the assets.True, CME was protecting shareholders by aiming to get Trayport for a low price but it was a mistake not to have significantly offered more. It might well pay for it, one way or another.
180;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:34:32+0000;Last shout looms for US option traders;Open outcry is giving way to electronic trading for these derivatives;CME Group is consigning its futures trading floors, once home to thousands of noisy traders, to history. But one section of the floor will shout on: the options pits.The question on the minds of options floor brokers and traders is how long they will last. Electronic trading is gaining ground for these derivatives, which entitle holders to buy or sell shares or futures contracts at a given price by a certain date.Options markets are buoyant overall. At CME, which lists options on markets such as interest rates and grain, options volumes rose 38 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter to a new record.At exchanges that list options on US stocks, stock indices and exchange traded funds, volumes rose 3.4 per cent to 4.3bn contracts in 2014, their second highest level ever, according to a survey from Tabb Group, a capital markets consultancy.Conditions are propitious for options trading as uncertainty grips US interest rate markets and oil prices have plunged, bringing back volatility.Despite this trend, there are some ominous signs for the floor. At CME, half of options are now traded electronically — up from 13 per cent in 2009. At futures markets run by rival Intercontinental Exchange, no options on futures have traded “open outcry” since its New York soft commodities pits closed in 2012.Options can be far more complex to trade than securities or futures, however, which accounts partly for the continued presence of the human trader. Phupinder Gill, CME chief executive, has signalled he is in no hurry to push all trading on to screens, saying the floor is popular for complex options structures.“The integrity of the marketplace is paramount for us,” Mr Gill told analysts. CME estimates the annual cost of running trading floors at around $50m ahead of the futures pit closures.CME’s crosstown peer CBOE Holdings, which operates the largest US options market, says simple retail trades have already gone fully electronic but large and complex orders remain the domain of open outcry. More than 60 per cent of CBOE’s proprietary products — including popular options on the Vix volatility index and the S&P 500 — are traded on the floor.“When our customers say [they] get no value add from bringing that trade on the floor, those pits will close — but we have not seen any of that yetWe have a massive amount of interest in Vix, SPX [S&P 500] and Russell options that really need and require those face-to-face negotiations — the floor from that perspective has many years ahead of it,” says Ed Tilly, chief executive.Still, Mr Tilly says the company is agnostic when it comes to floor trading. “We’ve built our systems so that our customers can view us as 100 per cent screen-based or . . . take orders outside the electronic format,” he says. “When our customers say [they] get no value add from bringing that trade on the floor, those pits will close — but we have not seen any of that yet.”Even so, some argue that the options floor is still likely to go the way of futures as the marketplace becomes global and technology improves.“Options use a lot of complex maths modelling, like Black Scholes. They also trade a lot more complex strategies, like butterfly trades. Some can have trades of up to 10 legs,” says Hazem Dawani, chief executive of OptionsCity, a Chicago-based software company that provides tools for electronic trading. “Previously, you would send the trade to the floor and a specialist would price it for you. Now there is software that can calculate it.”60%Percentage of CBOE’s proprietary products that are still traded on the floorTabb estimated asset managers routed 32 per cent of their total contract volume electronically, more than double the amount the year before. But it acknowledged that hedge funds were keen to maintain voice trading, to keep themselves at the forefront of brokers’ attention.Nik Miczek, managing partner of 312 Capital, has been on the CME floor since 1996 and his firm trades eurodollar and Treasury options in the pits. Mr Miczek says they remain viable because of “the type of trades done — many are bespoke combinations that are invented by the brokers and created that day, and they change day to day”.Even if the floors closed, Mr Miczek says it is likely some trading would move to the so-called “call-around market”, which involves traders and brokers using the telephone to work out trades rather than communicating face to face.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York
181;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-02-10T08:41:46Z;CME pit closure sparks member buyout call;Fee structure too complicated, existing members say;The demise of futures trading pits in Chicago and New York has triggered debate over exchange membership, a privilege some now view as a burden in an era of electronic markets.A membership gave traders and brokers access to the once-bustling trading floors of CME Group, the biggest futures exchange operator. CME last week announced it was closing most open-outcry futures trading, abandoning a tradition dating to the 19th century.But memberships are to survive, prompting pointed questions to CME executives at a member meeting last Friday, attendees said. More exchange members are scheduled to see the executives in New York on Wednesday.Ray Cahnman, chairman of TransMarket Group, a prominent Chicago-based proprietary trading firm, told the FT that memberships were a “throwback to when the pits were the main thing. Now they’re not. So you should find a way to reduce them.”Pat Mulchrone, a founding partner of broker Advantage Futures, said CME should buy out members’ stakes.“I think it’ll make the exchange stronger in the long term,” Mr Mulchrone said.Buying out all 8,500 “class B” memberships across CME’s four US exchanges could cost $2bn-$4bn based on recent sale prices, CME estimated. The company said in response to an FT query: “Like all of our customers, class B shareholders provide important liquidity.”Members are still entitled to discounts on exchange fees even if they trade electronically. But memberships can cost millions of dollars as traders must buy or lease at least one for each CME exchange they use, including the Chicago Board of Trade and New York Mercantile Exchange.Mr Cahnman said the membership system gave CME a “more complicated fee structure” than competing exchanges such as Intercontinental Exchange and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex, threatening its appeal as a trading venue.The decision to close futures pits will reduce demand for memberships as individual floor traders exit, said Mr Cahnman, a member and CME shareholder.It would be a big plus to CME stockholders if access to the lowest exchange rates was available without requiring the added burden of owning memberships“With only limited demand for memberships offset by a very large supply of unleased memberships, the CME board has an opportunity to make a tender offer for memberships at prices that are viewed as beneficial to CME stockholders,” Mr Cahnman said. “It would be a big plus to CME stockholders if access to the lowest exchange rates was available without requiring the added burden of owning memberships.”As CME became a for-profit company and acquired other exchanges, it compensated members as they ceded some of the rights of owning a seat. Each member of the Nymex got $750,000 when CME took it over in 2008, for example.Dozens of memberships are available for lease on the CME website, while only a handful of applicants were recently seeking new memberships. A full membership on CME’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange sold for $720,000 on Friday, down from $785,000 in mid-January.
182;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-02-05T01:37:11Z;CME to close futures pits;Open outcry trading falls to just 1% of company’s futures volumes;CME Group will close most of its future pits in Chicago and New York by this summer, in the latest sign of how electronic trading has taken over the old system of floor-based trading.The operator of the world’s largest futures exchange said open outcry trading had fallen to just 1 per cent of the company’s total futures volumes, and most pits will close by July 2. The Chicago-based company said floor-based trading of S&P 500-based futures would continue, along with most options products.Contracts based on numerous commodities will be affected by the decision, including grains, energy and metals. But the absolute number of traders affected will be far fewer than in open outcry’s heyday, when hundreds of people crowded the floor at the Chicago Board of Trade, which CME bought in 2007.Those pits that do remain active at CME’s Chicago trading floor have seen the number of active traders dwindle consistently since CME introduced its Globex electronic trading system in 1992. That trend has accelerated in recent years.It is unclear how much money CME will save by closing the remaining futures pits. But the company has been under pressure to cut costs recently, and in October slashed around 5 per cent of its global workforce, or 150 jobs.The pits at the CBOT were famous for hectic, frenzied trading involving shouting and complicated hand gestures over prices of everything from interest rates to pork bellies. The Eurodollar options pit is now the CME’s most active, largely because the contracts involve complicated trading strategies, though many expect them to transition to the screen eventually as well.CME has had a sometimes contentious relationship with the remaining floor traders in recent years, as seen in a lawsuit brought by grain traders upset with changes to pit rules.But CME said it would try to help those floor traders who want to trade electronically make the transition.“It’s sad,” said Scott Shellady, a senior vice-president at TJM Investments, which trades options on the floor and futures electronically. “But operationally I understand the decision . . . most of the business has moved to an electronically traded market.”The news came as the company declared a 50 cent quarterly dividend, up from 47 cents, and days after CME’s bid to acquire interdealer GFI Group was defeated in a shareholder vote.CME will report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.
183;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-01-27T17:41:31Z;GFI head makes last call for CME backing;Michael Gooch says he and his ex-wife will take a reduced price for their shares;The executive chairman, founder and main shareholder of interdealer broker GFI Group has made a last-ditch effort to muster support for a takeover by CME Group by disclosing that he and his ex-wife will take a reduced price for their shares.In an open letter to shareholders published on Tuesday, Michael Gooch said he would be paid only $4.44 for his shares compared with the $5.85 in cash and stock deal on offer from the Chicago futures exchange.His call, a rare public comment on the deal from the British-born Mr Gooch, marked the board’s final push to establish a decisive outcome in the battle for the US interdealer broker.A shareholder vote on Friday in favour of the CME deal that the board has agreed would prevent a competing hostile bid from BGC Partners, a rival US interdealer broker, that is worth $6.10 per share. Although higher, it is structured as a tender offer and comes with several conditions.Mr Gooch said shareholders could “opt for a ‘bird in the hand’ with the CME or hold out for a hostile, conditional ‘BGC in the bush’.” The latter has also yet to conduct due diligence on GFI.He added that his ex-wife, whom he recently divorced, was also willing to take a reduced sale price of $5.46 per share for her GFI shares. “That is her vote of confidence in the CME merger and shows how much she wants to see the CME deal close,” he added.The value of GFI has risen nearly 90 per cent beyond the CME’s initial bid last summer and its equity is valued at $743m by the CME deal.In a side deal, CME plans to sell GFI’s brokerage and clearing business to a management consortium led by Mr Gooch and chief executive Colin Heffron for a total consideration of $369m. That would leave CME with the electronic trading assets of Trayport and Fenics.However the CME deal faces hurdles on Friday. It needs both the approval of two-thirds of the GFI shareholders and a majority of the outstanding shares held by neutral stockholders. Two influential US proxy voting advisory services, ISS and Glass Lewis, have recommended that shareholders vote against it. Some unaffiliated shareholders have also been privately unhappy with the potential conflicts of interest on GFI’s board.The group’s shares were trading down 2 per cent at $5.98 in New York on Tuesday, indicating investors felt that the CME deal would be defeated.BGC also faces challenges with its offer, such as getting sufficient shareholder backing. It has also not signed a non-disclosure agreement to “protect GFI from a raid on its employees”, GFI said.“As a result, I believe BGC’s hair trigger conditionality is unlikely to be satisfied given its inability to do due diligence without such a customary non-disclosure agreement in place,” said Mr Gooch.www.ft.com/tradingroom

That would leave CME with the electronic trading assets of Trayport and Fenics.However, it faces a rival offer from BGC Partners worth $6.10 per share, although it is structured as a tender offer and comes with conditions.“Either of the two competing offers is likely to deliver greater value to unaffiliated shareholders than remaining standalone,” Institutional Shareholder Services, the world’s largest proxy firm, concluded on Wednesday. The service advises investors on how to vote at company meetings.It also noted that the bidding war — in which offers have sometimes been raised within hours of each other — had pushed the GFI price up so far that “even the economically inferior offer now represents a premium of more than 88 per cent”.The six-month saga has pitted GFI, the smallest of the five large global interdealer brokers, against its larger rival BGC — also a 13 per cent shareholder. Complicating the issue, a GFI management stake of nearly 40 per cent of the company’s share capital is committed to voting for the CME deal and to vote against any alternative transaction for up to a year following termination of the CME transaction. However, it also needs approval from two-thirds of outstanding shares.“Perhaps most disturbingly, however, the management consortium and BGC — which are effectively the two competing bidders here — may each be in a position to block the other’s transaction, even if they remain unable to get their own deal over the finish line,” ISS added.“As it is not at all clear that unaffiliated shareholders incur any greater risk of the deal breaking by holding out for the economically superior offer, shareholders should vote against the CME transaction on its current terms, and, if that offer does not improve to at least parity with the BGC bid, tender into the BGC offer instead,” it concluded.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

The company also announced a “non-contingent” offer of $5.75, which has a deadline of January 29.The new bids come as GFI shareholders prepare to vote on the CME offer on January 27. Michael Gooch, chairman and founder of GFI, supports the CME deal, which would see a management consortium he leads take the company’s broking business private, a move BGC has criticised.As part of CME’s latest bid, Mr Gooch’s group has agreed to increase its cash contribution from $254m to $282m. The group would also assume $77m in liabilities.Mr Gooch has committed the roughly 40 per cent stake his Jersey Partners controls to the CME bid.BGC, which holds a 13 per cent stake in GFI, launched its hostile bid after negotiations over its own offer failed. Its latest offer represents a premium of more than 88 per cent to the price of GFI shares on July 29, the last day before the announcement of the CME deal.
187;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:34:32+0000;Nasdaq plans challenge to energy futures duopoly;Exchange group seeks to undercut CME and ICE fees;Nasdaq OMX plans to break into global oil and gas derivatives markets, invading the turf of established commodity exchanges by offering traders lower fees.The New York exchange group has signed up brokers, trading firms and banks including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to back a new energy futures venture to launch in 2015, industry executives said.Tentative products would include futures and options on West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude as well as US natural gas.The move would make Nasdaq a third contender in an already fierce fight for energy market share between CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, which together list the benchmark oil and gas contracts. Despite the dramatic fall in oil prices and wild swings in gas, energy volumes on both exchanges shrank in 2014.Nasdaq has been aggressively trying to spread beyond equities trading, where profits have contracted amid tough competition. Previous initiatives include the $750m purchase of eSpeed, a government bond trading platform, and the launch of NLX, an interest rate derivatives platform in Europe. It also has a European power business.Nasdaq re-registered its US futures exchange last November after a lapse, a regulatory filing shows. In a notice posted online, the exchange said it planned to add “core benchmark products in crude oil, natural gas, and US power” to its offerings, allowing traders to “access liquidity at below current published market rates”.A person familiar with Nasdaq said executives believed current energy trading and clearing fees did not reflect the efficiencies of what is now a largely electronic marketplace. “The pricing is generally wrong. It’s a lack of competition,” the person said.While executed on Nasdaq computers, trades would be guaranteed by the Chicago-based Options Clearing Corporation, whose executive chairman is Craig Donohue, former chief executive of CME.Javier Loya, chief executive of energy broker OTC Global Holdings, said his company will back the new exchange.“I think it’s a good opportunity for a third party to come in and challenge the vertical silos of both CME and ICE with a different market structure,” Mr Loya said. “Ultimately, clients want to see competition. They want to see fee reductions.”An executive at a large energy trading group uninvolved with the venture was sceptical, however. “They don’t have a competitive advantage,” he said. “They’re trying to enter into a market that is largely dominated by two incumbents that do a very good job, CME and ICE.”Nasdaq’s products would be “lookalike” contracts with prices based on futures at CME and ICE.One potential lure for the exchange is looming position limits on energy speculators. By spreading positions across a few exchanges, a trader could maintain larger bets than if all were kept at one exchange, a futures executive said.Nasdaq said it “works closely with customers to understand the demands of the marketplace and opportunities to provide customers with competitive alternatives and greater efficiencies that leverage our technology and expertise”.

The offer is 15 cents higher than its previous bid for GFI, and 35 cents higher than CME’s bid, which shareholders are set to vote on later this month.The BGC offer — which includes a $61m advance to pay any termination fees due CME — is the latest in the months’ long bidding war for GFI. Michael Gooch, GFI’s chairman and founder, supports the CME deal and has committed the roughly 40 per cent stake his Jersey Partners controls to the bid.But BGC, a 13 per cent shareholder in GFI, has criticised a side deal with the CME which would see GFI’s broking business offloaded to a consortium that includes Mr Gooch and the company’s chief executive, Colin Heffron.When negotiations over its own offer failed, BGC launched its hostile bid, and hopes to convince enough shareholders to vote for it at a January 27 meeting.The news comes the same day BGC agreed to pay a $100m settlement to Tullett Prebon, the UK interdealer broker, to end a five-year long dispute.
189;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-01-12T18:35:21Z;US banks call for action on clearing houses;Treasury secretary asked to examine the ‘serious risks’ posed by a collapse;US banks have urged Jack Lew, the US Treasury secretary, to take action to shore up clearing houses, arguing that the likes of CME Group and LCH.Clearnet could cause the next financial crisis instead of preventing it.Clearing houses were given a stamp of approval by the Obama administration and the US Congress as part of the post-crisis financial reforms. They stand between two parties on a derivatives trade, ensuring the deal is completed in the event of a default of one of the counterparties.But there is concern among the big banks over what would happen should a clearing house itself fail and frustration over a lack of action from regulators.“I just think like many other things it’s a combination of bandwidth and complexity and frankly the split jurisdiction,” said Paul Saltzman, president of The Clearing House Association (TCH), which, confusingly, is the oldest bank trade group in the US and does not represent clearing houses.“In the United States, you have the CFTC [the Commodity Futures Trading Commission], the SEC [the Securities and Exchange Commission], the banking regulators all involved,” he said.In a letter to Mr Lew, seen by the Financial Times, TCH urged him to take control of the process in his role as chairman of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, an umbrella group for the regulatory agencies.The banks’ trade group said it was “particularly concerned that serious risks posed by CCPs [central counterparties, or clearing houses] have yet to be sufficiently addressed in five key areas”, limiting liability to banks in the event of a collapse, forcing the clearing houses to have more “skin in the game” by injecting their own capital, increasing transparency, specifying what collateral is used and setting resolution plans for what happens in the event of a CCP collapsing.This last point has generated some arguments within the banks. JPMorgan Chase is pushing for a resolution fund to be set up which could be used to help preserve the operations of a failing CCP. But other big banks have failed to sign on to the proposal, preferring not to contribute to it.The largest derivatives clearing houses in the US, operated by CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange and LCH.Clearnet, have resisted the banks’ calls, arguing that increasing their “skin in the game” would expose the risk manager to greater credit risk at the very moment the market needs the operator to be resilient.They also argue that new rules in the US and Europe have toughened their operating procedures and increased their capital buffers, and their role in the market is to neutralise risk while banks are risk takers.Europe is likely to publish proposals for legislation in the coming year and US authorities are coming under pressure to follow suit. To date, guidelines from the Bank for International Settlements and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, an umbrella group of regulators, last year also recommended clearing house operators be given leeway to deal with crises, such as the freedom to tear up derivatives contracts and allocate any uncovered losses to members and replenishing any funds that were used up during a “stress event”.
190;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Decision time for GFI shareholders;Forthcoming vote on deal with CME may open interdealer broker to new offers;The GFI shareholder meeting scheduled for January 27 to vote on its sale to CME Group should be a date marked in the diary.It may settle some questions after another week of thrusts and parries in the market structure industry’s most involved takeover battle in several years.Shareholders are to vote on one issue — whether to back a deal in favour of the CME, the world’s largest futures exchange — but that day there are three options on offer. They could go with management’s agreed CME deal or back a hostile but higher cash offer from BGC Partners, a rival US interdealer. The final choice? Back neither deal.The CME choice would offload the broking business to a consortium of management and leave CME with the electronic trading assets of Trayport and Fenics. Shareholders are being offered what amounts to $5.25 a share in cash and shares.BGC’s offer is more straightforward, at $5.45 per share in cash for all of GFI. That seemingly more appealing prospect is complicated because it comes with conditions, notably as a tender offer. Plus, GFI senior management have a near 40 per cent stake and are committed to the CME deal come what may. GFI employees also have strong reservations about joining BGC, largely because of issues relating to deferred compensation, although the latter has been at pains to stress that existing arrangements will be protected.It is quite possible neither side will prevail. To win, the CME needs backing from two-thirds of GFI shareholders and a majority of the outstanding shares held by neutral stockholders. BGC, a 13 per cent shareholder, is trying to secure proxy votes to block it. Around 30 per cent of shareholders have tendered for BGC, including the company. Turn those tenders into proxy votes and that might be enough to prevent the CME deal.BGC’s own efforts to secure control may get no further though. BGC needs tenders from 45 per cent of shareholders, while it has extended that deadline repeatedly (now also to January 27) it has never got close enough.So what happens then? It seems unlikely GFI will resume as normal. It is now “in play” and that throws up a series of permutations. BGC or CME may come back with another bid separately, or join together to break up GFI. But the actions of GFI management in recent months appear almost designed to keep the company out of BGC’s hands. As a New York Observer article detailed over Christmas, there’s little appetite to join BGC among employees.So it may go searching for a white knight. GFI held talks with rival interdealer broker Tullett Prebon in 2008 and while talks broke down, circumstances are different now. Tullett also has a new chief executive and the two companies’ operations could dovetail neatly.One cannot also rule out Intercontinental Exchange, which would almost certainly seek the same European energy trading assets that CME wants. Shortly after the CME deal was announced Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, noted: “Whatever process the board of directors went through to sell that asset, we were not a part of it . . . We were not afforded the opportunity.”He may yet get the chance but that 13 per cent stake makes BGC the effective kingmaker. Prospective bidders may have to offer a hefty price to secure the deal.
191;CME;CME Group Inc;2015-01-08T09:09:46Z;US still the dominant superpower in derivatives trade;CME’s lead over ICE will continue until Europe’s economy recovers;"Like two cold war superpowers, US derivatives exchanges CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange are turning asset classes and geographies in the world’s markets into their own private duel.ICE’s launch of a new euro-denominated cocoa contract ahead of its rival marks the latest skirmish in an ongoing battle, which encompasses the flagship crude oil futures contract and emerging fights over credit default swaps clearing in the US, swap futures in Europe and new business in Asia.Yet a different story emerges from the world of interest rate futures, used by investors to speculate and hedge against rate moves by central banks and therefore among the most traded derivatives by value in the world.CME this week reported a 19 per cent year-on-year growth in average daily volume to 7m contracts. By contrast, ICE recorded a 28 per cent fall on the same measure, to 1.6m contracts.For ICE, the figures represent a tough start to its first full year offering interest rate futures after it acquired NYSE Euronext for $11bn two years ago to get hold of Liffe, the London derivatives exchange. It turned to Europe to break into the market after being effectively shut out of the US market by ‘Fortress Chicago’, as CME’s near-monopoly in the local market is sometimes known.For the moment that citadel looks as strong as ever, and is underpinned by a regulatory regime that forces investors to close their futures contracts on the same venue they open them.The CME’s volume numbers were a reflection of its dominance in products related to movements by the Federal Reserve, such as Treasury and eurodollar futures. The winding down of the Fed’s quantitative easing programme in October, and expectations of rising interest rates, stimulated demand in two-year and five-year notes on the exchange. Overall interest rate open interest — the total number of derivative contracts still running or ‘open’— increased 28 per cent last year at CME.ICE ascribed the decline on Liffe, now renamed ICE Futures Europe, “to continued low volatility in continental European short-term interest rates”. Demand for short-term hedging products has tumbled as the European Central Bank cut its deposit rate below zero. Not only did volumes fall, open interest was down from 18m contracts to 13m.ICE maintains that “we continue to believe we acquired our interest rate franchise at the bottom of an interest rate cycle”.Intercontinental Exchange has announced the launch of a new euro-denominated cocoa contract ahead of rival CME Group’s entry into the market. The new contract adds to ICE’s existing contracts — the dollar-denominated cocoa contract traded in New York, and a London contract traded in pounds. It comes as CME is preparing to enter cocoa trading with a contract in Europe.Continue readingIndeed, there were bright spots, as evidenced by its distinction between the UK and “continental” trading. Rising expectations that the Bank of England may begin raising rates in the UK meant the bourse twice set daily volume records in its 10-year gilt futures contracts during the year, and surpassed 1m contracts one day in August. It also smashed a five-year old record in daily volume in euro swapnote futures.“The more interesting battle is going to be the one in clearing and over-the-counter open interest — which is the bigger place to attract investors to offset their margin positions,” says Steve Grob, director of strategy at Fidessa, a UK trading technology company. “The story is a bit more subtle than just looking at trading volumes.”Even so, breaking out of the box may prove difficult for ICE. For a start, it is held back by a different market structure in Europe. At the CME investors can trade all along the yield curve, a line that plots interest rates for bonds of different maturities but the same credit quality.In Europe it is split. ICE Futures Europe dominates liquidity at the short end of the curve with Libor-pegged euribor futures. Deutsche Börse’s Eurex controls the longer end, with its Bund, Bobl and Schatz futures pegged to German government bonds.The eurodollar market — so central to the CME’s volumes — is unique. Furthermore European antitrust regulators blocked a merger of Liffe and Eurex three years ago, meaning ICE will have to grow by developing new contracts.ICE last year launched contracts based on the repo-based US Treasury market to compete in the US with CME, and in long-term European government debt to compete with Eurex. Neither initiative has yet gained traction, illustrating the difficulty in futures markets of attracting liquidity from one venue to another. ""I do think the dominant effect is the ECB basically going into “on hold at zero for a long time” mode while the Fed is potentially hiking in a couple of quarters, give or take,"" says the head of fixed income trading at an electronic market maker.The coming year may be another one of dominance by CME until Europe recovers.www.ft.com/tradingroom"

The date is likely to be crucial for GFI, the smaller of the world’s five main interdealer brokers but which has been up for sale for more than six months as the industry struggles with profound structural change.BGC is hoping to garner enough support from undecided shareholders to prevent approval of a deal GFI management agreed over the summer with CME, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, and to open a route to purchasing GFI itself.BGC, a 13 per cent shareholder in GFI, has been angered by a side deal with the CME that would offload GFI’s broking business to a management consortium, including chairman Michael Gooch and Colin Heffron, chief executive. BGC has labelled it “a blatant disregard for the interests of all GFI shareholders and is a breach of their fiduciary duties”.To that end, BGC has launched its own hostile bid after becoming frustrated by failed attempts to negotiate with GFI management over its own offer. The competing parties have since upped their offers to shareholders, with CME offering a mix of cash and shares worth $5.25 a share and the side deal. BGC has offered $5.45 a share in cash for the whole company, valuing the equity of its smaller rival at just under $700m.The CME deal needs both the approval of two-thirds of the GFI shareholders and a majority of the outstanding shares held by neutral stockholders. About 30.5 per cent of GFI shareholders have agreed to BGC’s tender offer to date.Jersey Partners, a vehicle controlled by Mr Gooch and whose near 40 per cent stake makes it GFI’s largest shareholder, has committed to backing the CME deal.The industry has been hit by a combination of profound regulatory reform of markets and its investment banking customers, and several years of low market volatility. Most acknowledge consolidation is needed, but antipathy and wariness among the industry’s top bosses has curbed dealmaking.Many senior GFI brokers and salespeople have been unhappy at the prospect of joining BGC, with a number concerned that the deferred bonuses they have accrued would not be protected after the takeover.BGC confirmed it expected to honour existing agreements and would not change them. It added that GFI employees could choose to receive the earnings owed to them in cash, based on BGC’s $5.45 a share offer, on existing vesting schedules.“We want to send a clear message to GFI employees that we recognise the value of their contributions and that there are meaningful opportunities for them going forward,” Howard Lutnick, BGC chief executive, confirmed in a statement.

Its proposal values GFI’s equity at $694m, but it has yet to secure a majority backing for its offer. BGC, which is led by chief executive Howard Lutnick, has extended its tender offer until January 6.Staff on longer-term contracts have sought new clauses that would enable them to quit GFI without breaching their employment terms or potentially facing legal action and losing deferred bonus payments if it is bought by BGC, said those with knowledge of the situation.“We’ve been pretty taken aback by the strength of feeling,” said a senior GFI executive who declined to be identified. “It’s not about people being precious. They see a very significant divide between the brokers.”The employees’ concerns underscore the delicate takeover negotiations for GFI, the smallest of the five main global interdealer brokers. The industry has been hit by a combination of profound regulatory reform of markets and its investment banking customers, and several years of low market volatility. Most acknowledge consolidation is needed, but antipathy and wariness among the industry’s top bosses has curbed dealmaking.Nearly 40 per cent of GFI equity is held by its management, who have pledged to back a deal with CME.Concerned employees have asked senior management for a new break clause to be inserted into their contracts under “change of control” that specifically names BGC.“We are having to look at this very seriously and very closely and are looking into our options on how to address this issue,” the senior GFI executive said.GFI Group declined to comment.BGC has promised that the deferred bonuses held by GFI employees would remain outstanding and vest on their existing schedules. BGC has also defended its employee incentive schemes, pointing out that it has made more than 21 acquisitions in 10 years without mass departures and has more than doubled the size of its business to 2,700 employees in the last decade. It also reiterated that GFI would remain a separate company for some time.
194;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-12-30T09:36:27Z;ICE bans ‘disruptive trading’ strategies;Trades that are designed solely to mislead other traders are outlawed;Intercontinental Exchange has explicitly banned an array of market strategies — from flooding its systems with data to tricking others by cancelling orders — in a tougher stance towards electronic trading groups.Two of ICE’s commodity futures exchanges in New York and Canada late on Monday outlined rule changes that set out detailed lists of prohibited “disruptive trading practices”. They are to take effect on January 14, about four months after exchanges owned by rival CME Group adopted similar rules.Both ICE and CME are in a delicate position, seeking to keep markets fair without choking off volumes from proprietary traders. As self-regulatory organisations they are the first line of defence against abuse. As for-profit exchange operators, they depend on active trading groups for liquidity and revenue.Disruptive trading was made illegal under the 2010 US Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Last year, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued further guidance on banned types of trading including “spoofing”, or entering bids or offers with the intent to cancel them before completion.Such strategies can take place in millionths of a second as traders use algorithms to gauge the price level and depth of a market. One trader is fighting criminal charges that he designed computer programs to spoof commodity and currency futures markets for an illicit $1.6m in profit.ICE said it was now providing “additional clarification” on disruptive practices which were prohibited. These included entering orders with “intent to overload, delay, or disrupt the systems of the exchange or other market participants” and the “intent to cancel the order before execution”.A four-page document attached to the rule notices attempts to illuminate the changes, but an executive at one trading firm warned the rules appeared to rely heavily on judgment calls by exchange regulatory officials.ICE said that using a “momentum ignition” strategy to kick-start price movements was a potential violation of the rule, but only if a trader also intended to disrupt orderly or fair trading, was reckless or misleading or engaged in other shenanigans.Iceberg orders, which divide large orders into segments that are visible to and hidden from the market, would not violate the rules unless used to mislead other participants.The document adds that ICE market regulation officials “may consider a variety of factors”, including a trader’s historical pattern of activity and actions in related markets, as they weigh bringing a case.
195;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-12-11T18:32:02Z;Mexico eyes gas futures amid energy reforms;MexDer to work with CME on gas futures contracts for 2016 launch;Mexico is developing gas futures contracts to exploit demand for hedging tools as the country opens up the hydrocarbons sector it has closed for nearly 80 years.The country’s main derivatives exchange, MexDer, will work on the development in the coming year with CME Group, the US futures exchange and a longstanding partner, according to Jorge Alegría, chief executive of MexDer.Mr Alegría said the contracts would “probably only be listed here, and will reference the Henry Hub price [for natural gas in the US], plus or minus some basis points. “We’re aiming for launch in 2016, and the contract will be in pesos,” he told FT Trading Room. The CME owns the Henry Hub energy futures contracts in the US.He added that the contracts would be designed and approved in 2015 as questions about how gas would be sold in Mexico still remained. Mexico plans to jack up imports of cheap US shale gas from Texas to meet demand until new investment allows its own production to catch up.Luis Téllez, the outgoing president of MexDer parent Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV), told reporters the contract “can’t happen overnight”.Mr Alegría said he was also excited by the possibility of launching a product based on electricity prices “but there’s nothing tied down yet”. Electricity prices can be very volatile, he noted, so such a contract would help companies cover their risk. Such instruments exist in the US and Europe, Mr Alegría added, largely in the form of auctions.The move is a further sign of Mexico’s push to upgrade its financial markets infrastructure to attract more investors. This week the finance ministry said Mexico would allow Euroclear, one of the world’s largest securities settlement systems, to allow peso-denominated local bonds to be held and settled through Eurocelar. This will allow Mexican corporate issuers to issue peso-denominated debt but access international investors.The bourse is about to sign a deal with Deutsche Börse’s Clearstream, Euroclear’s main rival, and Mr Téllez said such deals would help cut operating costs as well as provide a platform to trade corporate bonds. “Currently, there are only private transactions. It is not a transparent market,” he said.Mr Téllez had no information on plans announced by BM&FBovespa’s chief executive Edemir Pinto to take 15 per cent stakes of every significant stock market in Latin America to flex its muscle in the backyard of the Mila tie-up of the Chilean, Colombian, Peruvian and now Mexican markets.“I would be very glad to do something with Bovespa but there aren’t discussions at the moment,” said Mr Téllez, who is being replaced as president by Jaime Ruiz Sacristán next month. A new chief of the stock market is due to be announced on Thursday. Mr Téllez had held both roles.Mexico’s stock market has 10 per cent of its Peruvian peer and Mr Téllez saw the strategy of cross-partnerships in a “more robust integration like we have with Peru” as worth pursuing in future, though he stressed “there’s nothing on the table now”.Though Mr Téllez reckoned Mexico faced a tough 2015 economically because of the oil price fall, he saw the US recovery as a key helping hand, and noted that there are 10 to 12 companies waiting to list on the Mexican market “and they wouldn’t do that if they didn’t see growth prospects”. He declined to name them for confidentiality reasons.
196;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-12-09T23:59:12Z;Leaks boost privacy start-ups;The stolen pictures of a Hollywood star have raised the concerns of ordinary people;"Companies that aim to provide better standards of privacy for internet users are hoping to seduce the mass market next year, after sprouting in 2014 to cater for customers increasingly worried about their data.Businesses focused on providing private messaging, calls and browsing have surged in popularity after revelations last year by National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden highlighted how much important information about people can be found online.But users for such services so far are in the millions, not billions, and companies including San Francisco-based Wickr and Abine are working on forming partnerships to boost the number of people signing up.Nico Sell, chief executive of Wickr, has struck deals with partners as varied as the CME Group, the US exchange operator, which is interested in private messaging for traders, and Wargaming, an online gaming company.“I think we’ll get to tens of millions of users through natural growth of the app,” she says. “But the board won’t settle for anything less than 1bn users. They push me every single day and the only way to get there is through partnerships.”Both the CME Group and Wargaming also invest in Wickr, as do Richard Clarke, a former White House security adviser, Jeff Moss, the founder of the Def Con hacking conference, and Breyer Capital, a private equity investor.Ms Sell also has her sights on telecoms carriers, who can rapidly boost an app’s popularity by preloading it on smartphones. She says Wickr is gunning for “pole position” on the phone, so its messages, which are not stored on a server and can be set to disappear, become the standard.The market should be there. According to a survey from the Pew Center Research Center, 81 per cent of US adults feel “not very” or “not at all secure” using social media sites to share private information; 61 per cent feel insecure using chat or instant messages; and 57 per cent feel insecure sending private messages via email.Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet Project and co-author of the study, says: “Far from being apathetic about their privacy, most Americans say they want to do more to protect it.”Rob Shavell, co-founder of Abine, which recently released the Blur security product to protect passwords, emails and financial information online, also thinks next year will be crucial to making privacy mainstream.Before the Snowden leaks, he says privacy tools were “fragmented” and none were “really user-friendly” for people who are not technical experts. The situation has been transformed in the past nine months, he says. There are a lot more start-ups.Here’s why a small little company like mine is going to win: we will never give up the keyPartnerships are important to helping Abine grow beyond its core audience. “Privacy has to be easier and a better internet experience for it to go mainstream,” Mr Shavell says. “You have maybe 25m-100m people globally that care enough to download or use different pieces of software, which is a very small minority.”He says Abine and its rivals will be seeking bigger partnerships, many of which will be announced in 2015.Marc Boroditsky, president and chief operating officer at Authy, which wants to replace passwords with stronger authentication methods, has another theory about why consumers are increasingly interested in better privacy: Hollywood star Jennifer Lawrence. When nude photos of her spread over the internet after her iCloud account was hacked, it had a big effect on the everyday consumer, he says.He notes that security breaches have been occurring every week or two. “Home Depot or Target or JPMorgan — everywhere you look, there’s some kind of breach. The consumer might get inconvenienced, but ultimately an institution shields them — the banks absorb the costs, retailers reverse transactions and you go on your merry way,” he says.“But the Jennifer Lawrence pictures brought home that these systems may not be as trustworthy as we thought.”Mr Boroditsky thinks the password, insecure and easy to guess, will begin a slow death next year. “I would love to say next year is the year the password dies but I think next year is when we rally the troops to kill the password. It will take a couple of years to eliminate it on a large scale.”Big technology companies are also improving their own measures to protect privacy, realising there is a demand for safe as well as flashy products. Google, Facebook and Yahoo are among those improving their encryption.But Wickr’s Ms Sell thinks it will be a start-up combined with a bigger partner, rather than a company such as Google, that will eventually win out, because advertising-based companies have an interest in being able to access masses of data about their users.Wickr’s basic consumer app is free, but it charges for additions and tools.Ms Sell says: “Here’s why a small company like mine is going to win. We will never give up the key, [while] they will always want to be in the middle to know exactly what customers are doing. They aren’t making money in a brand new way.”"
197;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-12-04T16:54:00Z;ICE to join Europe swap futures battle;US exchange to use licences from Eris Exchange for European trading push;Intercontinental Exchange is to join the emerging battle in Europe with rivals CME Group and Deutsche Börse to trade hybrid fixed income derivatives after finalising a licensing deal for the contracts.The US exchange, the world’s second largest by market capitalisation, will begin trading hybrid swap futures next year after agreeing to take a licence from Eris Exchange, a US start-up that operates in North America.Atlanta-based ICE will also use the licence as the basis for European and US credit default swap (CDS) futures from next year, the companies said on Thursday.Its move sets the stage for a battle among Europe’s largest exchanges to grab market share as new rules on derivatives and bank capital requirements reshape the market.Investors and brokers face mandatory clearing of derivatives trades under new global legislation, but some worry it will add extra cost to trading or force investors to use products that are not tailored to their needs.Swap futures have been touted as having the economic flexibility of a swap with the inexpensiveness of a future. Futures cost less in margin collateral than OTC swaps.CME and Eris in the US — and Deutsche Börse and CME in Europe — have already launched swap futures although take-up has been muted as investors assess and test their usefulness. The London Stock Exchange Group is also widely expected to launch its own products shortly.ICE’s CDS futures contracts in the US will be based on Markit indices. In Europe, the Eris-based swap futures will be euro and sterling-denominated. ICE will clear all of the new products. ICE is already the dominant market clearer for over-the-counter CDS swaps.The agreement will also allow Eris to use its intellectual property beyond its US heartland, although Eris will retain CME Clear to process all its US-based swap futures trades.“We believe we’ve found the magic formula that allows everyone to trade it,” said Neal Brady, chief executive of Eris. “We’re really gratified by the ratification of ICE, a major player in the market.”ICE’s adoption also creates two rival blocs vying for intellectual supremacy of the new swap futures products.Goldman Sachs and other dealers are supporting CME’s swap futures contract — which is also based on a Goldman patent — while the Eris swap contract has the support of Morgan Stanley. Eris is owned by Morgan Stanley and several proprietary trading companies, including DRW Trading.
198;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Exchange operator CME raises bid for GFI to fend off rival;US group aims to secure interdealer broker with cash and shares;CME Group has raised its offer to shareholders of GFI Group in order to push through the US futures exchange operator’s purchase of GFI’s main electronic trading assets and fend off a rival offer from BGC Partners.CME and GFI, a US interdealer broker, confirmed yesterday they would improve an all-share offer of $4.55 per GFI share to a mix of cash and shares worth $5.25 a share. The total on offer compares with an all-cash offer of $5.25 a share to GFI shareholders from BGC.With the raised offer, CME and the management of GFI are aiming to sway undecided stockholders and end objections to the previous deal from one of the bid target’s main shareholders, BGC.Both CME and BGC have sought to buy GFI, the smallest of the world’s five main interdealer brokers, albeit for differing reasons.CME wants to purchase Trayport and Fenics, GFI’s electronic energy and foreign exchange trading businesses, to push into European energy trading.BGC also wants the electronic units but is also keen to expand and consolidate the market. GFI shares rose above the offer price, and were up almost 7 per cent to $5.38 by lunchtime in New York.BGC first sought to disrupt the initial deal over the summer, when CME and GFI reached an agreement which valued GFI’s equity at $580m in an all-stock deal.The total deal value of $820m included CME taking on $240m of debt and a side deal that would offload GFI’s broking business to a consortium of current and former management for $165m. BGC, a 13 per cent shareholder in GFI, complained the side deal undervalued the brokerage business.To complicate the deal further, nearly 40 per cent of GFI equity is held by its management, who have pledged to back the deal with CME.In response BGC began a hostile tender offer to GFI shareholders that valued the company's equity at $675m. It has yet to convince enough shareholders to back its proposal but has extended the deadline to December 9.BGC said its offer remained the superior one. “Our all-cash offer provides immediate liquidity to GFI shareholders upon the close of our tender offer. We are currently evaluating our options.”
199;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-11-20T17:54:44Z;BGC extends deadline for GFI offer;Interdealer broker says it has backing of 31% of shareholders;BGC Partners, the US interdealer broker, has extended its offer to buy rival GFI Group by nearly three weeks after failing to convince enough shareholders to back its hostile $5.25 per share cash tender offer.Following the close of the original November 19 deadline, BGC said it had secured the tender of 23.2m shares to combine with the 17.1m shares it owned. As a result, BGC said it had the backing of about 31.7 per cent of shareholders.New York-based BGC needs to secure the support of two-thirds of shareholders to succeed with its hostile bid to buy the 86.5 per cent of shares in GFI it does not own. BGC turned directly to other shareholders after becoming frustrated with delays to a potential negotiated deal with the GFI board.Its offer, which values GFI at $675m, is looking to break up a rival lower-priced deal GFI has agreed with CME Group, the US futures exchange. The CME deal includes a side that would offload GFI’s broking business to a consortium of current and former management.BGC’s offer is also dependent on it gaining two-thirds control of GFI’s board. However, GFI’s board is staggered and a third of it is elected annually.BGC added that it remained in discussions with the independent board set up to oversee the sale of GFI. It indicated that the board “would be willing, under certain conditions, to recommend that GFI’s stockholders accept BGC’s tender offer, resign, and take actions necessary so that BGC would have control of two-thirds of GFI’s board”.GFI governing documents require the deal to be approved by the two-thirds majority of shareholders. Nearly 40 per cent of GFI shares, owned by management, have been pledged to the CME bid and not support another for a year. The extended tender offer will close at 5pm US eastern time on December 9.On Wednesday, BGC Partners said it had “resolved matters” with UK authorities over purchased GFI shares over the summer without seeking the regulator’s approval.BGC was required to inform UK authorities as some of the assets that are owned by GFI are UK-regulated. The Financial Conduct Authority “expressed its disappointment at the breach” but did not further penalise BGC.
200;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-11-16T05:28:12Z;Record growth sees new alliances;Banks offload data services as independent providers undergo consolidation;One of the crown jewels of the indexing industry is up for sale. This is the latest of a series of strategic deals bringing change of ownership for some of the most important benchmarks in global financial markets.Barclays is considering the sale of its Index, Portfolio and Risk Solutions (IPRS) unit, which provides benchmarks for billions of dollars of assets in derivatives, structured products, mutual funds and exchange traded funds.Barclays is also the world’s leading provider of fixed income indices, and the sale of IPRS is expected to raise up to $500m. Two contenders – S&P Dow Jones Indices and Markit – have emerged as the favourites to acquire IPRS.Buying Barclays’ indexing business would help S&P Dow Jones Indices extend its reach into bond markets, building on its already considerable presence as a provider of equity and commodity benchmarks.Markit is arguably best known as a provider of benchmarks used in derivative contracts such as credit default swaps, but it also provides cash bond indices for which the Barclays indexing business would appear to be a natural fit.Index providers collect fees based on assets under management tied to their benchmarks. Record inflows in 2014 into fixed income exchange traded funds (ETFs) provide an illustration of the strategic importance of IPRS to a potential buyer.Vanguard’s Total Bond Market ETF has pulled in $5.8bn so far this year, while the BlackRock iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF has garnered $5.4bn. Both these ETFs track Barclays’ indices.However, inflows into those two ETFs are just part of a much broader shift into index-linked investments. Assets held in index tracking funds and mandates are forecast to reach $22.7tn by 2020, up from $7.3tn in 2012, according to a projection from the consultancy PwC.Asset growth on such an enormous scale is one of the key drivers behind the new alliances being forged between index providers and stock exchange operators, as the fortunes of these two sectors become ever more intertwined.Earlier this year, the London Stock Exchange Group bought Russell Investments, index compiler and asset manager, for $2.7bn from US insurer Northwestern Mutual.The LSE will combine Russell’s indexing business, which has $5.2tn of benchmarked assets, with its existing FTSE International operations, with $4tn of assets.The deal, which is the LSE’s biggest to date, will significantly increase the exchange’s presence in the US, where Russell’s equity indices are widely used in tracker funds and as benchmarks.In October 2012, Nasdaq OMX bought the margent family of dividend indices. As well as expanding its indexing operations, the deal should allow Nasdaq to offer a fuller range of services beyond trading and listings, areas where exchange operators’ revenues have been under pressure.In 2011, the exchange operator CME Group and McGraw Hill, the owner of S&P Indices, united their indexing businesses in a joint venture. The deal brought together under one roof the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index, the two most widely followed US equity benchmarks.More deals seem likely as other banks exit from their indexing businesses amid pressure from regulators who would prefer to see indices supplied by independent providers that do not sell financial products based on their proprietary benchmarks.In April, Bloomberg – which is building a presence in the indexing industry – acquired a family of Australian bond indices from UBS, and also assumed responsibility for the governance, calculation, distribution and licensing of the UBS commodity indices.But critics question whether end users are seeing real benefits from consolidation in the indexing industry, arguing that it is stifling competition and hindering innovation.In response, Alex Matturri, chief executive of S&P Dow Jones Indices, says consolidation in the indexing industry has brought “a lot of benefits” to end users.“Unifying the indexing operations of S&P and Dow Jones as a single provider has helped us develop new indices and to be more efficient in providing services to clients,” he says.But Christos Costandinides, a long-time industry analyst now working as an independent consultant, says that consolidation is giving more power to fewer players.He notes that end users are increasingly questioning the fees they have to pay, illustrated by Vanguard’s decision in 2012 to switch from using MSCI benchmarks to cheaper FTSE and CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices) indices.“There is growing discussion as to what the level of compensation should be for using an index and how much an index provider’s proprietary intellectual property is worth, especially for equity indices where a lot of the information is already available for free,” says Mr Costandinides.He believes there is broad consensus among investors supporting the need for reform, while adding that it is unclear which steps will best improve transparency and competitiveness.The large index providers that are attached to exchange operators and data providers will continue to be able to defend their current levels of fees and charges unless more is done to make the provision of data used in benchmarks more competitive, says Mr Costandinides.This is even more true for fixed income indices as the asset class trades over-the-counter, and therefore pricing information availability can be more limited.“A handful of players that often have exclusivity in access to certain asset prices gives disproportionate power to certain index providers, and makes it very difficult for anybody else to enter the space,” he says.But Mr Matturri of S&P Dow Jones Indices rejects this argument. “We have extensive relationships with exchange operators. But that does not preclude exchange operators from selling data to our competitors, such as MSCI and FTSE,” he says.
201;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-11-12T08:56:55Z;End of gold fix heralds shift for London;UK’s precious metals market faces growing competition from Asia;For centuries London’s precious metals markets have operated themselves. Gold has been moved between hidden vaults in the city, to customers from across the world. To this day, no one knows how much gold changes hands.Now, under pressure from regulators, one of the oldest markets in the world has been forced to open its doors to powerful global exchange groups who could bring the curtain down on bilateral over-the-counter trading.This month London’s prized bullion benchmark, or fix, which is used by miners, refiners and central banks to trade gold bars and value derivative contracts, was handed to the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to run electronically from early next year.That came hot on the heels of Chicago-based CME Group taking control of the 117-year silver fix and London Metal Exchange taking over the administration of the benchmarks for palladium and platinum.The dramatic overhaul of London’s precious metals markets is a result of increased regulatory scrutiny of financial benchmarks in the wake of the Libor and foreign exchange rigging scandal.But traders and industry watchers say the involvement of exchanges in London’s daily fixing could lead to greater costs and more red tape. The UK government has already given regulators the power to police seven key financial market benchmarks, including gold and silver.They say London’s existing over-the-counter gold market has advantages. These include allowing traders to work out the credit risk of dealing with a specific party rather than having to post collateral to an exchange, and warn that moving gold on to exchanges could bring more regulations that could have the unintended consequence of damping the market – or shifting it elsewhere.London already faces competition from exchanges in East Asia launching new physically-settled gold contracts that could draw in some of the business the City has traditionally enjoyed.In September, China’s Shanghai Gold Exchange launched an international gold contract in the city’s pilot free-trade zone, which includes a clearing system. That will allow foreign investors to buy gold in the country, the world’s biggest consumer.This month Singapore Exchange launched a new physically backed contract and CME Group is expected to start a physically backed futures contract in Hong Kong by the end of the year.But others say the benefits of trading on an exchange outweigh the costs. Not only is it more efficient, it is more transparent and therefore less prone to market abuse.“While there are benefits to OTC trading, typically trading happens through a handful of large institutions who dominate those markets,” says Rosa Abrantes-Metz, an adjunct professor at New York University. “When you have that happen with a lack of information coming out to the ultimate buyers and sellers, there is the potential of abuse.”Critics were given extra ammunition this week as US, UK and Swiss regulators slapped $4.3bn in penalties on six global banks as the result of an investigation into allegations of widespread rate-rigging in the foreign exchange markets.Switzerland’s financial regulator, Finma, also handed UBS a SFr134m ($139m) fine for “serious misconduct” in its forex and precious metals businesses.The UK will carry out an industry-wide “supervisory remediation programme” that will in some cases look at precious metals trading, the Financial Conduct Authority said on Wednesday.London’s gold market has long relied on over-the-counter trading between counterparties, with the London Bullion Market Association only being formed in 1987.The trade is regulated by a code drawn up by its members, rather than by rules that govern financial products. It was believed that professional investors could look after themselves, a principle known as “caveat emptor”, or “buyer beware”.Under the current system clearing still takes place through a company run by six banks – Barclays, Deutsche, HSBC, JPMorgan, Scotiabank and UBS, who at the same time regulate the process.That makes it impossible to estimate the total trading taking place in the London gold market, as positions are netted out. According to the LBMA in 2013, the daily average net amount of gold cleared through London was 21.95m ounces with an average daily value of $31bn.So far there has been little market demand for centrally cleared trading of gold products.Exchanges have tried to produce more gold products but with little success. In 2010, CME introduced London cleared gold forwards. The London Metal Exchange also introduced a gold forwards curve, yet discontinued it in September after market makers ceased to contribute data.*“The market is very polarised around the issue of central clearing,” one gold market bullion bank said.Market participants say it was no coincidence that the LBMA chose three different exchanges to run different precious metals, a sign they don’t want any one group to become too powerful or dominant. But it could do a more vocal job of showing the benefits of the existing OTC system, according to one market participant. Indeed, the gold fix has functioned for almost 100 years without very many problems.“If two private parties want to buy a lump of something I don’t think it should be restricted,” said Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault, a physical gold and silver exchange for private investors.* The marked paragraph has been amended to reflect that the LME introduced gold forwards data rather than contracts, as the article originally indicated.
202;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-11-06T11:56:13Z;Europe attracted by US derivatives pull;Rise in interest rates trading and credit default swaps clearing to the States;European derivatives trading has had a distinctly American flavour in recent months.Earnings reports from CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, and Intercontinental Exchange, its close rival, have shown a rise in both interest rates trading and credit default swaps (CDS) clearing to the US from the old continent.First CME Group, owner of the actively-traded eurodollar futures contract, said electronic average daily volume from European clients was 2.1m contracts in the three months to September 30, up 22 per cent year-on-year. That outperformed North America, which rose 13 per cent.Then ICE reported that 40 per cent of the $4.9tn of buyside gross notional cleared came from European buyside customers clearing through its US CDS clearing house in September.Both trends are notable, albeit for differing reasons. The CME put the influx down to greater demand for its US interest rate products. Its eurodollar futures contract is widely used by banks to hedge their exposure with dollar swap interest rates and of course, the Federal Reserve has just ended quantitative easing. By contrast, the European interest rate curve is dead.What is perhaps more surprising is that traders appear to be ignoring the bickering between US and European regulators over equivalence of each other’s derivatives clearing rules.For European banks the non-recognition of US clearing houses could mean applying onerous capital charges to balance sheets. The CME has estimated the charges could be in excess of 30 times current levels for some deals. While nothing is official yet, traders expect regulatory sense to prevail (once every other avenue has been exhausted). Nevertheless, that transatlantic volume flow could easily flow back again should the European Central Bank – hopefully – one day raise rates.More revealing is what is happening with ICE. The Atlanta group said investors’ behaviour was down to uncertainty over plodding legislation such as the European Market Infrastructure Review and Mifid II, the review of Europe’s main capital markets legislation.Emir will be introduced first but only from late next year while Mifid II will not kick in until 2017. Some parts of it will not come in until 2019. By contrast much of Dodd-Frank is done, and that has allow the CME and ICE to invest and focus on their US clearing houses.Bryan Durkin, CME’s chief commercial officer, noted new services such as coupon blending, compression and portfolio margining were “really bearing fruit”.But there is more to it with ICE. Behaviour is driven by incentives and ICE has deliberately sought to entice more CDS business to its US operations. There, investors can clear both index and single names and give back huge savings to customers on their collateral requirements by cross-margining their portfolios. CME does it too, but its eurodollar clearing business has always been in the US. ICE’s CDS business has been supplemented by clearing in London.“It’s surprising to see the European business leaving Europe and coming to the US. That isn’t something we really could’ve predicted even two years ago,” said Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, on the analyst call.Behind this lies another consideration. Post-financial crisis, Europe mandated to make its markets more competitive. That included opening access to clearing houses, allowing investors to open contracts on one trading venue and closing them on another.This is fine in theory but brings hazards if no other country is doing it. Exchanges such as CME and ICE have warned that policy would discourage innovation, or rather, shift it to a more favourable jurisdiction. As an insurance policy exchanges such as CME, ICE and Deutsche Börse are investing in the US and Singapore, which do not have the same definition of competition in their markets.ICE’s experiment with CDS has perhaps provided the first illustration of how it can be moved.
203;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-11-04T20:00:59Z;Trading industry strives to find its form;Low volatility, new rivals and onerous rules are taking their toll;On retiring from Sanford Bernstein last month, veteran analyst Brad Hintz penned some observations about the capital markets in which had worked for 30 years.In a memo to clients, he pointed out that the trading businesses of Wall Street were still generating returns far below their cost of capital six years after the crisis. Even so, he noted, most investors expected returns to rebound once services had been repriced to reflect increased regulatory costs.“But this is far from certain,” wrote Mr Hintz, who spent 13 years at Sanford and was once chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers. “Are the new rules coming from Washington, London or Basel just the fine-tuning of already established regulatory models or is there a conscious strategy to shift the capital markets business from the universal banks to smaller and presumably less systemically important participants?”Noting the rise of electronic trading venues, clearing houses and interdealer brokers, he added: “It appears the invisible hand of economics is at play.”Banks, under pressure, have pulled back on commodities and fixed income trading, leaving a gap in the market to be filled by new actors, such as hedge funds and other lightly regulated entities. Regulation has boosted revenues at clearing houses, which are mainly owned by exchanges. Equally, the market structure industry, which includes exchanges, clearing houses, brokers, traders, banks and data providers, has had to deal with its own set of post-financial crisis problems.National pride and concerns about systemic risk and competition have slowed deal making by exchanges in the past few years, with the notable exception of Intercontinental Exchange’s $11bn cash and shares purchase of NYSE Euronext. The deal, in November 2013, transformed Atlanta-based ICE into one of the world’s largest exchange operators. It also broke up an underperforming cross-border conglomeration put together at the height of the 2005-07 financial bubble.Exchanges, blocked from making big deals and with their profits hampered by low market volatility, have been starting afresh with longer-term projects such as clearing and collateral management services. Deals have been more focused, such as the London Stock Exchange Group’s $2.7bn agreement to buy Russell Investments, the US benchmark provider.“I think we will see exchanges start to evolve away from each other a bit more,” says Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq. “Some will choose indexes, others will choose technology. I think we will see that exchange comparisons are harder to make.”One of the biggest focuses for the industry has been growth in Asia in general, and China in particular, as it opens its capital account and begins to integrate its markets with the rest of the world. “To date, most of the volume in derivatives has come from speculative domestic retail activity in China. We are now seeing the widespread introduction of market-based pricing, initially in the underlying commodities markets,” says William Barkshire, managing director of Agora Partners and a former co-president of the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange.In the US, the new breed of equities trading venues – dark pools – face fresh regulatory scrutiny.In the derivatives markets, toughened standards have been a two-edged sword for operators. The rules stipulate that where possible, trading of all standardised over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts be conducted on regulated trading platforms and that more bilateral swaps should be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs or clearing houses) to manage their risk better.Regulators, operators and market participants alike have recognised them as potentially the new central points of systemic failure, but have not come to agreement on what to do if a clearing house fails.Three weeks ago, global regulators called for CCPs to be given all the tools needed to keep this critical market infrastructure alive rather than close them and risk a future market disaster.Others worry that latitude could lead to widely differing standards for trading and clearing derivatives in a global market.The European Association of Clearing Houses, which represents 22 regional CCPs, has called for a consistent global approach to the regulation of recovery and resolution frameworks of CCPs.As it has pointed out, clearing houses are too interconnected with banks. Most of its members “serve clearing members and clients connected to several legal jurisdictions”, it said.The trade association is keen to avoid a repetition elsewhere of the strained and protracted discussions between the US and Europe over recognising clearing houses based in each other’s territory as being regulated to an equivalent standard.The two jurisdictions, which account for the majority of the world’s derivatives trading, have made differing interpretations of the same G20 mandate, and an agreement has so far proved elusive.The row affects CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange and various European banks, all of which all conduct extensive cross-border business.Negotiators remain hopeful of a breakthrough. In September, Chris Giancarlo used his first speech as a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to warn against the stand-off deteriorating into local market protectionism.Calling for a change in US approach, he noted that fragmentation of the global swaps market “means smaller and disconnected liquidity pools and less efficient and more volatile pricing for market participants and their customers”.That volatility can manifest itself strikingly. Some market participants had a scare this year, when the malfunction of an algorithm trading derivatives – lasting 143 seconds – caused the collapse of a small local broker in South Korea.At first the incident barely registered until it emerged that the clearing house’s rules allowed it to bypass using its own funds and go straight to non-defaulters to help repay counterparties in the $4.3m default.For some, the arguments have gone far enough. Lance Uggla, chief executive of Markit, a UK data provider, says: “Regulators and the market have recognised the need to work together to rebuild the economy.”As for Mr Hintz, he will join New York University’s Stern School of Business and write a book that examines how Wall Street has changed in the face of tighter regulation and new technologies.It promises to be a fascinating read.
204;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-11-04T20:00:59Z;China’s financial reforms boost integration with global markets;Modernisation of the financial system has been swiftest in areas such as swaps and commodity futures;Despite the slow progress in implementing many of the large-scale economic and financial reforms endorsed in a landmark policy blueprint last year, China has made headway in modernising its financial market infrastructure and launching new financial and commodity derivatives.At the Third Plenum meeting in November 2013, Communist party leaders pledged to give markets a “decisive” role in resource allocation, including liberalising interest and exchange rates and putting privately owned companies on a par with state-owned enterprises.Though there has been little substantive progress on these broader issues, regulators have overseen swift development in margin trading, swaps clearing and commodity futures, among other changes. Margin trading began in earnest in late 2011 with the creation of the China Securities Finance Corp (CSFC), jointly owned by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges and the China Securities Depository & Clearing Corp.CSFC borrows cash or securities from brokerages, banks, fund management companies and insurers and lends to brokerages for use in margin trading and short selling.Margin trading has grown quickly, with margin loans outstanding reaching Rmb685bn ($112bn) by late October, up from Rmb90bn at the end of 2012, according to Choice, a Chinese financial data provider. Securities lending trails, however, and totals just Rmb4.2bn.This slow development in part reflects rules that make CSFC the only channel through which brokerages can borrow securities on behalf of clients. “CSFC sets a high price for refinance securities,” says Pan Hongwen, non-bank financial institutions analyst at UBS Securities in Shanghai.Chinese banks, which have little involvement in overseas derivatives markets, have been unaffected by the US financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank, which required US banks to conduct swap trades via central clearing houses. Nevertheless, the People’s Bank of China began phasing in central clearing of interest rate swaps this year via the Shanghai Clearing House, one of two state-backed clearing houses for the interbank market.China launched interest rate swaps in 2006 in the interbank market. Regulated by the National Interbank Funding Center, an affiliate of the central bank, the key reference rates are money-market interest rates, including the seven-day bond repurchase rate and the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate.The Shanghai Clearing House plans to offer central clearing of currency forwards and swaps, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange says it plans to require central clearing of these products eventually.In September, the Shanghai Clearing House signed a memorandum of understanding with CME Group. Xu Zhen, chairman of the SCH, has said it hopes to roll out a new product every two to three months over the next three years.Other areas of the swap market are languishing. China launched credit default swaps – officially known as credit-risk mitigation instruments – in 2010, but the market barely trades.Significant changes are also occurring in the area of commodity derivatives. The Shanghai Gold Exchange launched its international board last month, allowing foreign institutions to trade the metal for the first time.Officials stress that financial innovation should serve the needs of the real economyLocal affiliates of foreign commodity traders could already trade on the local gold exchange, but the latest move will eventually allow for arbitrage between the international and Chinese gold markets, where prices frequently diverge.China wants to assert greater influence over gold pricing, following its emergence as the world’s largest gold consumer in 2013. It also hopes renminbi-denominated gold contracts will boost the global clout of China’s currency.The gold futures contracts follow the launch of a central clearing service for premium swaps on copper, iron ore and thermal coal by the Shanghai Clearing House, which the central bank created for the interbank bond market. Premium swaps are derivatives based on the difference between the spot and futures prices.A crude oil futures contract is expected to be launched by the Shanghai Futures Exchange within months.Western exchanges have sought to develop links as China integrates its markets with the global economy. Trading has centred on four exchanges – Shanghai Futures Exchange, Dalian Commodity Exchange, Zengzhou Commodity Exchange and China Financial Futures Exchange.It will take years for China to rival the breadth and sophistication of foreign markets. Officials have prioritised risk prevention and continuously stress that financial innovation should serve the needs of the real economy.——————————————-Additional reporting by Ma Nan in Shanghai
205;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-11-04T20:00:59Z;Start-ups making waves in Chicago’s derivatives industry;Broader technological trends are bringing down the cost of entry for financial technology companies;"Last month, the world’s largest futures exchange played host to a meeting of tech workers, venture investors and traders. CME Group had not formally organised the event, but it had provided the venue and Rumi Morales, representing the CME’s new venture capital fund, was moving about the crowd.CME’s involvement demonstrates its appreciation of the important role that start-ups are likely to play in the future of the derivatives industry – and the city.Derivatives trading is going through an important transition, as electronic trading cements its hold on the industry.Broader technological trends are bringing down the cost of entry for financial technology companies, cloud- and web-based computing are making retail participation easier and new regulations are challenging the advantages of established incumbents.Among the newcomers are AlgoFast, which aims to take complex algorithmic trading to the masses, and Social Market Analytics, which trawls Twitter for data sophisticated enough to be used by traders.Then there is TopstepTrader, which allows retail traders to simulate futures trading with the aim of being invited to trade with the company’s money.The city’s leading exchanges, CME and CBOE, both acknowledge that innovation may now come more from the start-up world and have started venture capital initiatives.Mark Fields, managing director of CME’s strategic investment group, launched the company’s venture fund this year. It plans investments of between $500,000 and $5m to develop a pipeline of companies.The fund’s mandate is global and it has so far made investments in four companies: Wickr, a communications and cyber security firm; 1QBit, a software company; Powerlytics, a data analytics provider; and payments start-up Dwolla. None is Chicago-based, but Mr Fields says CME is looking in its home town. “We regard it as an extension of the 160 years of innovation and leadership in the financial industry that CME has had,” he says.“We [saw] a gap and recognised that technology was changing fast. We continue to innovate, but we wanted to look out three to five years in the future and the place you do that is in the venture community.”John Deters, chief strategy officer at CBOE, says his company’s initiative – which invests from early-stage to full maturity – operates according to a similar philosophy.“No longer are big ideas more likely to come from centralised, process-oriented R&D structures. It’s equally if not more likely that big ideas are going to be sourced from a broadly distributed network of creative individuals who are applying their talents to solving a problem,” he says. “We are concretely trying to make sure we’re part of the conversation.”In March, CBOE invested in New York-based Tradelegs, an analytics platform like many new fintech firms, following an earlier investment in the Chicago-based Intellectual Property Exchange International.Mr Deters notes that over the past decade, the decline of floor trading sent many people off to launch businesses, and has given Chicago’s trading community “an appreciation of individual creativity and what people can do when they’re out there with an idea”.This has been the mecca for derivatives since they were invented. Now that’s going awayJustin Bouchard, who founded AlgoFast in 2011, says the industry is “ripe for disruption”. But he says start-ups face big challenges, including high market data prices, legal and compliance issues, and the generally secretive nature of the industry, which runs counter to the open-source ethos of start-up culture.Joe Gits, founder of Social Market Analytics, says that the barriers can be high, but “the technology to get started isn’t nearly as challenging as it was in 1997”, when Mr Gits founded Quantitative Analytics, a data software company he later sold to Thomson.Rick Lane, chief executive of Trading Technologies, agrees. “Building tools for the professional trading community over the web isn’t something that has been done a lot to date,” he says.“Cloud technology enables start-ups to compete, where a couple of years ago they might not have been able to because of the costs.”That ability to compete may also give Chicago a chance to retain some of the derivatives industry dominance that it has lost, as trading has migrated to the computer screen, says Mark Longo, a former trader, who left the floor in 2007 to start Options Insider, which provides news and analysis on the industry.“This has been the mecca for derivatives since they were invented, and now that’s going away,” he says.“You can’t just walk off the street and start a derivatives-oriented start-up. You really need that deep knowledge . . . No where else is there a community like this, and if you want to keep it, you need to foster it.”"
206;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-11-04T19:09:03Z;ICE chief blasts rival’s tactics to lure users;Sprecher characterises CME strategy as ‘payment for order flow scheme’;The head of Intercontinental Exchange, the world’s second-largest exchange group by market value, launched an unusually explicit criticism of its bigger competitor’s business strategy as he touted growth in his flagship oil contract.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, said that the number of futures contracts outstanding in its benchmark Brent crude oil market had surpassed open interest in CME Group’s rival oil contract, West Texas Intermediate.Commercial customers such as refineries and airlines propelled this growth “as we see our competitors adopting incentives that attract the type of algorithm . . . trading that typically drives commercial users away,” Mr Sprecher said.Incentives such as rebates and payments to traders have a long history at futures exchanges trying to achieve critical mass as a centralised marketplace. Open interest and volumes in crude have climbed as oil prices slump close to $80 a barrel, forcing traders to reposition.Chicago-based CME Group two months ago revamped fee rebates for energy traders, with discounts that could top $16m annually for the biggest. It also offers free trading in its own Brent crude contract.Mr Sprecher said “payment for order flow schemes” such as CME’s expanded the market by “attracting traders that really don’t want to hold the risk of your products but just want . . . to get paid to be there.”ICE has expanded rapidly and raised its profile by acquisition, including the purchase of NYSE Euronext a year ago. But its roots as an energy exchange run deep. Brent crude housed at London-based ICE Futures Europe is its largest single source of revenue. Brent revenue rose 7 per cent year on year to $62m in the third quarter, ICE said.CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange, historically the biggest energy market, has been grabbing share in Brent trading, with volumes almost doubling this year to 70,000 contracts a day.CME said: “Our incentive programmes are designed to grow liquidity in our markets. Increased liquidity benefits all users.” It added: “We invest millions in policing our markets. Something our competitors should strive to [do] as well.”ICE also offers volume-based rebate programmes to traders, but not the cash bonus pool that CME has at times provided, a person familiar with the company said.Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston, said: “ICE really has no need to offer inducements because it is already the leader in Brent and bigger markets tend to be more liquid”.ICE said net profit in the third quarter was $206m, up 46 per cent from $141m a year ago. Adjusted for items related to the NYSE acquisition, net profit was $245m and earnings per share totalled $2.15, topping Wall Street forecasts.
207;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:34:32+0000;CME Group reports big switch to futures;Traders used instead of OTC interest rate swaps when volatility hit;Mayhem in interest rate markets this month attracted traders to listed futures contracts instead of derivatives traded over the counter, according to executives at CME Group, the biggest futures exchange.Their comments highlight the possibility of fund managers embracing futures as they navigate an eventual rise in US interest rates in a market transformed by new financial rules.Regulators have put pressure on trading operations run by banks, forcing big hedge fund and asset managers to choose whether to use more futures instead of the OTC interest rate swaps traditionally dealt by banks.Bond, currency and equity markets shuddered this month as fears of slowing growth sent interest rates unexpectedly lower, forcing money managers to liquidate bets on rate rises. The action was most violent on October 15, when the interest rate on 10-year US Treasury bonds plunged from 2.2 per cent to 1.86 per cent in a matter of hours before rebounding.CME executives on Thursday presented data to bolster the case that fund managers had flocked to futures on that date.In a presentation issued alongside third-quarter financial results, CME said volumes in its listed interest rate contracts had reached a record 25.1m contracts on October 15. In OTC markets the notional amount of cleared interest rate swaps was well below average.Phupinder Gill, chief executive, said: “People turned to the futures because [of] the liquidity that was there.”CME partly based its analysis of OTC markets on swaps executed between dealers – Wall Street banks – and customers and processed by clearing houses at CME and LCH.Clearnet.Other data sources indicate that swaps markets also witnessed a surge in volumes.Clarus Financial Technology has said trading in dollar interest rate swaps on swap execution facilities (Sefs) hit $136.6bn in notional value on October 15, a record and three times the average since Sef trading began about a year ago.October was on track to generate CME’s greatest volume on record, the company said as it presented results for the third quarter. The Chicago exchange operator reported net profit of $290m, or $0.86 per share, up 22 per cent from $236.7m, or 71 cents per share, from the quarter a year before.While volumes in three-month eurodollar interest rate contracts – the most active on CME – hit a record on October 15, open interest has declined since last month, suggesting some traders have been liquidating positions.
208;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-10-28T05:42:39Z;CME eyes Korea Exchange stake;Deal to open a new avenue for investors seeking to adjust their exposure to the South Korean won;CME Group is considering buying a stake in the Korea Exchange (KRX), the US company’s chief executive said, amid fierce competition among leading exchange operators to expand their presence in Asia.“It would make sense for us, if allowed, to participate in the upside of the exchange, particularly as we are planning to help the exchange on an international expansion,” said Phupinder Gill, CME chief executive.“We have a firm belief in aligning our interest with that of the exchange partners with whom we deal,” he said at the annual meeting of the World Federation of Exchanges.The two exchanges were set to deepen their partnership on Tuesday by announcing a deal that will allow trading of KRX’s currency derivatives through CME’s trading infrastructure.The deal will open a new avenue for investors or companies seeking to adjust their exposure to the South Korean won outside Seoul market hours, who must currently rely on the offshore non-deliverable forward market.A 2.5 per cent stake in KRX is set to come on to the market when the South Korean brokers NH Investment & Securities and Woori Securities merge, in a deal due to be completed by the end of this year. The pair together own 7.5 per cent of KRX, above the 5 per cent limit imposed on financial companies by South Korean law.Although it is owned mostly by local brokerages, KRX has been under state control since 2009 when the government designated it a “quasi-governmental institution” citing the company’s effective “monopoly” of its market.Ahn Sang-hwan, an executive director of KRX, said in August that there was “some concern about possible management interference if a foreign exchange buys a stake”.However, Mr Gill played down concerns about opposition to foreign ownership. “It’s not uncommon to see that [discomfort] anywhere in the world,” he said.CME may face competition for a stake in KRX: Standard & Poor’s and Deutsche Börse have also expressed interest. The German group’s Eurex futures arm, a key rival for CME in the global derivatives market, has since 2010 had a partnership with KRX allowing Eurex members direct access to Kospi 200 options, among the most heavily traded options contracts in Asia, after Korean trading hours.Deutsche Börse is also building a clearing house for Asia based in Singapore, where CME’s US rival IntercontinentalExchange is also set to revive an existing clearing house in the wake of its acquisition last year of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange.Some market participants argue that an Asian clearing house would reduce problems for CME’s Asian clients in the event of a default outside the region. But Mr Gill said that, when the company considered the challenges facing its clients, the option of building an Asian clearing house “falls out”.“It’s our view that . . . Asian clearing needs can be very comfortably met either from London or from the US,” he said. “We’ve seen exchanges putting the cart before the horse and we don’t think that’s the right thing to actually do.”
209;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-10-27T23:09:41Z;LME taps China investors’ metals interest;Focus comes as economy slows but demand expected to remain robust;It is a tradition at the London Metal Exchange’s annual black tie dinner in the ballroom of the Grosvenor House Hotel to bet on the length of the speech. At 28 minutes this year’s not only surprised to the upside, it also came with an ominous warning.Apurv Bagri, the head of a metals company set up by his father in 1970, cautioned the assembled owners of the 137-year-old bourse, which plays a pivotal role setting prices that affect producers and consumers from smelters in China to the copper wires used in US wind farms, not to destroy the golden goose.“If over time the LME is reshaped into a lookalike American style exchange then the very barriers that have prevented competition will dissipate, and lead to the erosion of our dominant position,” he said.It is a debate that was evident throughout LME week, the annual event that saw traders, producers and buyers descend on London. Bought by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing for $2.2bn in 2012, the exchange now wants to capitalise on its purchase, especially its ability to expand into mainland China, the biggest consumer and producer of most metals.The focus on China comes as the country’s economy is slowing yet demand for industrial metals is expected to remain robust. Participants at LME Week were mildly bullish on zinc, which is used to galvanise stainless steel, and nickel but less so on copper, used for construction and in electrical appliances.Asked by Macquarie Bank at its annual base metals conference which metal they would most like to “short” on a 12-month view, 400 participants named copper as their favourite short for the first time since the financial crisis, in contrast to zinc which was the least preferred short.Overall sentiment was generally subdued with traders, analysts and bankers predicting broadly flat metal prices over the next year. For example, the weighted average price forecasts for cash copper in one year’s time at the Macquarie conference was $6,663 a tonne, little different to Monday’s price of $6,762.But where there was a positive vibe it was concentrated on those metals where there is supply-side tightness such as zinc and nickel.“We look at all the big ore bodies and there’s no zinc coming on,” said Andrew Michelmore, chief executive of MMG, a subsidiary of state-owned Minmetals, which is developing the vast Las Bambas copper mine in Peru. “I’m even more bullish on zinc than copper.”The key to both supply and demand, of course, remains China and if Charles Li, the chief executive of HKEx, gets his way, ever more Chinese traders should be able to reflect that in the LME price.At the dinner Mr Li announced the launch of Asian contracts for aluminium, zinc and copper in Hong Kong, in which trading will start in December in renminbi. Known as “minis” since they offer lots of 5 tonnes rather than the standard 25 tonnes, they are expected to target China’s numerous retail investors who already trade heavily on domestic futures exchanges.The contracts will be cash settled on the third Wednesday of each maturity month – rather than physically settled as in traditional LME contracts.The exchange wants to tap into the liquidity available in China’s domestic markets in the hope that capital controls will further ease as Premier Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping carry out their reform agenda. Yet that will require designing contracts Chinese buyers are happy with.A previous attempt by Singapore’s exchange to launch similar Asian renminbi contracts fell flat. Inside China, LME faces competition from the Shanghai Futures Exchange and the Dalian Commodity Exchange, who already have large numbers of participants.Total turnover on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 36 per cent last year to 60.4tn yuan ($9.9tn).“Charles Li has it in his mind this is the future, but who’s going to play with him?” the head of one-London based brokerage with a seat at the LME, said.Catherine Raw of BlackRock on outlook for zinc, nickel and goldWhile members welcome the prospect of more trading from China, they caution against making the LME resemble other established futures exchanges such as Comex on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and competing with them head on. This is a charge denied by the LME, which says it is building out its business globally with guidance from its members.Attracting new members from Asia should not be designed to simply transfer current business flows, Mr Bagri said in his dinner speech.At the most extreme it would mean an end to the LME’s floor traders who shout orders from the “ring”, the last open-outcry trading floor in Europe. The daily official and closing prices for the most widely used base metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc are determined entirely, or in part, on the trading floor.The “ring” still plays an important role in price discovery, because the LME’s contracts are settled on specific dates rather than months like the US exchanges. While producers and consumers like and use these contracts, some of the financial community want standard monthly outright contracts, according to the LME, which is working on plans to concentrate liquidity on a third ‘Wednesday’.“The LME is a forwards market not a futures market. If you change the contracts then that’s the end of the floor traders, they’re gone,” said one bank analyst.
210;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-10-27T16:28:32Z;Kengeter to become chief executive at Deutsche Börse;Kengeter replaces longstanding CEO Francioni;Carsten Kengeter is set to become chief executive of Deutsche Börse in a comeback by the former head of UBS’s investment bank who left last year after the Swiss lender decided to wind down large parts of its bond trading business.The former fixed income trader, who is aged 47, will succeed Reto Francioni after the company’s annual meeting in June next year, Europe’s largest stock market operator by value said on Monday.He will take the helm from one of the longest-standing chief executives of a German Dax-listed company, after Mr Francioni spent almost a decade leading the Frankfurt-based group.The Swiss native’s contract had been scheduled to run until October 2016, but he will reach the group’s internal age limit of 60 next year. After that, his contract could have only been extended by one year at a time, according to the group’s bylaws.“Everything must come to an end, even if it’s not easy for me to take this step,” said Mr Francioni.Mr Kengeter is returning to a top management role about 18 months after he left UBS in the wake of turbulent times at the Swiss lender.He stepped down from the bank’s management board in 2012 to run UBS’s non-core operations, which housed a large part of the former bond trading business. But he departed from the Swiss lender altogether only a few months later.The former Goldman Sachs banker is credited with having overseen the restructuring of UBS’s legacy subprime mortgage portfolio as well as the – later to be reversed – expansion drive of the fixed-income trading unit.But his tenure has also been overshadowed by troubles in the investment bank that included the Kweku Adoboli unauthorised trading scandal.Mr Kengeter has spent the past year involved in personal investments into financial technology companies and as a guest professor at the London School of Economics, where he steered a research project looking into unintended consequences of regulatory intervention in financial markets.The insights from this research and his derivative expertise are expected to be beneficial for his new job, given that the group is banking on more business from new regulatory rules that force more over-the-counter trades on to exchanges.Mr Francioni’s tenure since 2005 was characterised by ambitions to broaden the group’s international presence.He was appointed shortly after Deutsche Börse’s failed bid for the London Stock Exchange in 2004. Frustration after another failed bid in 2012, when the European Commission blocked a $9bn merger proposal between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext that would have created the world’s largest equity and derivatives exchange, prompted him to label it a “black day” for Europe.Since then, the group has set its sights on Asia, with plans to open a clearing house in Singapore next year as part of its attempt to grab market share in the region from US rival CME Group.The push into Asia is also seen as a way of offsetting weakness in the börse’s core market, where the EC wants to enable greater competition among exchanges and reduce the market dominance of the biggest operators.The company said revenues rose 8 per cent in the third quarter to €496m, beating expectations, as it reported that trading activity towards the end of the period had picked up “significantly”.The group also said Andreas Preuss, deputy chief executive and touted as a potential successor to Mr Francioni, had agreed to stay on until May 2018.
211;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
212;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-10-22T16:52:39Z;BGC launches hostile $675m offer for rival GFI;Interdealer broker acts after ‘delays’ in striking negotiated takeover deal;BGC Partners has launched a hostile $675m bid for rival US interdealer broker GFI Group after becoming frustrated with delays to a negotiated deal.The New York-based group will offer to buy the 86.5 per cent of shares in GFI it does not own in a deal that values the interdealer broker at a tender offer of $5.25 a share.If successful, the bid would break up a deal the GFI board had agreed over the summer with CME Group, the US futures exchange, to buy GFI at $4.55 a share. As a shareholder, BGC has argued the CME bid undervalues GFI as it would sell the company at a discount to its cash pile.The offer will put the focus on the GFI board as about 40 per cent of equity is owned by company employees. Shares in GFI rose 1.6 per cent to $5.21 as investors bet that BGC would succeed. BGC shares rose 1.4 per cent to $7.60.For both suitors, the prize is ownership of GFI’s fast-growing electronic energy and foreign exchange businesses, Trayport and Fenics. For differing reasons, both the interdealer broker and the exchange are keen to expand into electronic trading.Low market volatility and volumes have tempered investor appetite for hedging instruments such as swaps and cut into brokers’ profits. Bourses are eyeing opportunities from the global regulatory push to make the bilateral, telephone-based OTC market more electronic. The assets would allow CME to expand in the growing European energy trading market.GFI, the smallest of the five global interdealer brokers, agreed in September to open its books to BGC provided the two could negotiate a confidentiality clause.“Despite our best efforts to engage with GFI regarding a negotiated transaction, we have been met with only unreasonable demands and delay tactics in connection with our attempts to execute even a confidentiality agreement covering information on the Trayport and Fenics businesses with GFI and its management. It is time to allow GFI shareholders to choose for themselves,” said Howard Lutnick, BGC chief executive.GFI declined to comment. In September it described the BGC offer as “not at this stage sufficiently detailed or definitive” for it to recommend to shareholders ahead of the CME offer.CME has agreed to pay $580m in an all-stock transaction and take on $240m of debt to buy all of GFI. In a separate deal, CME will offload GFI’s brokerage and clearing businesses to GFI’s management, led by founder Mickey Gooch and Colin Heffron, chief executive, for $165m. BGC has argued the deal would give GFI $191m in cash. CME shares traded down at 0.2 per cent $79.86.BGC has secured funding from Morgan Stanley for its tender offer. The offer will end on November 19.
213;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-10-16T19:15:17Z;Record day for derivatives exchanges;CME, ICE and CBOE report high contract volumes;As fear swept markets on Wednesday, US derivatives exchanges hit record highs.CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and CBOE Holdings all reported record volume in various contracts on a day that saw the Dow Jones log its biggest intraday fall for three years as investor fears on global growth led them to exit trades and opt for the haven of highly rated government debt.CME reported daily volume hitting 39.6m contracts traded – the single-highest total in its 166-year history – eclipsing the previous record of 26.9m set on May 29 2013. The Chicago-based company had heavy volume in its flagship interest rate futures contracts while Eurodollar futures doubled the previous record, to 11.5m contracts. In all CME saw a record day in nine categories.Rival ICE beat its previous single-day record in its US dollar index futures by nearly 2,000 contracts, with trading in 118,291 contracts.CBOE, operator of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, also experienced record volumes on Wednesday in its options on the S&P 500 index, futures on its flagship volatility index (Vix) and options at its C2 options exchange.US banks placed most of the blame for the wild swings in US government bond prices on new bank regulations they say have reduced market liquidity. The rules, put in place since the 2008 financial crisis, are meant to make the banking system safer, but banks say Wednesday’s volatility shows the rules hamper their ability to absorb market stress.Some analysts have said high-frequency trading and other factors also played a part.
214;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-10-15T14:22:38Z;Quick View: CME faces up to painful reality;Chicago exchange faces up to change with job cuts;One of the biggest criticisms in the industry for years has been the number of employees CME Group has employed. Now it is slimming down.Under a euphemistically-titled “refocus on future growth”, the CME is cutting 5 per cent of its global workforce, around 150 jobs.The biggest impact is on the poor people on the end of the horrible experience. Beyond that, the move sends a message to the rest of the world about what the CME, the world’s largest exchanges operator by market value, wants to be.As Terry Duffy, CME’s executive chairman, pointed out: “The industry has changed significantly in the last five years with the advent of over-the-counter derivatives clearing.” That has required a lot of time and effort in understanding regulations that affect both exchanges, clearing houses and their customers, banks and electronic traders.The problem, as many are finding out, is that the changes have yet to translate into corporate earnings and this has been exacerbated by low trading volumes.A few numbers illustrate the problem. In recent years CME’s expenses have steadily been rising, from $1.17bn in 2010 to $1.29bn last year. Until now, it would seem there is more of the same. For the six months to June 30, it has recorded expenses of $642m compared with $621m a year ago.In that same 2010-13 period, group revenues have been steady, going from $3bn to $2.9bn. Consequently its margins have fallen from 61 per cent to 56 per cent. Something had to give. Technology, corporate and administrative functions are the areas likely to bear the brunt.Now it’s the big 800-pound gorilla of market infrastructure, it’s sometimes forgotten that just over a decade ago the CME was a relatively small, nimble regional futures exchange with around 600 employees.Thanks to the purchases of the Chicago Board of Trade and Nymex, those employee numbers have swelled fourfold. The UK now employs around 300 people alone.But therein is the problem. As the company grew, demutualised, became answerable to shareholders and developed international ambitions, its structure changed.Mr Duffy pointed to the board’s intention to “reduce management layers”. Longtime CME employees have privately grumbled that these extra layers have hurt their ability to introduce new products and react. It has lost that snappiness it once had, they say. Perhaps it’s an inevitable consequence of the parent company’s growth.The clear and unflattering comparison here is with CME’s big rival IntercontinentalExchange, which barely existed 15 years ago. In the space of a year ICE will have floated Euronext, moved Liffe on to its own technology, taken over running of IsdaFix and bought the Singapore Mercantile Exchange and SuperDerivatives.A wide range of stakeholders having power in decision-making is welcome and rare, but it can also leave an institution open to unwieldy process that slows down changeCME, by contrast, has taken over running of the silver fix and has seen its main deal, a bid to buy the Fenics and Trayport software parts of GFI Group for $680m, become mired in uncertainty.It is clear that CME wants to regain some of its former suppleness, which can only be welcomed. Still, there remains one part of CME that stubbornly refuses to slim down to a more standard size: its board.Management have only just come out of a bruising battle with members to cut it down to 21 by the start of 2015. That’s still nearly double the largest board of any company in the S&P 500, according to Institutional Shareholder Services. The overbearing size is in part down to its history as a mutual exchange and articles of incorporation that require the presence of six directors representing traders and users.A wide range of stakeholders having power in decision-making is welcome and rare, but it can also leave an institution open to unwieldy process that slows down change.
215;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:23:53+0000;US agency aims to grow tri-party clearing;FICC wants to expand service to include funds and large investors;The Fixed Income Clearing Corporation will announce on Wednesday it is seeking regulatory approval to expand its safeguarding of trades in a crucial $1.6tn segment of the financial system known as the tri-party repo market.The move comes after regulators at the Federal Reserve expressed concerns about the repo market, where financial institutions from large banks to hedge funds pawn their assets in exchange for trillions of dollars worth of short-term financing.The repo market is an important component of the shadow banking system and became Ground Zero for the 2008 financial crisis after creditors pulled back on their repo lending to broker-dealers including Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.The abrupt withdrawal of repo funding constituted a run on these broker-dealers and alerted regulators to the vulnerability of other financial institutions that relied on short term loans to finance their assets.Since then, Fed regulators have tried to reform the market by reducing reliance on repo and correcting perceived points of weakness in what has come to be known as the plumbing of the financial system.In particular, the Fed has worked to reform the tri-party market that sees JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon sit between many repo transactions. Despite that multiyear effort, regulators are still worried about the prospect of a “fire sale” of the collateral that secures tri-party repo loans.The FICC, part of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, clears tri-party and bilateral repo deals struck between banks and broker-dealers but wants to expand its tri-party service to include funds and other large investors.Clearing trades is supposed to make the repo market safer by ensuring orderly liquidation of positions in the event of a bank or fund going under. Under the DTCC’s proposal, investment funds would become limited purpose members of the FICC and provide some interim liquidity in the event of a member’s default.“Centralising the clearing and settlement of repo transactions through FICC could potentially help to prevent another squeeze in tri-party funding such as the one observed in 2008 when funds sharply reduced their lending during the run-up to the Lehman failure,” said Murray Pozmanter, managing director at the DTCC.“It would also provide regulators with a broader and more comprehensive view of the repo market for the monitoring and management of systemic risk as well as mitigate risks associated with a fire sale in the tri-party marketplace.”Despite the enormous size of the repo market, data on the complex web of transactions remains patchy at best especially for bilateral deals that are not cleared.The FICC needs approval from the US Securities Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve and expects to submit its proposal as soon as this month. The new service would cover almost three quarters of the $1.6tn tri-party market.Other entities including CME Group and LCH.Clearnet are believed to be exploring expanded clearing services for some repo trades.Such moves come at a time when banks have already been reducing their use of repo thanks to new capital requirements and rules that make it more expensive for them to arrange the transactions on behalf of their clients. The Fed has also taken over a sizeable chunk of the market thanks to its new reverse repo programme.One repo market expert said: “Repo used to be something that banks made money off of, now the central counterparties will make money off of it and the Fed is just going to do more of it.”Mr Pozmanter said that despite adding to repo transaction costs, the expanded FICC clearing service was likely to be received favourably by banks since it does not change the fundamental structure of a tri-party repo market that remains dominated by JPMorgan and BNYMellon.“We’re not looking to change the market structure,” he said.
216;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-10-14T18:26:50Z;CME cuts 150 jobs in company rejig;Most losses will be technology jobs based in Chicago;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, said it would cut 150 jobs, or 5 per cent of its global workforce, as it seeks to reorganise operations in the face of a changing derivatives industry.Most of the cuts will be technology jobs, with the remainder in administrative and corporate roles, and the majority will be in Chicago.“Our industry has transformed significantly over the past five years, with the advent of OTC Clearing and other changes,” said Terry Duffy, executive chairman.“These staffing changes and other expense control measures we have taken internally will result in decreased costs and reduced management layers, and will help ensure the company’s long-term continued growth.”The move comes weeks after the company reorganised its executive suites, with head of clearing Kim Taylor becoming president of global operations, technology and risk. Bryan Durkin, chief commercial officer, will take on a new role focused on client relationships, while a number of other executives will take on new or expanded roles.The exchange group lost its Asia head, Julien Le Noble, in a surprise departure last month, which came as CME and its rivals are trying to step up growth in what is expected to be the next great growth frontier.In August, Jamie Parisi announced his retirement as chief financial officer.CME is experiencing a record October for trading volume, according to Sandler O’Neill, with open interest also near record levels so far this month, as investors turn to futures to offset the risk of a potential looming rise in interest rates.Shares in the company rose 1.69 per cent, to 80.35, in early New York trading.
217;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-10-10T09:13:54Z;GFI in a bind with BGC proposal;GFI Group finds itself in a tight spot after proposal by rival interdealer broker BGC Partners;"The month-long stand-off between US interdealer brokers BGC Partners and GFI Group shows few signs of ending soon.BGC needs to make a decision about whether to go ahead with its proposed tender offer of $5.25 a share for its rival, which has been holding out.If it proceeds, that will ratchet the pressure on GFI to break up its agreed deal with CME Group, the US futures exchange. The GFI board has so far agreed to open its books, subject to both sides signing a confidentiality agreement, but stopped short of recommending BGC’s proposal to shareholders. But it may yet have to take that next step; BGC has GFI in a tight spot.CME has agreed to pay $4.55 per share in an all-stock transaction valuing GFI at $580m while also taking on $240m in outstanding debt. In a separate deal, CME will also offload GFI’s brokerage and clearing businesses to GFI’s management, headed by founder Mickey Gooch and chief executive Colin Heffron.But it is this side deal that has irked BGC, which holds a 13.5 per cent stake in GFI. The headline price is for $165m in cash and the assumption, at closing, of $65m in unvested deferred compensation and other liabilities.BGC has put its finger on a thorny problem; GFI’s cash position. Second-quarter earnings showed GFI had total cash of $231m, which comprised $173m of cash on its balance sheet and a further $58m of “cash held at clearing organisations, net of customer cash”.That extra $58m is parked at clearing houses and is treated as a receivable. After all, some is effectively customer cash and payable to GFI’s clearing customers. A chunk of it, though, is cash held at clearing houses and exchanges to settle and clear matched principal transactions, the main job of an interdealer broker.This extra $58m has to be divided up carefully, since one of those clearing houses belongs to the CME. As the SEC filing (but not the press release) shows, the two envisage CME keeping around $40m of the total. As a result, it would hand over around $191m or so to the consortium.Admittedly the vast majority of that cash will be needed for GFI’s regulatory and working capital requirements. Even so, with the total cash exceeding the value of the business, there is merit to BGC’s allegation that the CME deal “allows GFI management to purchase the brokerage business from CME at a discount”.Illustrating the point, interdealer brokers have historically been valued substantially above their net cash position. Tullett Prebon has around £30m of net cash and is valued at $910m.An alternative is GFI tears up this side deal, or the whole thing. That would allow the CME to compete on a level playing field with BGC. But it could also let in othersBGC’s interest may be more substantial than thought – it was buying shares in GFI in mid-July – although that may have been blown out of the water by the CME offer and is now angling for the best possible price for its asset. With access to the books as both a competitor and shareholder, it will have a very shrewd idea of what GFI is worth.With GFI’s share price around $5.29 per share, the market is still expecting BGC to prevail. The irony is that neither side is particularly interested in the brokerage business. For both, the prize is ownership of GFI’s electronic energy and foreign exchange software businesses, Trayport and Fenics.If GFI sticks with the CME bid, it risks shareholder wrath that it has not realised appropriate value. If BGC becomes the preferred acquirer, the CME will have to pay much more to retain the same deal structure. An alternative is that GFI tears up this side deal, or even the whole thing. That would allow the CME to compete on a level playing field with BGC. However it could also let in others."
218;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:34:32+0000;Chicago prosecutor gets tough on ‘spoofing’;Attorney brings first criminal charge against spoof trade entry;For professional traders in financial markets, the potential consequences of “spoofing” are not funny.Variants of spoofing, the strategy of entering and quickly cancelling securities or futures orders to trick others into making trades, have long been punishable by fines – usually in the thousands of dollars.Last week the potential consequences escalated sharply when a high-frequency trader was indicted by a grand jury over alleged spoofing and fraud. If convicted, he faces 25 years in prison.The first criminal case against spoofing has unsettled traders around Chicago, a hub for proprietary firms that use sophisticated algorithms to outwit one another. The US attorney in Chicago who brought the charges, Zachary Fardon, earlier this year formed a new unit to focus on securities and commodities fraud – a strong signal in a city where federal prosecutors are known for bringing gang and public corruption cases.“This is a watershed moment in the futures industry,” says Michael Creadon, chief executive of Traditum, a Chicago trading group. “There’s never been an indictment for what’s essentially order entry.”Congress explicitly outlawed spoofing with the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010. But under other names, the practice was previously banned by exchanges. CME Group, the largest US futures exchange operator, recently told a traders’ organisation that disciplinary actions for disruptive trading date as far back as 2002.Nor is spoofing limited to automated trading. Last week the Commodity Futures Trading Commission obtained a $1.56m civil fine against a trader named Eric Moncada for attempting to manipulate wheat futures prices. In a court filing, CFTC lawyers said Mr Moncada manually placed and cancelled orders in a “practice commonly referred to as ‘spoofing’”. He has not, however, been charged with any crime.Mr Fardon brought the criminal spoofing case against a trader named Michael Coscia. According to the indictment, Mr Coscia designed computer programmes named “Flash Trader” and “Quote Trader” to place orders in markets such as gold and currency futures “that he intended to immediately cancel before they could be filled,” moving the market in a direction favourable to him and generating $1.6m in profit.What surprises some traders and lawyers about the indictment is that Mr Coscia already settled related civil charges with the CFTC and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority in 2013, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. He paid millions of dollars in fines.Dan Waldman, head of the derivatives practice at law firm Arnold & Porter, says: “Criminal indictments for trading activity are rare. So [Coscia’s indictment] sends a pretty strong signal.”Richard Reibman, a lawyer for Mr Coscia, declined to comment on the case. The defendant is scheduled to be arraigned on the criminal charges next week.In the past three years, CME’s regulation wing has brought more than 40 exchange disciplinary actions for spoofing, misleading, or intentionally or recklessly disruptive conduct, it told the traders’ organisation.In one case CME cited as an example of spoofing, trader James Chiu was fined $155,000 after being found to have violated exchange rules in part by entering orders in stock index futures, “most of which he did not affirmatively want to be filled”, then cancelling them less than a second later, according to a disciplinary notice.What’s interesting is that we’re finally seeing the potential of jail time for someone who wrote an algo that broke the rulesRegulatory records show Mr Chiu was employed by the large Chicago firm Jump Trading at the time of the alleged violation in 2010. He could not be reached. Jump, which was not named in the case, declined to comment.Some market participants say the line between spoofing and legitimate trading is blurred and that any victims of spoofing are other speedy traders, not ordinary investors. CME sought to clarify what was disallowed by issuing a new anti-spoofing rule last month.Drew Shields, director of product management and marketing at software maker Trading Technologies, says spoofing is “a bush-league move” that most elite high-frequency firms do not engage in.“What’s interesting is that we’re finally seeing the potential of jail time for someone who wrote an algo that broke the rules,” adds Mr Shields, who was chief technology officer at Chicago-based proprietary firm Infinium Capital Management.The head of one high-frequency firm says the new indictment is “a very loud shot heard by everybody”, causing traders to review how they place orders.“This case is a big deal because it alleges the type of manipulative conduct that regulators and investigators have been most concerned about in this space,” says Lorin Reisner, a former federal prosecutor and deputy director of enforcement at the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
219;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-10-07T17:03:15Z;CME wins clearing approval in Australia;ASX will face further competition in the A$18tn over-the-counter derivatives market;CME Group is to join the increasingly competitive market for clearing off-exchange interest rate swaps in Australia after local authorities approved its application to allow local banks to connect to the US clearing house.The approval by the Treasury means that CME will pitch for local banks’ for business, two years after LCH.Clearnet, the transatlantic clearing house, was approved to operate its own clearing house alongside incumbent ASX Clear, owned by the main Australian stock and derivatives exchange.ASX will face further competition in the A$18tn over-the-counter derivatives market, which its chief executive Elmer Funke Kupper has identified as a key growth area for the exchange. Many of Australia’s overseas banks use the LCH service.Regulators want to move over-the-counter derivative markets on to more transparent trading venues such as exchanges, with deals processed by clearing houses. A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, guaranteeing that the deal is completed even if one side defaults.CME will be allowed clear interest rate swaps, used by investors to hedge against risk and speculate on changes to interest rates. It will also be allowed to clear non-Australian dollar denominated interest rate derivatives that are traded on the CME or its CBOT market. Both venues allow investors to net the margin they must post to back their trades against margin investors have posted to back their interest rate swaps.The move comes amid concern that the country’s 23-year long economic boom is coming to an end as commodities prices like iron ore tumble. Commodities make up the bulk of Australia’s exports.Opening up the OTC derivatives clearing market to competition comes only three years after the Australian government cited the importance of clearing and settlement functions behind its decision to squash plans for SGX, the Singapore Exchange, to buy ASX. At the time the Treasury said it was critical that clearing assets remained in the country.The CME has two clearing houses, opening a London operation last year to complement its long-established US business.This article has been amended to reflect that CME has not opened a clearing house in Australia
220;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-10-03T16:44:05Z;Frazzled livestock traders given a rest;The change comes as US meat prices reach all-time highs as drought and disease cut herd sizes;Cattle and hog traders fatigued by a record run are about to get their lives back.CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, on Friday said it would shorten the electronic trading session for livestock markets from 23 hours a day to eight hours or less.The move is a reversal for CME, which depends on fees from trading volumes for the bulk of its revenue, after it expanded hours in 2007.Prices of benchmark cattle and lean hogs futures have surged to all-time highs this year as drought and disease cut herd sizes in the US. On CME’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange, trading volumes in slaughter-ready “live” and younger “feeder” cattle were up 9.2 per cent and 20.5 per cent in the year to date, respectively.The combination of round-the-clock trading and heavier volumes meant long days in the office and tiresome price monitoring in the middle of the night, said George Enloe, a cattle broker at Amarillo Brokerage in Texas.“People like us and our customers had to be on point virtually all the time,” Mr Enloe said.As computer screens replaced the exchange floor as the main futures trading venue, CME expanded hours and allowed traders to connect from around the world.“There was a period of time when everyone was expanding hours. Quite frankly, everyone believed that was the right strategy,” said Tim Andriesen, CME Group’s managing director of agricultural commodities and alternative investments.But meat is not internationally traded as much as grain and oil, meaning the core of CME’s livestock market still consists of US-based ranchers, processors and consumers.“A lot of the feedback we got from them was they felt shorter hours would more concentrate liquidity,” Mr Andriesen said.It is rare, but not unprecedented, for CME to cut back trading hours. In 2012, the exchange operator proposed to extend the trading day for grain and oilseed futures to 21 hours as it sought to fend off a competitive threat from IntercontinentalExchange.After complaints from traders, CME shortened the grain trading day to 17.5 hours, giving Chicago-based traders a long break in the afternoon.The livestock changes come as meat prices have been surging. CME October live cattle futures this week hit a record $1.64 a pound. The market has gained 21 per cent this year. The 95m head of cattle on US farms is the lowest population since records began in 1973.Lean hogs futures also broke records this year, as a piglet-killing virus swept through farms. The CME October lean hogs were $1.0525 a pound on Friday, with the market up 23 per cent in 2014.Mr Enloe said he expected the new hours, due to take effect on October 27, will “compress volume into shorter trading sessions and potentially increase liquidity a bit”.The 23-hour days have had a more personal impact, Mr Enloe added. “You’ve got people with young families and they’re missing the evening meal. There’s just no need for that,” he said.
221;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-10-02T17:50:36Z;Trader faces criminal ‘spoofing’ charges;Michael Coscia allegedly used algorithms to submit false bids;A high-frequency trader has been indicted on charges that he manipulated commodities markets by “spoofing” – marking the first time US authorities have criminalised the practice.Commodities trader Michael Coscia, owner of Panther Energy Trading in New Jersey, allegedly used computer algorithms to submit false bids, known as spoofing, to trick the market into thinking there was buying and selling interest in a range of commodities futures, including gold, soyabean meal and high-grade copper.Prosecutors allege that once buyers stepped into the market driving the prices up, he would cancel the orders and sell his position at artificially high prices. Between August and October 2011 he made nearly $1.6m by defrauding participants in the CME Group and ICE Futures Europe markets, according to the indictment.“Traders and investors deserve a level playing field, and when the field is tilted by market manipulators, regardless of their speed or sophistication, we will prosecute criminal violations to help ensure fairness and restore market integrity,” Zachary Fardon, the US attorney for the Northern District of Chicago, said in announcing the charges.Mr Coscia was indicted on six counts of commodities fraud and six counts of spoofing. It is the first prosecution to be brought under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that bans the manipulative trading practice.He faces as much as 25 years in prison if found guilty. He will be arraigned on the charges at a future date. Mr Coscia’s attorney declined to comment on the allegations.The criminal charges are a signal to the market and also to Mr Coscia personally. Last year he agreed to pay $2.8m to settle civil charges alleging the same misconduct with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority imposed a fine of $903,000 (£597,000). The criminal investigation was launched after the civil cases were settled, according to people familiar with the matter. At the time it was the first action by the CFTC under its new powers granted by the Dodd-Frank law.The criminal charges come as regulators and law enforcement agencies are investigating the role of high-frequency traders and whether they are manipulating the market. To date there have been a handful of civil actions taken by regulators over spoofing, but it had not previously been elevated to a criminal prosecution.To prove the case, law prosecutors need to show that Mr Coscia placed the orders with no intention of filling them. The case will probably draw the attention of the market, where many orders are cancelled daily.Last month, the CME adopted a new rule expressly prohibiting disruptive trading including spoofing. Among the factors exchange monitors watch for is “whether the market participant’s intent was to induce others to trade when they otherwise would not”, according to the rule. The CME declined to comment on the charges.Additional reporting by Neil Munshi
222;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-09-26T09:26:01Z;Quick View: FX industry gets organised;Forex industry fights back with its own lobby group;"It’s the world’s biggest, most liquid and most accessible market and is closely watched by governments and central banks alike. Yet now the foreign exchange market also feels the need for a lobby group to look out for its interests.Yesterday saw the launch of the Foreign Exchange Professionals Association (FXPA), which aims “to engage key US and international regulators, policy makers, the general public and news media” in a range of industry issues.Impressively, it has wide cross-industry support, with founder members from banks (Bank of New York Mellon), institutional investors (CALPERS), infrastructure providers (CME Group, LCH.Clearnet, LMAX Exchange, Traiana) and market middlemen (GFI Group, Virtu Financial and Citadel).Adam Cooper, chief legal officer at Citadel, is chairman and Derek Sammann, global head of commodity and options products at CME Group, will be the vice chair.But before we add it to the growing pile of industry interest groups, it is worth considering why it has come into being.There are clear parallels here. This is exactly what the world’s big electronic market makers and high-frequency traders did only a few years ago. In remarkably short time the new boys had upset the old world order, shaken up the system, taken much of its business . . . and then came the Flash Crash of 2010.Faced with popular hostility and regulatory scrutiny, under the auspices of the Futures Industry Association it created the Principal Traders Group and a European counterpart. Its role has been twofold; explain the industry and in doing so, head off some populist legislation, especially in Europe.Clearly, there is deep concern about the long-term outcome of the global regulatory investigation into whether some traders attempted to manipulate the WM/Reuters rates during the critical period when benchmarks are fixed. Already there have been some calls for a global FX platform.But the creation of this lobby group underlines a deeper point. Mr Sammann put his finger on it by saying: “This is a watershed moment for FX as we redefine who we are as an industry and where we’re going.” He went on: “We can more strongly represent the voice of the FX industry to positively impact the coming market structure changes resulting from unfolding market regulations, capital changes and client product choice.”For a long time the FX industry has considered itself a world apart, contributing to its characterisation as something of a barely-regulated “wild west”. Post-crisis, that is coming to an end.Already, foreign exchange futures and options are becoming a more popular way to trade and those trades will have to be cleared. Yet regulators appear to be very uncertain how to proceed. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission long ago produced its final rules for clearing interest rates and credit products yet FX is still to come; Europe is bogged down in a mind-numbing discussion over what constitutes a derivative. As FXPA noted, there are also risk controls and post-trade reporting rules to implement.This week in London the International Swaps and Derivatives Association talked openly about its plans to head off potential chaos by creating a single industry model to calculate initial margin for uncleared trades.Some of Isda’s previous efforts include tidying up large parts of the credit default swaps market, tearing up overlapping contracts and netting exposures and revisiting its definitions of a default.Lobbyists, yes, but also an example that a trade group can be a galvanising point for a more practical, efficient – and hopefully safer – market."
223;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-09-26T02:23:40Z;CME loses Asia head following reshuffle;Departure comes as industry ramps up in Asia;CME Group, one of the world’s largest exchange operators, has lost its Asia head in a surprise departure that comes as industry rivals are ramping up in the region in a bid to capture growing demand for futures trading.The exchange said that Julien Le Noble, Singapore-based head of CME for the past three years, had submitted his resignation this week. He gave no reason.His resignation comes a week after a major reshuffle of top management at CME, which sees Bryan Durkin, chief operating officer, expanding his job to include oversight of international offices. CME has four in Asia beyond Singapore: in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul and Beijing, which the company opened this year.Mr Le Noble, a French citizen and former senior executive at broker Newedge, ran CME’s Asia business from the company’s regional headquarters in Singapore, which is also the regional hub for IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and Eurex, the futures arm of Germany’s Deutsche Börse.Singapore has become a magnet for global exchanges wanting to tap into a new customer base in Asia for their benchmark products as the region becomes an increasingly important battleground for derivatives trading and clearing.Mr Le Noble’s departure comes only weeks before CME’s arch-rival ICE, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, is set to relaunch the former Singapore Mercantile Exchange, which it bought last year for $150m.Atlanta-based ICE has been transforming SMX and its associated clearing house into a new exchange that will act as the company’s springboard for growth in Asia. While it has not said what derivatives products it will offer after the launch – expected within weeks – industry experts say gold, foreign exchange and possibly energy futures are likely.Deutsche Börse is meanwhile in the process of setting up a clearing house in Singapore, which will also help the company expand in Asia. In January, the exchange bought control of Cleartrade, a small Singapore-based trading platform that specialises in freight, fuel oil and metals derivatives.CME’s office in Singapore, which employs 50 of the company’s roughly 70 staff in Asia, promotes use of eurodollar futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which are one of the most widely traded exchange-traded derivatives globally, as well as CME’s energy, FX and commodities contracts.Singapore is growing rapidly as a location for proprietary trading groups, such as Chicago-based Jump Trading and Propex, a Sydney-based company, which are increasingly using the city-state as a base from which to trade futures electronically in the region and beyond.
224;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-09-15T23:10:12Z;GFI to open its books to BGC Partners;;GFI Group, the US interdealer broker, has agreed to open its books to rival BGC Partners in the face of a potential higher offer from BGC that threatens to break up an agreed deal with CME Group.New York-based GFI made the concession in its first response to last week’s proposed tender offer outlined by BGC. However it fell short of recommending that shareholders accept BGC’s planned $5.25 per share cash offer, which would trump an agreed $4.55 per share offer from CME.The attraction of GFI, the smallest of the five main global interdealer brokers, is its electronic energy and foreign exchange software business, Trayport and Fenics.Exchanges and interdealer brokers are keen to extend electronic trading into over-the-counter derivatives markets, albeit for differing reasons. Low market volatility and volumes have tempered investor appetite for hedging instruments such as swaps, hurting brokers’ profits. Bourses are eyeing opportunities from the global regulatory push to make the bilateral, telephone-based OTC market more electronic.BGC, a 13.5 per cent shareholder in GFI, indicated it would go direct to other shareholders with a tender offer although it is predicated on BGC receiving backing from a majority of shareholders. About 40 per cent of GFI’s shares are owned by the management.GFI on Monday described the BGC offer as “not at this stage sufficiently detailed or definitive” for it to recommend to shareholders ahead of the CME offer. GFI shares rose 1 per cent in morning trade in New York, to $6.07.The CME, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, is keen to buy the Fenics and Trayport businesses to expand in European energy markets. As part of the deal struck in July, GFI’s senior management, led by former chief executive and founder Mickey Gooch, would buy GFI’s wholesale brokerage and clearing business for $165m, along with $63m in liabilities.BGC, which has had a longstanding interest in acquiring GFI, said it had approached its rival with an offer to buy the company only two days before the CME deal was announced. In a filing on Monday, it reiterated it continued to seek a negotiated merger with GFI that would “provide superior value to the GFI shareholders.”GFI said its decision to open up its books was based on independent advice and that BGC’s proposal could “reasonably be expected” to lead to a superior proposal, which could break up the deal with the CME.Mr Gooch abstained from the vote while Colin Heffron, chief executive of GFI, was not present when the GFI board voted to open its books.
225;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME on spot in finely balanced GFI battle;;The battle for GFI Group, the US interdealer broker, has become one of the most absorbing stories of the summer.On one side is CME Group, the US futures exchange and the biggest beast in the market structure jungle. On the other is BGC Partners, a rival US interdealer broker.At present the duel is finely balanced. BGC, a 13 per cent shareholder in GFI, has offered $5.25 per share for the rest of the company, valuing GFI at $675m.That would break up a $4.55 per share offer from the CME. However the CME offer, worth $655m in total, comes with a side deal. It plans to sell GFI’s broking business to the current management to keep GFI’s Trayport and Fenics energy software trading businesses.These two units are the jewels in GFI’s crown. Fenics does foreign exchange derivatives pricing, trading, and risk management. Trayport is one of the world’s main electronic trading platforms for energy trading.BGC, also keen to push more into an electronic world, is keen on all of GFI but its approach comes with risks. Its tender offer is predicated on it receiving indications of support from a majority of shareholders, and GFI management hold 40 per cent of the shares.Michael Wong, an equity analyst at Morningstar, argues that a BGC-GFI deal would be more of a boon to the interbroker dealing industry. It “could take capacity out of the interdealer broker space and could firm up the prices for trading, while also decreasing the competitiveness for brokers and the compensation that they can demand,” he says.True, the merger would mean fewer brokers but whether it changes industry economics is another matter. Interdealer brokers may make a more lucrative margin on their trades but once operational factors – broker compensation, heating, lighting, the screens – are taken into account, electronic trading is the more profitable. The real problem, as all market participants are aware, is the low market volatility. The fixed costs remain and are not being offset by trading.BGC’s offer feels like a gambit to push the price up. It came only days after CME’s big rival IntercontinentalExchange agreed to pay $350m for SuperDerivatives, a business not unlike Fenics and certainly not as established. Perhaps the timing was by chance, but there are many people in financial markets who don’t believe in coincidences.Even so, the pivotal question is how keen CME is to do a deal. It can easily afford to raise its bid and would still have the option to offload the broking business.A raised offer would relieve the GFI board of any awkward questions – and possibly legal challenges – over its fiduciary responsibilities to all shareholders if it had accepted the lower bidA raised offer would relieve the GFI board of any awkward questions – and possibly legal challenges – over its fiduciary responsibilities to all shareholders if it had accepted the lower bid.For the CME, buying Trayport and Fenics would give its fledgling European trading and clearing operations a vital shot in the arm. Progress can be at best described as steady despite hiring several hundred staff in the last few years. The launch of its London-based trading operations was delayed for more than a year and it debuted currency derivatives into a becalmed market. Pumping the Trayport volume and applying Fenics risk modelling to trades could transform its European OTC business at a stroke.And while missing out on a deal is not the end of the world, missing out on prize assets can have consequences, as the London Stock Exchange Group discovered when it missed out on Liffe a decade ago. In the meantime ICE has been rapidly snapping up assets like SuperDerivatives and the Singapore Mercantile Exchange, for $150m.The CME has sat and watched. Its biggest market – interest rate derivatives – remains in the doldrums, thanks to the expansive monetary policies of the world’s main central banks. Currency volatility is returning. The question is: does the CME feel it can afford not to do this deal?
226;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-09-11T10:50:03Z;CME names Cees Vermaas to lead European business;Former Amsterdam SE chief to take up new role in January;CME Group has appointed Cees Vermaas, former chief executive of the Amsterdam stock exchange, to head its growing European business.The post has been vacant since the death of Bob Ray in March. Mr Vermaas, 49, started his career in IT services at Philips and worked at Getronics and CMG Finance before joining Euronext in 2001. He resigned from his role at the start of August. His appointment is subject to approval by UK regulators but he is due to take up his role at the CME on January 2.He spent much of his 12-year career at Euronext in cash markets such as equities and became chief executive of the Amsterdam exchange in 2010. By contrast, CME is a derivatives business although many of its electronic trading customers are based in Amsterdam. The Netherlands is also a significant trader of energy, one of CME Europe’s key markets.The world’s largest futures exchange operator has made a London-based operation its chief area for growth beyond its US domestic stronghold. It began trading foreign exchange and biofuel futures this year following approval by UK regulators, and is set to add energy contracts such as coal. It has also built up a clearing and trade repository business.Confirmation of his appointment, trailed by trade press over the summer, also comes as its US parent aims to boost European volumes with the $655m purchase of two energy trading software units of GFI Group, a US interdealer broker. However, this week BGC Partners, a GFI rival, announced plans to break up the deal by pitching a higher offer totalling $675m to shareholders.Mr Vermaas will report to William Knottenbelt, CME Group’s senior managing director, Europe, Middle East and Africa (Emea).“His deep exchange experience, coupled with his strong understanding of the diverse needs of European market participants for risk management and liquidity access in local jurisdictions, will be a tremendous resource as we look to extend our product offering across multiple asset classes,” said Mr Knottenbelt.
227;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-09-09T09:53:11Z;BGC’s $675m offer for GFI to trump rival CME bid;;BGC Partners, the US interdealer broker, is to launch a $675m hostile counterbid for rival GFI Group, in a move that would trump a $655m deal GFI agreed with CME Group, the US derivatives exchange.BGC said on Tuesday it would commence a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding shares of New York-based GFI for $5.25 per share in cash, a premium of more than 15 per cent to the $4.55-per-share offer the CME made in July. BGC is also a 13.5 per cent shareholder in GFI and argued the CME price undervalued its rival.The counter-offer comes as the interdealer broking industry, intermediaries between banks and other counterparties in the trading of over-the-counter interest rate derivatives, is in the middle of a deep restructuring.Low market volatility and volumes have tempered investor appetite for hedging instruments such as swaps. Companies such as GFI, Tullett Prebon, ICAP and BGC have been cutting jobs, closing lossmaking business lines and open to selling prized electronic trading assets in an attempt to remain profitable. BGC has cash on hand after selling eSpeed, an fixed income trading venue, to Nasdaq OMX for $750m last year.It also indicates the industry’s willingness to fight back against the encroachment of exchanges into their backyard of over-the-counter derivatives markets.BGC said it had been rebuffed in an attempt to purchase GFI only two days before its rival announced a two-stage deal with the CME, on July 31. BGC notified the GFI board of its plans by letter late on Monday.“Given your lack of response to our offers, and our belief that the pending transaction deprives GFI shareholders of the opportunity to realise appropriate value . . . we intend to make an offer directly to the GFI shareholders,” wrote Shaun Lynn, chief executive of BGC, in the letter. He added that BGC was “prepared to begin such negotiations immediately.”The tender offer will only go ahead if BGC gets backing from a majority of shareholders, it said. GFI declined to comment. GFI shares, which spiked in the last hour of trading on Monday, opened up 8.35 per cent at $5.46. BGC shares were trading up 2.8 per cent at $7.62 in New York.The counter-offer also indicates a willingness of interdealer brokers to fight back as exchanges encroach on OTC markets, clearing off-exchange derivatives and launch swap-like futures contracts.To that end, IntercontinentalExchange agreed to buy SuperDerivatives for $350m last week in part to push into derivatives data, clearing and settlement, particularly for illiquid products.“This intent to acquire GFI makes huge sense to me,” said David Buik, a commentator for Panmure Gordon and former BGC employee. “Since the credit and bank crisis, global regulators have been all over the banks like a bad rash. Therefore the banks’ appetite for risk has dissipated – hence a substantial drop in trading volumes, which has not abated the banks’ quest to slash brokerage charges into the bargain. GFI has a global presence in a number of products and derivatives that BGC may not major in – commodities and credit derivatives in particular.”CME declined to comment. The Chicago group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, wants to acquire GFI Group’s energy and foreign exchange software business in late July to expand in European energy markets.As part of the deal, GFI’s senior management, led by former chief executive and founder Mickey Gooch, would buy GFI’s wholesale brokerage and clearing business for $165m, along with $63m in liabilities.“Having seen the ICE purchase of Superderivatives, the Fenics business is now more valuable,” said Jake Pugh, an independent industry consultant. “That said, I think the BGC bid is largely disruptive, rather like the ICE bid for the Chicago Board of Trade.The CME can easily pay more with a cash alternative. Meanwhile, the bid will allow BGC to carry out some due diligence on a competitor but a substantial proportion of GFI shareholders will probably want ‘out’ of interdealer broker stock.”www.ft.com/tradingroom
228;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-09-07T15:24:41Z;CME revamps fee rebates for energy trading;;CME Group, owner of the world’s largest futures exchange, has launched a sweeping revamp of its opaque system of fee rebates for energy traders as it battles flagging volumes in oil and natural gas contracts.The new incentives replace a hotchpotch of perks with a uniform programme that sweetens traders’ rebates as their volumes surpass certain thresholds. Only the biggest high-frequency trading firms are likely to qualify for the most generous rebates, people familiar with the matter said.CME’s new incentives, which took effect last week [September 1], apply to energy futures created as many as three decades ago: crude oil, natural gas, diesel and gasoline. Energy has the second largest share of the exchange’s $2.5bn clearing and transaction fee revenue, comprising 23 per cent of the total last year.According to people who have seen the rebate programme details, proprietary trading groups would fall into one of eight tiers based on their average daily volumes in the energy products.Transactions of at least 150,000 contracts per day would place a trader in the top tier, eligible for $0.45 rebates from the standard $0.55-per-contract member trading fee. Top rebates could exceed $16m annually, assuming a normal trading calendar.The changes come nine months after CME raised trading fees. Volumes in the four energy contracts have declined in the year to August.Some traders praised the programme’s consistent criteria for rebates and a person close to CME said the new incentives level the field.However, others raised concern it would concentrate the market. “They are trying to incentivise people to trade more,” said an oil trader. “What they’re going to end up with is quite possibly fewer, but bigger, traders”.CME said: “We regularly review programmes relative to market and other developments and may modify program components or structures in an attempt to respond to those developments.”Rebates are a common way to build volume in new futures contracts. But they have recently caught the eye of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is reviewing how they work and who receives them.Virtu Financial, an electronic trading firm, disclosed this year that the futures commission was looking into its participation in some exchange incentive programmes. Virtu declined to comment.The exchange operator has kept details of the programme private, requesting an exemption from disclosure requirements when it informed regulators of the plan.Some traders say scarcity of public incentive information at CME and rival IntercontinentalExchange fosters suspicion certain parties get better deals.“How transparent should we require the exchanges to be about the types of participants that are actually reaping benefits and the amount of proceeds that are being paid as part of these market-maker incentive programmes?” Vince McGonagle, CFTC market oversight chief, asked at a recent public meeting.
229;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-08-25T16:20:55Z;Wickr butts into conversation on Wall St chatroom;;Wickr, a cyber security start-up, is in talks with banks and major financial services companies including Markit to create an alternative to Bloomberg instant messaging, just as Goldman Sachs tries to create its own Wall Street chat service.The San Francisco-based company has taken an investment from CME Group, the futures exchange operator, and is working closely with it to create an app that will allow both chat and financial transactions between traders.The app would undercut Bloomberg while creating a more secure service which automatically deletes messages that regulators no longer require financial services to keep, removing the risk of storing information for longer than is necessary.Nico Sell, Wickr chief executive, said the company wanted to be the “cheapest and the best” for messaging, using encrypted peer-to-peer communications which means Wickr never has access to the content of the emails or chats.She said the financial services industry could not trust the big technology companies to create a messaging service because their business is data.“You do not see Google or Facebook building systems this way because it is not in their interest. They are sitting on databases that they are legally obliged to sell to create value for shareholders,” she said.Wickr would not say which banks it was in talks with, although it did say it was talking to Markit, the financial information service.Its negotiations come at the same time as Goldman Sachs has asked financial companies across Wall Street to invest $5m to $6m each to create another alternative to Bloomberg’s instant messaging, which relies on the $20,000 a year terminals.That project is believed to involve fusing Goldman’s own in-house messaging technology, known as Live Current, with software developed by another California-based start-up, Perzo.Wickr has hired Andrew Caspersen, former chief information security officer at Charles Schwab, to head its financial services unit.“A lot of people think Bloomberg is just too expensive,” he said. But he said the current alternatives, using consumer services such as iMessage or email – were “hard to control”.Wickr can be used to send messages that self destruct, in a similar way to Snapchat, but for bankers the limit would be set to regulatory requirements, keeping the messages for seven years in the US. Many never delete messages, creating a store of information that could be very enticing to a cyber criminal or a disgruntled employee, who could publish them online or use it to blackmail executives.“The next wave of significant data breaches could be with archives of messages,” Mr Caspersen said.He said Wickr could also create closed groups better than Bloomberg, for example, a chatroom only for chief financial officers at 10 firms.Wickr’s list of investors include Michele Burns, who is on the board of directors for Goldman Sachs, Gilman Louie, the founder and former chief executive of In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s strategic venture fund, and Jim Breyer, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist best known for his early investment in Facebook.
230;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-08-18T11:50:32Z;Global exchanges line up for KRX stake;;US exchange operator CME Group, Deutsche Börse of Germany and Standard & Poor’s have expressed interest in buying a stake in Korea Exchange (KRX) as part of their efforts to expand into Asia, South Korea’s bourse operator said.A 2.5 per cent stake in KRX is for sale ahead of a planned merger between brokers NH Investment & Securities and Woori Investment & Securities, and is due to be completed at the end of this year.The merged company will have a combined stake in KRX of 7.5 per cent, which breaches Korean regulations that ban a financial company from holding more than 5 per cent.The sale of a 2.5 per cent stake, worth more than Won90bn ($88m), offers a rare chance to access one of the region’s most active derivatives markets. Western exchanges are keen to expand into Asia, where derivatives markets are still relatively under-developed, compared with the US and Europe.“The foreign institutions are showing interest in the sale as part of their Asian expansion strategy,” said Ahn Sang-hwan, an executive director at KRX.He said Deutsche Börse had sent KRX a letter expressing its interest in the stake, while CME and S&P had “verbally expressed” their interest. “The deal seems attractive to them as the KRX is a rare exchange that operates securities, derivatives and spot trades all together and whose earnings are relatively stable,” Mr Ahn said.Deutsche Börse and S&P declined to comment. CME declined to comment on “market rumours”.South Korea has an active equity-linked options and futures market at a time when derivatives are becoming increasingly more important than equities for global exchanges as their main profit drivers.CME offers Kospi futures to its customers through its Globex trading system. “We are still working on expanding that partnership across other asset classes,” said Julien Le Noble, CME’s Singapore-based head of Asia-Pacific.The German operator’s derivatives arm, Eurex, offers Kospi options in Europe via a mutual agreement between KRX and Eurex. In January, Eurex bought a 5 per cent stake in Taifex, the Taiwan futures exchange.KRX is cautious about selling its stake to foreign investors, given its state-controlled status and negative public sentiment against foreign buyouts in South Korea.“Our shareholder base is pretty limited as the exchange is not yet listed. So there is some concern about possible management interference if a foreign exchange buys a stake in KRX,” said Mr Ahn.He said it would be more appropriate for KRX to form a partnership with foreign exchanges through stake swaps after it goes public.More KRX stakes are likely to be up for sale amid continuing mergers and acquisitions among local brokerages, which are struggling to stay afloat due to falling trading commissions.
231;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-08-12T07:40:49Z;Banks wait on sidelines of new silver benchmark;;Build it and they will come. Or that is what participants in London’s $1.6tn-a-year silver market will be hoping.There are just three trading days before the new, electronic replacement for the 117-year old silver fix goes live and there is still considerable uncertainty over who will be participating on Friday.Since there is no centralised clearing for precious metals markets, the initial users of the new benchmark are expected to be the 11 market-making members of the London Bullion Market Association, which include Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and UBS.But so far no one has publicly stepped forward to say they will be involved even though testing of the system has gone without a hitch. The CME Group, whose Comex exchange offers the biggest silver futures contract, is providing the electronic price platform and the algorithm that will be used to set the auction’s opening price. Thomson Reuters will take care of the governance and administration.This is only to be expected, according to people familiar with the situation. In the current regulatory climate anything connected to a benchmark gets stuck in a legal and compliance quagmire. As such, it is entirely possible that the list of participants in the London Silver Price, as the new benchmark will be known, will not emerge until Friday morning.Just to recap, the fix, which has been criticised as opaque and vulnerable to manipulation, is closing down because Deutsche Bank failed to find a buyer for its seat, leaving only two other members – HSBC and Scotiabank.Its successor retains some of the main features of the silver fixing, in particular the auction-style process used to calculate the price. But the whole system will be brought into the 21st century.Still, there are reasons to think there will be an adequate number of banks involved and therefore enough liquidity to set a reference price for the global silver market later this week.Peer pressure will help. The banks that do sign up – and several are rumoured to have indicated willingness – could simply refuse to process orders for those who have not bothered. This could place the laggards in the potentially embarrassing situation of not being able to execute a trade for a large, important client of the bank. A client that might use the institution for other more lucrative investment banking services.Indeed, there are already rumours in the market place that some big silver producers and consumers are preparing to pepper the market with orders.And if the London Silver Price does prove popular it is likely the system will be used as a template for fixing gold– a much bigger market whose benchmark should be operational by the end of the year.The Commodities Note is a regular online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times.
232;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:23:53+0000;Listings revival fails to boost HKEx trading revenue;;A revival in new listings has failed to boost trading revenue this year at Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, highlighting the weakness of the exchange operator’s core business at it prepares for a period of transformation.Net profit at HKEx, the world’s largest bourse operator by market capitalisation, rose just 2 per cent to HK$2.37bn ($306m) year on year in the first six months of 2014, the company reported on Wednesday, in spite of a doubling of cash raised through initial public offerings.Trading in equities and derivatives – which accounts for more than two-thirds of group revenue – fell year on year, a further sign that Asia is not enjoying a pick-up in volumes seen in the rest of the world.However, investors have been looking past the moribund performance of the main trading business, focused instead on the significant changes looming for HKEx this year.The exchange is due to launch a direct trading link-up with its Shanghai counterpart in the fourth quarter, giving mainland Chinese investors the chance to buy almost all Hong Kong-listed shares for the first time.Global investors will also be able to trade Shanghai equities via the connection, side-stepping the existing quota system that has kept a tight lid on foreign involvement in China’s domestic markets.“The launch of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect is one of the main strategic initiatives to be accomplished in the second half of this year,” said HKEx chairman CK Chow. The project marked “an important new page in the further development of the country’s capital markets”, he added.In January HKEx will also be able to increase fees on the London Metals Exchange, which it bought nearly two years ago in a $2.2bn deal, and is expected to launch a clearing house for the LME in the coming months – potentially a source of significant revenue.Writing ahead of the earnings release, analysts at Jefferies said the future of the exchange was far brighter than current performance would suggest.“Focusing on the results is probably moot given the transformational changes the exchange will experience from [the fourth quarter] onwards,” Jefferies said. “We believe historical correlation with Hong Kong turnover will be less meaningful as China and LME contributions increase.”Arjan van Veen, financials analyst at Credit Suisse, said in his earnings preview that in spite of weak market activity, “there is no doubt that the long-term growth profile of HKEx is very strong”.Optimism about the Shanghai link has driven shares in HKEx up a third this year, helping the company regain its place as the world’s largest bourse operator from CME Group. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index is up about 5 per cent in that time.HKEx shares closed up 0.1 per cent at HK$174.50 on Wednesday.
233;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:23:53+0000;CME’s earnings drop as trading volumes tumble;;CME Group, operator of the world’s largest futures exchange, reported a 15 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings, missing expectations as trading volumes tumbled.Terry Duffy, executive chairman, said the exchange was hit by “historically low levels of volatility” across the market during the quarter ending in June. But he said conditions could soon change.“We continue to see positive economic signs that could potentially lead to a more traditional Federal Reserve monetary policy,” he said. “This would . . . likely accelerate market activity as firms shift back into growth mode.”Trading volumes for CME’s flagship interest rate products tend to grow when traders believe a rate rise is coming. Speculation of a possible rate rise has been driven by the Fed’s decision to taper its asset purchases.But the Fed’s approach has caused some uncertainty as to when it will raise rates. On Wednesday the bank cut its monthly asset purchases by a further $10bn to $25bn-a-month, but also laid the groundwork for low interest rates.During the second quarter CME reported an average daily volume of 12.6m contracts, down 12 per cent from the same period last year due to low volatility.Clearing and transaction fees fell 12 per cent to $609m, compared to last year when CME said traders had reacted strongly to the Fed “chairman’s comments about potential tapering on quantitative easing”, CME reported.Mr Duffy said geopolitical uncertainty caused by the war in the Gaza Strip, the crisis in Ukraine and the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, has tamped down volatility in energy markets.“I think these are all confusing signals to any energy trader, and I would be afraid a little bit right now to trade at all,” he said to analysts on a conference call. “I think we’ll get more certainty on the geopolitical stuff, and that’s when you’ll see volatility come back into the marketplace.”The Chicago-based company reported earnings of $264m, or 77 cents a share excluding one-time items, compared to $311m, or 93 cents a share, during the same period last year. Revenues fell 10 per cent from $816m to $732m.Analysts had expected earnings of 79 cents a share on sales of $741m.The news came the day after CME said it would acquire GFI Group’s energy and foreign exchange software business in a deal worth $655m including debt as it seeks to expand its global reach.Shares in the company fell 2.5 per cent to $73.94 by close of New York trading.
234;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-07-31T15:37:32Z;Massad sees end to US-EU clearing dispute;;Timothy Massad, the new head of the main US derivatives regulator, said on Thursday he was committed to resolving a transatlantic dispute over compliance standards for clearing houses.Mr Massad said he had already been to Europe twice since he took office less than two months ago.With a December 15 deadline looming for the EU to recognise equivalent standards for overseas clearing houses, market participants like CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, have warned the uncertainty is affecting where customers choose to do their trading and clearing.The situation intensified in June, when the EU said it would recognise the regimes of India and four other jurisdictions but would not yet recognise those of the US, the world’s largest market.That decision alarmed some staffers and commissioners at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to people familiar with the agency. Under Mr Massad’s predecessor, Gary Gensler, who stepped down in January, the CFTC was accused of territorial over-reach by the EU and other global regulators in its oversight of the swaps industry.“The importance of working out an international framework for over the counter derivatives cannot be overstated,” Mr Massad said at a Politico Morning Money talk, his first major public event since becoming chairman of the CFTC in June. “I’m committed to working out a harmonious relationship that gives appropriate deference to other countries.”The CFTC is working on a proposal to exempt certain overseas derivatives clearing houses from agency rules, but the EU has been pushing to include customer clearing and the US plan involves only member clearing.Mr Massad said the EU has indicated that it recognises the US as having equivalent standards but the region wants the same recognition in return. He added that the parties were working to resolve the issues, and the CFTC’s main concern was making sure US customers are protected, especially in a bankruptcy situation.“We don’t want to lower standards in protecting US customers,” Mr Massad said.He added that one of his top priorities was tough enforcement of CFTC rules, citing Tuesday’s $650,000 fine on JPMorgan for submitting inaccurate reports on positions held by certain large traders whose accounts are carried by the bank. Mr Massad said there would be further similar actions.He also said he had asked for more information on the agency’s scrutiny of banks reorganising overseas units that could help them avoid US regulations. The CFTC began reviewing those practices before Mr Massad arrived.
235;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;CME buys GFI software business in global push;;CME Group, operator of the world’s largest futures exchange, has agreed to acquire GFI Group’s energy and foreign exchange software business in a deal worth $655m including debt.Terry Duffy, executive chairman of CME, said the acquisition of New York-based GFI’s Trayport and Fenics software businesses would help the company take advantage of deregulation in European energy markets and shows how it “is expanding its international footprint and committed to the European marketplace”.The Chicago-based company will buy GFI for $4.55 a share, or about $580m, in CME stock, a 46 per cent premium on Tuesday’s closing price, along with the assumption of $240m in debt.CME will then sell GFI’s wholesale brokerage and clearing business to a private consortium led by the firm’s management for $165m, along with $63m in liabilities.Trayport’s strength in Europe will be complemented by the “particularly strong client base in Asia” of the Fenics platform, which is used in over-the-counter foreign exchange options trading, Chris Allen, analyst at Evercore, said in a note to investors.The acquisitions will bolster CME’s London hub, which it launched after multiple delays in April, said Martin Fraenkel, head of CME’s international energy team.Roughly 85 per cent of European energy markets trade on the Trayport platform, Mr Fraenkel said.“It gives us a big step forward in terms of introducing our group to the European energy markets in a much more broad-based way,” he said. “They have a lot of customers across Europe that are not currently CME Group customers.”CME Europe is seen as the company’s major push to challenge Eurex for clients in Europe and Asia, along with IntercontinentalExchange, whose European operations have been strengthened by its merger with NYSE Euronext.CME Europe launched with around 30 contracts, including futures tied to foreign exchange, with plans to expand into interest rates, commodities, metals and equities derivatives.Shares in CME were up slightly at $76.04 in afternoon trading in New York.The deal is expected to close at the beginning of January.
236;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
237;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-07-16T15:44:07Z;New silver price is ‘improvement’ on fix;;The unfortunate name will disappear. So too will the private teleconference, as well as the ownership by a handful of banks that have run the London Silver Fix – the global benchmark price – since 1897. And the cloak of secrecy over the trading volumes will be lifted.But anyone thinking there has been a complete change in the way the daily snapshot of the silver market is conducted would be mistaken. The new benchmark, to be administered jointly by Thomson Reuters and the CME Group from August 15, keeps some of the main features of the silver fixing, in particular the auction-style process used to calculate the reference price.“This is like the move from wet-plate photography to box brownie cameras,” says Brian Lucey, professor of finance at Trinity College, Dublin, and an expert on precious metals economics. “Which is fine, because these benchmarks should be handled conservatively.”The death of the silver fix was caused by the withdrawal of Deutsche Bank, which runs the benchmark with HSBC and Bank of Nova Scotia. A few years ago, the German bank, which also retired its seat on the gold fix, would have had little trouble finding a purchaser for both positions.But amid the increased scrutiny of all financial benchmarks following the rigging of the Libor interest rate, precious metals fixes have lost their shine.Competition to run the new silver benchmark was keen. The CME Group, which operates exchanges, and the information and data provider Thomson Reuters, saw off six other bids from the London Metal Exchange, Platts, Bloomberg and others. The process was overseen by the London Bullion Market Association, an industry group.Under the London Silver Price – as the new benchmark will be known – Thomson Reuters will handle the governance and administration. It will publish the volumes of silver bars traded daily and prices that are tested – something that does not currently happen – while maintaining the anonymity of buyers and sellers.CME Group will provide the electronic price platform and the methodology. By maintaining the auction process that is used in the current fixing – the silver price is adjusted up or down depending on supply and demand from the member banks – it will ensure that market participants can still trade at the daily benchmark price. But instead of a chairman from one of the fixing banks determining the opening silver price, and subsequent adjustments, an algorithm will now fulfil that role.“It’s a good system, with good governance, that will be overseen by well-respected organisations,” says Jon Spall, managing director of G Cubed Metals Ltd, a precious metals consultancy, who conducted an independent review of the silver benchmark selection.“It addresses what market participants need.”The initial users are expected to be the 11 market-making members of the LBMA, including Credit Suisse, UBS and Goldman Sachs, which are active in the over-the-counter silver trade. A precious metals fund manager says that while the new benchmark appears robust in theory, there is a chance that some banks will initially sit on the sidelines until they are convinced it works.“That’s the risk: you host the party but nobody comes,” he says. “If there’s not enough liquidity, it will be a disaster.”Even so, few dispute that the new benchmark will be an improvement on the fixing. Rosa Abrantes-Metz, adjunct professor at New York University Stern School of Business, and one of the most prominent critics of the precious metals fixes, says she is “greatly satisfied” with the changes, citing the improved transparency and expanded market participation.“What is most important is the reduction of conflict of interest between the benchmark administrators and those who trade on it,” Ms Abrantes-Metz says.Her one concern is that the auction process is maintained, because it lasts for a short period, usually less than 15 minutes. Benchmarks discovered over a longer period of trading – an entire day, for example – or from time windows selected randomly each day, are harder to manipulate, Ms Abrantes-Metz says.If the London Silver Price does prove popular and successful, the banks that run the fixing for gold – a much bigger market – will come under pressure to move to a similar solution. On Wednesday the London Gold Market Fixing Limited said it was introducing changes to its benchmark, but it was not clear how far this would go.“Everybody in this process, from market participants to the LBMA to us and others, was very mindful to set a template that is applicable to other precious metals,” says Dan Rees, head of strategy for commodities at Thomson Reuters. “If we have to go through a similar process for all the other metals and come up with different mechanisms, that’s going to be problematic for all the participants and providers.”
238;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-07-11T12:02:36Z;CME and Thomson Reuters to set silver benchmark;;Thomson Reuters and exchange operator CME Group have won the race to oversee the new global silver price benchmark when the 117-year-old London silver fix is abolished on August 14.The current daily fix, which has been an integral part of London’s $1.6tn-a-year silver market for decades, and controlled by a handful of banks, has lost its lustre in recent years due to concerns about transparency and vulnerability to manipulation.It is shutting down because Deutsche Bank failed to find a buyer for its seat, leaving only two other members.The joint Thomson Reuters-CME Group bid beat six other proposals, the London Bullion Market Association announced on Friday.While the new benchmark will maintain the existing auction-style process to match buy and sell orders for silver bars, electronic trading will replace the closed teleconference run by three banks.Transparency should be improved and, in time, direct market participation broadened, the LBMA said.“I am delighted that there was a clear market consensus for the CME Group and Thomson Reuters joint proposal,” said Ruth Crowell, chief executive of the LBMA.The CME Group, whose Comex exchange offers the biggest silver futures contract, will provide the online trading platform for the new silver benchmark.It will also design and operate the algorithm to calculate the auction’s opening silver price, and to adjust it up or down until supply and demand are roughly in balance. Anyone wanting to trade at the day’s benchmark price will have their order filled.Under the current system, a chairman from one of the three banks – the others are HSBC and Bank of Nova Scotia – determines and shifts the price, raising concerns about potential undue influence.The market would like key industry participants from outside the banking sector, such as refiners and producers, to get involvedThomson Reuters, the Anglo-Canadian media and financial information group that administers about 150 global benchmarks, will provide oversight of the algorithm, and also handle the compliance and data requirements.To address concerns about the current lack of transparency, daily trading volumes will be published.Since there is no centralised clearing for precious metals markets, initial users of the new silver benchmark are likely to be the 11 LBMA spot market making members, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and UBS. They can currently only trade through the fixing members.“Over time, it will widen out and the market would like key industry participants from outside the banking sector, such as refiners and producers, to get involved,” said Jon Spall, managing director of G Cubed Metals, who conducted an independent review of the benchmark selection process.The LBMA said it will develop an accreditation system for participants in the London Silver Price, as the new benchmark will be known.Others involved in the consultation included silver producers, refiners and manufacturers. The Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England attended as observers.The tender attracted wide interest. Among the unsuccessful candidates were Bloomberg, ETF Securities, Platts and the IntercontinentalExchange.A last-minute bid by the London Metal Exchange and technology provider Autilla also failed.If the new silver benchmark proves successful, it may hasten the end of the London gold fix, according to precious metals analysts.“If it is good enough for silver, then why not for gold?” said one gold consultant. “This benchmark has the buy-in from the market so it cannot be ignored.”Thomson Reuters and CME Group will make money by selling the benchmark data.
239;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-07-09T13:58:52Z;Joint Thomson Reuters/CME bid in lead for silver fix;LME and Autilla make last-minute revised joint bid;A joint proposal by Thomson Reuters, the data and news service, and exchange operator CME Group has emerged as the frontrunner to provide a new global silver price benchmark when the 117-year old London silver fix is disbanded in August.However, it faces a last-minute challenge from the London Metal Exchange that has joined forces with Autilla, a technology provider, to table a revised bid.The move has delayed the announcement of a new method for providing a daily reference price for silver. The London Bullion Market Association, the industry body co-ordinating the search for a new transparent electronic mechanism, was set to announce the winner of the hotly contested process earlier this week.While the LME’s new proposal will be given a hearing because it comes from a “serious candidate”, people familiar with the situation said it was unlikely to find favour with industry participants.“This is complete about-turn by the LME and I would say it’s too late,” said one of the people.The current fix is an auction-style process run by three banks that confer daily via teleconference. It allows miners, financial institutions and jewellers to trade silver bars and value their stocks and contracts, but is due to be abandoned on August 14.The date was set earlier this year after Deutsche Bank failed to find a buyer for its seat on the rate-setting body – leaving only HSBC and Scotiabank involved and effectively killing the fix. Market participants said the fixing process could not function properly with fewer than three members.The LME is understood to have joined forces with Autilla after it became clear the exchange’s original solution – a closed auction process – would not be selected. Many industry players are wary of this method because of the possibility that they will only be able to fill part of their orders.Its new proposal is closer to the plan put forward by Thomson Reuters and CME, whose Comex exchange is already home to a widely traded silver futures contract.This builds on the current fixing process such that the current volume match auction method is retained but an algorithm is used to set the opening price rather than a chairman from one of the banks.The LME said its solution would be ready for testing next week and rollout in early August.The hotly contested battle to provide a new daily reference price for silver – seven solutions were put forward– is being closely watched by market participants elsewhere in the precious metals industry.Whichever organisation is chosen to run the new silver benchmark will also be in a strong position to take over the under-fire gold fix, if the group of banks that operate this benchmark decide to phase it out.The twice-daily gold auction is run by HSBC, Barclays, Soctiabank and Société Générale and has come under fire from politicians and academics who say the process is old-fashioned and opaque, and needs to be overhauled.In May, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority fined Barclays, one of the fixing members, £26m for poor controls after one of its traders used the auction to influence the gold fix to avoid paying out on a derivatives contract.
240;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;Low volatility hits derivatives trading;;Prospects for interest rate rises in the US and UK brought isolated bursts of activity to an otherwise slack first half of the year on the world’s largest derivatives exchanges.Low volatility in markets from bonds to commodities has slowed volumes as investors feel less inclined to trade instruments that hedge risk. The Bank for International Settlements warned financial markets have become “euphoric”, with asset prices potentially overvalued.The torpor has affected shares of exchange groups such as CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and Deutsche Börse as well as profits at Wall Street trading desks.“When it comes to trading, more volatility is generally better,” said Gaston Ceron, analyst at Morningstar.One market where volume picked up in some places was interest rates, as traders bet on future monetary policy at the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Volume in CME’s flagship eurodollar interest rate futures rose 20.6 per cent in the first half from the same period last year, contributing to a 4.7 per cent increase in overall daily volume at the exchange, new data showed.Average daily volume in CME’s interest rates product line has been running at the highest level since 2007. However, it dipped 25 per cent in June from the same month of 2013, when uncertainty over when the Fed would begin curtailing its bond-buying programme unnerved markets.Liffe, the London derivatives exchange owned by ICE, reported a record number of trades in short-sterling futures and options contracts, used to speculate and hedge against rate changes, after Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the case for raising the UK base lending rate from a historic low “could happen sooner than markets currently expect”. CME had record volume in British pound futures.However, ICE said on Thursday that daily interest rate volume fell 26 per cent in the first half, citing “continued low volatility” for a further drop in June.Eurex, the derivatives bourse owned by Deutsche Börse, recorded a 13 per cent fall in daily volume for the first half, with volumes softening further as summer approached.The group’s fortunes are more tied to the euro yield curve. Investor appetite for risk-offsetting contracts has been suppressed by the European Central Bank’s decision to impose a negative interest rate on overnight deposits. Eurex’s long-term interest rate derivatives for German government bond futures – the Bund, Bobl and Schatz futures – also registered double-digit declines in June.A few other markets have accelerated, notably corn, wheat, live cattle and lean hogs futures at CME. At ICE and CME, volume in benchmark Brent crude jumped as a violent insurgency routed security forces in Iraq, a major oil producer.
241;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-06-16T07:58:02Z;CFTC moves to curb speculators face revision;Traders complain position limit rule makes it harder to buy grain;A long-running effort to constrain speculation in commodities markets could face another round of revision.Almost five years after its first hearings on the issue, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has made the rare move of reopening public comment on position limits, or caps on the number of commodity trading contracts speculators may control.On Thursday, commission staff will host representatives of commodity trading houses such as Vitol and Cargill and exchanges such as CME Group to listen to complaints that a position limits rule proposed last year will make it harder to buy grain or store oil.The public meeting will be the first under CFTC chairman Timothy Massad since he was sworn in this month. Traders are keen to know whether Mr Massad will hew to the rule as proposed by his predecessor, Gary Gensler, or amend it in response to industry criticism.The discussions come as the number of large hedge funds and money managers betting on a rise in benchmark US crude oil has increased by more than a third this year to 95, according to CFTC data. Nymex July WTI crude was about $107 per barrel early on Monday, close to its highest level so far this year.Congress directed the CFTC to impose limits on speculative positions in 28 commodities contracts after oil and grain prices soared to records in 2008. Europe has approved its own curbs.Writing a rule to implement the US legislation has proven tough, however. In September 2012, a federal judge struck down the first attempt in response to a lawsuit brought by two banking lobbies, saying that CFTC had failed to show limits were necessary.Last November, the CFTC unveiled a revised rule 163 pages long. While banks continued to oppose the new proposal, the concerns of trading houses– companies that buy, sell, transport and store bulk commodities, as well as trade derivatives – will be the main focus of this week’s meeting.The proposed rule would “tend to suggest that most of the bona-fide hedging that end users have done for decades could now be kicked over into the category of speculation”, said Gregg Doud of the Commodity Markets Council, an umbrella group for traders and futures exchanges.Traders contend that the proposed rule would prevent them from building commodity futures positions in anticipation of supplies they intend to acquire, such as unharvested corn sold ahead by farmers.Some also argue the rule would make it too difficult for traders to claim an exemption allowable for holding two different but related commodities, such as natural gas and electric power. The proposed rule requires the prices of two commodities to move with a strong correlation of at least 80 per cent.Mr Massad has shown awareness of such concerns. At a Senate hearing before his approval, he said: “If I’m confirmed, I will clearly want to be thinking about making sure that commercial end users can still properly engage in the activities they need to engage in.”
242;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Massad confirmed as new CFTC chairman;;The board of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the main US derivatives regulator, is back to full strength for the first time in a nearly a year after senators confirmed three new members, including chairman Timothy Massad.Mr Massad will lead an agency whose responsibilities were dramatically broadened in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and became a target of Wall Street under previous chairman Gary Gensler.Market participants are eager to know whether Mr Massad, a former Treasury official, will continue in Mr Gensler’s reformist vein or make changes as dozens of rules reshape the $400tn US over-the-counter derivatives market.Since Mr Gensler stepped down at the start of the year, the CFTC has signalled a softer tone. Last month it took steps to ease record keeping requirements for certain transactions. It has also solicited more public comment on a measure to clamp down on commodities speculation.Mr Massad will be joined by Sharon Bowen, a Democratic corporate lawyer, and Christopher Giancarlo, a Republican swaps brokerage executive, as commissioners on the five-seat panel.The agency is working, and in some cases struggling, to implement dozens of new swaps rules passed under Mr Gensler as it puts flesh on the bones of the landmark 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.Walt Lukken, chief executive of the Futures Industry Association, said: “The Dodd-Frank Act greatly expanded the scope of the CFTC’s authority, and there are still many important issues that need to be addressed in the implementation of that law. So it is all the more important that the CFTC have a full complement of commissioners at this critical moment in its history.”The agency is also grappling with the arrival of high-speed electronic trading firms in futures markets. The issue has taken on new urgency since the publication this year of Michael Lewis’s book Flash Boys, which alleges the equities markets are rigged in favour of high-frequency traders.Separately on Tuesday, the CFTC’s technology advisory committee discussed the implications of these trading strategies, focusing on distinctions between equities markets and futures markets.“Michael Lewis’s book has stirred up quite a debate about high-frequency trading and market structure,” said Scott O’Malia, one of the CFTC’s two sitting commissioners.Ms Bowen, a Democrat, was approved in a 48-46 vote after opposition led by Republican lawmaker David Vitter.He is unhappy with her role as acting chair of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, an industry fund that covers losses from brokerage failures, which failed to compensate victims of the $7bn Ponzi scheme of financier and cricket mogul Allen Stanford .
243;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-05-01T16:33:18Z;CME says high-frequency trading outcry should not hit futures;;The chairman of CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, said the company’s lobbying efforts to differentiate itself from equity markets should shield it from undue regulation thrown up in the furore over Michael Lewis’s latest book, Flash Boys.“I think we do a very good job at educating [legislators and regulators on] the differences in our model versus the equity models,” Terry Duffy said after reporting a 13 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings. “And we didn’t do that when Michael Lewis’s book came out – we’ve been doing it for 10, 12 years now.”Mr Lewis’s book argues high-frequency traders – who use computer algorithms to shave fractions of a second off trading times – are given unfair advantage by exchanges. The book has sparked a public debate about the merits of high-speed trading, with New York’s attorney-general announcing an investigation into the practice.CME has also come under fire. Last month, the company was sued by a group of traders for allegedly selling market data to HFTs earlier than to other market participants. CME has denied any wrongdoing.CME said that HFTs accounted for about 30 per cent of its first-quarter trading volumes, and less than 15 per cent of its revenues.Mr Duffy said the company would use potential upcoming hearings in the Senate to “draw the differences between our market structure and the equity market structure so we don’t get swept into some kind of reform that doesn’t apply to our business”.CME reported net income of $267m compared with $236m, in the same period last year. Sales rose 8 per cent, from $719m to $777m.Excluding one-time items, the exchange reported earnings of 83 cents a share, against analyst expectations of 83 cents a share on $776m in revenues.CME’s shares were down 1.6 per cent to $69.28 in morning trading in New York.
244;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:34:32+0000;Deutsche Börse hopes that its philosophy has global appeal;Exchange’s breadth of operations is unrivalled;While EU and US policy makers press on with reforming markets in the wake of the financial crisis, Deutsche Börse (DB) stands apart.North Atlantic rivals may have more volume in particular products, but none has the breadth of operations of Europe’s largest infrastructure operator by market capitalisation.Thanks to long-term planning, its operations have mushroomed in the last 20 years from share trading to derivatives and commodities, and providing IT services and market data.It has built on extensive post-trade services, such as clearing and settlement, which, while not always attracting much attention, provide a critical market “plumbing” by offsetting systemic risks from trading.These units account for the majority of profits and create a highly integrated business the group sees as fundamental to a particular strand of capitalism.Reto Francioni, chief executive, told business leaders and politicians in January: “We share the same basic belief that the market economy also has to fulfil a social obligation, and that the ‘Rhine capitalism’ model of an economy buffered by corporations and focused on the long term, with strictly regulated markets – which are free for that very reason – is fundamentally superior to the Anglo-American capitalism model of deregulation.”Yet, perhaps surprisingly, few politicians and regulators see the bourse as a role model. Instead, it finds itself facing threats to its status, particularly from Brussels.The first blow came two years ago, when antitrust officials blocked its planned merger with NYSE Euro­next, the transatlantic exchange operator, saying the combination would have created a European monopoly in futures markets. The ruling had two ramifications say senior executives, who maintain it makes further acquisitions in Europe difficult and puts local companies at a disadvantage to US rivals.Chicago-based CME Group had been allowed by its regulators to pursue a combination that gave it a near-monopoly in interest rate futures in the US. Then, Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) swooped in to buy NYSE Euronext for $11bn.As ICE already had extensive London-based operations, this has created a bigger rival to DB’s Eurex derivatives business in the European heartland. CME plans to launch a futures exchange in London in late April.CME’s divisions will also square up in two of Eurex’s new developments, foreign exchange futures trading and over-the-counter (OTC) swaps clearing.For all three, the goal is to persuade investors to process more of their derivatives trades through their clearing houses, allowing customers to save on margin by netting out positions.Post-crisis, global regulators have sought to underpin financial markets by pushing more of the over-the-counter market through these risk managers, which guarantee a trade in the event of a counterparty default.But it is unclear how profitable this business could be, with regulators keen to avoid clearing houses competing by cutting prices or skimping on risk management processes.In February, Morgan Stanley said the market for OTC clearing in Europe could be worth an extra €160m in revenues.Even if Deutsche Börse won a quarter of this market, it would accrue only €40m in revenues, about 2 per cent of its group total, the bank said.Another threat comes from Europe’s review of its key markets legislation, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Known as Mifid II, it seeks to introduce competition in futures trading, clearing and ownership of market indices.Taken together, these moves could force open what is known as the “vertical silo” of integrated business that has played an important part in Deutsche Börse’s growth.But the rules are unlikely to come into force until 2019 and DB executives expect to win as much in new business as they lose in old.A European financial transactions tax, as pursued by its own government, may also hit profits.Faced with potential threats in its backyard, it is exploring new products and markets, such as corporate bond trading and interest rate swap futures. Central to its long-term vision is Asia, mirroring the trade flows between China and Germany.Europe’s largest economy is the biggest recipient of Chinese investment in the region. Germany took in €1.27bn in the first nine months of 2013, according to A Capital, a private equity group.Deutsche Börse has also bought a stake in the Taiwan Futures Exchange and will open a derivatives clearing house in Singapore.More than that, it hopes that its philosophy of a capitalism based on long-term careful planning will find a more receptive audience worldwide.In another notable win, Deutsche Börse beat the London Stock Exchange Group and Nasdaq OMX of the US to supply the technology to upgrade the Bombay Stock Exchange’s platforms. The Börse offered its code as open source software, which allows the BSE to tweak its technology to meet regulatory changes.“For me it is the correct way to look at the world,” says Ashishkumar Chauhan, chief executive of the BSE. “We are not customers, we are partners.”
245;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-04-14T01:59:37Z;Lawsuit claims CME gives HFTs unfair advantage;;A group of traders has sued CME Group, operator of the world’s largest derivatives exchange, for allegedly selling market data to high frequency traders earlier than to other market participants.The traders allege that the Chicago-based company has perpetuated a “fraud on the marketplace” since 2007 by allowing high-frequency traders, who use sophisticated computer algorithms to shave fractions of a second off trading times, early access to buy and sell orders. Such practices changed prices for all other participants, the complaint alleges.CME has denied any wrongdoing.The plaintiffs – William Braman and two other traders – are seeking class-action status and say they paid for real-time market data even as CME allowed HFT groups to trade on early non-public data, according to the complaint filed on Friday in a federal court in Chicago.CME “concealed the fact that they were not providing a marketplace free of market manipulation because they allowed HFTs to trade based upon non-public information”, the complaint alleges.In a statement, CME said the suit was “devoid of any facts supporting the allegations” and “demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how our markets operate”.“The case is without merit, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously,” the exchange operator said.The lawsuit comes amid an intensifying public debate over the merits of high-speed trading, fuelled by the recent publication of author Michael Lewis’ latest book, Flash Boys.Earlier this month, New York’s attorney-general announced a probe into US stock exchanges to determine whether they provide services to HFTs that give them unfair advantages in the marketplace.Critics allege that such groups are favoured by exchanges and wreak havoc on market stability, while proponents of high-speed trading argue that the groups provide much needed liquidity to markets.Virtu, a top HFT group, delayed its high-profile listing earlier this month amid the furore and the attention that has been given to revelations in its initial public offering filing that it has had just one losing trading day over the past five years.This is not the first time CME has been sued for allegedly favouring electronic traders. Last month an Illinois judge ruled in favour of the exchange against floor traders who had sued CME to overturn rules that factor in electronic trades to settle end-of-day grain futures prices. The traders had said the rules were forcing many of them out of business.
246;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-04-10T10:44:20Z;Traders warn on deadline for new swaps rules;;Swaps dealers have warned a mid-May deadline forcing them to comply with new US rules for over-the-counter trading remains tight, even after a US regulator clarified its positions on some key issues.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said late on Wednesday that venues trading US products, and customers in Europe will be required to report trades to US data repositories. They will also provide US officials with monthly reports on the activity of their US customers.But broker-dealers and trading venues on Thursday were concerned the CFTC held to its May 14 deadline for compliance. US and European broker-dealers, who have been waiting for two months for clarifications, have estimated it could take about four months to finalise their connections and compliance with the US rules.Market participants are worried the uncertainty and rapid build-out is contributing to a fragmentation of the global market. Research released this week by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a trade body, suggested swap execution facilities (Sefs) were likely becoming more US-centric venues. Since the introduction of the first set of final rules in February there have been fewer trades, and of lower value, in non-dollar denominated currencies trading on the platforms, Isda found.“Evidently, timing is the issue. We didn’t consider the eight weeks to May 14 the CFTC set as sufficient. Now, instead of affirming our request to lengthen that by another six weeks, they have effectively shortened it to only five weeks,” said Alex McDonald, chief executive of the Wholesale Market Brokers’ Association.“Given the Isda report yesterday about increased fragmentation and the migration of the non-US dollar markets away from the US, this evidently throws as many challenges to market liquidity as it hopes to solve.”The design seems to be to expect more from MTFs for now until the regular data reporting system is adequate to give CFTC enough visibility into the participationUS and European officials have been seeking to harmonise their tougher over-the-counter derivatives rules, drawn up in the wake of the financial crisis to strengthen against systemic risk. They have sought to avoid loopholes and duplication to avoid stymieing the market, although long-running talks have sometimes been affected by concerns over a turf war.US rules require that swaps trading be conducted on Sefs but regulators have wrestled with how they monitor US markets participants when they trade with overseas counterparties.Earlier this year, the CFTC and the EU agreed overseas swaps traders and venues could use alternative, officially-designated European venues known as multilateral trading facilities (MTFs), and set a May deadline for registration.On Tuesday, the CFTC said European-approved venues must report all swap transactions to one of its registered swap data repositories as if it were a Sef. It has approved repositories operated by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange, and provisionally approved a Bloomberg one.The CFTC has also been unable to use the vast majority of the data owing to imprecise reporting requirements.“The design seems to be to expect more from MTFs for now until the regular data reporting system is adequate to give CFTC enough visibility into the participation,” the senior counsel of a major swaps dealer said of the CFTC clarification.Trading venues must also certify that they are compliant with European rules and submit monthly reports summarising levels of participation and volume by US persons, the CFTC said.

As reported this week, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has warned that civil lawsuits may follow. EFRPs are a specialised but vast portion of the derivatives market, used most often in energy and metals.Traders simultaneously execute both a listed futures contract and a privately negotiated derivative contract, such as a swap. This allows traders to take positions in thinly traded markets – say, for a unique variety of diesel – and shift the risk to its clearing house, which acts as buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer. Millions of EFRP transactions have been executed since Nymex (since 2008 a part of CME) helped pioneer clearing in response to Enron’s collapse.The issue for regulators is transparency. Futures contracts are supposed to be openly traded on central exchanges. For the off-exchange portion of the transaction, traders must show it’s not a futures contract in disguise.As the oil trader with the fax machine says, exchange compliance officials for years were content with broker statements showing the off-exchange trades were bona fide.It is no longer so clear. In a rule change proposed last year, CME said EFRP records would need to include “order tickets, trade blotters, emails, instant messages, telephone recordings or other records”.CME has also issued a series of fines showing a new vigilance towards the transactions, including a $40,000 penalty against HSBC last week for deals on which the UK bank was “on both sides,” according to a case summary. HSBC says it co-operated with the exchange.The recent actions reveal tension between CFTC and CME. The commission oversees CME, which is both a self-regulatory organisation and a profit-seeking business dependent on trading volumes for revenue.The CFTC criticised last July CME’s “inadequate” procedures for monitoring and verifying documents related to EFRPs.CME says that, following the review, “we did augment our EFRP programme to address matters that were raised by the CFTC and ensure proper documentation was maintained for these types of trades”.As for the CFTC’s probe, it’s unclear if its warnings to market participants will turn into lawsuits. Commissioners would need to vote to authorise charges and the agency is down to only two.
248;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-03-23T17:39:25Z;CFTC steps up probe of ‘exchange for futures’ deals;Commodity regulator issues notices recommending civil action;The US derivatives watchdog has warned market participants of potential legal charges as it escalates a probe into more than a million energy, metals, foreign exchange and other swap transactions.Commodity Futures Trading Commission staff have sent “Wells notices” as they examine a broad category of transactions that includes “exchanges of futures for swaps,” or EFSs, three people familiar with the matter said.A Wells notice is an indication that CFTC staff intend to recommend commissioners authorise a civil action. It allows the recipient an opportunity to present evidence to try to dissuade the regulator from moving ahead with a lawsuit.Some Wells notices have been sent in the past two months, one person familiar with the matter said, although it was not clear how many notices were sent or to whom.The Financial Times reported last May that the regulator had issued a “special call” asking Wall Street banks and other traders to provide documents to prove their EFS transactions were legal.The CFTC division of market oversight subsequently referred the matter to agency enforcement lawyers responsible for investigating and prosecuting potential violations, people familiar with the matter said.EFSs are two-step transactions used by banks, energy companies and hedge funds to arrange specialised deals, often in illiquid markets where there are few counterparties and one trade could move prices dramatically.Industry lawyers and some traders say the CFTC is dwelling on a minor documentation issue in a market that has largely dried up. Volumes of swaps-to-futures transactions have declined sharply since October 2012, when exchange operators CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange changed their rules in response to new CFTC directives on swaps.Last month, CME announced penalties of between $10,000-$35,000 related to EFSs and similar transactions against nine parties including Deutsche Bank, Rabobank and Britannic Trading, a subsidiary of BP.Rabobank said it has not received a Wells notice. People familiar with the companies said that Deutsche and BP had not received one either.
249;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME move to shrink board opposed;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, is facing opposition over its efforts to slim down the size of its board after unveiling plans to reduce the representation of some of its traders and users.Five former board members are publicly opposing CME’s plans to reduce the board from 24 to 21 members by cutting in half the six seats nominated by class B shareholders, who are members of the exchange.Even after the cut, CME will still have the largest board of any company in the S&P 500, according to Institutional Shareholder Services. CME’s board – which at one point had 39 members – has long been seen as unwieldy. But CME’s move may provoke further tensions among its users in the wake of substantial fee increases last November which left many customers unhappy.When the exchange changed from a private-members’ club to a shareholder-owned company in 2000, the articles of incorporation mandated the presence of six directors representing traders and users among a larger slate of regular shareholder board members.Jeff Carter, an independent trader and former board member, wrote an op-ed in Futures Magazine this week saying the company should not change that agreement. The cuts should come from the non-member directors instead, he said. The piece was signed by four other former board members.“They’re under pressure to cut their board size and they should,” he said. “[But] instead of doing what executives do and making hard decisions, they’re trying to change the game.”The move, along with November’s fee rises, build on a pattern of “disdain for the industry”, he added.Laurie Bischel, a spokeswoman for the exchange, said the proposal, made earlier this month, “corresponds to efforts to reduce our board size” and reflects how the exchange has changed since demutualisation.“Members are an important part of our company and marketplace,” she said. “We will continue to have class B directors and other members on our board.”CME whittled its board from 39 members to 20 when it went public in 2002. But by 2008, the board had grown to 33 members as it took on directors following the acquisitions of the Chicago Board of Trade and New York Mercantile Exchange.This year the board has recommended a slate of 18 directors, alongside the mandatory six B share directors. If its proposal to halve the number of B share directors passes at the May annual meeting, the board will have 21 members beginning in 2015.That will still be nearly double the 11-director average for S&P 500 companies over the past six years, according to ISS.Gaston Ceron, analyst at Morningstar, said that while the company is large and complex, the size of CME’s board “could make managing the company’s affairs a more unwieldy process than it need be”.“CBOE, Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange make do with smaller boards,” he said.The head of one proprietary trading firm who did not wish to be named agreed. “Everybody knows that board needs to be smaller,” he said.
250;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-03-11T22:47:02Z;Falling volumes lead to talk of broader Brent basket;;Slowing output from the North Sea may require IntercontinentalExchange to add oil grades from beyond the offshore European fields to underpin its flagship Brent crude contract, according to a senior exchange official.The comments from David Peniket, president of the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, echo growing industry concern that the global crude oil benchmark is backed by a declining source of supply. Brent trading generated $228m in revenue for ICE last year.While Brent futures volumes are climbing, the physical oil production from the North Sea that forms the basis of the market has fallen sharply in recent years. Critics contend Brent is “broken” as a marker for global oil prices.Mr Peniket called Brent the “world’s only truly global oil benchmark” at the annual gathering of the Futures Industry Association in Florida. But he said it was evolving, including recent changes to its trading calendar.“There are now discussions going on in the market around how Brent will need to continue to change. That will include adding further grades of North Sea oil, and may even include adding in grades from outside the North Sea. That remains to be seen,” Mr Peniket said.Mr Peniket’s comments echo others in the physical oil market. The head of Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil trading house, said in January that Brent should be widened to include grades from west Africa, Kazakhstan, Algeria, possibly Russia, and even the US.Jorge Montepeque, the global director of market reporting at Platts, also said in January that the agency, which assesses the prices for physical cargoes of Brent, might have to look outside the region if North Sea supply did not increase.Any additions to the crude grades that comprise the Brent benchmark could take years, market participants said.When Brent futures were launched in 1988, they were based solely on oil from the Brent field. The futures contract now encompasses four North Sea grades: Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk, all pumped from the North Sea.The crude market is one of the most competitive in the futures industry. Brent only recently captured the crown as the most widely traded contract from West Texas Intermediate, a US grade mainly traded on CME Group’s New York Mercantile Exchange. Unlike Brent, supplies of US light crude are rising rapidly due to the shale drilling boom.Nymex has its own Brent futures contract. Volumes doubled to 872,772 contracts in February compared to the year before. ICE Brent futures volume totalled 10.7m.In an interview, Mr Peniket said that Brent has “evolved through the years through adding new streams of oil within the North Sea. There is further potential within the North Sea for adding further grades, but naturally market participants are also looking beyond the North Sea”.
251;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;CME Group’s global push given UK green light;;CME Group has won UK regulatory approval for a derivatives exchange, paving the way for the US operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to expand in Europe and globalise its operations.Authorisation on Tuesday by the UK authorities, including the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England, brought an end to a lengthy application process, in which CME twice had to postpone its planned launch date.The green light comes only a few days after the death of Robert Ray, CME Europe’s chief executive, and the man who had spearheaded the expansion of CME’s trading business from London.CME will begin trading with both foreign exchange futures and biodiesel futures on April 27.The Chicago group’s push to establish a London hub is its most high-profile move to build infrastructure and attract business from outside its US heartland, where it dominates interest rate futures trading.However some of its customers, particularly in Europe and Asia, faced being caught under stringent new US rules around derivatives trading come into force. More than 30 companies have submitted applications to join CME Europe.More than 3bn futures and options contracts in interest rates, commodities and equity derivatives were traded on its markets last year, making it the world’s largest derivative exchange by volume, according to figures from the Futures Industry Association.In time the group may launch interest rate futures trading in Europe, putting it in competition with IntercontinentalExchange’s Liffe and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex, which dominate the local market.It has been trading forex futures for more than 40 years but the application with UK authorities was held up because of central bank fears of systemic risk to markets from cross-border currencies trading. Senior executives also had to explain the process to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. CME had initially hoped to open the exchange a year ago.“It’s taken a long time and there have been a lot of negotiations,” said William Knottenbelt, senior managing director for Europe, Middle East and Africa at CME.“We’ve got to sort out with members how the delivery mechanism (for the currencies) works. It’s a matter of making them comfortable. There have been a lot of differences from 6-9 months ago and a lot of it is in the detail, such as the size of deliveries from each customer.”The company plans to launch 30 foreign exchange currencies contracts.
252;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-03-06T23:25:49Z;Robert Ray, Chicago exchanges veteran, dies;;Robert Ray, head of the CME’s planned European futures business, has died after a short illness, the US group confirmed on Thursday.Mr Ray, a veteran Chicago exchanges executive, had been chosen two years ago to lead the CME Group’s expansion in Europe, a key role as the world’s largest futures exchange seeks to break out of its domestic markets and exploit incoming global derivatives rules.The CME has launched interest rate swaps clearing and Mr Ray spearheaded its application to open a listed derivatives exchange in London, currently before UK regulators.The 60 year-old had spent most of his career in the Chicago futures industry and played an important role in its emergence from a regional commodities market to global business.Mr Ray joined CME in 2007 when it bought his employer, the rival Chicago Board of Trade. He had spent five years at the CBOT and in one of his roles, as head of business development, had led the exchange’s expansion of agricultural futures products and pushed into precious metals futures and options.Before moving to London, he had been global head of CME’s International Business as well as Global Head of its Equity and Commodity business lines.However he had been a regular visitor to London for many years and was well known to the City’s futures traders, regarding the UK capital as a second home.As well as previously working at CME in the 1980s, Mr Ray had also worked at Robertson Stephens, Dean Witter Reynolds and its successor company, Carr Futures. He was also on the board of directors at the Swiss Futures and Options Association.
253;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-02-17T10:54:45Z;Swaps market prepares for its big bang;;"The US swaps market is expected to begin a shift away from the predominance of telephone trading this week as it joins the 21st century in a move towards more tightly regulated electronic trading venues.The changes are being ushered in by global regulators in the wake of the financial crisis and come into effect on Tuesday, as trading of over-the-counter derivatives moves on to so-called swap execution facilities, or Sefs.Long viewed as a shadowy area of the financial market, OTC swaps trading has been dominated by large global banks and investors since its inception in the 1980s, but the collapse of some banks in 2008 revealed serious shortcomings within this bilateral system.The efforts of regulators led by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been to open up the swaps market to greater competition and price transparency. Last year, the credit risk between buyers and sellers of standard swaps was mutualised via centralised clearing houses, setting the foundation for rapid paced transactions on Sefs.While Sefs facilitate electronic and voice based transactions, many in the industry expect the share of computer driven transactions will quickly escalate from their current very low level.The biggest concern facing the market is whether banks, investors, clearing houses and operators of Sefs are ready for showtime.Jamie Cawley, chief executive officer at Javelin Capital Markets, says the mandated era of swaps trading on Sefs, “will be a bit more dramatic than people think”.He adds: “A number of market participants recognised long ago the inevitability of Sefs coming and have prepared for this. Others however have not.”Ahead of a hard Sef deadline, the CFTC has announced a number of temporary measures aimed at providing relief from possible last minute problems that could hamper an orderly start for Sefs.Lee Olesky, chief executive officer at Tradeweb, says: “It’s hard to measure readiness collectively across the market; there will be bumps in the road as the market makes the transition to Sef trading.”Meanwhile there has been a scramble among some clients to sign up for Sef access, particularly at Bloomberg, whose data terminal is ubiquitous across trading floors.“We are seeing quite a sizeable chunk of people coming on to the platform,” said Ben Macdonald, president of Bloomberg’s Sef. “The Sef is part of the terminal and it’s very integrated into our clients’ work flow.”For interdealer brokers used to high commissions from executing billions worth of notional derivatives over the telephone on behalf of banks amid a raucous trading floor atmosphere, the winds of change are certainly blowing.Michael Spencer, chief executive of ICAP, the biggest interdealer broker and which began in the 1980s with a specific focus on the then fledgling interest rate swaps market, is under no illusions that the old ways of doing business are ending.“The market in interest rate swaps is still predominantly voice brokered but it’s not where we see it in the longer run,” he says.ICAP, which has large electronic franchises in Treasury and currency trading, is expected to be more able than many of its rivals to weather the competitive landscape, as the likes of Bloomberg, Tradeweb, MarketAxess, the CME Group and start-ups vie for a slice of the swaps market.As swaps begin trading on Sefs, an early shakeout is expected among the 20-or-so competing platforms.Rick McVey, chief executive of MarketAxess, says the proliferation of venues, all interpreting the rules differently, will cause problems for dealers and investors. The high cost of running a venue will also be significant, he adds. “By the end of the year we will be down to around seven venues,” he predicts.Mr Olesky says, based on the current size of the swap market, that it is hard to see demand for more than several Sefs across different asset classes.Tradeweb, which has been facilitating US electronic derivatives transactions for more than eight years, is looking to provide investors with ways to trade swaps on a Sef, from streaming prices, anonymous order books, to a request for quote function.“We are not picking a particular model, the market will evolve,” says Mr Olesky. “We have prepared ourselves for a number of outcomes and protocols given the different types of customers in the market.”Mr Cawley says: “Sef volumes will increase and it remains to be seen whether customers and dealers use voice or trade electronically on Sefs, but the market will be forever changed.”"
254;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-02-14T11:47:19Z;Muted start for European derivatives rules;;The introduction of a key part of sweeping new rules policing the European derivatives market has had a muted start with many market participants still unprepared for their introduction.The trade repositories set up to collect vital data on the derivatives market reported brisk business in the first few days of operation since reporting of derivatives trades became mandatory on Wednesday.IntercontinentalExchange, the US group, said its vault had processed more than 4.5m current and backdated energy, commodities, credit, interest rates and equity derivatives trades from 300 market participants on the first day.The data warehouses, run by market infrastructure providers such as the London Stock Exchange Group, CME Group and Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, are intended to give European regulators better oversight of the derivatives market. Traders’ ability to leverage swaps trades was blamed for amplifying the financial crisis.However, banks, fund managers and corporations have faced huge operational challenges as European authorities squeezed the timetable for compliance. Rulings on key reporting issues were finalised just three months ago. Even on the eve of the mandatory reporting deadline, European regulators have still been publishing rule clarifications.Market participants have said many institutions were struggling to submit compliant trade reports, leading some national regulators in Europe to indicate they would take a lenient view of the February 12 deadline.“If it’s a soft launch, then it’s been successful. If it’s been a hard launch, it’s been a total failure,” said the head of over-the-counter derivatives clearing at one bank.Others said some repositories were experiencing difficulties as customers rushed through their applications in the final few days. Each company and all of its subsidiaries need a legal entity identifier, a unique ID to identify parties in financial contracts. Many repositories reported staff had been working through the night to meet demand.“Although the trade reporting obligation has come into force, anecdotally we are hearing from our clients that all is not going smoothly,” said Edmund Parker, partner and head of derivatives at law firm Mayer Brown. “The market-making banks are in excellent shape, but the end-users and non-financial counterparties are a mixed bag of readiness. Many have not prepared and among those who have made progress we understand that many do not have the right infrastructure to report their trades.”Other Group of 20 jurisdictions are also due to introduce similar policies in coming years, although US market participants have been reporting their trades for a year. Unlike the US, trade reporting is the responsibility of both counterparties while European rules also include exchange-traded derivatives. Market participants have reported having to fill in up to 80 separate fields on a reporting sheet compared with about 25 in the US.
255;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-02-10T22:25:04Z;CME steps up push into Europe;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures operator, is stepping up its push into overseas markets by launching new hybrid fixed income derivatives for Europe.The Chicago-based group said on Monday it would launch euro-denominated deliverable interest rate swap futures in the US from April 14, pending approval by US regulators.CME said the product was “designed to meet the needs of European financial market participants, including banks, hedge funds, asset managers and insurers”.The products are hybrids of off-exchange interest rate swaps and listed futures. Investors and brokers face mandatory clearing of derivatives trades under new global legislation, but some worry it will add extra cost to trading or force investors to use products that are not tailored to their needs.Swap futures are being explored by both exchanges and investors. They promise the economic flexibility of a swap with the inexpensiveness of a future. CME launched US equivalents a year ago, and they have traded 1m contracts in their first year since launch. There was open interest of more than 114,000 contracts in December.CME said investors would be able to net the collateral they post for swaps futures with its most highly-traded contracts, such as US Treasury futures and Eurodollar futures and options. Nomura and Société Générale have agreed to be market makers for the product, it said.Its move to attract European investors comes as rival Deutsche Börse explores swap futures for the market. CME’s main rival IntercontinentalExchange, which owns one of the region’s main listed derivatives exchanges, is also expected to begin clearing of over-the-counter derivatives later this year.CME has also applied to operate a European derivatives market, although the process has been delayed while plans are examined by central banks on both sides of the Atlantic.
256;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-02-05T22:54:38Z;New contract to hedge high aluminium premium;;Aluminium traders and the London Metal Exchange are in advanced discussions over a new contract that will allow consumers to protect themselves against the cost of the surging premiums for the metal.Demand for a hedging tool has mounted in recent weeks as the gap between the physical aluminium market and the official LME benchmark price has widened leaving industrial buyers exposed.The US Midwest aluminium premium – the amount payable on top of the exchange price for immediate delivery of metal – surged to a record level in January, rising from $0.12 a pound to more than $0.20. That equates to about $450 a tonne – or more than a quarter of the current LME price for aluminium. European and Japanese premiums have also rocketed to record levels.The sudden spike in premiums has caused consternation among purchasers of the metal. This is because there are vast stockpiles of refined aluminium sitting in warehouses. Novelis, the world’s biggest aluminium buyer, has complained of a possible “ engineered squeeze”.Aluminum consumers, which make everything from soda cans to car bodies, can easily lock-in production costs by hedging the LME price, which has fallen to four-year lows, at the exchange.The premium, which represents the cost of physically delivering the metal to the consumer, has historically been modest compared with the all-in-cost of aluminium, and thus left uncovered.“But with high premiums, the hedge becomes very inefficient,” said Michael Widmer, metals strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Contracts to hedge premiums should now be quite attractive.”The high premiums are partly a result of the lengthy queues at the biggest LME aluminium warehouses, at Detroit and Vlissingen, in the Netherlands, which stretch to more than 500 days. The LME has implemented new rules, effective from April, to reduce warehouse queues.In a statement on Wednesday, the exchange acknowledged “current market concerns” over the high premiums, and said that it was investigating the launch of a “premium hedging contract”.According to people involved in talks the proposed premium contract will be physically settled in order to enhance market liquidity. Buyers will deliver warrants for metal in a warehouse with long queues, plus a cash payment, in exchange for a warrant for metal that is immediately deliverable.The LME move follows a similar initiative by the Chicago-based CME Group, which launched a cash-settled futures contract tied to the Midwest aluminium premium in 2012.The first trade occurred last August, and there was little more activity – or liquidity – until last month when the US premium surged. Open interest – the number of outstanding contracts – rose in the second half of January from 37 lots to 252 lots, which represents 6,300 tonnes of aluminium. The CME said that some European traders, who have also been stung by high premiums, had been enquiring about the Midwest premium contract.The LME also announced further steps in its warehouse reform efforts. The consultancy Oliver Wyman has been appointed to conduct a “logistical review” of the warehousing network, while law firm Addleshaw Goddard will conduct a legal assessment. Professor Phillip Crowson will chair the LME’s newly established Physical Market Committee, a forum for the physical industry to put forward its views to the exchange.Rusal, the Russian aluminium producer, is taking the LME to court in London over the new warehouse rules, claiming that its human rights have been breached.
257;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Fed taper driving up volumes in futures market, says CME;;The US Federal Reserve’s decision to reduce its asset purchase programme will help boost activity in futures markets, the chairman of CME Group said as the company reported a nearly 30 per cent rise in the volume of interest rate contracts in the fourth quarter.“There’s a tremendous amount of participants that are still on the sidelines waiting for the programme to completely end,” Terry Duffy, executive chairman of CME, operator of the world’s largest futures exchange, told analysts. “Then we will see some fluctuation in rates.”“Tapering” of the Fed’s asset purchases has increased speculation of a coming rise in interest rates, and investors have turned to futures to offset that risk. Mr Duffy made the comments as the Chicago-based company reported a 16 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings.CME reported earnings of $193m, or 58 cents a share, compared with $167m, or 50 cents a share, during the same period last year. Consolidated revenues rose 4 per cent, from $661m last year to $687m.Excluding one-time items, the company reported earnings of 64 cents a share, against analyst expectations of 68 cents a share on sales of $691.3m. CME’s shares rose 0.6 per cent to $73.61 in New York trading.Average daily volumes rose 11 per cent in the quarter ended December to 11.3m contracts, compared with a year earlier, led by a 29 per cent rise in interest rate contracts volume. Total average daily volume rose 13 per cent in January, to 12.9m contracts, with interest rate contracts up 18 per cent.Some of those interest rate contracts are based on the Libor benchmark, which was battered by scandal last year and is being administered by rival IntercontinentalExchange.Phupinder Gill, chief executive, said CME “continued to look at alternatives that make sense for our client base”, and would support whatever new regime emerges, whether it involves fixing Libor and similar benchmarks or creating entirely new ones.The news comes two weeks after Europe agreed its biggest overhaul of securities markets since the 2008 financial crisis.Last week, Mr Gill warned European regulators against proposals that would open up the “ vertical silo” model, in which contracts are traded and cleared at the same exchange.On Tuesday, he told analysts that while the exchange would need more clarity on the rules, he did not think it would affect US operations.Any breakdown of the vertical clearing model could hit sources of revenues for exchange operators. But because CME is not a big player in Europe, it may stand to benefit if the model opens up on the continent, said Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.“They’re the challenger, so open access . . . could make the trading platforms a lot more competitive and lower barriers to entry over there,” he said.CME has less exposure to Europe than ICE, which owns Liffe, Europe’s second-largest derivatives exchange. The opening of CME’s London-based derivatives exchange has been repeatedly delayed, and the company could not offer any update on its progress.CME reported a 6 per cent rise in clearing and transaction revenues to $579m in the quarter, compared with the same period last year. Such fees made up 84 per cent of total revenue during the quarter.
258;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-01-27T22:39:21Z;CME and ICE warn on plan to force open European clearing houses;;The heads of the world’s two largest exchange operators by market value have warned against proposals to force open Europe’s clearing houses, arguing policy makers could undermine the stability of global markets.Phupinder Gill, chief executive of CME Group, and Jeff Sprecher, his counterpart at IntercontinentalExchange, hit out at European plans to require all derivatives platforms to connect to their rivals venues’ and process investors’ trades.In their first public comments since Brussels agreed a political deal earlier this month, the two US exchanges said the moves could both stifle innovation and interconnect the world’s clearing houses, which global regulators have made the centrepiece of plans to underpin the financial system post-crisis.Both CME and ICE could potentially be hit by an overhaul to the rules for Europe’s securities and derivatives markets. Policy makers want to open access to derivatives trading and clearing and break the “vertical silo” model that both exchanges operate, in which contracts are traded and cleared at the same exchange.ICE owns London-based Liffe, Europe’s second-largest derivatives exchange, while CME is planning to open its own derivatives exchange from London.The political agreement has yet to be officially confirmed but the regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority, is now assessing how to define “open access”. It may rule that clearing houses have to be interoperable, and allow customers to access their open interest positions in contracts at rival venues. Customers could have a swap open at one clearing house and have the position offset by a swap cleared at another clearing house.However, Mr Sprecher warned that that raised concentration of risk in markets.“What’s amazing is that the regulatory push to bring contracts into listed trading and clearing was very much to unlock the interconnection of the banking system,” he told delegates at a conference in Miami, Florida.He said ICE’s clearing operations had netted down around $50tn worth of credit default swaps to around $2tn.“What I don’t understand is why any regulator would want to now interconnect a bunch of clearing houses and re-link the very risk that they asked us to take on. It makes no sense to me from a risk standpoint. And if you’re going to do that, I don’t know why there should be a clearing mandate imposed on an industry. Because I’m not sure that the industry is going into a less risky environment than it would be if you just did everything bilateral.”Mr Gill said requiring contracts to trade on a multitude of exchanges would discourage investment. Unlike equities listings, “in the industry that we are in you are actually creating products”, he said at the annual conference of the Commodity Markets Council. “There’s IP [intellectual property] that goes into it. Then you’re listing it and someone else goes and trades it. It disincentivises the need to actually innovate.”www.ft.com/tradingroom
259;CME;CME Group Inc;2014-01-17T16:07:21Z;Mifid show moves to Paris after breakthrough agreement;;After the euphoria of the EU’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) deal in Strasbourg, the march on Paris has begun.Finalisation of a political agreement by European policy makers late on Tuesday on the review of Mifid, the region’s main markets legislation, was greeted with relief. While not completely finalised, it marked a major breakthrough in the 42-month process.Europe has agreed rules designed to curb commodity speculation, high-frequency trading and force more transparency and competition into derivatives markets. Drawing clear conclusions from such a wide-ranging and complex piece of work will take time, although as a general rule it seemed to favour exchanges ahead of banks.Nevertheless, there was enough for most to be happy with some outcomes, less so with others. However, interest is now turning to the fine details of the agreement. This will be overseen by the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma), based in Paris, and is where the winners and losers will ultimately be decided.The regulator’s 150 employees are about to be visited by a steady stream of lobbyists. To give an example of the dilemmas they will face, consider the issue of open access.Many have grumbled that the agreed planned transition period of 30 months, plus a potential deferral of another 30 months, in effect protects the vertical silo. But even more critical will be how Esma defines “open access” for clearing.This will turn on whether these risk management houses have to make products fungible – or fully interoperable with rivals.Fungibility refers to the ability of traders to open a position at one exchange and close it at another. Central to their ability to do this is that both exchanges use the same clearing house. If an investor who wants to open a contract on IntercontinentalExchange’s Liffe venue, clears it via CME Group and closes it on Deutsche Börse’s Eurex, he should be free to do so.To encourage competition, regulators demonstrably want clearing houses to clear for many venues. An excellent research note on Mifid from Richard Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill + Partners, this week underlined that the US Dodd-Frank Act has mandated much the same process for over-the-counter derivatives (although not listed derivatives. Here Europe goes much further).Whether Esma determines clearing houses to be interoperable is another matter entirely. In this case exchanges would have to allow customers to access their open interest positions. Customers could have a swap open at one clearing house and have the position offset by a swap cleared at another clearing house.To encourage competition, regulators demonstrably want clearing houses to clear for many venuesWhile it would open up the liquidity pool to customers, it also introduces serious potential systemic risks as it interlinks two clearing houses. Should one clearing house fail, the rest could get very rapidly engulfed. As Mr Repetto pointed out, US regulators blocked that scenario, and rightly so. Is it really a good idea to force a risk manager to accept a position with which he is not comfortable?This may be a crucial point. Investors appear to want the benefits of netting their derivatives positions but, for systemic reasons, that can only take place in one clearing house. Since the introduction of mandatory clearing in the US, investors trading interest rate swaps have been offered a choice of CME Group or LCH.Clearnet for clearing. CME is steadily taking more market share– primarily as its large futures business offers more capital efficiencies through netting. In spite of the regulatory push, clearing may be a natural monopoly.Other avenues for vertical silos may still be open. Even if Esma allowed full interoperability, exchanges could simply opt not to divert their trade feeds to a rival.A further problem that Esma faces is integrating Mifid with other sweeping financial legislation. Some headway has been made. A clause inserted by the British late on in effect reconciled open access on listed derivatives with the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, which had ruled against it two years ago. “All those frustrated arguments we had years ago and they’re gone in a week,” said one lobbyist ruefully.But the CRD4 legislation had to introduce the Basel III capital requirements for clearing houses after it was missed by Emir. But these sorts of technical rulings will have to be repeated in the coming months for issues such as commodity position limits and recognition. After three and a half years, the hard decisions are just beginning.
260;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-12-17T16:38:26Z;Crunch time for exchanges’ ‘vertical silo’ as EU rules finalised;;After three sometimes interminable years, Europe stands on the brink of agreeing its flagship financial markets legislation. European policy makers meet tomorrow to hammer out the final details for the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, and an accompanying piece in which some rules are given the greater force of a full-blown Regulation.The signals coming out of Brussels in the last 48 hours have been that a deal is likely. Rules on high-frequency trading and dark pools have been largely agreed. The final battleground is the one with potentially the most profound consequences for the industry.Access to derivatives exchanges’ “vertical silo” model, where contracts that are traded at a venue are processed through the exchange’s clearing house, is fiercely contested, in part because there is no real halfway house.Policy makers will have to decide whether to insist that derivatives products owned by exchanges be made fungible, or interchangeable with rival products. “After all, why shouldn’t a futures trade be put on at one venue and closed at another?” the critics say. The futures exchanges would be forced to compete on price and resemble the stock and options exchanges, they argue, but clearing is the mechanism that locks investors in and makes markets uncompetitive.That could potentially open CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and Deutsche Börse to competition in listed derivatives as it would strike deeply at all their business models.This stance on access is shared by a wide range of market participants, as evidenced by a letter sent to the EU’s Council, Parliament and Commission in September. Among the signatories were some of the world’s biggest investors like Allianz Global Investors, APG, State Street Global Investors, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, as well as the London Stock Exchange Group – who have skin in the game in the form of LCH.Clearnet, a clearing house run on the principle of open access.Given their reliance on financial services, it is a stance which the UK government has been lobbying particularly hard in the last few days and their lobbying looks like paying off.Others, such as Sharon Bowles, chair of the influential committee on economic and monetary affairs, have argued that there is also an issue over potential financial market stability with open clearing access in derivatives markets. If there is not sufficient open access, they argue, then resolution of a clearing house is far more likely to fall on the taxpayer as outstanding positions could not easily be taken over by another clearing house.CME, ICE and Deutsche Börse argue that their model is better suited to maintaining financial stability and is what customers want. There is some merit to the last point. One may ask if there is any real indication that users are really that bothered about a vertical silo or horizontal model. For all the carping, investors in the US seem to have shown a willingness to use the CME just as much as LCH to clear their swaps, and enjoy the cross-margining of listed and off-exchange business. Words suggest one thing, actions another.Indeed, the market share volumes of interest rates swaps clearing taken by both CME Group and LCH.Clearnet suggest there is no single view from the market.So would it then represent a victory for London and its financial services industry? Yes and no. It would benefit some investors and infrastructure owners but would leave others with a serious problem. In recent years CME, ICE and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing have all expanded their operations in London, partly to be close to customers but also because of key ancillary features like the legal framework and advice from professional services firms. That may now be under threat.Will open access make markets any safer than closed access? Probably not as the same critical issues – such as procyclicality in collateral management and fears about a race to the bottom over standards – will remain no matter what.But it is the issue about competition that seems most problematic. Unlike the US, Europe already permits competition in listed interest rate derivatives and allows users to choose. Europe would be closing down that flexibility and forcing itself to play a game no other jurisdiction is playing.Finally it also potentially creates incoherent European policy and regulatory oversight. The European Market Infrastructure Regulation has already made up its mind that competition and access should only be in unlisted derivatives. Both have the force of being a Regulation and not a Directive. Which one is supposed to prevail?It promises to be a crucial day.
261;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
262;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-12-09T18:40:59Z;US regulator acts to reform futures trading;CFTC’s block trading rule would set out three futures categories;The US derivatives regulator has drawn up plans to bring more transparency to futures trading, a move that could tilt the competitive balance between commodity exchanges.The block trading rule would set out three broad categories for futures, requiring at least 95 per cent of trading in the most active contracts to take place on central exchanges and not between two parties, people familiar with the draft proposal said.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission was set for a public vote on block trading on Tuesday, but has delayed the proposal as commissioners focus on the Volcker rule for banks’ proprietary trading.The measure is important to the competition between futures exchanges including CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange, as well as start-up derivatives platforms called swap execution facilities. The outcome of the rule could influence where traders want to do business.Last week CME officials including Terry Duffy, executive chairman, met CFTC chairman Gary Gensler and his staff to discuss the block rule, records show.Most futures traders execute transactions on computers or exchange floors. When they need to trade large volumes without moving prices they execute trades in blocks, or deals struck in private.Since the terms of blocks are only reported afterwards, they are less transparent than live bids and offers flashing on screens. Policy makers want to push trading towards exchanges without killing off less liquid contracts.Exchanges late last year established lower block thresholds for many futures as energy companies sought to avoid new regulations on swap contracts. In US crude oil options the minimum block size is now 100 contracts, down from 1,000 in early 2012.“It’s reasonable to have some block thresholds that are higher for the more liquid products, but we think that it’s important to maintain relatively low block thresholds for the less liquid products,” said Donald Wilson, head of DRW, a proprietary trading group.The draft proposal would require exchanges to ensure at least 95 per cent of futures were traded centrally, not as blocks, if their daily volume exceeded 100,000 contracts, and at least 80 per cent were traded centrally if daily volumes were between 200 and 100,000. For the least active futures, the central trading requirement would be about half, two people with knowledge of the matter said.CFTC completed a block trading rule for swap derivatives earlier this year. “To preserve the pre-trade transparency that has been a longstanding hallmark of the futures market, I believe that it is critical do so for futures as well,” Mr Gensler said in a speech last month.
263;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;Effect of reforms yet to be seen;Trend to more electronic trading and tough new global regulation;Driven by the long-term trend to more electronic trading and tough new global regulation, the world of fixed income trading is going through a quiet but profound overhaul.Trading floors, with people in colourful jackets frantically shouting and signalling to each other have become a relic of the last century as markets have gone global and investors use computers.But that trend has been accelerated by the financial crisis. In its aftermath, global regulators pinpointed the market structure of world’s derivatives markets as exacerbating the fallout.The G20 pressed for more of the vast but opaque over-the-counter market, historically traded bilaterally on the telephone between banks, be pushed on to transparent trading venues and processed through clearing houses. A clearing house stands between two parties in a deal, ensuring the deal is completed.Pushing it through central market infrastructure is intended to create a digital audit trail and force more trades to be backed by margin, or insurance for trading.These sweeping reform encompasses fixed income trading more than any other, from the underlying security to their derivatives such as interest rate and credit derivatives swaps.Interest rate swaps, for example, are used to hedging against and speculating on changes in global interest rates.The new swap trading era pits a host of players in open competition against each other, from the well-established interdealer brokers such as ICAP, to big platforms run by Bloomberg, Tradeweb and MarketAxess, to a number of new entrants such as State Street and Javelin.Other regulations are also having an effect. Banks and broker-dealers are also under regulatory pressure to hold more capital are keen to trade more of their major fixed income instruments – such as US, European and UK government bonds – electronically in an effort to cut costs.This has created a problem for banks as they have historically played a central market-maker role as they were able to hold large inventories. Broker-dealers continue to reduce the bonds they hold, thus shrinking the supply of corporate debt on offer in the market and constraining liquidity in the market. The new trading platforms, such as TradeWeb and MarketAxess, are also eyeing this market.But these momentous changes may yet have unintended consequences. They have been taking place while global interest rates have persistently been held at historic lows. That has dramatically damped investors appetite for risk and trading volumes. While there have been some signals that the US will taper its bond purchases, only when central banks make a firmer commitment will the industry see the full effect of its reforms, and volatility increases.That has led to fears of a shortfall of collateral to lubricate trading on financial markets, particularly in a world with less top-rated sovereign bonds to offer.Estimates have varied dramatically. The Basel Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) suggested the reforms, combined with new banking rules such as Basel III, could require the financial system to find an extra $4tn. That amounted to more that a third of the high quality collateral in active circulation.However the CGFS has argued that it is small relative to the global supply of assets capable of meeting the demand, with the stock of non-cash collateral eligible for derivatives standing at some $50tn.But the collateral comes with attendant risks. A rise in the value of collateral allows financial institutions to borrow and in turn push up the value of assets up further, known as “procyclicality”.“The reverse is also true. This inherent procyclicality exposes the system to sharp corrections in collateral values,” said Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England and chairman of the Financial Stability Board, in a recent speech. “In extremis, a sell-off in financial markets leads to higher haircuts, a run on repo and ultimately a market freeze.”Indeed, part of the regulatory push to focus on clearing houses is aimed at reducing this procyclicality, because these risk managers usually only accept the highest quality collateral available – mainly cash or US Treasuries as collateral for margin – as need to liquidate positions in extreme markets at short notice.But the fear of a collateral shortage means the industry is examining new ways to both meet regulatory requirements and free up collateral.Clearing house operators such as CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and LCH.Clearnet are offering investors the chance to offset the margin they put up for clearing listed derivatives against the margin they post to clear OTC products.“As trading volumes increase and with a potential collateral shortfall looming, participants are looking to markets such as NLX to provide access to clearing where portfolio margining with correlated interest rate derivatives creates margin efficiencies and reduces collateral requirements,” said Charlotte Crosswell, chief executive of Nasdaq NLX, a new European interest rate derivatives venue.If the Federal Reserve does signal rates will rise next year, these theories will be set for their first test.
264;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-11-19T08:27:49Z;ICE secures foothold in growing Asia derivatives market;;IntercontinentalExchange, the US energy exchange operator, has bought the Singapore Mercantile Exchange for $150m, gaining a foothold in a region that is rapidly becoming the main global battleground in derivatives trading.The move puts ICE ahead of rivals CME Group and Deutsche Börse as they vie to acquire the infrastructure needed to capture more business from Asia, where China’s hunger for energy and commodities is spurring greater use of hedging strategies.It also pits the Atlanta-based exchange against rivals in the region including the Singapore Exchange (SGX), whose derivatives business is its fastest growing segment.By buying SMX, ICE secures a fully licensed derivatives clearing house in Singapore, making it the first non-Asian exchange to own a clearing house in the region.While ICE already has a sales office in Singapore that attracts traders in the region to trade its over-the-counter fuel, energy and commodity derivatives and have them cleared at a London-based clearing house, the acquisition of SMX will allow ICE to offer clearing in Asia directly.“This is not only about the [OTC] energy space but gives them a foothold in the OTC clearing business . . . to compete with other regional players,” said Bill Herder, head of the Singapore-based office of the Futures Industry Association.Asia accounts for 15-20 per cent of global exchange-traded derivatives volume, with the rest split about equally between North America and Europe, according to the FIA.SMX is a small commodity exchange launched in 2010 with S$75m (US$60m) in capital from Financial Technologies, which also owns India’s MCX commodities exchange.It offers futures markets for metals, currencies, energy and agricultural commodities, but has failed to gain much traction and has suffered from low volumes since launching.ICE said that it would consult with market participants, clearing members and regulators to “evaluate the product and clearing strategy of SMX to ensure the offering meets market participants’ needs in the region”.Michael Syn, head of derivatives at SGX, said the deal “swings the centre of gravity further to Singapore as the pre-eminent Asian destination for commodities trading. We look forward to working closely together with ICE to fortify the Singapore derivatives community.”ICE said the deal would be completed by the end of this year, subject to regulatory approvals.David Goone, ICE’s chief strategy officer, said the acquisition “represents an important step in ICE’s growth trajectory as we look to expand our customer base and markets in Asia”, noting that “in recent years, Asia-based trading activity in our benchmark energy and interest rate products has been rising as the region increases in importance in global markets”.Germany’s Deutsche Börse is considering building a derivatives clearing house in Asia, based in Singapore, as part of a strategic push into the region. US-based CME Group has not ruled out doing the same.Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing said last month it had received regulatory approval for OTC Clear, which is set to start clearing this month of interest rate swaps denominated in renminbi, Hong Kong dollars, US dollars and euros.
265;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-11-15T23:29:02Z;CME discloses FBI probing July hacking attack;;CME Group disclosed on Friday that a system used to process big futures trades had been hacked in July, highlighting the vulnerability of the financial industry to cyber attacks.The CME said in a statement that its clearing and trading services had not been adversely affected by the intrusion, but that “certain customer information relating to the CME ClearPort platform was compromised”.The ClearPort platform handles big energy and metals futures trades on behalf of customers including major oil companies, asset managers and hedge funds.“The incident is the subject of an ongoing federal criminal investigation and CME Group is co-operating with law enforcement in its investigation into this matter,” the CME said. It declined to comment further.The intrusion on the biggest US futures exchange comes as financial industry executives are escalating their warnings about the threat of cyber attacks.A report released this year showed that more than half the world’s exchanges had fought off incursions on their technological systems during the past 12 months, while securities groups and government agencies in the US and UK have been simulating cyber-attack scenarios in an effort to beef up their security systems.This week three key financial industry trade groups in the US – the American Bankers Association, the Financial Services Roundtable, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association – sent a letter to members of Congress urging lawmakers to revive cybersecurity legislation that has stalled following revelations about the National Security Agency’s domestic surveillance programme.“The cyber threat facing the financial services industry presents a clear and present danger not only to our members and their customers but to other critical infrastructure providers relied on by our industry and our economy,” the letter said.“The need for specific and co-ordinated action to protect our sector and the larger business community has been recognised at the highest level in our member firms.”The groups are pressing for politicians to enact legislation that would make it easier for the US government and private US companies to share information before, during and after a cyber attack. At the moment, private companies could be found liable for sharing sensitive customer data with the authorities or if they act on a government warning of an forthcoming cyber threat.The CME said that it was in talks with impacted ClearPort customers.The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Chicago field office said: “We received the referral from CME Group and we’re looking into the matter. It’s an ongoing investigation.”Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer and Arash Massoudi
266;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-11-15T19:17:19Z;Report casts doubt on insurance plan for futures brokers;;Government-authorised insurance for customers of collapsed futures brokers would take half a century to become fully funded, requiring a taxpayer backstop in the interim, an industry-backed study has found.The conclusion is ominous for the creation of a futures market version of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which covers up to $500,000 in losses suffered by US stock investors if their broker fails.The study was commissioned in November 2012, after a year in which the collapse of brokers MF Global and Peregrine Financial Group shook traders’ faith in the safety of futures markets.More than $1bn in customer collateral held by MF Global went missing in the broker’s chaotic final days in October 2011. At Peregrine $200m vanished in a fraud.In the aftermath traders advocated the creation of an insurance fund like SIPC, which Congress authorised in 1970.The futures study, whose sponsors included futures exchange operator CME Group, the National Futures Association self-regulatory body and the Futures Industry Association, examined the viability of a “Futures Insurance and Customer Protection Corporation” similar to SIPC.The corporation would cover up to $250,000 per customer and be funded by a 0.5 per cent annual assessment on futures brokers’ gross revenue.Assuming no payouts, the corporation would take about 55 years to reach a target funding level of $2.5bn.“A universal government-mandated solution would take a long time to fund,” said Christopher Culp, who led the team of study authors.A US regulator who supports an insurance scheme cast doubt on the conclusions. “Look, firms don’t want to pay for an insurance pool to protect customers,” said Bart Chilton of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “Now we have a study funded by those guys that gives reasons why it’s a bad idea. I’m certainly not shocked.”An alternative plan involving a private insurance company owned by futures brokers and backed by reinsurers stoked interest from a syndicate of eight reinsurance companies. The syndicate proposed covering up to $300m in claims, with participating brokers bearing the first $50m in losses.The cost, estimated at $18m-$27m per year, was deemed “restrictive” but the study indicated that brokers might be able to negotiate a better rate.Gary DeWaal, a consultant and former general counsel at Newedge, the futures broker, said that the government-mandated alternative appeared “dead on arrival”. “The problem is it would just take an eternity to come up with a useful level [of funds],” he said. “I can’t imagine there’s any appetite in the federal government to provide a loan if there was a blow-up in the interim.”John Roe, an NFA board member who heads a group advocating for former MF Global customers, said that the industry is clamouring for some sort of customer account insurance.“The pricing is going to be the rub here – you’re going to have to have a big enough field of folks here to bring the costs down to make it effective,” he said.
267;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-11-12T23:39:19Z;CME defies trends by hiking trading fees;;CME Group has substantially raised transaction fees for the first time in four years as it flexes its pricing muscle as the dominant US futures exchange operator.The fee rises would hit traders in markets from Treasury to energy futures. Chicago-based CME attracted 84 per cent of US futures volumes in the first 10 months of 2013, according to the Futures Industry Association.The exchange’s ability to demand higher rates runs counter to trends in other markets, where commissions and transaction fees have been ground down under intense competitive pressure. It comes as CME beats back legislative efforts to fund its primary regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, through a new user fee.Clearing and transaction fees provide the bulk of CME revenue and totalled $597.9m in the third quarter of 2013, up 6 per cent on the year. But its average rate per contract traded fell 7 per cent. The exchange last substantially changed transaction fees in 2009.“We routinely adjust fees and since our last fee increase, we’ve made numerous investments in resources and technology enhancements to address the growing infrastructure needs for our customers,” CME said.The exchange seeks to raise the fee for Treasury futures from 50 cents to 54 cents per contract for traders who are not clearing house members. The “day” rate for core energy futures would rise from 45 cents to 55 cents.CME dominates interest rate futures trading in the US and its cleared exchange model is one that regulators have referenced in their efforts to reform the much larger privately negotiated derivatives market.For investors, banks and other traders, the advent of electronic markets has resulted in lower transaction costs, but the entrenched position CME enjoys in some areas of futures means it can push up the price of trading and clearing.However, fees have fallen in recent years as CME has sought to combat rivals from entering the lucrative interest rate sector in the US.Sang Lee, managing partner at Aite Group, said the move reflected the power of CME’s market position in US listed futures.“They don’t want to push it too much so that it compels people to look for an alternative. Most people complain about higher fees, but then move on,” he said.A senior US proprietary trading group executive opposed the fee increases and said: “They’ve become all powerful. They have pricing power, regulatory power and huge market share in the United States.”CME has fought an Obama administration proposal to fund the CFTC with a user fee worth $315m a year, saying it would “increase the cost of business for all customers” and raise food prices as farmers back away from grain futures.John Brady, senior vice-president at broker RJ O’Brien, said the increased fees reflect higher regulatory costs faced by the industry in recent years. “Eventually it filters down to the end-user,” he said.
268;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-11-12T12:09:05Z;NYSE Euronext takeover poses tough challenges for ICE boss;;Jeff Sprecher has built an enviable reputation by turning IntercontinentalExchange into the leading home for energy derivatives trading in just 14 years.But as the ICE chief executive takes control of NYSE Euronext on Wednesday, he steps into unfamiliar territory as the new owner of the world’s most high-profile stock exchange.His target in the $10bn acquisition was Liffe, NYSE’s London-based derivatives exchange, a leader in trading interest rate derivatives. But to justify that price tag to ICE shareholders accustomed to growth, the Atlanta-based group must unlock value from NYSE’s range of underperforming assets, including leading equity businesses in the US and Europe.That challenge is one much greater in terms of staff, scale and geography than anything Mr Sprecher has undertaken before. “This [NYSE] is a big conglomerate of stuff that has never been integrated and now Jeff gets to do one giant integration,” says one industry insider.Investors are betting that Mr Sprecher’s tenure will bring better times. More than 80 per cent of NYSE shareholders have opted to take ICE stock rather than the cash offered as part of the deal.With the addition of Liffe’s strong European interest rates business, Mr Sprecher will aim to turn ICE from a predominantly energy derivatives exchange to one better positioned to compete in new asset classes against CME Group and Deutsche Börse.As new regulations around derivatives take shape and with volatility expected to return when interest rates rise, the three exchanges have jockeyed for position around the world.The CME, which operates the world’s largest futures exchange, overwhelmingly dominates the US market in interest rate derivatives. Taking control of Liffe gives ICE a footing in Europe, where it will compete against Deutsche Börse and where CME’s plans to enter have been stalled.“Neither [CME nor ICE] has been able to steal each other’s contracts . . . it’s about new contracts and new territories,” says Karl Fruecht, managing partner at the Nomy Group, a consultancy. “As you’re looking for growth, you have to be buying new contracts – and that is what ICE has just done: they just bought Europe.”But while fighting that battle, Mr Sprecher must also divine NYSE’s future in US equities. While Twitter’s listing last week threw the spotlight on the famous exchange’s listing business, it has spent the past decade fighting a decline in market share.NYSE once had a near monopoly of equities trading, but now holds a slim lead in market share over US rivals largely by offering payments to encourage brokers to trade on its exchange. Mr Sprecher, however, has repeatedly expressed his disgust with the practice, which is a feature of most stock trading venues.Jeff Sprecher has long sought an interest rate derivatives business. His first shot at one came in 2007 with an unsuccessful attempt to halt the Chicago Board of Trade’s sale to CME. The ICE head then tried to purchase Liffe in 2011 by combining with Nasdaq OMX in a failed attempt to break up the merger of NYSE and Deutsche Börse, which was later blocked by regulators . . .Continue reading“I think the secondary market that takes advantage of people that have to trade or have poorer information is not particularly warranted or helpful or sustainable,” he said recently on an analyst call. “I think the market model is going to change, I think people in the business want it to change and hopefully by being transparent about it, we will be a positive force in causing it to change.”How Mr Sprecher will lead such a major change while re-establishing NYSE’s dominance in the market remains to be seen, especially considering many say the US equity market has little in common with the futures business. Rich Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill says: “It’s a very tough, highly competitive environment. It’s not going to be easy to change.”Mr Sprecher is also preparing to dispose of Euronext, the operator of stock exchanges in Paris, Lisbon, Amsterdam and Brussels. By spinning off Euronext through a sale or initial public offering, ICE will be freed of the transatlantic corporate governance issues that slowed decision making at NYSE.Lastly, ICE must decide what to do with the technology unit that NYSE has ploughed hundreds of millions of dollars into without much result. According to people familiar with its thinking, ICE is planning to move the market data business back into the exchange and look to dispose of the remaining assets, including data centres in Mahwah, New Jersey, and possibly Basildon, UK.The technology unit’s top executives are expected to depart when the NYSE-ICE deal closes. According to former insiders, the struggles of its technology business stemmed from NYSE’s halfhearted embrace of the changes taking place in the industry. NYSE declined to comment.“The biggest mistake an equity exchange [can make] is to try and not . . . be an equity exchange,” says one banker. Now how NYSE defines itself will be in the hands of Mr Sprecher.

The ICE head then tried to purchase Liffe in 2011 by combining with Nasdaq OMX in a failed attempt to break up the merger of NYSE and Deutsche Börse, which was later blocked by regulators.In addition to interest rates trading, both ICE and CME are looking to exploit new rules around clearing of over-the-counter interest rate swaps. New regulations mean more of the OTC derivatives market will move on to electronic trading venues and trade through clearing houses.The CME has long been seen as a winner under the reforms as it is able to offer customers offsets on the margin investors post for both listed and OTC business.On a call with analysts last week, Mr Sprecher said that the combination of Liffe’s interest rate business, its new role as administrator of the Libor interbank rate, and ICE’s dominant position in the clearing of credit default swaps would “give us a platform to go after more unique businesses in the rate space” including the clearing of OTC interest rate swaps.While he would not go so far as to say the company could take market share from CME, he said “the pie for people in this business will be getting bigger”.NYSE switched clearing on NYSE Liffe to ICE Clear Europe ahead of the merger, which has so far generated a “relatively modest amount” of revenue, Scott Hill, chief financial officer, said on the call.But Mr Sprecher said “it was in ICE’s best interest to offer Liffe a very attractive clearing deal” to convince NYSE not to build its own clearing house, and this would benefit the combined company.Anything that strengthens ICE is likely to affect CME, says Matt Simon, analyst at the Tabb Group.“This tie up . . . will push the CME to be a little more aggressive in terms of trying to find out where they can capitalise,” said Mr Simon. “They’re going to be paying a lot of attention to what they’re doing at ICE-NYSE to stay on top of their game.”
270;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-11-04T23:00:23Z;CME disappoints on clearing revenues;Revenue less than expected despite market share gains;CME Group, operator of the world’s largest US futures exchange, disappointed investors with lower than expected over-the-counter clearing revenues even though third-quarter profits rose 8 per cent as it increased its market share in interest rate swaps.CME was touted as one of the biggest winners of new rules designed to boost transparency in the $600tn over-the-counter derivatives market under the Dodd-Frank Act, because it owns one of the houses at which US OTC swaps are cleared.However, shares in the group closed down 1.1 per cent in New York trading due to the OTC clearing revenues being lower than had been expected.“While they are making good strides in interest rates overall, the OTC [interest rate swap] revenue per million continued to decline in the third quarter,” said Richard Repetto, of Sandler O’Neill.Phupinder Gill, chief executive, told analysts on a conference call that there was evidence that interest rate products were “benefiting from a migration of activity from OTC to futures”, with interest rate contracts volume up 29 per cent.The company’s exchanges saw overall daily average trading volumes rise 11 per cent to 12m contracts from the same period the previous year.Terry Duffy, president, said that CME’s market share in OTC interest rate swap clearing lifted from 5 per cent in the first quarter to 31 per cent during the three months to September, after taking some share from LCH.Clearnet, the market leader.“Now that the three waves of the Dodd-Frank clearing mandate are completed, the market is shifting from a compliance phase to an optimisation phase,” he said. “Our interest rate [products] will continue to benefit from our success in OTC clearing.”The Chicago-based company reported earnings of $236m, or 71 cents per share on a diluted basis, for the September quarter, up from $218m, or 66 cents a share, for the same period last year. Revenues increased 4.6 per cent to $714.6m from $683m last year.Excluding one-off items, CME earned 75 cents a share, compared with 70 cents last year and against analysts’ expectations of 73 cents a share and sales of $713m.The results come as the company is defending itself against a suit brought by floor traders last year which claims that CME changed its rules to benefit high-frequency and electronic trading over traditional open outcry trading.The trial continues on Monday.
271;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-10-24T16:24:51Z;Deutsche Börse buys stake in UK start-up venue GMex;;Deutsche Börse, Europe’s largest exchanges operator by market value, has made its first foray into hybrid fixed income trading with the purchase of a minority stake in Global Markets Exchange Group, a new UK start-up venue.The German exchange said on Thursday it had paid “a single-digit” sterling sum in the millions for the minority stake in GMex, which was founded this year by Hirander Misra, former chief operating officer of Chi-X Europe, which became the region’s largest share trading venue.London-based GMex plans to offer swap futures and derivatives indices. It has applied to the UK regulator to become a multilateral trading facility, a legal designation that allows it to trade. If approved, Deutsche Börse’s clearing business, Eurex, would process the deals made on GMex.The tie-up is the most high-profile push to date by a European exchange into swap futures, which are hybrids of off-exchange interest rate swaps and listed futures. Investors and brokers face mandatory clearing of derivatives trades under new global legislation, but some worry it will add extra cost to trading or force investors to use products that are not tailored to their needs.Swap futures are being explored by both exchanges and investors. They promise the economic flexibility of a swap with the inexpensiveness of a future. They were first launched in the US last year by CME Group, but take-up has been slow while regulation is being finalised.However, CME has agreed similar tie-ups to explore the products with new US trading venues TruEx and Eris Exchange.GMex says it provides a more accurate track of the real exposure to the changes in the yield curve than existing contracts.“Time to market is one of the key things here,” said Brendan Bradley, global head of innovation management at Deutsche Börse. Eurex, like CME, was also developing its own swaps futures contracts, in addition to the GMex investment, he added. “We don’t think one swap futures concept will win out. There will be several that will coexist.”Mr Misra said the investment was a validation of GMex’s business model. “What’s attractive here is that Deutsche Börse have a large derivatives franchise and they are expanding OTC clearing. We see synergies between interest rate swaps and the listed products by offsetting.”
272;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-10-17T07:28:37Z;US eleventh hour deal averts default;House vote of 285 to 144 lifts debt ceiling and reopens government;The US Congress has passed a bill to reopen the federal government and approve new sovereign borrowings, ending three weeks of high drama on Capitol Hill that pushed the US to the edge of a debt default .With pressure mounting from US business and overseas creditors such as China, the Senate and then the House of Representatives both voted to end the partial government shutdown and extend the debt ceiling into early next year while Democrats and Republicans start negotiations on a new budget.The Senate approved the agreement on Wednesday night with a vote of 81 to 18, and the House followed, approving the measure 285 to 144, although a majority of Republicans in the chamber voted against it.President Barack Obama signed the legislation shortly after midnight and furloughed workers are expected to return to work at federal agencies on Thursday morning.“Hopefully next time it won’t be in the eleventh hour. We’ve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis,” Mr Obama said on television shortly after the Senate vote.Sylvia Burwell, the White House budget director, said: “Employees should expect to return to work in the morning.”The bill won the reluctant blessing of John Boehner, the Republican speaker in the House, who earlier said that blocking the deal “will not be a tactic for us”.“We fought the good fight. We just didn’t win,” he told an Ohio radio station. In a closed-door session, Mr Boehner and other leaders urged fellow Republicans to support the Senate-negotiated bill.The compromise reopens the government until January 15, suspends the debt ceiling until February 7, and requires negotiations to reduce the budget deficit to be completed by December 13. It includes a mechanism for Republicans to voice their disapproval for an extension of the borrowing authority, though this would not have a practical effect.Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund managing director, welcomed the deal but called on US politicians to act differently in future. “It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner,” she said in a statement. “We also continue to encourage the US to approve a budget for 2014 and replace the sequester with gradually phased-in measures that would not harm the recovery, and to adopt a balanced and comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan.”Equity markets mostly rallied on the news. On Thursday the FTSE All-World equity index rose 0.3 per cent to 257.4, on course for its best close since May 2008. The Nikkei 225 was up 1.2 per cent in Tokyo, the Hang Seng 0.4 per cent higher in Hong Kong and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.4 per cent. European markets opened marginally down, however.On Wednesday US equity markets had rallied on the prospect of the deal, with the S&P 500 index climbing 1.38 per cent, leaving it within striking distance of last month’s record closing high that followed the Federal Reserve’s decision not to begin scaling back its quantitative easing programme.The CBOE Vix equity volatility index – closely watched as a measure of Wall Street anxiety – was down 21 per cent.However, business leaders said the long, high-decibel stand-off had already damaged the economy and consumer confidence.Standard & Poor’s said the shutdown shaved at least 0.6 per cent off annualised fourth-quarter GDP growth, or about $24bn out of the economy.The rating agency even warned that another round of government brinkmanship could lead to another “Humbug” holiday season.“The most immediate impact we’re seeing from the government default risk is an inflow of deposits,” said Andy Cecere, chief financial officer of US Bancorp, the sixth-biggest US bank by assets. He said customers were moving money out of Treasuries – with a “few billion dollars in the last week” moving to cash deposits at the bank.Mr Boehner vowed to continue to fight against “Obamacare”, the subject at the centre of the fiscal stand-off, but said Republicans would rely on “aggressive oversight” and “smart, targeted strikes” to split supporters of the law and push through reforms.Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, and Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, announced the agreement on the Senate floor on Wednesday, two weeks after the partial closure that has seen hundreds of thousands of workers temporarily laid off and just a day ahead of the debt ceiling deadline.Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas who had pushed a hard line in negotiations, did not delay the vote. But he tweeted afterwards: “This is a lousy deal that sells the American people down the river. It’s time to #MakeDCListen.”Mr Reid said: “We will do everything we can to change the atmosphere in the Senate and accomplish things for the good of our country.”Government agencies could also get more flexibility to arrange their budgets to comply with long-term cuts in spending introduced in the last big budget agreement.Under the current law, the agencies have little wiggle room to determine how the across-the-board cuts should be made. However, the overall, lower levels of government spending would be preserved.
273;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-10-16T18:20:45Z;Shutdown to continue to hurt US companies;;"The deal may be done, but the US will be living with the consequences of the debt showdown for a long time to come, in the form of corporate profit warnings, economic uncertainty and the enduring disgust of international investors.Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, criticised Congress, reflecting widespread views in the business community, saying investors abroad were “disappointed and concerned” by some politicians’ willingness to countenance a debt default.“The fact the narrative in Washington is even about whether we extend our debt ceiling is just not acceptable. If you are a debtor nation your job is to make sure your creditors like you,” Mr Fink said. “Even with a deal to avoid a default, the damage has been done and the result will be a slowdown in economic growth.”Stanley Black & Decker on Wednesday became the first US company to tie a profits warning to the shutdown. James Loree, the company’s chief operating officer, said there was usually a surge in demand in September related to government spending, but this year “it just didn’t occur”.WW Grainger, the industrial supplies company, reported a “high-single digits” decline in sales to the federal government, and warned: “Sequestration and the government shutdown remain significant headwinds”.Housebuilder sentiment is also ebbing. Yet global equity markets rallied after Senate leaders unveiled a deal that could be put to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.Earlier, billionaire investor Warren Buffett likened the last-minute negotiations over raising the government’s debt ceiling to wielding a “political weapon of mass destruction”.If Congress did damage to the “237-year period of good behaviour” by causing a technical default on bond payments it would be a “pure act of idiocy”, Mr Buffett told CNBC.“I know it’s been used in the past, but we used the atomic bomb back in 1945 and we decided we weren’t going to do something like that again.”Market participants continued to make contingency plans for a default: CME Group, the exchanges operator, demanded clients trading US interest rate swaps deposit more collateral to absorb potential losses; Bank of New York Mellon said its fund management customers had been liquidating short-term government debt in favour of holding cash.William Demchak, chief executive at PNC Financial, said that, even if Congress lifted the debt ceiling in a timely manner, “we’re still likely to see an impact in the form of a slowdown in broader economic activity as we go to the fourth quarter. So, things are not going to get any easier and we’ve plenty of work to do.”Tim Hopper, chief economist at TIAA-CREF, the investment firm with $523bn under management, said: “If Congress and the president are able to reach a long-term deal that offers investors some certainty, it could unleash a wave of growth. However, a short-term deal that doesn’t provide clarity about future fiscal intentions would likely continue to restrain growth.”"
274;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME raises US interest rate swap deposits;;CME Group, the exchanges operator, has raised the amount of capital that investors must deposit to clear their US interest rate swaps trades by 12 per cent on fears over the fallout of a potential US government debt default.The move by the Chicago-based group, one of the world’s largest clearers of interest rate swaps, comes amid growing global concern over faltering US efforts to end its budget impasse.Overnight Fitch, the credit rating agency, placed the triple A credit rating of the US on negative watch as fears grew the US would miss Thursday’s deadline to raise its $16.7tn borrowing capacity.CME told customers on Tuesday it would make four increases of 3 per cent over the next four days to base margins, coming into effect today.Interest rate swaps are the world’s largest over-the-counter asset class, with around $500tn traded by notional volume globally. A clearing house stands between two parties in a deal, ensuring the trade is completed in the event of a default. Global regulators have pushed for more of the opaque OTC derivatives market to be processed through clearing houses since the financial crisis.The Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing became the first exchange to take measures against the risk of a US default last week when it raised collateral levels on some types of short-term Treasuries.“CME Clearing is closely monitoring the developments related to the US reaching its debt ceiling,” it told customers in a circular. “Anticipating possible market moves specific to this event, CME will increase margin for all over-the-counter interest-rate swaps.”There was no change to CME’s requirements for collateral or a “haircut” to its valuation of US Treasuries. CME added that the measure was temporary. “It will be rolled back upon resolution of market uncertainty stemming from this specific event risk.”
275;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-10-10T13:39:41Z;Currency risk fears delay CME Europe;;CME Group’s plans to launch a London derivatives exchange is being held up by concerns at the Bank of England that it could pose systemic risk to the currency trading markets, according to two people familiar with the situation.The world’s largest futures exchange has had its year-long application to commence derivatives trading in Europe delayed repeatedly while its UK regulators examine its process for clearing trades.The Chicago-based group wants to establish a London hub as part of a global expansion and intends to start with foreign exchange futures, a business that it has operated for more than 40 years in the US. Altogether it wants to offer 30 foreign exchange contracts at its debut.But two September launch dates have been missed while the exchange awaits final approval. Last month CME told clients that the delay was due to “a technical issue around the delivery of physical currencies”.While the UK Financial Conduct Authority provisionally gave approval several months ago, the BoE, which regulates clearing houses, has yet to sign off on the application, people familiar with the situation said. The final decision on CME’s application will rest with the BoE.The BoE has consulted with other central banks, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York over clearing of foreign exchange. Unlike other asset classes, much of the foreign exchange market is settled via a not-for-profit industry body called CLS Bank, rather than one of the big clearing houses.CLS Bank was set up a decade ago largely to deal with counterparty risk in the foreign exchange market – it seeks to mitigate the problems that would occur if one party to a trade pays out the currency it has sold but does not receive the currency it has bought. CLS Bank settles most of the $5tn a day market, mostly by netting trades between the same counterparties.Part of the issue for regulators is that CME has proposed to process foreign exchange trades in the same way, by netting investors’ long and short positions, as it does with other popularly traded products, such as US Treasuries, the people said.That puts it at odds with common practice in London, where most trades in the currency market are settled on a gross basis. The BoE said it does not comment on individual cases.The dollar leg of foreign exchange trades must be settled via CLS Bank. The New York Federal Reserve acts as the lead overseer of CLS. The CME declined to comment.The move comes as the BoE this week warned UK lawmakers over the risks posed by clearing houses to the world’s financial system. Paul Tucker, deputy BoE governor, described the institutions as “too important to fail”.Rival Eurex, owned by Deutsche Börse, also had to postpone the launch of foreign exchange futures trading this week, but said the delay was because a third-party bank through which Eurex would access CLS was not ready.CLS said it had requirements for exchanges connecting via third-party providers but it was “not directly involved in the relationship between them and the third-party banks”.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York declined to comment.

Rusal, the world’s largest aluminium producer, said a new rule proposed by the LME would lead to “ diminished relevance of the exchange for industrial users”.Ms Hunnable said that both investors and corporate users of the metals markets had approached CME to suggest it launch an aluminium contract. “They want the kind of price transparency that only CME Group can offer,” she said.The move represents a direct challenge to the largest franchise at the LME, which was acquired only last year by Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing for £1.4bn. Aluminium is the largest non-ferrous metals market and the highest turnover contract on the LME, accounting for about 40 per cent of trading volumes.“This is a great risk for the LME,” Oleg Mukhamedshin, deputy chief executive of Rusal told the Financial Times on Tuesday. “The market is not as transparent as it should be and growing competition from other markets means the LME will have to react quickly to make sure . . . market participants are satisfied.”CME’s contract would be physically deliverable and mirror the LME contract in many ways, according to a preliminary specification sent to traders and seen by the FT. Just as on the LME, each contract would be for 25 tonnes. Unlike the LME’s daily contracts the CME contract would be monthly.CME already has a network of warehouses in the US that underpin physical delivery of its copper contract. However, Ms Hunnable hinted that the exchange may expand its network for the aluminium contract: “It will be broader in region and participants than we have today.”The LME contract has been used as a benchmark by the aluminium market for more than 20 years, as so-called “producer pricing”, whereby producers set fixed prices for the metal, was abandoned in the 1980s.Additional reporting by Neil HumeThis article was amended to reflect the end of producer pricing in the 1980s.
277;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-10-03T16:40:44Z;ICE and NYSE Euronext go where other exchanges have struggled;;IntercontinentalExchange’s purchase of NYSE Euronext has moved one step closer after passing a key European regulatory hurdle, but the $10bn deal has yet to spark another round of global industry consolidation.ICE and NYSE said late on Wednesday that Euronext’s governing college of regulators were “not minded to object” to their proposed deal, announced in December. The acquisition needs final approvals from national authorities in individual European jurisdictions for it to be completed.The transatlantic deal is likely to become the industry’s largest since the Chicago Mercantile Exchange bought the Chicago Board of Trade for close to $12bn in 2007, and a notable cross-border success after several high-profile failures.The once-fragmented, equities-dominated business has been overturned in the past decade by competition, increasing use of automated trading and the growing popularity of derivatives. The industry response was to bulk up via acquisitions, with strategic assets fought over like a game of chess. But the dealmaking has since slowed down.“The ICE/NYSE deal is in fact more the outlier rather than the trendsetter, at least for now,” says Frederic Ponzo, managing partner of GreySpark capital markets consultancy. “In fact, it can only go through because the US market is fragmented and competitive, therefore the risk of abuse of dominant position is very remote.”So far this year BATS Global Markets has agreed a merger with rival Direct Edge to create the second-largest share-trading platform in the US. And speculation in recent weeks has linked Nasdaq OMX in a merger with the London Stock Exchange Group.Cross-border exchange deals have not always been easy, however. The European Commission’s blocking of Deutsche Börse’s merger with NYSE Euronext last year and Australian authorities’ squashing of Singapore’s SGX’s plans to buy ASX in 2011 left executives scarred.“The national card has been played [by regulators] a lot in recent years and [executives] have had their fingers burnt,” says Niki Beattie, founder and chief executive of Market Structure Partners, a capital markets consultancy.Instead, consolidation and growth has increasingly been focused along national or local lines.“I think exchanges have gotten a lot smarter and size is less important,” says one industry banker, who declined to be named. Executives were thinking more imaginatively about acquisitions, considering data companies and clearing houses for example, “because there are fewer transactions that the regulators would let happen or that make sense from a valuation perspective”.Speculation linking Nasdaq OMX in a tie-up with the London Stock Exchange Group revives one of the industry’s longest-standing bid stories, write Philip Stafford and Arash Massoudi.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, went hostile seven years ago, with a £12.43 per share offer for the 69 per cent of LSE shares it didn’t own. The LSE shareholders rebuffed the approach, and Nasdaq later sold its stake at a profit.Nevertheless, analysts say the rationale for a deal still holds. “Nasdaq faces consolidations taking place above and below them. You could certainly see some movement there,” says Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.Furthermore, LSE and Nasdaq have both seen their historic business of cash equities trading come under intense pressure from new market entrants. Recent efforts to diversify – Nasdaq has pushed into US fixed income trading and the LSE has entered clearing and settlement – are complementary.But others question the timing. LSE is still integrating LCH.Clearnet, and Nasdaq has a $2bn debt pile, which will rise with the $750m purchase of eSpeed from BGC Partners.One asset with an unclear future is Euronext, which comprises the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. ICE has already indicated that it plans to float the business next year, although rumours persist it could be sold.“If I were LSE, I would consider NYSE or Nasdaq but not until I see what happens with Euronext, because there would be more synergies with Europe and the transatlantic deals have not worked,” says Diego Perfumo, an analyst at Equity Research Desk.In Asia, speculation persists that the Singapore exchange may yet return to the consolidation trail after the failure to merge with ASX two years ago. It has one of the strongest balance sheets of any exchange in the world but, since 2011, it has concentrated on organic growth and is stepping up plans to expand its network of overseas sales offices.Japan is expected to undergo another round of consolidation after the creation in January of Japan Exchange Group through the combination of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Osaka Securities Exchange.The country still has three main commodity exchanges, including Tocom, as well as other smaller ones. “Consolidation has to take place for it to make any sense as an efficient exchange model,” says Bill Herder, president of the Asia chapter of the Futures Industry Association, based in Singapore.However, unlike many other countries, Japan’s commodity exchanges and financial exchanges are each overseen by different regulators. Consolidating watchdogs under one roof is seen as a key prerequisite for any deals between these exchanges.But for many executives, a mega-deal is a simply a step too far in an uncertain world. Exchanges with derivatives businesses are having to comply with a G20 mandate intended to tighten up practices and oversight of derivatives markets, and this could threaten revenues.Around the world, the local rules are still being written. “Only time will tell what will be the profitable business models,” says Mr Ponzo at GreySpark. “Until it gets clearer, the valuations for deals are pretty much impossible to ascertain, hence the lack of appetite to buy too high or sell too low. Give it two years for the new regimes to play out and then we will see another wave of consolidation, but I doubt it will happen before then.”
278;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-09-28T01:15:16Z;CME delays Europe exchange again;;CME Group has been forced to delay the launch of its planned London derivatives exchange for the second time in three weeks after failing to secure regulatory approval in time.The world’s largest futures exchange sent a circular to its customers on Friday afternoon that the opening of CME Europe, due to take place on Monday, “has been delayed due to a technical issue around the delivery of physical currencies”.“CME Group has been working very closely with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England to achieve full regulatory recognition,” the company said.With CME Europe, the company is seen as making a major push to challenge Eurex, part of Deutsche Börse, for clients in Europe and Asia, as well as IntercontinentalExchange, whose European operations will be bolstered if its $10bn merger with NYSE Euronext closes as expected later this year.The CME gave no alternative date for the launch. It submitted its application to become a derivatives exchange to UK authorities last year but hopes of launching in the first half were put back by an overhaul of the regulatory structure.Under the new rules responsibility for clearing houses such as CME Clearing Europe has moved to the Bank of England.The company plans to launch 30 contracts, including many futures tied to currencies. It is planning to expand to other asset classes in the 18 months following opening of CME Europe, including interest rates, commodities, metals and equities derivatives.The CME’s first planned launch date of September 9 was also cancelled.

He will handle external affairs, enterprise risk and internal audit and compliance for the clearing organisation.“I am . . . enthusiastic about the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead,” Mr Donohue said.The move comes after the options industry has been hit by a series of technical errors that temporarily halted trading across much of the sector.Mr Donohue is no stranger to markets turmoil. He resigned after eight years as chief executive of CME in the aftermath of the collapse of two major futures brokers , MF Global and Peregrine.Mr Donohue was born and raised in Chicago, and rose through the ranks at CME over a 23-year career.OCC recently received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to split the roles of chief executive and chairman.Michael Cahill will serve as its next chief executive. He and Mr Donohue will replace long-time chairman and chief executive Wayne Luthringshausen, who announced this year that he would leave at the end of the year after nearly 40 years at the helm.
280;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-09-18T16:47:06Z;CME pushes into OTC market with move to trade swaps;Surprise application will pit exchange against Wall Street brokers;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, is to intensify its push into the off-exchange derivatives market by applying to trade swaps in the US.The group, which already clears interest rate swaps, has lodged an application with US regulators to operate a swaps trading platform as it aims to take advantage of new rules designed to boost transparency in the $600tn over-the-counter derivatives market, pitting it against Wall Street brokers.Analysts said CME’s application to operate a swap execution facility (Sef), a type of trading venue seen as reforming OTC derivatives without forcing activity on to exchanges, was a sign that the company was expanding its strategy and the scope of its OTC efforts by bringing in swaps trading revenues.“This is a more aggressive posture to now look at both the trading and clearing opportunities,” said Rich Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill.The CME has already been touted as one of the biggest winners from the new derivatives rules, passed under the Dodd-Frank Act, because it has created hybrid “ swap futures” products and owns one of the clearing houses in which US OTC swaps are likely to be cleared.Its market share in OTC interest rate swap clearing has continually grown since the first clearing mandate in March, hitting a record 29 per cent in August, while LCH.Clearnet, the dominant player, has seen its share drop, falling to 71 per cent in August.Operating a Sef will pit the company against competitors such as Bloomberg and ICAP, which have applied to operate the facilities and like CME are likely to concentrate on interest rate swaps eventually.The move may upset the operators of other Sefs, many of which are also customers of the exchange, given that the company had not given any clear indications that it planned to enter execution.Indeed, Phupinder Gill, CME chief executive, last year suggested in Futures Industry magazine that in the case of swaps the company was “clearly a horizontal participant” focused on clearing.Rival IntercontinentalExchange has also applied to operate a Sef, though is likely to focus on credit default swaps initially. If its $10bn acquisition of NYSE Euronext closes later this year as expected, ICE will probably focus on interest rate swaps in Europe, Mr Repetto said.The CME’s application requires approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The company said it would initially focus on commodity products, and would develop additional products over time.
281;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-09-16T21:01:33Z;Winds of change blow through Chicago exchanges;New rules on over-the-counter derivatives create opportunities;In the early 1980s Milton Friedman phoned up Leo Melamed, then the head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with an idea for a Consumer Price Index-based futures contract.“This is near the hand of God handing something down, so I said, ‘of course, send me your notes’,” says Mr Melamed, now chairman emeritus of CME Group. “Our people came back almost in embarrassment and said, ‘Leo, we don’t know if we can make a market with this’.”Mr Friedman took the product elsewhere. “I think history will show that they listed it and it failed,” says Mr Melamed.Mr Melamed and Mr Friedman, perhaps more than most, are responsible for the soaring fortunes of the Windy City in the past 30 years as futures trading has moved from a minor sideline to one of the main ways investors speculate and hedge risk. The lack of fungibility in futures products has helped provide the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) with a near-monopoly of the US futures industry.The new rules around over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives passed under the Dodd-Frank Act present a great opportunity for the CME, which Mr Melamed helped to grow into the world’s largest futures exchange operator. Some institutions will be required to clear off-exchange trades, including credit default and interest rate swaps, forcing them to put up more margin and collateral to back their trades.Analysts said the CME was likely to be one of the biggest winners as it owns one of the clearing houses in which US OTC swaps are likely to be cleared.CME, its main domestic rival IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), headquartered in Atlanta, and Chicago-based start-up Eris Exchange are also seeking to capitalise on the new rules as investors switch from tailored but expensive swaps to cheaper but standardised listed futures to offset their risk. The exchanges have also created new products such as “swap futures”– hybrid products that promise the economic benefits of swaps but trade on an exchange.But Mr Melamed’s story about his Nobel-prize-winning friend illustrates the vast uncertainty of the prospects of futures products. After all, if the “hand of God” doesn’t always get it right, who can?“The probability of new products succeeding is really low,” says Don Wilson, head of DRW, a major proprietary trading firm, and a co-founder of Eris. “But in this Dodd-Frank driven environment, the probability of success is much higher than it otherwise would be.”Eris has seen a surge of open interest as the new rules have come online, recently crossing 50,000 contracts, compared to around 20,000 contracts at the beginning of this year. Still, its trades will clear at CME’s clearing house.In energy trading and clearing, CME faces competition from ICE. It also faces a challenge in clearing from LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house which launched a US-domiciled version of its interest-rate swap clearing service in June. The London Stock Exchange Group-controlled company is the world’s largest clearer of interest rate swaps, though CME is gradually chipping away at its lead.Rich Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill, says the opportunity presented by the new clearing mandate is already playing out. “The magnitude of it is what is still unclear.”The CME’s market share in OTC interest rate swap clearing has continually grown since the first clearing mandate in March, hitting a record 29 per cent in August while LCH has seen its share drop, to 71 per cent in August.CME will face some competition from swap execution facilities (Sef), which are seen as reforming OTC derivatives without forcing activity on to exchanges. But the higher cost may lead to swaps shifting toward exchanges, where the price of margin is less.But with around a dozen entities, including Bloomberg and ICAP, applying to offer Sefs, liquidity is likely to be very poor, says John Fay, global head of commodities and currencies at Newedge. With only a few places that can act as clearing houses, “the clear winners will be the established players”.That includes ICE, though Mr Repetto says ICE is not a threat to CME’s dominance in the US in the near term. Instead, NYSE Liffe, which the company will acquire if its $10bn acquisition of NYSE closes later this year as expected, makes the company a much greater threat to Eurex in Europe.One of CME’s greatest opportunities may lie elsewhere. Phupinder Gill, chief executive, recently argued that Asia, and China specifically, may provide the most promising medium- to long-term boost.In the US, CME and ICE have largely grown separately because the lack of fungibility in the futures market “creates an environment [in which] the unique products of an exchange drive the business”, says Matt Simon, analyst at the TABB Group.Mr Simon says the growth of unique products as each company attempts to draw interest, combined with the potential for arbitrage opportunities if the exchanges attempt to market similar products, could be beneficial for all participants.“This actually could be better for the market overall, for both to grow side by side and succeed,” he says.NYSE Liffe’s exclusive agreement with MSCI and ICE’s with Russell will create key advantages for the joint entity, Mr Simon adds. But CME’s S&P Dow Jones agreement has its own advantages, and bolsters the case that ICE and CME “could do very well if the entire futures market continues to grow”.“The brokerage community and some of the futures desks are actually looking forward to that pairing up, because it will now provide opportunities for potential more pricing arbitrage and new trading opportunities,” says Mr Simon.
282;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-09-16T21:00:40Z;Europe: Thwarted merger raises question of transatlantic power balance;Will a combination of new derivatives rules and EU competition policy usher in a US takeover of European market infrastructure?;To mention European competition policy to a senior Deutsche Börse executive is to touch on a sensitive subject. Last year Brussels squashed the plans by Europe’s exchanges operator to merge with rival NYSE Euronext.The merger would have created a transatlantic global powerhouse well positioned to exploit the opportunities being created by the sweeping legislation that will force more privately traded OTC derivatives on to electronic trading venues.Deutsche Börse argues that the consequences go far beyond its own interest. “It is the result of European regulators making sure that consolidation in our global derivatives industry, for the foreseeable future, will be very successfully led by exchanges with US origin,” Andreas Preuss, chief executive of its derivatives exchange Eurex, told a conference in London over the summer.Nearly 18 months on from the landmark ruling, the landscape in the old continent appears to be shifting dramatically. Overseas companies have been aggressively pursuing European and global expansion plans, using London as the hub.In that short time, CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, has expanded by opening a futures exchange and a clearing house in Europe. BNY Mellon, a US custodian bank, won approval for a European central securities depository.Overshadowing it all, the US’s IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) then swooped on NYSE Euronext last December in a deal worth around $10bn. Assuming the deal goes ahead, it will give Jeff Sprecher, ICE’s chief executive, the London Liffe derivatives market that he has long sought and ownership of the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. It has made ICE’s clearing house one of the largest in Europe. Deutsche Börse, which had eyed a mega-merger with NYSE Euronext for four years, found itself rebuffing polite inquiries from the CME about a deal.So will a combination of new derivatives rules and EU competition policy usher in a US takeover of European market infrastructure? “If you look at history, US dominance is far from proven,” argues Florence Fontan, head of asset managers at BNP Paribas Securities Services. “It doesn’t mean they can’t be successful.She adds that attempts to “take the US model and plug it into Europe” have “been failing” for “underestimating the level of complexity” on the continent. “Europe is used to adapting to differing frameworks,” she says.Significant variances between the US and Europe include regulations governing the way clearing houses must segregate their customers assets and the way they collect initial margin or insurance for trading.Newcomers face a serious problem in wresting business away from local incumbents, particularly in derivatives trading. Clearing of OTC interest rate swaps is dominated by LCH.Clearnet and, while the CME clearing operations are in their infancy, they have yet to make a significant inroad into the local market.Ms Fontan points to the example of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which tried to crack European equities clearing, as regulation demanded competition in equities trading.The US post-trade service provider is in the process of selling down part of its stake in its main vehicle, EuroCCP, which is merging with the European Multilateral Trading Facility to cut costs.European companies have been as ambitious as their US counterparts. LCH.Clearnet, its future secure after the London Stock Exchange Group bought a controlling interest, is taking its game to the US. It has cleared $50tn in client business since the first stage of the US clearing mandate began in March. Euroclear, the post-trade services provider, agreed a deal with DTCC on collateral.European pride may get a boost next year when Euronext’s future is resolved. ICE’s Mr Sprecher has signalled his intention to float the business, although rumours persist that it will be sold. Several exchanges, including Deutsche Börse, the London Stock Exchange and SIX Group have been linked with a bid.Complicating the outlook is the uncertain regulatory framework in which business decisions are being made. Details need to be finalised for key Europe regulations, known as the Mifid Review and Emir. Policymakers will spend the next few months debating opening access to derivatives exchanges’ “vertical silo” model, with which contracts that are traded at a venue are processed through the exchange’s clearing house.To do that, policy makers would have to insist that derivatives products owned by exchanges be made fungible, or interchangeable with rival products. That could potentially open CME, ICE and Deutsche Börse to competition in listed derivatives – and could allow others to follow the path opened this year by The Order Machine, the Dutch start-up that has taken a quarter of market share of options trading from NYSE Euronext in Amsterdam.CME, ICE and Deutsche Börse argue that their model is better suited to maintaining financial stability and is what customers want. “The question is how does Europe grow?” said Mark Hemsley, chief executive of US-owned BATS Chi-X Europe, the region’s largest share trading venue. “Should the approach be that of the US equity options market, which has created a vibrant market for customers by releasing exchange competition but providing fungible products? This is not where exchanges want to go but it may mean that in the longer run innovation will continue to be restricted in Europe.”
283;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-09-16T21:00:40Z;US: Rivals vie for custom in changing world of swaps;Reforms open up an industry dominated by big banks;The financial reforms triggered by the financial crisis are starting to make their presence felt in the $300tn privately negotiated US derivatives market.With the counterparty risk of swap transactions now being assumed by centralised clearing houses, the focus of the industry is on how the trading of swaps will develop.A number of firms are formalising new transaction venues known as swap execution facilities, and these “Sefs” will compete with established futures exchanges to enable trading between banks and institutional investors. The development is seen as opening up an industry long dominated by big global derivative banks to greater competition, resulting in lower trading costs for investors.The new swap trading era pits a host of players in open competition against each other, from the well-established interdealer brokers such as ICAP, to big platforms run by Bloomberg, Tradeweb and MarketAxess, to a number of new entrants such as State Street and Javelin.The leading derivative exchanges, namely CME Group and the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), and other vendors are seeking to entice users of over-the-counter (OTC) swaps towards futures contracts that are cheaper to clear centrally.As Wall Street has lobbied hard to water down financial reform, an undercurrent among players in the established swaps industry has been the fear that exchanges such as CME and ICE would emerge as the big winners from a wholesale evolution of OTC swaps from a telephone-based market to computers.“Either OTC swaps or swap futures could be the winner,” says Charley Cooper, head of exchange-traded derivatives at State Street Global Exchange, which has filed a Sef application, and also provides technology support for the Eris Exchange and its swap futures contract.“In our discussions with clients we heard a preference for OTC swaps and swap futures, so we are offering them both, so we can capitalise on the way it plays out,” says Mr Cooper.Goldman Sachs and other dealers are supporting the CME’s swap futures contract – which is also based on a Goldman patent – while the Eris swap contract has the support of Morgan Stanley.According to Richard Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill Partners, leading executives at the CME believe it is not yet clear how far the OTC market will shift towards futures, while the presence of dealers remains important.“The CME believes the dealers will continue to play a significant role in the trading and clearing of IRS [interest rate swaps], at least in the near term,” says Mr Repetto. “On a five-year forward view, CME believes it is still unclear how much of the OTC will stay cleared and remain OTC or convert to a futures-like product.”Chris Edmonds, president of ICE Clear Credit says their credit index futures contract, launched in May, was developed in response to demand from investors who may not generally participate in the OTC market. “This is a credit product that appeals to non-traditional players, looking to hedge macro credit risk.”Mr Edmonds says ICE is looking at launching a full suite of credit-related products that would complement existing OTC products in the future.As the world between dealers and investors converges, all prospective swap trading platforms will need to connect with a wide range of participants. For interdealer brokers, this means moving beyond talking to a limited number of banks. Existing platforms such as Bloomberg, TradeWeb and MarketAxess that already link banks with institutional investors are expected to hit the ground running once Sefs are fully operational.Many of the new trading venues will not only offer streaming prices that enable users to buy or sell a swap on a screen with the click of a computer mouse, they are also going to provide a request for quote (RFQ) service, whereby an investor can seek a price from a limited number of banks or other market makers.“The winners will be those platforms that listen to their customers and give them a choice of ways to transact,” says James Cawley, chief executive officer at Javelin Capital Markets, which has filed to become a Sef. “In a commoditised market place, it is the relationship that wins.”The use of RFQ is seen as helping banks to preserve their market share, but if more investors gravitate towards an anonymous electronic trading book, it is seen as shifting the market to an exchange model.Chris Ferreri, a managing director at ICAP North America says while it is too soon to tell whether the OTC market will move towards a futures-type model, the cost of trading is a key factor for users of derivatives. “If the cost to clear and margin a future is less than a swap, then it’s more of a challenge for clients to transact swaps and not futures,” he says.
284;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
285;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-09-16T21:00:40Z;Markets tally cost of safer global trading;After ‘seismic’ regulatory change, the markets are grappling with ways to reduce risk while turning a profit;"Delegates at this week’s annual Sibos conference in Dubai are gathering at an apposite moment. Five years ago market infrastructure – the trading, clearing and settlement institutions on which financial markets rest – was thrown into the spotlight amid the fallout from the collapse of Lehman Brothers.As the worst subsided, global policy makers homed in on the huge and usually uninsured one-way positions in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that went unnoticed by banks until it was too late, in part because the opacity of the market allowed brokers to reap huge rewards.To prevent a repeat of this oversight threatening the financial system, the G20 mandated more standardised OTC derivatives, traded on transparent venues. Deals should be processed, they concluded, through clearing houses and reported to data warehouses known as trade repositories.In the interim the industry has grappled with one overarching challenge; how financial burdens associated with the new market structure should be shared between clearing houses, the banks that act as intermediaries and the end-users of derivatives, while still guarding against systemic risk.In the past year some decisions on key rules in the US and Europe have been made. Whether the process is finished is another matter.“It’s the most seismic thing to happen in years,” says Barney Reynolds, a partner at lawyers Shearman & Sterling. “The momentum has carried through some pretty meaningful change but that is running out.“As this beds down and the market takes off again, how will financial institutions manage to get an acceptable return in a heavily regulated and highly capitalised market?” he asks. “Will new business models develop to avoid some of the more onerous new restrictions? More importantly, will regulators allow this to happen?”Underpinning policy makers’ thinking was a push to move some of the risks for economies and markets that were traditionally absorbed by banks to supposedly more stable, less conflicted infrastructure such as clearing houses. They also aimed to spread risk around the industry. A clearing house stands between two parties in a deal, ensuring a trade is completed in the event of a default and its members pay for the operator to manage positions.These changes are well under way and elements are in force in some countries, even though important problems remain outstanding.Japan and the US, via its Dodd-Frank Act, have mandated clearing of swaps and reporting of trades. European regulators are working to finalise their response, contained in the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir).Perhaps most critically, in early summer US and European officials agreed a way jointly to police global derivatives markets and avert a potential regulatory turf war that threatened to disrupt the daily workings of financial markets.The world’s derivatives exchanges hope to benefit most from these sweeping moves, as they own their own clearing house.The industry has been quick to exploit the weaknesses of rivals and address gaps in their own services as evidenced by IntercontinentalExchange’s planned deal to buy NYSE Euronext, owner of London’s Liffe derivatives market, for $10bn in cash and shares.However, exchanges face a fierce battle. Heavy lobbying by banks, for whom OTC derivatives trading is a lucrative business, has resulted in some proposals being watered down, or profitable business lines carved out of the rules. Banks have voiced concerns to regulators that clearers are not sufficiently transparent about their operations, or may compromise systemic safety for commercial gain.This is rebutted by the industry. “As a neutral facilitator of risk, which clearing houses clearly are, the direction of the market is irrelevant,” says Terry Duffy, executive chairman at CME Group. “What’s important is making sure the pays and collects are done on a risk basis and not on a mark-to-myth or anything else.”Authorities recognise the job of shoring up the financial system is not finished.“There’s been good progress but there is still a lot more work to be done,” said Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England and chairman of the Financial Stability Board, only two weeks ago as he outlined the steps regulators had taken to solve the “too big to fail” problem.“We now have to move from the powers to the practical …we need to translate it into actual resolution plans for systemically-important financial institutions,” he said.He called on other countries and regulators to follow the US-EU agreement over swaps market oversight. The industry has long been concerned that regulatory over-reach across borders could stifle a global business and force it into regional concentrations.The first country to undertake mandatory clearing of derivatives for banks was Japan. Tokyo is the third largest off-exchange derivatives market after London and New York. It is also taking the lead role in defining Asian responses to the G20 mandate.“Everyone is looking at Japan,” says Sanela Hodzic, head of strategy at Calypso Technology, a US trading technology company that supplies the region’s main clearing houses. “The G20 rules are still being implemented but volume on the Japan Securities Clearing Corporation is bigger than the CME.”The participants potentially facing the greatest shake-up of the OTC market are the interdealer brokers, who act as middlemen moving large blocks of illiquid securities. US authorities have interpreted the move to electronic trading venues as an opportunity to introduce competition in what had previously been a clubby, closed world.In mandating these new marketplaces, known as swap execution facilities or Sefs, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has opened the door to entrants such as Bloomberg.However, interdealer brokers such as ICAP, Tullett Prebon and GFI Group say the reforms to offset risk in the market will simply institutionalise in regulation a role they already fulfil. “It will formalise many of the trading and post-trade practices that interdealer brokers have had in place for some time,” says Alex McDonald, chief executive of the Wholesale Markets Brokers’ Association.By contrast, equities trading is still dealing with the consequences of its “big bang” half a decade ago. Reforms on both sides of the Atlantic succeeded but brought market fragmentation in the era of high-frequency trading (HFT), which sought to exploit regulations or technological inefficiencies in the market.Profits from HFT peaked in 2009 and have fallen sharply since. For some of those who had benefited from the HFT explosion in equities, the time had come to branch out into other asset classes such as currencies and fixed income.Perhaps as a sign of a loss of confidence in transparent markets, investors increasingly turned to so-called “dark pools” – off-exchange venues where deals could be struck in private. Institutions liked them but regulators began to grow increasingly concerned about their ability to monitor a market where pricing was not transparent. It is a problem with which derivatives regulators are only too familiar."
286;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-09-11T21:58:47Z;In his own words: Terry Duffy;;Terry Duffy, executive chairman of the CME Group, runs one of the world’s biggest clearing houses and one of the companies most affected by the shake-up in derivatives markets.On meetings with lawmakers and regulators:In Washington when Congress is in session, I’m there every other week at least, sometimes every week.I think it is very important. Washington plays a pivotal role not only in the US, but throughout the world, so I try to make sure I’m part of the process as much as possible.The need for rules, the lack of need for mandatory clearing:Overall I don’t see much changing in Dodd Frank. At least not in the short term. I’m a big believer that we needed to have some legislation. I don’t like anything that needs to be mandatory. I’m against mandatory clearing.CME is not grabbing too much cash in the shake-up:This is a very commoditised product. Our rate per million contract is $2.25/$2.50. Some were projecting it would be $25 or $30 per million. That didn’t happen. This is a very stiff margin business.I never saw the pot of gold on the other side of the rainbow that other people were trying to portray.Activity moving from swaps to futures:Some will shift to futures, in what is called futurisation. That’s being going on since Enron. This is not new. People want to say its been happening since the crisis. I believe these markets are complementary in nature, and they can both continue to grow.Some banks say there is a “race to the bottom” among clearers and they themselves could be the source of the next crisis:That’s absolutely true what the banks are saying except for one thing: they didn’t do the same risk protocols that we do in clearing. What we do is twice daily mark-to-market and it’s a zero sum game: if you don’t have the money, out you go. At a bank they might have most favoured status for the client and so give them three, four, five days grace and carry it.If we ever had a race to the bottom on margin or collateral, you know we are only putting ourselves at risk. So that’s not something I would ever support or the organisation support. When people talk one day margin, two day margin, whatever the case may be in theory, don’t realise we don’t look at it that way. We look at it on a risk basis of the transaction.Banks say the quality of collateral accepted by clearing houses is decreasing:There are many things you can use. Corporates [bonds] are one of them. There are haircuts. These are not full-value bonds. They’re all haircutted to a proper level of liquidity. We don’t just take corporates, we don’t just take gold, we don’t just take cash, we take a blended mix of instruments. It’s diverse, which we think is a better system than putting all our eggs in one basket.The market structure has changed, we didn’t push it there, we didn’t cause the crisis, bad lending practices caused the crisis, giving credit to people [just because they have] a pulse caused the crisis. Giving people cash because they had an asset that was going to appreciate and that was your business sense, that’s what caused the crisis.Sometimes there is tension with the CFTC:I don’t think anyone has a smooth road with their regulator. There’s always a bit of tension, because they’re looking from the perspective of how do you eliminate 100 per cent of your risk. But there’s no such thing as eliminating a 100 per cent of the risk. You might as well turn off all the lights in every business.That’s the only way to eliminate 100 per cent of the risk. We do have some tension, but when you come off a crisis like we had in 08 and 09, there’s going to be a big swing of the pendulum and how do we eliminate everything that can go wrong. We have to show them in a real practical sense the unintended consequences.Because of MF Global . . . [there are going to be new rules for] customer segregation that has operated flawlessly until someone decided to circumvent the system. The system didn’t break, someone broke into the system. Now we are going to create a bunch of rules. That could hurt a bunch of smaller participants in the marketplace.All in all, the rules coming out of the CFTC are OK, we can love with them, deal with them. There’s a handful that are troublesome.On Gary Gensler, the chairman of the CFTC:I can work with Chairman Gensler, I’ve worked with him since day one. I don’t get overly concerned about that, others may. Listen, I think his end goal is make a safer system and I think that’s a very admirable goal. The question is it’s my job and others’ jobs to point out when it may be doing more harm than good.I will say there are times when I have a valid argument, he is very open-minded about it. There are other things where I think he has been a little stubborn on, but has listened to me and that’s all I ask for.Derivatives market better than securities exchanges:The market structure we ave here in listed derivatives is something that’s been a benefit from a risk management standpoint. IF you look at the flash crash as an example, when the CFTC called us and wanted the data, we had all in five hours. when I testified a month later on the flash crash, the securities exchanges still hadn’t got the information to the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] yet.
287;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-09-11T18:51:49Z;Dust starts to settle on derivatives revolution;Once opaque, much maligned sector cleans up its act;The numbers dance on the Bloomberg screen like any normal day on the stock market.But the fluctuating prices are not company shares. They are interest rate swaps – allowing traders to swap floating rates for fixed and vice versa – and the fact that there are so many prices visible to so many traders represents a sea change in derivatives trading.“It’s a paradigm shift from a market that was largely uncleared, largely dealer-focused, not exchange-traded, the classic attributes of a dark market,” says Gary Gensler, one of the architects of the change and chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.The “dealers” are the world’s biggest banks, spanning JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which enjoyed a couple of decades of lucrative profits from the rapidly expanding and opaque over-the-counter derivatives markets, until the crisis spoiled the party.The 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers and, particularly, mega-insurer AIG, which had to be bailed out after banks exercised clauses in derivatives contracts written by the insurance group and demanded more cash collateral, made “derivative” a dirty word in Washington.It showed the interconnectedness of the system – some of AIG’s top counterparties were banks as far flung as Société Générale in France and Royal Bank of Scotland of the UK, all of which also had exposure to dozens of other financial institutions. Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, memorably described derivatives as “financial weapons of mass destruction”.“One of the challenges for then Treasury secretary [Hank] Paulson and [Federal Reserve] chairman [Ben] Bernanke was if AIG fails what is their connection to others?” says Mr Gensler. “And if you remember the first $90bn [of taxpayer money] that went into AIG, $60bn went straight through AIG to other financial institutions.”The broad outlines agreed by the G20 group of nations in the aftermath of the crisis involved pushing more of the over-the-counter derivatives markets, with a notional value of more than $600tn, to be centrally cleared. The aim was to reduce the web of interbank exposure in favour of clearing houses that assumed and netted down the risk. Other rules force more transparency and push more contracts to be traded on electronic exchanges rather than in private “over the counter” deals.With the foundation of the new market in place, new winners and losers are emerging.As the dominant players, the largest banks should be the losers. Deloitte estimated they once enjoyed more than $50bn in revenues from derivatives trading. For instance, JPMorgan has predicted its revenues will fall by $1bn-$2bn as a result of the reforms.But as banks digest the new rules and changes in the industry, they are also adapting or looking for loopholes.Margins are expected to be squeezed as standardised derivatives contracts are moved to central clearing. Yet the dealer banks hope to benefit from a greater volume of trades while, if they choose, raising prices on more customised products to make up for higher capital costs.“The assumption in the market is that [it] will become much more equity-like and what we’ve seen there is lower margin, higher volume,” says Ruth Porat, chief financial officer at Morgan Stanley. “We think that’s the right direction to think about it.”Other banks are looking at ways of preserving their role. Not all derivatives have to be cleared or traded openly under the new rules: banks can continue with the old model on swaps that are customised and those that involve corporate “end-users” such as an industrial company wanting to hedge the risk of oil prices rocketing.“Our point of view is that everything has a price,” says another senior banker. “People have sensed that under the old regime the return on capital was substandard for many of these prices. But there’s a new price.”Another market development is the substitution of swaps with futures, which enjoy a lighter-touch regulatory regime even though they can be economically identical. “End users [real money investors and hedgers] are now required to clear swaps and they are starting to see how expensive it costs in terms of margin,” says Don Wilson, chief executive officer at DRW, a Chicago trading firm. “The futurisation of the swaps market is a story for 2014.”Ever since the regulatory overhaul was proposed in 2009, there has been intense jockeying – not only from the banks, but also from end-users, clearing houses and other large users and traders of derivatives, such as asset managers and hedge funds.I’m a big believer that the regulations we have were needed because we were going to knock ourselves into the Stone Age if we didn’t do somethingAs the dust begins to settle, there is not unanimity on who will benefit. Ken Griffin, chief executive of Citadel, the large hedge fund, told the Financial Times this week in enthusiastic terms that the market was being revolutionised in a “fantastic” way, with a narrower spread between prices quoted for buying and selling derivatives and a “material reduction in counterparty credit risk, and dramatic reduction in operational risk”.Other investors are far less certain that the market has lurched in their favour. “In terms of spread compression, we haven’t seen anything significant enough for us to get excited about at this point,” says a managing partner at a large hedge fund. He bemoans more bureaucracy to report trades: “It requires an extraordinary amount of man hours.”Meanwhile, the end users, who enjoyed the greatest lobbying clout in Washington and managed to secure an exemption from much of the rules, both in the US and in Europe, have nonetheless been affected. Banks are charging more for over-the-counter transactions, while low-volume customers face higher costs on exchanges.“The commodity exchanges came into existence to help farmers manage their risk,” says Chris Cheetham, president of Soter Advisors, which advises companies on hedging. “Now it seems they are more focused on the hedge fund community. A lot of end-users who do not generate lots of volume are finding it tremendously difficult to find clearing members willing to take them on.”The fulcrum of the new world are the clearing houses. Some market participants warn that regulators have created new “too big to fail” and highly interconnected entities with insufficient capital to cope with a future crisis.“There is still a tremendous amount of risk if you don’t have the right procedures and protocols in place,” responds Terry Duffy, executive chairman of the CME Group, one of the largest clearers. “We do, other clearers do, and that’s the difference from the way they [the banks] were doing it.”“The market structure has changed,” he says. “We didn’t push it there. We didn’t cause the crisis. I’m a big believer that the regulations we have were needed because we were going to knock ourselves into the Stone Age if we didn’t do something.”By Tom Braithwaite, Michael Mackenzie, Tracy Alloway and Gina ChonThe over-the-counter derivatives market has been reformed in several key areas under Dodd-Frank, with centralised clearing at the top of efforts by regulators to prevent any repeat of the systemic crisis that erupted after the demise of Lehman Brothers, write Michael Mackenzie and Philip Stafford.Bringing greater price transparency for a market long dominated by banks and hidden away in the shadows of finance and regulating swap dealers in a comprehensive fashion also underpins the intent of financial reform.With the credit risk of swaps being mutualised in clearing houses run by the CME, LCH.Clearnet and ICE Clear, records of swap activity are also now being stored in trade data reporting houses. This greater scrutiny is designed to alert regulators to the presence of large exposures being massed by one firm, and addresses the failure to catch AIG’s huge derivatives position in 2008.Greater price transparency for swaps is also set to increase as more platforms, dubbed Swap Execution Facilities, take a central role in 2014 as the primary trading venues for standardised swaps that are centrally cleared.The Dodd-Frank principles of greater transparency and greater use of clearing houses were part of a mandate agreed by the G20 at Pittsburgh in 2009.All countries have missed the end of 2012 deadline for full implementation. The US is the furthest advanced in implementing the rules although Japan has also begun mandatory clearing for broker-dealers.Europe is likely to finalise its rules in coming months, with clearing likely to become mandatory in about 18 months’ time.However, the industry and regulators are concerned that policing a global trading market will be complicated by differing local interpretations of the same mandate.
288;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-09-11T14:58:28Z;CME outspends rivals on Washington lobbying;;CME Group has outspent its closest rivals on lobbying policy makers so far this year and has appeared more times before the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the past six years, federal lobbying records show.The commitment to Washington by CME and the ultimate influence it brings reflects the powerful position the Chicago-based exchange operator has carved out for itself in the hallways of power. Few rivals have matched its influence.The world’s largest futures exchange by volume has spent a total $1.6m in lobbying the first six months of this year, registering six times before the CFTC.The IntercontinentalExchange, its closest rival, has paid $637,688 over the same period and registered twice before its regulator, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington non-profit making organisation that tracks political donations and lobbying. Federal lobbying records require companies to disclose which agency they’re lobbying every quarter.Bloomberg, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, and the Managed Funds Association, a hedge fund lobbying group, also registered before the CFTC six times. However, over the past six years CME has registered visits to its regulator significantly more: 16 times in 2011 compared with four registrations apiece by ICE, NYSE Euronext, and Nasdaq OMX.But if anything the public data underrepresents the influence in Washington of CME, whose strident executive chairman Terry Duffy flies to the capital twice a month for meetings, many of which do not have to be recorded, including those with lawmakers.“I spend quite a bit of time out there. Washington plays a pivotal role not only in the US, but throughout the world, so I try to make sure I’m part of the process as much as possible,” he told the Financial Times.One congressional aide recalled the time Mr Duffy killed an attempt to increase the tax rate on derivatives put forward by Carl Levin, the Democratic senator.The clearing house boss called the proposal “stupid”, the aide said, and ensured that not a single member of Congress co-sponsored the bill. Mr Duffy, who is renowned for his mastery of expletives, said he remembered only a “spirited, not a heated conversation”.Ties with Washington extend beyond Mr Duffy. Jill Sommers, a CFTC commissioner until she stepped down in July, was a former lobbyist for CME.The Chicago-based group ultimately won the support of the CFTC on cross-border rules that threatened to make it more expensive for companies to trade on CME’s exchange.But CME has also faced heightened scrutiny from the CFTC under Gary Gensler, the agency’s chairman. The CFTC filed its first enforcement action against a CME unit for allegedly not supervising a broker who gave proprietary information about clients to a rival broker. CME is fighting the allegations.“They’re probably the smartest folks at this business for the longest period,” said one senior regulatory official. “But they’re cocky about it and they do mess up.”
289;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;CME delays European exchange launch by three weeks;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures operator, will delay the launch of trading on its European bourse by three weeks, to September 30, it said in a memo to members on Friday.“We are currently working very closely with regulators in order to achieve both recognition and a successful CME Europe launch,” the company said in the memo, which was provided by a spokeswoman who said she could not comment further.CME Europe, the Chicago-based group’s first full overseas exchange, is seen as an opportunity for the company to challenge Eurex, part of Deutsche Börse, for clients in Europe and Asia. It will also allow CME to better take on IntercontinentalExchange, whose $10bn acquisition of NYSE Euronext is set to close later this year, consolidating the two companies’ large European operations.CME began clearing interest rate swaps in London in March as exchanges seek to capitalise on major incoming reforms to the global derivatives market.G20 countries have required that more of the $650tn over-the-counter derivatives market move to exchanges or other trading venues and be centrally cleared to ensure that deals are completed in case of a default.After interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts such as forwards and swaps are the second-largest asset class traded outside exchanges. Roughly $5tn of currency is traded daily, most of it outside exchanges, which means it would be affected by the new rules.CME Europe will launch with 30 contracts, including many futures tied to currencies, bolstering the CME’s dominance of the US forex futures market. It is planning to expand to other asset classes in the coming 18 months, including interest rates, commodities, metals and equities derivatives.The group saw record trading in foreign exchange in the second quarter.The news comes two weeks after Eurex agreed to a tie-up with the Moscow Exchange as part of its push into trading foreign currency derivatives beginning on October 7.
290;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-08-21T16:29:21Z;Eurex to challenge CME in currency arena;Derivatives bourse agrees tie-up with Moscow Exchange;Eurex, the German derivatives bourse, has agreed a tie-up with the Moscow Exchange as it makes a concerted push into trading foreign currency derivatives and takes on CME Group, the dominant operator in the market.The group, part of Deutsche Börse, said on Wednesday it would begin trading futures and options on eight currency pairs in the fourth quarter. They include listed contracts in dollar-euro and futures in the dollar-rouble, the third most popular foreign exchange futures contract globally.The move by Eurex comes as it looks to boost trading volumes after a weak year to date. Like rival CME, it is seeking a slice of business from sweeping incoming reforms to the global derivatives market.Countries from the G20 have mandated that more of the $650tn over-the-counter derivatives market be moved on to electronic trading venues and processed through clearing houses. A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, ensuring the deal is completed in the event of a default.Foreign exchange contracts such as forwards and swaps are the second largest asset class traded off-exchange, behind interest rate swaps. About $5tn of currency is traded daily, the bulk of it off-exchange and set to come under the new legislation.“With our listed contracts we are offering an alternative in which we bring the advantages of exchange trading, including clearing, to a market that has so far been organised predominantly bilaterally,” said Peter Reitz, member of the Eurex executive board.CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, is due to commence trading in early September on its new London-based futures exchange with 30 currency futures. Increased market volatility contributed to record trading in foreign exchange in the second quarter at the US group.For Moscow Exchange, the tie-up deepens an agreement between the two bourses agreed earlier this year as it looks to broaden Moscow’s appeal to international investors and make the Russian capital a global financial markets hub.With our listed contracts we are offering an alternative in which we bring the advantages of exchange trading, including clearing, to a market that has so far been organised predominantly bilaterallyThe Moscow exchange traded an average 2m contracts in rouble-dollar and rouble-euro futures, with a notional value of $2.1bn in the second quarter.Eurex said it would begin trading in pairs covering the euro, US dollar, sterling and Swiss franc. Trading would commence on October 7, it added, and be settled via CLS, the world’s largest foreign exchange settlement service.Trading of euro-rouble and dollar-rouble currency pairs will begin in the fourth quarter and be settled in Eurex’s clearing house, using settlement prices provided by Moscow Exchange.www.ft.com/tradingroom
291;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-08-19T11:13:33Z;CME and ICE mull joining new European repositories body;;CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange, the US derivatives groups, are among the market participants considering taking part in a new trade body being set up to resolve issues around repositories, the new derivatives data warehouses mandated by global regulation.The effort to create the Trade Repository Association is being led by the Trade Repository Group, a UK start-up that is preparing to register with European authorities as a derivatives data warehouse in coming weeks.The London-based group is also putting the final touches to its application with the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) to operate a trade repository, which are intended to give regulators an overview of the market, allowing them to spot potential risks to the financial system.Rory St John Webster, director of Trade Repository Group, said there had also been interest from fund managers and a large investment bank ahead of the first meeting of the association, which is due to take place on September 19. It will be “a European initiative but the intention is global,” said Mr Webster.Trade Repository Group was formed by CapitalTrack, an investment vehicle largely backed by Mr Webster and Fincore, a UK company that operates the European Central Bank database and the eurozone network of central banks running data to the ECB.It is touting its independence and online service as a critical factor for both its operations and administering the trade body. Unlike the six other groups that have agreed to build a trade repository in Europe, it does not have clearing operations.Its emergence comes as European regulators become concerned their view of trading on the derivatives markets may be hampered by the complexity of the rules.Policy makers have mandated that both sides of the trade – buyer and seller – be reported. However, the seller may report to one repository and the buyer to another. “One leg of the trade could be reported in Europe – the other leg reported to a repository that might be in Russia or Singapore. Somewhere the industry has to reconcile the two,” said Mr Webster.The first meeting of the association is due to take place only a few days before Esma is expected to name its first accredited trade repositories.US trio CME Group, ICE, Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the London Stock Exchange, the Central Securities Depository of Poland and Regist-TR, a venture between Deutsche Börse’s Clearstream and Spain’s Iberclear, have also made applications to operate the warehouses.Mr Webster said Trade Repository, which will be capitalised at around £1.8m, also planned to file applications with regulators in the US, Hong Kong and Singapore. “We shall be applying for authorisation with every regulator ‘governing this space’ around the world,” said Mr Webster.
292;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:34:32+0000;CME under fire over cash for trades in Brent;;The biggest US futures exchange’s campaign to break into North Sea oil has been marked by unusual trading patterns as computerised firms engineer ways to exploit a cash-for-volume scheme, according to market participants.CME Group has promised a pot of as much as $1m a month to the biggest traders in its upstart Nymex Brent crude futures contract, a June filing shows, as it attempts to wrest market share from ICE Futures Europe, the exchange that launched Brent in 1988.CME and IntercontinentalExchange, owner of ICE Futures Europe, are aggressively competing for market share across energy contracts that are vital to profitability at both companies.The CME’s Brent contract has been growing rapidly, but data show volume is concentrated in momentary bursts of trading in contracts for delivery several months in the future. Oil futures trading tends to focus on the first two or three months of delivery. Traders trace the activity to algorithms designed to generate incentive fees.“There’s no economic benefit to the trades whatsoever, except for the people that at the end of the month get a cheque from the CME,” said one participant in the incentive programme.The unusual patterns come as global regulators are closely examining the role of high-speed electronic trading in markets. In a June speech, Bart Chilton, commissioner at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, suggested high-speed traders pursuing exchange incentive programmes, such as the CME’s, are creating “fantasy liquidity”. He called on exchanges to stamp the practice out.CME has touted “excellent commercial participation” in its Brent contract, issuing a press release to mark record daily volume on August 12. On that day more than a third of volume came within 15 minutes just after 11am London time in the form of bets on the price “spread” between contracts for delivery in January and February 2014. January and February contracts accounted for 49 per cent of total volume.Similar heavy trading in far-ahead spreads has happened on several other days in recent weeks, data show. A person active in the CME Brent crude market said computer traders are focusing on spreads because they are lower risk. “They make no loss because they buy and sell at the same price,” this person said.CME said: “We have rules in place to prohibit any inappropriate trades. Our market regulation division employs modern surveillance procedures to continually review trading activity in our markets and ensure integrity.”It is not unusual for exchanges to reduce fees or other incentives to traders or market makers. ICE currently has incentive schemes to encourage trading in WTI crude, which is principally traded on Nymex.But ICE said its incentives differed from the cash scheme for Nymex Brent: “We do not offer any programs where a cash pool is offered to customers in exchange for trading volume.”
293;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-08-01T12:08:19Z;Interest rate concerns lift profits at CME Group;;Uncertainty over the path of US interest rates powered an increase in profits at CME Group as investors flocked to benchmark Treasury and other financial futures.The Chicago-based futures exchange operator reported net profit of $311.2m, or $0.93 per share in the quarter ended June 30, up 27 per cent from $244.9m, or $0.74 per share, in the same period a year earlier.The return of volatility to interest rates has been a windfall to CME after years in which the Federal Reserve’s monetary easing policies slowly ground 10-year Treasury bond rates lower.In May the trend broke as Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, signalled the central bank would eventually pull back on aggressive bond-buying in response to an improving US economy.Phupinder Gill, chief executive, said: “During the quarter, our interest rates complex performed extremely well”. Average daily volume in interest rates rose by a third in the quarter from the prior year, while the fee per interest rate contract declined 6 per cent to $0.455.Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, added that “clients turned to our products to manage heightened volatility in several markets”. CME broke quarterly volume records in foreign exchange and metals, which include gold and silver futures on New York’s Comex exchange.As rates jumped, so has CME’s share price. The stock closed at $74.06 before Thursday’s earnings announcement, up 21 per cent from late April.
294;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-07-24T02:07:07Z;CME Group looks to uncoil its spring;;For as long as interest rates have been at historic lows CME Group, operator of one of the world’s biggest futures exchanges, has been “like a coiled spring”, in the words of chief executive Phupinder Gill.With the bulk of its financial futures products tied to market expectations of movements in the interest rate cycle, CME has for years seen less than stellar activity in its flagship eurodollar contract while central bank rates have stayed low.With the bulk of its financial futures products tied to market expectations of movements in the interest rate cycle, CME has for years seen less than stellar activity in its flagship eurodollar contract while central bank rates have stayed low.That was one reason group-wide CME trading volumes fell 16 per cent last year.But demand for CME’s interest rate products, which contribute 20 per cent of CME’s revenues, is rising amid signals from Ben Bernanke, US Federal Reserve chairman, that a tightening in monetary policy is a little less distant on the horizon.The volume of interest rate products traded at CME in June was the highest average monthly level since January 2008, not long before the global economic crisis that triggered the era of low rates. CME averaged 8.6m interest rate contracts per day, up 70 per cent from the same month a year ago.Asked if this is sustainable, Mr Gill says: “Absolutely. When you get to the second quarter of next year you can expect it to be a ‘normal’ [interest] rate environment.”Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill in New York, believes “a portion” of current interest rate volatility is sustainable as markets continue to speculate on the precise timing of an end to quantitative easing.Investors appear to agree, sending shares in CME up more than 20 per cent since May, about a month before Mr Bernanke first signalled a change in the Fed’s stance.In addition the ramping-up of volumes at CME’s interest rate swaps clearing service, a response to the landmark Dodd-Frank financial reforms, means CME is “now involved in every part of the rate curve and every single instrument in that curve”, Mr Gill says.On a visit to CME’s Asia headquarters in his native Singapore, Mr Gill says demand for futures trading is growing at a healthy clip in the region, providing another source of growth.In the first quarter, CME posted record volumes and revenue from Asia , up 24 per cent and 31 per cent respectively year-on-year.In Japan, the electoral victory by prime minister Shinzo Abe’s LDP-led coalition government in the upper house of parliament sets the stage for policies to tackle two decades of deflation.“The Japanese elections are going to provide some kind of momentum at least for the yen side, if not for the [interest] rate side,” Mr Gill said. CME has since 1999 offered trading in yen-dollar futures, which is now one of its biggest FX futures contracts.More business recently has started to come to CME from South Korea, where investors are turning to foreign exchanges to escape a series of new regulations including an increase in the amount of collateral required for trades.But China could provide the most promising medium- to long-term boost, Mr Gill believes.Futures brokers, or “futures commission merchants”, in China have in the last 12-15 months begun using CME’s agricultural, metals and interest rate futures from their offices in Hong Kong – currently the only way for a mainland broker to access products on a foreign futures exchange.“You are seeing a lot of the FCMs asking for more educational work and sending flow through to us,” Mr Gill says, adding that the associated fees earned by CME are at the exchange’s full rate, rather than discounted rates often charged to attract market-makers or high-speed traders.This week Cash Financial Services Group and another broker, Nanhua Futures, became the first two mainland Chinese futures brokers to sign up to a telecoms hub CME set up nine months ago in Hong Kong to allow high-speed access to the exchange’s Globex trading system.Industry experts say it is unclear what appetite clients of Chinese brokers – such as state-owned commodity and industrial companies – will ultimately have to use futures. Regulations currently restrict what the state-owned enterprises can do when it comes to, for instance, hedging the foreign exchange exposures connected with commodities.Mr Gill says: “If I am a Chinese grain house I can only hedge grains now, I can’t hedge the FX exposure surrounding grains. But SOEs will be allowed to do more and the Chinese government is contemplating that change now. So the range of activities that these guys can do will grow”.
295;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-07-22T20:35:08Z;High-frequency trader fined in transatlantic clampdown;;US and UK authorities have used beefed-up powers to punish a small high-frequency trading firm for attempting to rig commodity markets, in a sign that authorities are looking to team up to crack down on market abuse.On Monday the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and CME Group, the exchanges operator, each fined Panther Energy Trading and one of its traders for manipulating futures markets on both sides of the Atlantic with computer algorithms in a three-month period.The crackdown represents the first time the CFTC has used powers granted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and that the newly-created FCA has fined a high-frequency trading company.Regulators in both countries have become increasingly concerned about potential market abuse from high-frequency trading, in which traders use superfast computers to trade across assets and continents in milliseconds.The regulators allege Panther used practices such as spoofing and layering. These techniques are used to deliberately make and then cancel large amounts of orders to create a false impression of liquidity.For example, the CFTC said in the West Texas Intermediate crude oil market, the group placed a small, 17-contract sell order of $85.29 per barrel that underpriced other offers in the market. Within a fraction of a second, Panther then flooded the market with buy orders that it intended to cancel, driving the market towards its selling price. “The program sought to capture an immediate profit from selling the 17 lots,” the regulator said.The CFTC said Panther spoofed 18 separate US futures markets, including oil, soyabeans and wheat, as well as interest rates and stock indices between August and October 2011.UK regulators said Panther also made thousands of false orders for crude oil and gas contracts on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.“High-frequency trading and the use of algorithms are an important and commonplace part of the markets nowadays, but in this case these techniques were deliberately designed to abuse the market, undermining its integrity,” said Tracey McDermott, the FCA’s director of enforcement and financial crime.Cross-border investigations that result in parallel enforcement actions are becoming increasingly common as US and UK regulators learn to work more closely together. In recent years, the CFTC, US Department of Justice and the FCA have co-operated on three Libor-rate rigging settlements, and the FCA and the Securities and Exchange Commission worked together on the Blue Index insider trading probe.The CFTC ordered Michael Coscia, the trader at the centre of the allegations, to pay a total of $2.8m in trading profits, while CME Group imposed fines totalling $2.1m. The CFTC also banned Panther and Mr Coscia from trading on any its registered entities for one year for offences in the US.The FCA imposed a fine of $903,000 (£597,000) and six-month trading ban on its exchanges.Mr Coscia declined to comment.“We saw very short-term systematic flickering in certain futures markets quotes in that period,” said Chris Concannon at Virtu Financial, a high-frequency trading firm. “We had to make adjustments to avoid being harmed by that activity.”The penalty comes as US authorities have ramped up their scrutiny of high-frequency trading practices.Additional reporting by Brooke Masterswww.ft.com/tradingroom
296;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-07-11T22:57:08Z;CME resubmits wash trade rule changes;;CME Group, the world’s largest exchange operator, has asked the Commodity Futures Trade Commission to approve its plan to update rules barring wash trades a month after withdrawing the proposal amid calls for further review from a member of the commission.The Chicago-based company had submitted new rules governing the trades to the CFTC for self-certification, under its authority as a self-regulating body. Exchanges are allowed to make rule changes without approval from the CFTC.But following discussions with the CFTC’s market oversight division and criticism from Commissioner Bart Chilton that the changes merited further review, the exchange withdrew them.CME has voluntarily resubmitted its changes under the commission’s formal approval process in order to “give market participants certainty that the guidance in the advisory is fully consistent with the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations,” said Laurie Bischel, spokesperson for the exchange.Wash trades involve a single firm engaging in a transaction with itself by buying and selling the same contract. The practice is prohibited in the US because regulators say it can create the illusion of market activity when there is none.CME’s proposal would mark a clearer distinction between intentional and unintentional wash trades, which can occur inadvertently in high-frequency trading given the volume and speed of trading.Earlier this month the company began offering traders the option of blocking matching buy and sell orders in order to prevent such self trading.Regulators have intensified their scrutiny of exchanges in recent years, especially the effect of high-frequency and algorithmic trading strategies and how they might distort markets. Mr Chilton, in particular, has called for greater oversight.The news came the day after the US arm of Newedge, the global broker co-owned by Société Générale and Crédit Agricole, agreed to pay $9.5m to settle allegations that it failed to adequately police high-speed traders on its systems, including those engaging in wash trades.Reuters first reported the CME’s request.
297;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-07-08T18:24:48Z;CME chief defends clearing houses’ growing role;;The head of the world’s largest exchanges operator, CME Group, has rejected calls from global banks that the growing reliance on clearing houses is posing a new challenge to the stability of the financial system.The risk management houses are becoming a critical part of the plumbing of the world’s financial markets after global regulators mandated that more of the vast but opaque over-the-counter derivatives market be processed through central counterparties.That is expected to lead to a higher-profile role for the US’s CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange, which own their own clearing houses, and LCH.Clearnet, the transatlantic group controlled by the London Stock Exchange Group. A clearing house sits between two parties in a trade, guaranteeing the deal in the event of a default.Terry Duffy, executive chairman of CME Group, said the shift in moving more OTC derivatives transactions was more profound than just transferring the risk and exposure to a counterparty default from banks to clearing houses. “The difference is with a clearing house we do market-to-market [risk management], either twice daily or have the ability to do it much more often,” he said on a visit to London.“What’s important is making certain the pays and collects are done on a risk basis and not a mark-to-myth or anything else. Because of that, we have a much easier time doing the pays and collects than the banks do if it was a bilateral transaction. In turn, I think some of the banks are just not used to the model of clearing.”Some banks have raised concerns about the relatively low capital reserves of clearing houses. Indeed, tougher European rules have forced the region’s two largest clearing houses – Deutsche Börse’s Eurex and LCH.Clearnet – to increase their capital reserves to about €250m and €744m.However, capital reserves form only one of a series of barriers employed by clearers if one of their members fails. Guarantee funds, which a clearing house would exhaust first, are typically far larger. CME has more than $4.5bn as a guarantee fund and LCH nearly €6bn. Industry executives also acknowledge that those reserves will be raised again when Iosco, the umbrella group of financial regulators, finalises global principles governing the operation of clearing houses next year.“I think what was critically important, under Dodd-Frank, we made certain we were not forced to accept all bilateral swaps into our clearing house, that if we felt we couldn’t risk manage them we wouldn’t accept them,” said Mr Duffy. “If we do take them, we make certain that we have adequate capital so we can do their risk management. So I think it’s a little bit of a misdirecter.”Some observers such as Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, have warned that clearing houses must also develop recovery and resolution plans should one default.
298;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-07-07T20:30:55Z;Banks warn of risk at clearing houses;;Fast-expanding clearing houses on both sides of the Atlantic are posing a growing risk to the stability of the financial system, some of the world’s top bankers have warned.Concerns have mounted as clearing houses have shot to the top of banks’ lists of counterparties, following the shift of over-the-counter trading to centralised clearing houses.Clearers – such as LCH.Clearnet and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex in Europe, and CME Group in the US – sit between two parties in a trade and guarantee the deal if one of those parties defaults.They have traditionally been seen as a staid part of market plumbing. But in the aftermath of the financial crisis, they have moved to the forefront of a global regulatory push to reform derivatives markets and reduce the risks posed by big banks.But, as trading volumes through the clearing houses ramp up, banks increasingly fear this new counterparty risk. Top bankers, who have been lobbying regulators over the issue for some time, have also sought meetings with clearing house bosses in recent weeks to discuss their concerns.“We are losing track of the nominal risk,” warned Jean-Pierre Mustier, head of investment banking at UniCredit and a former board member at London-based LCH.Clearnet. “We’re moving from a set-up where banks were interconnected, because they had transactions between them, to a system where very lowly capitalised entities, the clearing houses, are supposed to protect the banks from a problem.”The finance director of a leading global bank said: “The lobbying effort to fix this has begun. Investors want clarity. If we move risk somewhere else, we obviously need to make sure there is enough capital to support it. Current capital levels [at clearing houses] may be insufficient.”Banks have voiced concerns to regulators in Europe and the US that central clearing houses are providing insufficient data on their own risks and demanding lower-quality collateral for swaps transactions. They argue the risks are too opaque, and getting riskier.“It’s going in the wrong direction,” said the head of credit trading at a large US bank. “The race to the bottom is on.” He and other executives were critical of the CME’s decision to accept corporate bonds as collateral, a step down from the safer instruments usually required for margin.Clearing houses counter that they have boosted capital already and that their tough collateral and margin requirements provide crucial safety buffers.Some institutional investors and clearing officials are suspicious of the motives of the banks, arguing that they are keen to check the move of bilateral, “over-the-counter”, derivatives trading, traditionally a large profit centre for the biggest dealer banks, to electronic platforms.But bankers argue that they are in danger of failing in their own risk management if they are not given timely and full access to risks that clearing houses are facing.A collection of banks, including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase, which forms the “payments risk committee”, produced a report in February “to improve the transparency of risk management practices of central counterparties”.The PRC, which is sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, produced a list of data it wanted from the clearing houses, including details of total collateral posted to allow banks to verify each clearing house was collecting sufficient funds.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:A capital buffer can strengthen the clearing system / From Prof Eric De Keuleneer
299;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-07-01T16:53:47Z;Europe steps up regulatory assault on CDS;Brussels alleges collusion potentially made system more vulnerable to shocks;"Investment banks’ lucrative role as the middlemen of derivatives markets have long been under regulatory attack. But Brussels is not only rewriting rules for future trading and clearing; it could now punish banks for their past dominance.On Monday the European Commission accused 13 of the world’s top investment banks of illegally sustaining their grip over the credit default swap market by muscling out rival exchanges which threatened their indispensable and highly profitable position as dealers.The almost 400-page charge sheet is the latest front in a transatlantic regulatory assault against “over-the-counter” derivatives markets such as CDS, where banks build customised insurance-like products for clients, doing deals privately away from exchanges and generating big revenue streams.The allegations from 2006-2009 are not yet proven. But Brussels alleges that collusion did more than simply inflate costs or reduce choice for investors in CDS. It also potentially left the world’s financial system more vulnerable to shocks and amplified the fallout from the collapse of Lehman Brothers.“Exchange-trading of credit derivatives improves transparency and market stability,” says Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief. “But the banks acted collectively to prevent this from happening. They delayed the emergence of exchange trading of these financial products because they feared that it would reduce their revenues.”All 15 groups receiving the “statement of objections” on Monday have a right of defence before Mr Almunia takes a decision and potentially imposes hefty penalties. Their case will rest on picking apart the evidence of illegal co-operation, while showing there were many other reasons preventing the rise of credit trading on exchanges. At stake are hundreds of millions of euros in potential fines.Underlying the commission’s case is an assumption that without interference CDS trading would naturally progress – as contracts became more standard and volumes increased – from the opaque, bespoke world of dealers to cheaper, more open exchanges, where trades are cleared.This trend would also benefit market stability as counterparty risk is more strictly managed through clearing houses, the commission argues. A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, ensuring a deal is completed in the event of a default.Regulators have moved to force this transition on to exchanges through law on both sides of the Atlantic. But for now CDS remain the purview of banks. The first credit futures traded on exchange were launched just a fortnight ago – via IntercontinentalExchange – while clearing of OTC trades remains the exception. Around $2.5tn of transactions had been cleared by December 2012, compared to the notional outstanding for the CDS market of $25tn.The Commission’s two-year probe homed in on two ways that investment banks are alleged to have joined forces to safeguard this profitable business.The first is what Mr Almunia describes as “control” of Markit, the main information provider for the CDS market, and Isda, the trade body that issues licences that would be essential for trading credit on exchanges to emerge.Both bodies – on the advice of banks sitting on their internal committees – included explicit restrictions in licences that made it impossible for Deutsche Börse and CME Group to enter the credit trading business, according to the commission’s preliminary conclusions.Investigators found that all 13 banks at some point were involved in or aware of these crucial recommendations. Some of those restrictions remained in place until recently, but the commission case has been narrowed to a three-year period up to 2009, where its evidence is strongest.The antitrust division of the US Department of Justice has been probing the CDS market since the crisis, focusing on the role of Markit and its ownership by big investment banks including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse.*According to Brussels, a smaller group of investment banks also allegedly sought to preserve their role through a second means: co-ordinating their choice of clearing house.As banks began to clear some off-exchange CDS trades from 2009, US derivatives exchange ICE quickly built up a dominant position. This was in spite of an earlier concerted effort to break into credit trading by CME, the world’s largest futures market operator.Rather than just offer CDS clearing like ICE, CME launched hybrid credit futures trading in 2006, which in theory challenged the banks’ OTC business. The Chicago group’s efforts failed to make headway, in part because the banks favoured the approach taken by its rival.*This article has been amended to remove a sentence stating that Tradeweb and the Clearing Corp were part of the DoJ’s investigation."
300;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Fertile futures;The complexity of bringing crops to market has increased for farmers;"It is 9am on a Wednesday and a group of farmers is beginning two days of training in global commodity markets and futures trading at the Cambridge office of Offre & Demande Agricole (ODA), a fast-growing European consultancy.The same scenario is being played out around the world. With shifts in commodity markets in one hemisphere almost instantly mirrored at remote grain elevators and farm gates in the other, the complexity of bringing crops to market has increased dramatically for farmers. In the past decade, success has become as much about selling a crop at the right moment as producing it.“We sometimes make three trades [spot, futures or options] in a day,” says Cherilyn Nagel, who farms on the Canadian prairies.Trading in commodity futures – the forerunner of today’s mainly financial futures markets – goes back centuries. While dealers now predominate, farmers and food processors have become more active in the past 10-12 years, says Dave Lehman, managing director of commodity research and product development at CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange operator.The reasons are many. In Canada and Australia – both top four global grain exporters – farmers are no longer obliged to sell through pools controlled by national wheat boards. In the EU, production-based subsidies that underpinned sale prices have been replaced by land-based payments. Everywhere, there are better information flows and electronic trading, and now smartphones mean farmers can even access markets from their combine harvesters.The single biggest driver, however, has been the marked increase in price volatility. “Before 2005, price shifts were usually small and farmers weren’t interested in using the markets,” says Benjamin Bodart, who heads ODA’s UK operations. “Now, wheat prices can move by 100 per cent over a campaign.”For Peter Kuhlmann, managing price has come on top of managing extreme weather and yields that can vary threefold from year to year. Working in South Australia, one of the driest parts of the world’s driest inhabited continent, he has won national recognition for his farming skills. But in 2007-08, the first year of free trading after the Australian Wheat Board’s monopoly was lifted, he lost some A$500,000 ($476,000) on a wheat swap. Not only did grain prices soar above the price he had fixed but drought wiped out much of his crop.“Grain marketing has become another skill set,” he says. “I am reluctant to put my foot in the market again. It burnt me.”But some welcome the chance to manage their cash flow more actively, with many farmers adding more storage in recent years in order to do so.Last year it was western Canada’s turn to lose its grain monopoly. Nagel became one of the first local farmers in 70 years to sign a forward contract with her local grain elevator.If she was quick off the mark she was also astute, locking in a good price. “I had the biggest smile when I could take the grain to the elevator and come back with a cheque,” says the 33-year-old, whose family has farmed locally for more than a century. “Before, it was months until we got our money [from the Canadian Wheat Board].”Among the traded tools, options are the most widely used by farmers, says CME’s Lehman. Paid for up front, these give rights to forward sale contracts at a fixed price without a commitment to a sale. Reflecting increased demand, the Chicago exchange last year introduced shorter expiry date new-crop options for maize, soybeans and wheat.“For me, options are key. They give you a floor price but enable you to keep the upside if prices rise,” says Stephen Vandervalk, a wheat and canola farmer from Alberta, Canada, who sometimes also buys currency spreads.The president of Grain Growers of Canada, a lobby group, Vandervalk estimates only about 10 per cent of his peers buy options, although the number is rising, he says.Following the markets is time-consuming and even addictive, however. Vandervalk sometimes finds himself checking prices every couple of hours. Since the end of the wheat monopoly he has had, like other western Canadian farmers (and their Australian counterparts before them), to field calls from local grain elevators looking for quick spot deals, while newsletters offering trading advice pile up in his inbox.In Europe, options tend to be more expensive than in North America and direct participation in the traded markets by farmers is lower; in the UK the number is less than 2 per cent, says Bodart.A typical European arable producer might forward sell up to half of a crop through non-traded contracts with grain merchants or food processors, keep a further quarter for January and sell the rest, also on a spot basis, in the run-up to the next harvest, says Joe Nagel, a farming consultant based in Germany. “Selling in January is a bit of a gamble on the southern hemisphere,” he says. “Prices might rise if there are bad harvests in Argentina and Australia.”Back in Cambridge, Bodart’s message to his farmer students is that the price volatility of recent years is here to stay. On top of climate change, more fragile supply and growing demand, commodity markets are far less driven by fundamentals than they were just five or six years ago.“Many farmers think the markets are just for speculators and hedging is complicated, when in fact it is really simple,” he says. “Increasingly, farmers will have to know how and when to fix their margins.”"
301;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-06-26T20:37:45Z;CME among the winners of stock market turbulence;Health insurers and regional lenders also emerge as havens;"Volatile interest rates may have been an unpleasant shock for US stock investors but the sharp swings have not been bad news for all.Shareholders of CME Group have emerged as one of the few winners of the recent market turbulence.It has been one of a select number of companies enjoying haven status, with the global derivatives exchange jumping almost 19 per cent since May 21, even as a sell-off has sent the S&P 500 index down nearly 4 per cent from an all-time high. The company has seen record high trading in Treasury and other futures products as traders look to hedge or close out bets made during an environment when interest rates were trading at historic lows.“We continue to believe a portion of the current interest rate volatility is sustainable as the market continues to evaluate the Federal Reserve’s [stimulus] programmes and speculates on its termination,” said Rich Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill.He raised his earnings estimates for the CME’s second quarter twice during June.Other trading venues have also seen their business pick up and shares rally, including the option exchange operator CBOE.The US exchanges have been joined by a handful of other sub-sectors, ranging from health insurers to regional lenders, that have managed to record gains even as investors broadly retreated from stocks. Health insurers have gained as they are regarded as insulated from rising interest rates. Cigna and Humana, two of the biggest US health groups, have risen 5.6 per cent and 5.8 per cent, respectively, since May 21.Analysts said the gains were driven by investor expectations that changes to US healthcare laws, popularly known as “Obamacare”, would likely bring new customers to the market and boost insurer profit.“You’ve got a nice secular story behind healthcare reform that doesn’t really change with anything that’s going on in the fixed-
income markets,” said Steven Rees, head of US equity strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank.“Healthcare is supported by ageing demographics and the fact that this country is undergoing major reforms, which brings some uncertainty but, overall I think, provides a tailwind.”Regional lenders have also outperformed, despite the recent struggles for their larger counterparts.People’s United Financial and Zions Bancorp have climbed 4 per cent and 5.4 per cent, respectively, at the same time as the S&P 500 financials sector has fallen 3.4 per cent. The regional banks offer investors exposure to improvements to the US economy as well as rising interest rates while avoiding problems that plague large banks that rely on a wide range of businesses to expand profits.“The expectations are that as the economy begins to heal, these [regional] banks are the beneficiaries of a much more solid underpinning, coupled with attractive valuations and a steepening yield curve,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial."
302;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-06-21T20:33:29Z;US options volumes at record highs;;Options contract trading volumes hit record highs on Thursday as traders rushed to hedge equities after the Federal Reserve signalled the tapering of its asset purchasing programme, sending shares sharply lower.Trading in the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s S&P 500 Index options contracts reached an all-time high of nearly 2.3m contracts. The exchange’s popular Vix index, which measures implied volatility on the S&P 500 – often referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” – crossed 20 for the first time this year.The CME Group also experienced record high trading in Treasury options, 10-year US Treasury note options and e-mini S&P 500 options.Exchanges have pinned their hopes on a rebound in trading activity after 2012’s weak volumes crippled the industry.At the futures industry’s annual conference earlier this year, Jeff Sprecher, head of IntercontinentalExchange, highlighted the advantages exchanges might reap as markets, anticipating the end of the zero-interest rate environment, react to even minor positive comments from central banks.“You’ve got to believe that in a zero interest rate environment that money is flowing into places where it wouldn’t otherwise flow if there were normal interest rates,” he said. “I think as interest rates rise, we’re going to discover where all that money went …and people will have to hedge or get out of those transactions.“I suspect it will be pretty good for listed exchanges.”So far, it has been, with shares of bourses far outpacing the S&P 500’s nearly 12 per cent year-to-date gains.Shares of CME are up more than 50 per cent so far this year, with about 18 per cent of that increase coming since Fed chairman Ben Bernanke first suggested on May 22 that the central bank might begin to taper its asset purchases.That rise has also been driven by record futures volumes and new regulations under Dodd-Frank that will see more swaps traded on exchanges and cleared in clearing houses like the one that CME owns.Shares in rival IntercontinentalExchange are up around 38 per cent so far this year, while CBOE shares are up more than 44 per cent. All three have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last week.
303;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-06-17T15:58:00Z;EU set to clear ICE’s $10bn NYSE takeover;;European regulators have approved IntercontinentalExchange’s $10bn cash and shares deal to take over NYSE Euronext, a move that will allow the creation of one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges.Two people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times that a probe into the deal concluded that the two global exchanges were complementary to each other and did not breach competition rules.The regulator’s green light for the deal, which is likely to be completed in the second half of this year, clears the final significant obstacle for ICE to complete the takeover of its 208-year-old rival.The tie-up will create a powerhouse for trading commodities and interest rate futures as well as US equities. The combined exchanges will rival the scale of the CME Group, the Chicago-based derivatives bourse.“The Commission’s investigation has been looking into two asset classes, where there could have been a breach of antitrust rules and on both accounts it was clear that there was no overlap,” said a person informed of the antitrust watchdog’s probe.The two areas looked at closely by the regulator were the exchanges’ markets for soft commodities derivatives – including cocoa, coffee and sugar – and their US equities index derivatives.The probe concluded that in the soft commodities derivatives sector the exchanges offered different types of products, and in the equities derivatives business the two were not competing against each other as the NYSE focuses on the options market while ICE specialises on the futures markets.For NYSE, the approval comes more than a year after European regulators blocked a takeover attempt by German exchange group Deutsche Börse, which faltered amid antitrust concerns that both companies’ businesses overlapped and could potentially create a monopoly.However, the deal with Atlanta-based ICE was never seen to trigger the same fears among regulators as their businesses differed. ICE and NYSE declined to comment.“The Deutsche Börse-NYSE deal was very different from the ICE-NYSE,” said another person familiar with the matter. “If Deutsche Börse-NYSE went through they would have had a monopoly of the European derivatives market. That’s not the case with ICE-NYSE.”The news of the approval was first reported by Reuters.Antoine Colombani, Commission spokesman for competition policy, declined to comment on the investigation. He said the regulator’s decision would be announced on June 24.ICE’s cash-and-stock takeover valued NYSE shares at about $33.12 in December. They have since risen by a quarter, valuing the deal at $10bn without debt, according to analysts.
304;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-06-11T17:28:45Z;CME wins bigger Brent market share;;CME Group is using free trading and rebates to encroach on rival turf in the oil patch, winning 5 per cent of Brent crude futures volumes for the first time.The market share advance by the biggest US futures exchange comes at the expense of IntercontinentalExchange, where Brent generated $213.5m in revenue last year.Chicago-based CME has also softened its ambivalence towards Brent as its product attracts significant volume. The company’s New York Mercantile Exchange historically presented West Texas Intermediate futures as the world’s pre-eminent oil price yardstick since its launch in 1983.“There is more than one global benchmark,” Phupinder Gill, CME chief executive, said last week. “There is a suite of benchmarks that serve the world.”North Sea Brent has won favour as resurgent crude output in the US and Canada grew faster than the region’s pipeline capacity. This led crude stocks to swell at the WTI delivery point in Oklahoma.Prices of the two crude varieties diverged by as much as $28 a barrel, but WTI’s discount has closed as new pipeline and railway capacity brings inland crude to coastal refineries. On Tuesday ICE July Brent was $102.47 a barrel down $1.48, while Nymex July WTI was off 77 cents at $95 a barrel.In May, 685,058 Brent futures traded on CME, or 4.7 per cent of total volume. In June to date, CME market share jumped to 5.2 per cent. Last Friday CME Brent volume exceeded 50,000 contracts for the first time, a milestone the company announced in a press release.The price of CME Brent futures is based on the ICE Brent futures market price. Mr Gill’s predecessor in 2011 called such “lookalike” contracts “a parasitic, second-order derivative.”CME has offered free Brent trading for commercial customers such as oil companies and fee rebates for market-makers who stand ready to honour bids and offers. CME’s average rate per contract decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared with a year ago partly “due to an increase in incentives and discounts on our energy contracts”, the company disclosed in a securities filing.Mr Gill said at a New York conference last week that the programmes had drawn 19 commercial traders into the market, from one or two. “That is the traction that we wanted to see,” he said.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said at the same conference that he was “absolutely unconcerned” about the shifts in market share and that the competition was “healthy”. He added: “We are not a low-fee provider of services.”
305;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-06-11T12:38:58Z;CME set for September launch of European derivatives;;CME Group has set a tentative date of September for the launch of its European derivatives exchange as the US group looks to harness growing investor demand to hedge risk.A circular sent out by the US group late on Friday to about 40 clearing customers and interested parties said it anticipated launching the new venue on September 9, pending regulatory approval.The group added that it would be operationally ready at the end of June, allowing potential customers a two-month window for testing.The group had initially hoped to launch the exchange in the first half of the year but had to await authorisation amid an overhaul of the UK regulatory structure. The FCA emerged out of the now-defunct FSA, while responsibility for clearing houses such as CME Clearing Europe moved to the Bank of England.Many banks, brokers and fund managers are currently preparing for the transfer of open positions held at NYSE Liffe from LCH.Clearnet to IntercontinentalExchange’s European clearing house.Bob Ray, chief executive of CME Europe, said it had not been given any clear indication for the exchange’s approval by the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator.“We did run it by them ahead of sending it out and they had no big objections,” said Mr Ray. “We needed to give the Street some guidance and it gives them a break.”The exchange will debut by trading foreign exchange derivatives but is planning to expand the offering to other asset classes in the next 18 months, including interest rates, commodities, metals and equities derivatives. The group began clearing interest rate swaps in March.
306;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-06-10T13:39:26Z;CME primed for new derivatives rules;;CME Group, the world largest futures exchange operator, is leading a group of US exchanges hoping to take full advantage of the next phase of new US rules tightening up derivatives trading, which came into force on Monday.About 500 large institutional investors will be required to clear more of their over-the-counter derivatives trades under a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act passed three years ago. The rules are part of a global regulatory push to safeguard markets against systemic risk. Some institutions will be required to clear off-exchange trades, such as interest rate and credit default swaps, forcing them to put up more margin and collateral to back their trades.Exchanges such as CME, its main domestic rival IntercontinentalExchange and Chicago-based start-up Eris Exchange are seeking to capitalise on the new rules, as investors switch from tailored but expensive swaps to cheaper but standardised listed futures to offset their risk. They have also developed new products such as “swap futures” – hybrid products that promise the economic benefits of swaps but trade on an exchange at a lower cost than their OTC equivalents.Analysts said the CME was likely to be one of the biggest gainers as it owns one of the clearing houses in which US OTC swaps are likely to be cleared. Last week, analysts at UBS, Credit Suisse, Wells Fargo and Raymond James upgraded their views of the CME’s stock, which has lagged behind the overall market in the past few years. Each cited optimism around the potential for greater revenues from OTC clearing and trading in swap futures.Raymond James noted that it took more than two years for CME to clear its first $1tn of interest rate swaps, 82 days for the next trillion and 42 days for its third. Investors have taken note of the approaching mandate. The CME’s deliverable swap future has seen surging volumes recently, hitting consecutive single-day, all-time highs last week. The company’s OTC clearing activity has also jumped as banks and customers start centrally clearing some swaps.Shares are up nearly $21 so far this year, to $72, with more than half of the gains coming in the past seven weeks. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in a May note to investors, said that even if swap futures do not pick up as anticipated the company’s core eurodollar and treasury futures “could benefit from some customers looking for alternatives to swaps”.Market insight: Instant market news and commentaryHowever, some have raised doubts about whether the infrastructure will be ready on time on Monday. Last month Tabb Group, a financial markets consultancy, warned that 75 per cent of the market was not ready for the mandate, and that this could lead to a liquidity drain of about $55tn in notional value from the market.Ray Kahn, head of OTC derivatives clearing at Barclays, told a conference last week in New York that investors were leaving it late to set up their systems for the second phase of swap clearing.“It’s like a term paper – everyone is waiting,” he said. The second phase of clearing, he added, was a much bigger operational event than the first round in March, with between five and 10 times more clients now required to clear their swap trades.CME faces competition in its dominance of the market. Domestic competition in swap futures products comes primarily from Eris, the start-up derivatives operator backed by some of the futures industry’s biggest traders. Eris has seen a similar surge in volumes leading up to Monday’s deadline. The exchange reported a record 12,700 contracts traded on May 10, and 40 per cent of 2013’s total trading volume came in May. However, its trades will clear at CME’s clearing house. In energy trading and clearing, CME faces competition from ICE.It will also face a challenge from a nascent LCH.Clearnet, the transatlantic clearing house which launched a US-domiciled version of its interest-rate swap clearing service last week. The London Stock Exchange Group-controlled company is the world’s largest clearer of interest rate swaps. But it has little US-domiciled business, and some observers warn that the differing methods by which CME and LCH calculate their margin requirements may favour the US company.Given the CME’s dominance in trading interest rate products – specifically its eurodollar and treasury futures contracts – it is likely to prevail, said John Brady, managing director of global institutional sales at RJ O’Brien.“The CME has walked a delicate line in terms of relationships between New York banks and customers,” Mr Brady said. “But since Dodd-Frank, when Congress and the American people mandated clearing, they’ve been setting up for it and they’re in a great position to capitalise.”www.ft.com/tradingroom
307;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-06-06T16:29:11Z;London Metal Exchange chief resigns;;Martin Abbott has resigned as chief executive of the London Metal Exchange just six months after spearheading the £1.4bn sale of the 135-year-old bourse to a Chinese rival.Mr Abbott, a former journalist and broker who personally made about $10m from the deal, will leave the exchange at the end of the year.The sale of the LME, the centre for global metals trading, to Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing was completed in December after a hotly contested bidding war among most of the world’s largest exchanges companies including CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and NYSE.The 53-year-old Mr Abbott said he felt he had secured the future of the LME, a bastion of tradition that is home to the last open outcry trading floor in Europe, for a new era of heightened regulatory scrutiny and high-frequency trading.“The business is in a better place. It’s time for me to go and find another business where I can do some kind of turnround job,” he said.HKEx has begun to stamp its mark on the LME, which it hopes will make it a gateway for Chinese companies wishing to trade commodities.Charles Li, chief executive, last week detailed his plans to allow more Asian companies to become members of the LME, to clear contracts in renminbi and to expand the exchange’s network of warehouses in Asia. He said he was also looking to form “strategic partnerships” with exchanges in mainland China.Mr Abbott denied that he had clashed with Mr Li, saying they had experienced “no disagreements other than typical business discussions”.“But I’m used to being pretty much in charge of everything, and quite reasonably that’s not the case any more,” he added.Mr Li praised Mr Abbott’s record at the LME, where trading volumes have risen to successive records in recent months. In the first five months of the year, volumes are up 13 per cent from 2012.“It’s not unusual for leaders of Martin’s calibre who are involved in major transactions and big transitions to pause for reflection when it’s all over and to decide it’s time to take a break,” Mr Li said.The LME this week announced that it would clear its own contracts from September next year– one of Mr Abbott’s signature projects.HKEx said Mr Abbott’s successor would be announced in due course.
308;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-06-06T15:26:00Z;Andrew Lamb to retire as head of CME Clearing Europe;;Andrew Lamb is to retire as chief executive of CME Group’s European clearing house, bringing to an end a 35-year career in London’s market structure industry.Mr Lamb, who joined CME Clearing Europe in 2009, was previously chief executive of LCH.Clearnet and had served for 15 years at the Bank of England, with four years as senior adviser, derivatives and commodity markets.He was also head of risk and deputy chief executive at London Clearing House for a decade until 2003. He will retire on July 31, according to a memo circulated at CME last week.Mr Lamb oversaw the establishment of CME’s European business and the opening of its London office in May 2011. The world’s largest futures operator began clearing off-exchange interest rate swaps earlier this year to challenge the market incumbent LCH.Clearnet for a share of the $500tn business. CME has also applied to become a futures exchange in the UK capital, a move that will put it into competition with Deutsche Börse’s Eurex and NYSE Liffe.He will be replaced by Lee Betsill, currently chief operating officer and managing director of CME Clearing Europe. Tina Hasenpusch will assume the role of chief operating officer, while continuing as head of business development. The appointments of Mr Betsill and Ms Hasenpusch will be subject to regulatory approval.The memo also noted CME Clearing Europe has hired Marc Vial from JPMorgan to fill a new role as chief risk officer. Mr Vial, who was previously executive director, head of global risk strategy and market analytics group at the US bank, began working in early June.

310;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-06-04T16:24:34Z;Swap futures market ramps up ahead of clearing mandate;Start-up operator seeks to capitalise on regulation of over the counter derivatives;Eris Exchange, a start-up US derivatives operator backed by some of the futures industry’s biggest traders, is to offer trading via one of the world’s largest trading software companies ahead of new clearing mandate for investors that kicks in next week.The exchange will connect its hybrid interest rate swap futures products to Trading Technologies’ popular X_Trader software platform, the companies announced on Tuesday.Eris specialises in “swap futures” – an emerging product in the derivatives industry. They promise the economic benefits of a swap but trade on an exchange at a lower cost than their equivalents that are traded over the counter (OTC).The two-year old company is looking to capitalise on efforts by global regulators to regulate the over the counter derivatives industry, with US reforms contained in the Dodd Frank Act of 2010. The centralised clearing of swaps is a key reform that seeks to limit the fallout from the failure of a major dealer or large investor in the future.From next Monday, more hedge funds and institutional investors will have to clear their swaps trades through clearing houses, the next phase of a set of rules being brought in to safeguard global markets against systemic risk.With the bulk of OTC swaps set to be cleared, exchanges like CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and Eris are hoping investors will may gravitate towards swap futures as they will require less margin for trading.Chicago-based Eris is looking to broaden the appeal of its products to investors as the new rules come into force. On Monday Eris cut the size of its contracts to a $100,000 notional figure, compared with $1m previously, a move widely interpreted as an effort to appeal to smaller investors and attract more users. Eris was founded by several electronic market makers including DRW Holdings and Getco, while Morgan Stanley, the broker-dealer, also took a stake in December.Trading Technologies, also based in Chicago, counts 19 of the top 20 futures commission merchants in the US as its customers, including Goldman Sachs, UBS and Newedge.Robert Stowsky, senior analyst at Aite Group said the choice between using OTC swaps and a swap future will be a “cost decision” for some investors. “We will see some firms that would have used swaps, go into swap futures.”For market-moving news and views 24 hours a day visit our new rolling news feed of bite-size stories and commentaryThe established swaps industry, led by global banks and interdealer brokers, has become increasingly worried that the lower cost of clearing and transacting a swap future will lead to a big shift in the over the counter derivatives market once banks and customers start centrally clearing swaps.Similar changes have already taken place in the energy derivatives market as CME and ICE converted swaps contracts to futures in response to the new rules.The difference in trading costs between swap futures and OTC swaps transacted on so-called Swap Execution Facilities has been a hot topic of debate within the swaps business. Bloomberg is suing the CFTC in an effort to equalise margin rules between Sefs and exchanges that plan to trade swap futures.Prospective backers of Sefs are worried that the market is moving to a futures model. GFI, the interdealer broker, indicated in March that it had filed an application with the CFTC to launch a futures exchange.Separately, Wells Fargo upgraded the CME Group’s stock to an “outperform” rating on Tuesday.“Outside of clearing, CME stands to benefit from the futurisation of swaps volumes which could ultimately be a much bigger opportunity than clearing alone,” said the bank.
311;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-05-30T22:10:02Z;CME reports record single-day volume;;CME Group registered its most active day on record this week in a sign that markets are rebounding from the lower trading activity that plagued the derivatives industry in recent years.The operator of the world’s largest futures exchange said 26.9m contracts were traded across all asset classes on Wednesday, surpassing the previous record of 25.7m contracts on August 9, 2011 shortly after the US credit rating was downgraded. The milestone represents a pickup in activity from even the beginning of May when daily volumes averaged around 10m contracts.“The credit crisis left a huge mark and people withdrew from taking risk and that’s starting to go in the other [direction] where risk appetites are growing globally,” said Mike Creadon, managing partner at Traditum, a Chicago-based proprietary trading firm. “People are trying to speculate about what comes next with Fed policy and the question right now is [whether] the Fed is going to start tapering its asset purchases.”Combined interest rate futures and options volumes hit 19.4m on Wednesday, compared to a previous record of 17.2m on February 27, 2007, before the global financial crisis.That volume is being driven by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s suggestion last week that the central bank could slow the rate of asset purchases under its third round of quantitative easing “within the next few meetings” as the economy improves.The exchange saw record volumes in a number of asset classes, including Treasury futures and options, partially driven by the rollover from June contracts to September contracts.After a rough few years that saw the collapse of two major brokerages hit industry confidence and a weak global economy depress volumes, Carl Gilmore, of Knight Futures, said the rising volumes bode well for the remainder of the year.“For the futures industry, even though there are a lot things floating around out there, especially [related to new regulations], it feels like as an industry the worst is behind us and I’m optimistic about this year,” he said.
312;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Eurozone looks to ease ‘Robin Hood’ tax collection;;The biggest eurozone economies are looking at commandeering Europe’s market infrastructure to collect a tax on financial transactions in the latest attempt to ensure the levy captures trades executed in the City of London.Officials are discussing ways to “certify” groups that process transactions as “FTT compliant” so that incentives are rigged towards paying the tax since the alternative for traders would be more burdensome and potentially more costly.The options to centralise some collection by charging and collecting it through Europe’s market infrastructure are outlined in a confidential European Commission paper, seen by the Financial Times.If the model is used, traders outside the zone would find it harder to sidestep the eurozone taxman and London’s clearing and settlement houses would come under pressure to collect revenues for FTT states. The plan is likely to rile the UK, which has already launched legal action over the “extraterritorial” reach of the levy.While 11 eurozone states – including France, Germany, Spain and Italy – want to agree a common levy, negotiations have stalled over how it should be implemented and how ambitious it should be. Tax officials are meeting in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss the proposal.The commission initially proposed implementing the financial transaction tax, often referred to as the “Tobin” tax, from January 2014 but it has long been clear that the implementation date will slip by at least a year. No important political decisions are expected before the German federal elections in September.The proposal has caused an outcry from the financial services sector and business groups. In a letter sent to Herman Van Rompuy, the EU Council president, three UK business lobby groups warn the measure is “growth tax” that will hurt competitiveness. “It will also deter non-European funds and companies from investing in Europe which will ultimately lead to fewer jobs and less investment in crucial infrastructure,” the letter states.In a letter to Thursday’s FT, Richard Raeburn, chairman of the European Association of Corporate Treasurers, said the burden of the tax would fall on companies, pension funds and investors.“It is touchingly naive to assume that the banks will simply absorb the tax, including its dramatic cascade effect within the system, and not pass the cost on to their customers,” he wrote.One of the open questions is how to collect the tax on trades that are executed outside the zone or involving parties that are not based in the FTT area. The issue is addressed in a commission paper, which responds to technical questions raised by the 11 FTT countries.The commission argues that the “easiest way” to overcome the risk of non-compliance is to “let the tax be collected and paid directly by the market infrastructure operator” such as a clearing house or trading platform, like an exchange.Brussels argues that a “business case” to pay the levy voluntarily will be created by a provision in the proposal that makes any financial institution with a headquarters in the FTT area “joint and severally liable”, even when trading with a non-eurozone group.It expects FTT-area financial institutions to manage this risk by trading with parties that comply with the tax, or through trading platforms or clearing houses that collect the tax from both sides of the trade.This in turn will create a “business case” for market infrastructures to agree to collect the levy that some call the “Robin Hood” tax, if they want to attract business from groups in the FTT zone, which covers almost a sixth of world economic output. It suggests eurozone states could facilitate this by certifying market infrastructures that collect the tax and only handle trades from compliant groups.“The possible use of joint and several liability might, however, be an extra incentive to transact with credible and tax compliant counterparties or for trading venues to allow only such parties. It is also expected that business practices will adjust to this feature rapidly,” said the commission in its paper.London is the home of the largest clearing houses in Europe, with the exception of Deutsche Börse’s Eurex. LCH.Clearnet is the dominant global clearer of off-exchange derivatives while US derivatives bourses CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange, keen to be closer to their customers, have rapidly expanded their clearing operations from UK capital in recent years.Settlement is the final stage in the life cycle of a trade, where transactions are confirmed as final and securities swapped for cash. The central securities depository (CSD), the infrastructure where the deals are processed, is where the UK stamp duty is collected. The largest eurozone CSD is Clearstream, also owned by Deutsche Börse, which processes around 40 per cent of settlements in the bloc.In its response to questions from eurozone states, the commission also confirmed that “every single transaction, before netting and settlement, which effectively occurs is taxable”. It added that cancelled trades would also be charged, “except for cases of errors”.
313;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CFTC sues broker over client disclosure breaches;;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Wednesday sued Ron Eibschutz, a commodity broker, with aiding and abetting two former New York Mercantile Exchange employees’ breach of customer information confidentiality rules.In February, the CFTC sued Nymex, a unit of CME Group, and two former brokers with disclosing confidential customer information to Mr Eibschutz from February 2008 until September 2010.In the civil actions, the CFTC alleged the former CME brokers, who worked on the ClearPort Facilitation Desk, provided Mr Eibschutz, previously identified as Broker X, with order flow information, including “the identities of the parties to specific trades, the brokers involved in trades and the number of contracts traded”.Mr Eibschutz allegedly aided their violations by repeatedly soliciting the men for specific information and by providing them with information to locate specific trades. He also bought one of the former CME brokers meals, drinks and entertainment, according to the CFTC.A former colleague said Mr Eibschutz brokered energy options at Parity Energy, a New York-based firm, before leaving with an associate to broker Poten. Records show Mr Eibschutz left Poten in March 2013.In one recorded call, a former CME broker said he would have to sign a confidentiality agreement so the calls would need to end. “Are you serious? What does that mean,” asked Mr Eibschutz“It means that if they ever play the tapes and I sign that piece of paper I could get f****d,” the former broker said.CME, the two former brokers and Mr Eibschutz are fighting the allegations.
314;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:23:53+0000;CME hits out at futures trading taxes;;The head of CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, said proposed tax increases on futures trading in the US are unlikely to become law, the latest main market participant to come out against financial transaction taxes similar to those currently being considered in Europe.“I believe that most people on [Capitol Hill] understand that this would be a detrimental tax” that would hurt liquidity, Terry Duffy, executive chairman and president, told analysts on a conference call. “I do think that will not prevail.”A similar taxation effort in Europe has come under fire by investors there, including the continent’s largest institutional investors.Mr Duffy’s comments came as CME reported a near 12 per cent drop in first-quarter net income as volumes growth remained sluggish.The Chicago-based company reported net income of $235.8m, or 71 cents per share, compared with a split-adjusted $266.6m, or 80 cents per diluted share, during the same period last year. Revenues for the first quarter fell 7 per cent, from $774.6m to $718.6m. Last May, the company announced a 5-for-1 stock split.CME took a $12m charge due to foreign currency losses. Excluding one-time charges, it reported earnings of 73 cents per share, meeting analysts’ expectations, on $714.6m in revenues.“We have made progress so far this year as we continue to implement our global strategy,” Mr Duffy said. “Looking ahead, we will keep investing in the company’s growth while also continuing to consistently return capital to shareholders in the most efficient way.”CME reported clearing and transaction fee revenues of $593m, down 4.5 per cent from the same period last year.Lower trading activity took a toll on exchange operators and the wider securities industry last year, though that began to change as markets picked up in 2013.Average daily contract volume in the three months to March rose 1 per cent to 12.5m compared with the same period a year ago. In 2012, volumes fell 15 per cent year-on-year to 11.4m per day.This marks the fourth consecutive quarter CME has seen net income fall. During the three months to December, profits fell more than 75 per cent.But Asia was a bright spot during the quarter. The company reported record volume and revenue from its Asia operations, up 24 per cent and 31 per cent respectively.The company’s main rival, IntercontinentalExchange, on Wednesday reported an 8 per cent drop in earnings, to $135.4m, or $1.85 per share, on revenues of $351.9m. Average daily contract volume at ICE fell nearly 4 per cent, to 3.64m, during the quarter.Shares closed 0.5 per cent higher to $60.40.
315;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-04-25T16:49:13Z;Zambia: second exchange primed and ready for derivatives;;"Zambia’s second bourse is hoping to kick off trading “in weeks”, giving investors a chance to trade derivative products alongside the bonds and equities available on the main Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE).Peter Sitamulaho, deputy chief executive of the Bonds and Derivatives Exchange Zambia, or BaDEx, said the bourse is just waiting on getting its first clearing member, which would guarantee trades: “When the first bank signs, we will be able to trade.”Sitamulaho said he expects one of the bigger pan-African banks – ABSA Bank, Standard Bank, or Standard Chartered – to be on board very soon. To give BaDEx a “Zambian flavour,” he hopes the first signer will be one of the local banks, “and then we can grow with international banks. We’ve got our systems and management in place, we’re licensed. We just need to start working.”LuSE, which has been open for nearly 20 years, focuses on equities and bonds. And BaDEx hopes to be Zambia’s derivatives exchange. It will work in partnership with Zambia’s Commodities Exchange to provide a platform for agricultural commodities trading.BaDEx, which developed its rules and regulations in a similar mould to exchanges such as the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and Chicago-based CME Group, is “not competing with LuSE in that we’re creating futures contracts on top of those bonds and shares,” according to Sitamulaho. “We’re not for now asking investors to list bonds on our exchange.”Sitamulaho pointed out that other financial organisations are able to do forwards and swaps, “but to a limited extent”, and that BaDEx’s three derivatives products – the Kwacha-Dollar Currency Future, Single Stock Futures, and the Zambia Dreadnought Tradeable Index – should help to deepen Zambia’s capital markets.The appetite for such derivatives should exist because as Zambia’s economy boomed, “a number of companies decided they would borrow offshore, at the low interest rates offered in Europe and the US,” Sitamulaho said. The resulting foreign exchange currency risk has proved a particular challenge for real estate companies and other companies with dollar liabilities and kwatcha cash flows, something the Kwacha-Dollar Currency Future could be used to offset.A number of contracts that were negotiated in dollars, for instance, Sitamulaho said, but the cash flow to the real estate companies was in Kwacha. “There was a mismatch. When renting a property, you would pay dollars, but [as required by law] they would sign a tenancy agreement in Kwacha.”The Single Stock Futures product would allow investors to protect the value of their shares using a futures contract. This, Sitamulaho said, should help prevent market illiquidity, which has been a big factor in discouraging other companies to list on the main exchange.From the 22 companies listed on LuSE, eight comprise the Zambia Dreadnought Tradeable Index, including meat-producer Zambeef. According to Sitamulaho, the index aims to help foreign investors who want to have exposure to the Zambian economy without having to invest in individual stocks.Which all sounds good, but BaDEx is still waiting for that first clearing member. Once it get that, it will want credibility – and that means clearing banks with big balance sheets that can guarantee big trades.Related reading:

316;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-04-21T22:10:00Z;Malaysia key in CME’s bid to tap into Asia;;It might seem a stretch, but residents of the two biggest cities on the Malaysian part of Borneo – more known for its rainforests and palm oil production – have been getting lessons in commodity futures trading.Phillip Futures, a provider of online trading services in Singapore, revealed last week it had been giving seminars in Kuching and Kota Kinabalu as it tried to expand the appeal of futures beyond banks and big electronic trading groups to the average investor.Phillip also received a licence from Bursa Malaysia, the country’s exchange, to set up a branch in Johor Bahru, a city on the southern tip of Peninsular Malaysia across the strait from Singapore.The idea is to broaden participation in Malaysian futures trading as part of a recent Bursa initiative allowing futures brokers to establish branch offices and “trading kiosks” anywhere in Malaysia.The moves are a sign that even as futures trading volumes in the west are anaemic, enthusiasm for the financial instruments is growing in Asia.For Phupinder Gill, chief executive of CME Group, operator of the largest US futures exchange, that is a welcome trend. Malaysia is a key element in his strategy to expand CME beyond the US. “Barely 10 years ago we had total top line [revenues] of $500m, and last year $750m of top line came from outside the US – most of that from our London operation,” he says. “We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of the potential that can be achieved, particularly in Asia.”CME has owned a 25 per cent stake in Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, part of the Bursa Malaysia group, since 2009. Its most widely traded product, crude palm oil futures, has since 2010 been available to traders outside Malaysia through CME’s Globex electronic system.This arrangement has allowed Bursa to tap into CME’s pool of existing customers, boosting the amount of trading in its palm oil futures contracts. Volume was 27 per cent higher last year in such contracts than in 2011.In turn, CME distributes its benchmark US futures products to Bursa’s existing customers, and sells proprietary market data to them.The arrangement will get a boost later this year when the US futures regulator is expected to allow US-based traders to access Bursa Malaysia Derivatives through a system known as “direct market access”, meaning they would no longer have to go through a local broker in Malaysia.The arrangement with Bursa is one of a series of alliances that CME has been building in Asia. CME and KRX, the Korean exchange, operate a similar arrangement under which KRX members can trade Kospi stock index futures after hours on the Globex trading platform.Yet it is China that offers the more enticing long-term opportunity, says Mr Gill.“For now and for the next three years, tapping into the alliances and promoting the benchmark products that we have would be the focus on the sales force in the region,” Mr Gill says. “But I think on a three to five year basis China would be one of the larger opportunities for CME.”Chinese futures brokers have been signing up for membership of CME and its rivals, such as Eurex, the German exchange, and NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext. That is even as trading volumes on the exchanges have been flat of late.“We’re seeing a pipeline of firms in various stages of becoming clearing [member] firms, which is highly unusual when you are talking about contraction in the industry,” Mr Gill says.Most of those Chinese brokers – such as GF Securities and Nanhua Futures, two privately owned companies – are expanding away from Hong Kong. Mr Gill says that while Hong Kong has previously been talked of as a gateway into China, “what we are seeing from a practical point of view is Hong Kong is actually a gateway out of China for us”.The group expects to open a Beijing office by the end of the second quarter, adding to a total Asia staff of 50. Most are based in CME’s regional headquarters in Singapore.In coming weeks, CME will boost its capacity to tap into Asia with the launch of a European futures exchange, based in London. That is set up to allow Asia-based traders to deal in their timezone, including futures on the renminbi, which were launched on Globex in February.Like its US and European rivals, CME does not have an exchange or a clearing house in Asia. Yet while Mr Gill does not rule out setting up a clearing house in the region – “depending on the demand” – he says CME can provide clearing from its London-based clearing house in the meantime.
317;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:58:35+0000;Quick View: ICE-NYSE deal countdown begins;US exchange asks for EU jurisdiction to review deal;A crucial 40 working-day clock has begun ticking for IntercontinentalExchange’s planned purchase of NYSE Euronext for $8.2bn in cash and shares.The two parties confirmed late last night – via a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission – they had asked the European Union to take jurisdiction to approve the deal, as widely expected.As the companies acknowledge, in Europe the deal is subject to the merger control jurisdiction of the national competition authorities in Portugal, Spain and the UK.But companies also have the right to apply for an intra-national review. In some ways the European Commission would also be the natural home. Euronext is largely a continental European business, headquartered in Paris with its main listing and an extensive options business in Amsterdam. Liffe, the prize Mr Sprecher most covets, is London-based.Furthermore, as the Commission showed last year with the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext deal, it isn’t solely looking to defend European businesses. It is keen on open, competitive markets.But practical considerations also play a part for ICE. The consummation of the deal is subject to approval from 16 competition authorities, central banks and banking authorities in the US and Europe. Any way to lessen that burden is bound to be explored.But it also reflects how ICE, for all its bullishness, acknowledges there is some catching up to do as the market moves on. ICE wants to compete with CME Group, Deutsche Börse’s Eurex and LCH.Clearnet in clearing more derivatives trades as global authorities seek to safeguard the financial system with more deals processed through clearing houses.The first rules around mandatory clearing of over the counter securities have come into effect in the US and are likely to be in place in Europe in just over a year’s time. While LCH, CME and Eurex are busy selling their services, ICE is wrapped up in its own deal.ICE is already a leader in OTC credit and energy derivatives clearing but has nothing for interest rates swaps, the biggest OTC derivatives asset class.Starting behind rivals is not an irretrievable situation for ICE. The planned switch at the end of June from clearing the contracts traded on NYSE Liffe to ICE’s own European clearing house is an important factor here. NYSE Liffe has its own trade administration and clearing service for OTC products, called bClear.Naturally the market will be watching closely for missteps but at least ICE has the experience for such a move. In 2008 it moved more than 40 clearing members, 26.5m contracts and more than $16bn of assets to its own new clearing house from LCH.Clearnet.But LCH.Clearnet also acts as another reminder why ICE and NYSE are seeking the EU path. The London Stock Exchange also asked the commission to review its planned purchase of a controlling stake in the transatlantic clearing house but UK authorities insisted, as is their right, to have the review conducted nationally.A year on from the initial announcement and that deal still awaits official blessing. The UK Financial Services Authority has yet to give its statement of “non-objection”, although all other regulators have blessed the deal. That’s not the sort of wait ICE wants to face.ICE’s application now means the UK, Spain and Portugal have 15 working days to object to the EU taking jurisdiction for the review of the deal.If the EU takes control, it then has 25 working days following receipt of a complete notification form to make a decision or open an in-depth investigation that it undertook for the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext deal. That could add months to the process.A critical period is upon us.
318;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-03-19T21:18:47Z;ICE adjusts terms of $8.2bn NYSE deal;;IntercontinentalExchange has tweaked the terms of its planned $8.2bn deal to purchase NYSE Euronext to satisfy regulatory rules surrounding ownership of exchanges.In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, ICE said it would form a new holding company for both itself and NYSE Euronext, which operates exchanges in the US and Europe. Each share of ICE common stock will be converted into the right to receive one share of the new holding company, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange as ICE Group.The change was made to meet requirements laid down by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which permits parties a maximum shareholding level in stock exchanges of just 20 per cent.“The terms of the agreement, including consideration to be paid to NYSE Euronext shareholders, are substantially the same,” the filing said.ICE is set to shake up global derivatives trading with its cash and shares deal to buy the New York Stock Exchange. However, ICE, which has emerged only in the past decade via energy and commodity trading, has designs on NYSE Liffe, the European derivatives exchange.Ownership of it will allow ICE to trade interest rate derivatives, the most widely used derivatives for hedging risk, and create a rival to CME Group and Deutsche Börse as one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges by contracts traded.The deal comes amid a lull in industry volumes as global low interest rates, little economic growth and greater stability in the eurozone curb investor appetite for trading.However, under its plan many of NYSE’s continental European assets, including the stock exchanges of Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon, are set to be floated in Europe. Dominique Cerutti, deputy chief executive of NYSE Euronext, has emerged as a frontrunner for the new European entity, according to people familiar with the situation.ICE is finalising its discussions with European regulators ahead of filing its deal proposals to antitrust authorities. It hopes to complete the deal by the end of the year.Last week Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of the ICE, called for more consolidation among European exchanges as regulation and the euro crisis combined to further the creation of a single market among the 27 euro states.Exchanges should form a federation “where they accommodate the local markets for listing and capital raising but allow trading to happen cross-border”, he said.Shares in ICE, up nearly 30 per cent this year, fell 0.3 per cent to $159.13. NYSE Euronext shares were down 0.3 per cent to $37.91.
319;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-03-18T13:20:40Z;CME launches swaps clearing in London;;Three-way competition in clearing interest rate derivatives has formally begun in Europe after CME Group began processing trades at its London clearing house on Monday.Aviva Investors became the first institutional investor to clear an interest rate swap, the largest assets of the derivatives market by notional value, via JPMorgan last week. CME has begun with clearing of swaps of up to 50 years in seven currencies: sterling, euro, yen, US dollar, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Swiss franc. The deals will be processed in less than a second.CME, the world’s largest futures operator, becomes the third commercial provider of over-the-counter clearing in Europe, alongside fellow newcomer Eurex Clearing, owned by Deutsche Börse. Both are aiming to take market share from LCH.Clearnet, the transatlantic clearing house, which has more than 95 per cent of the overall cleared OTC interest rate swap market.New entrants are eyeing the opportunities created by a regulatory overhaul of global derivatives market. Authorities want more of the OTC market processed through clearing houses, which guarantee a deal between two parties in the event of a default. In the US, the first phase of mandatory clearing, for the most active users, began last week, and there has been a surge in customer clearing volumes at LCH.Clearnet in recent months.“Aviva Investors view OTC derivatives as integral to the investment management process, enabling us to better manage our clients’ portfolios and to capture investment performance on their behalf,” said Shahid Ikram, chief investment officer at Aviva Investors.European deadlines are expected come into force in the first half of next year.An interest rate swap is a derivative contract that enables two trading firms to swap a fixed rate of cash flow for a floating, or variable, rate and accounts for around two-thirds of the $640tn market, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements.BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Nomura and Royal Bank of Scotland are all connected to the platform, while Citibank, Morgan Stanley and UBS will be connecting in the coming weeks“We will be building out the London operations so that it mirrors the US,” said William Knottenbelt, head of CME’s operations for Europe, Middle East and Africa. The CME will launch OTC forex and credit default swaps later this year and a second rollout phase likely to begin in June or July, he added.CME Clearing in the US has cleared more than $1.75tn in OTC interest rate swap volume.
320;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-03-15T12:20:08Z;First Derivatives to register in US as Sef;;First Derivatives, a UK trading technology company, is planning to register with US regulators to operate one of the new types of swaps marketplaces mandated by incoming rules overhauling the off-exchange derivatives industry.The Northern Ireland-based group has appointed James Sanders from Forex Capital Markets, a US currency trading venue, as its chief compliance officer to oversee its registration as a swap execution facility (Sef). Registration will be filed later this year, it said.The new derivatives marketplaces are one of the key features to emerge from the US Dodd-Frank act, designed to safeguard markets from further systemic risk.Policy makers want more transparency in the vast but opaque over-the-counter derivatives market, which is overwhelmingly swaps trading. Large illiquid contracts are set to be moved on to electronic trading venues.The final details covering the day-to-day operations of Sefs, however, have yet to be finalised by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The swaps industry has been concerned that onerous final Sef rules may increase costs to users of OTC products and encourage the use of rival, cheaper futures contracts.Earlier this week Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, described finishing the rules as “a priority” at the derivatives industry’s annual conference in Florida.“Sefs will allow market participants to view the prices of available bids and offers prior to making their decision on a transaction,” he said.Inter-broker dealers such as ICAP and Tullett Prebon and some of the world’s largest exchanges, such as CME Group, are expected to register as Sefs. First Derivatives said the move was intended to further expand its fast-growing Delta technology platform, a service that uses cloud computing to handle large volumes of data and allow traders to execute deals on mobile platforms.Mr Sanders has also worked in the legal department at Credit Suisse and served as counsel at Fulbright and Jaworski. Before that he served as senior trial attorney in the Division of Enforcement of the CFTC.
321;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-03-12T23:10:39Z;Bloomberg threatens suit over swaps trading;Financial data and services group complains to regulator over new rules;Bloomberg LP has threatened a leading US regulator with legal action in an effort to prevent a competitive advantage for exchanges in the battle over how derivatives will trade under new rules.In a letter sent this week to Gary Gensler, Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, the company said the higher cost of clearing over-the-counter swaps, compared with futures, is unfair to the swaps industry.Bloomberg, the financial information service which provides tools such as analytics and trading platforms, said it is prepared to file a lawsuit to block new regulations mandating minimum margin collateral that can cover five days of possible losses for cleared financial swaps. By contrast, margin for futures contracts traded on exchanges presently covers the risks of one day of losses.The company has hired Eugene Scalia, partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and son of US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. The younger Scalia has successfully challenged US financial regulations in court, stymying regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission.Last year, Mr Scalia persuaded a court to overturn caps on commodity speculation that the CFTC was implementing as part of Dodd-Frank.The CFTC is working to implement rules governing the trading of over-the-counter derivatives as mandated by the US overhaul of financial regulation known as Dodd-Frank.The CFTC has yet to pass final rules for trading swaps on so-called Swap Execution Facilities. But trading venues for transacting “swap futures” contracts at exchange operators CME Group and Eris Exchange in Chicago are already active.With OTC swaps now subject to clearing, the higher cost associated with trading these products is seen favouring swap futures. This week, IntercontinentalExchange announced plans to list a credit derivatives futures contract by May.“With ICE, CME, and others able to offer futures products that have substantially lower margin requirements than swaps that otherwise are functionally interchangeable, the implications for SEFs (which cannot offer futures) are clear and profoundly disturbing,” Mr Scalia wrote on behalf of Bloomberg.Bloomberg is developing a SEF and is expected to play a major role as a trading venue for OTC swaps.George Harrington, Bloomberg head of global fixed income trading, said the agency should set margin requirements based on the risk posed by the financial instruments, echoing arguments made by several large investors and dealers at a public CFTC roundtable in January.He claimed there was more liquidity in swaps than in swap futures, which should drive the CFTC to lower its margin requirements.The difference in trading costs between swap futures and OTC swaps transacted on SEFs is a hot topic for the swaps business, with many key players attending this week’s annual Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton.“Treating swaps and futures products differently is inconsistent with [the] Dodd-Frank Act’s commitment to transparency, investor protection, and competition, and it poses imminent, significant adverse consequences to Bloomberg (and potentially others),” said Mr Scalia in his letter to the CFTC.The company said all financial products should be subject to one-day margin requirements. This would result in similar margin treatment for over-the-counter swaps and futures on swaps, limiting an arbitrage opportunity for exchanges that list futures.Bloomberg said it was prepared to launch a lawsuit “in order to ensure that a flawed regulation, which would cause significant public harm, does not get implemented”.The company requested that the commission respond to the letter by March 19 so that Bloomberg “can proceed to court if necessary to obtain appropriate relief”.Additional reporting by Shahien Nasiripour in Washington
322;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-03-08T12:32:51Z;Warsaw bourse open to consolidation;;The Warsaw Stock Exchange is open to tie-ups with other exchanges, including capital links, the exchange’s new chief executive said, a dramatic change of policy for central Europe’s largest bourse.“It’s not just about organic growth – we have to seriously consider joining in with the pan-European consolidation process,” Adam Maciejewski, the WSE’s chief executive, told the Financial Times in his first face-to-face interview with the foreign press since taking over the exchange in January. “We have to carefully watch what is happening in Europe, and exchanges that ignore that are subjecting themselves to irrelevance.”He spoke in the wake of stories that Deutsche Börse was in merger talks with CME Group, denied by the Frankfurt exchange.The WSE had long been standoffish about other central European exchanges, particularly Vienna, which had consolidated many smaller bourses such as Prague and Budapest across the region. Mr Maciejewski was careful to avoid denigrating his neighbours.“I’d like to think about the future with them and other market participants in the region – I’m putting out my hand, not knocking it away,” he said.Mr Maciejewski took over from his disgraced predecessor, Ludwik Sobolewski, who was fired after allegations surfaced that he and his subordinates had approached listed companies about financing a movie starring his girlfriend.Mr Sobolewski insisted he had done nothing wrong, but was forced out on the recommendation of Mikolaj Budzanowski, the treasury minister. The treasury holds 35 per cent of the WSE’s shares, but controls 51.7 per cent of votes.“The end of the year was not the happiest time and one of my priorities is to return that confidence of public perception,” said Mr Maciejewski, who has worked for the exchange in various functions since 1994.Mr Maciejewski promises to bring quite a different approach to running the WSE than Mr Sobolewski, who was head of the bourse from 2006-13. Mr Sobolewski made an enormous effort in trying to attract companies from Ukraine, the Baltics and further afield to choose to list in Warsaw, while opening new lines of business such as Catalyst, a bond trading platform, and New Connect, an alternative small companies exchange.The WSE made a point of trumpeting the high numbers of initial public offerings it attracted, usually the most for any European exchange, but was dogged by low liquidity and by growing problems with New Connect, where some companies were tarred with ethical issues.Mr Maciejewski said he is planning to focus most of his energy on the WSE’s main share market, working to increase interest from individual investors, who account for about 19 per cent of volume, as well as “delicately” increasing foreign interest, now accounting for 48 per cent of volume.Of New Connect, he said: “We will raise that market’s quality. It will be a market we can be proud of, not just one that is able to boast about numbers of IPOs.”The WSE will also work with midsized companies that have complained about poor liquidity to improve their investor communications and boost trading in their shares.The WSE has more freedom of action than it did before its 2010 IPO, when the treasury owned 98 per cent of the exchange, but continued government control does pose some challenges to future tie-ups with other bourses.“One can say this sort of shareholder structure does create some restrictions when thinking in categories of mergers and acquisitions, but I propose a different view – having a strategic shareholder that is interested in the future of the company can strengthen chances for successful business” Mr Maciejewski said.
323;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-03-07T12:41:23Z;CFTC sides with CME in data dispute;;US regulators have sided with CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, in a controversial battle over the way customers must report their off-exchange derivatives deals to comply with tough new rules.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ruled by four votes to zero late Wednesday that exchanges such as CME could send data to its own data repository, purpose-built so the industry can comply with toughened rules around derivatives trading.Global regulators have called for greater transparency in derivatives markets in the wake of the financial crisis and the creation of data warehouses is a key aim. They will keep records of buyers and sellers and prices in the market and are intended to give authorities a better opportunity to spot potential systemic risk in the $640 swaps market. Authorities have identified its opaqueness as a key contributory factor the financial crisis.However, the best way to achieve it has provoked deep controversy in the industry, between CME, which clears many trades, and many the Wall Street banks that create the data and the market transactions.The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, a clearing house that is owned mainly by its banking users, has argued that data will be split between several repositories, fragmenting it and contravening policy makers’ aims, as laid down in the Dodd-Frank act.The CME argued that its rule book – approved by the CFTC – stipulated that deals processed through its clearing house would by reported to its own swaps data repository. The CME would share the data with rival swap repositories if permitted by the customer.Others counter that the fight is about exploiting the commercial opportunities that could emerge by dominating swaps data repositories.“We are very pleased with the CFTC’s approval of our rule, which provides clarity on the issue and certainty for market participants. We are eager to continue clearing swaps and reporting cleared swaps in the most efficient way,” the CME said in a statement.However, Larry Thompson, general counsel of DTCC, said the decision was “inconsistent with the principles of the Dodd-Frank Act.” It will “cripple market participant choice, is anti-competitive and compromises regulators and market participants’ ability to understand, assess and manage systemic risk effectively,” he said.We are very pleased with the CFTC’s approval of our rule . . . We are eager to continue clearing swaps and reporting cleared swaps in the most efficient wayThe DTCC has threatened the CFTC with a lawsuit if the decision went against it. Mr Thompson said DTCC and other market participants were considering their responses. JPMorgan has in the past warned the CFTC against siding with the CME.Furthermore, two of the five CFTC commissioners also spoke out against the ruling. Scott O’Malia, a Republican, abstained from the vote. Approving the rule without an amendment to the commission’s own regulations “will lead to further confusion with respect to reporting requirements for cleared swaps,” he said.Jill Sommers, another commissioner, acknowledged that while the regulator’s analysis was consistent with the CME’s rule book, she preferred the agency’s regulations be amended.“By failing to do so we have missed an opportunity to eliminate any remaining doubt,” she said in a statement.
324;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME Group trims grain-trading hours;Change to session-length ‘an exchange issue;CME Group has shortened its grain-trading sessions in response to a survey of customers, reversing a decision it took last year after its biggest rival increased trading hours.The company, which lists benchmark corn, soyabean, and wheat contracts on its Chicago Board of Trade platform, on Tuesday announced that it would cut the 21-hour trading day it had introduced last May to 17.5 hours. Before last May’s increase, trading was allowed 17 hours per day on the Chicago-based CME, the world’s largest futures exchange.Richard Feltes, vice president of research at Chicago-based broker RJ O’Brien, said there was universal praise from people in the business for the move. “I think it’s a quality of life improver,” he said.CME’s rival, the all-electronic IntercontinentalExchange last year launched lookalike grain futures that tracked price moves in Chicago, upsetting the established rhythms of agricultural markets by allowing 22-hour trading days. ICE said it had no intention to alter its trading hours.The threat from ICE seems to have subsided. The exchange had 603 open corn futures contracts as of Monday, compared to 1.2m open contracts on CME.CME’s decision takes place less than two months after the US Department of Agriculture shifted the release times of market-moving crop reports to midday to coincide with high trading volumes. The futures market formerly took a break when reports were released.Joseph Glauber, USDA chief economist, said late last month that the planned reduction in grain trading hours was “an exchange issue”.“A lot of people erroneously think that we have jurisdiction over the exchanges in terms of when they trade,” he said . “We consulted with a lot of people about the hours [for releasing crop reports]. For the time being, we’ll stay with these hours.”CME announced in January that it would survey customers and producers about the changes. More than 4,000 responded.“Over the past several months, we have received significant customer feedback about the current CBOT grain trading hours,” said Tim Andriesen, CME managing director of agricultural commodities and alternative investments. “While there were varying opinions about what the modifications to hours should be, we believe these changes balance the needs of our diverse global customers based on their feedback.”Electronic trading will be open Sunday to Friday from 7pm to 7:45am, Central time, before a break until 8:30am, when floor trading begins and electronic trading resumes until 1:15pm. The hours will take effect April 7, pending regulatory approval.On Monday, CME reported that derivatives trading on its exchanges had reached its highest level since September 2011, as volatility increased in stock and bond markets.
325;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-02-27T19:59:12Z;LCH.Clearnet names Weisbrod for US unit;;LCH.Clearnet, the transatlantic clearing house, has appointed David Weisbrod from JPMorgan to run its US business as it prepares for incoming rules around derivatives trading.Mr Weisbrod, who has been at JPMorgan for more than 40 years, will lead strategy in the US, one of the world’s largest locations for off-exchange derivatives trading.Global regulators want more of the vast over-the-counter derivatives market to be processed through clearing houses. A clearing house stands between two parties, guaranteeing a trade in the event of a default.LCH is the world’s largest clearing house, dwarfing rival services from CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange. It clears nearly half of the world’s $400tn global interest rate swap market and is the second-largest clearer of bonds and repos in the world.Ian Axe, chief executive, has led a two-year transformation to turn the Anglo-French group into a more global business and give it a more commercial focus.Mr Axe has agreed to sell a majority stake in the group to the London Stock Exchange, and last year bought the International Derivatives Clearing Group from Nasdaq OMX to expand its business.LCH is also in talks to sell a stake in the business to SGX, the Singapore exchange.Mr Weisbrod’s last role at JPMorgan was vice-chairman for risk management. He also chaired its exchange & clearing house steering committee. He has also been a member of committees on the New York Federal Reserve and served on the board of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, a bank-owned clearing house. He is also on the board of CLS, the foreign exchange settlement service.“I am delighted David is joining our team. He has vast risk management expertise, clearing knowledge and experience working with US regulators, and he joins the group at a critical stage of our US growth,” said Mr Axe.
326;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-02-27T18:00:20Z;Block trades face higher minimums;;A US regulator is pondering making it tougher to execute block futures trades, a way to transact discreetly while dodging new rules covering derivatives.Block trades have become a point of friction among brokers, traders, exchanges and regulators as financial reforms take hold. They worry about keeping markets transparent while also letting customised risk management survive.Futures from natural gas to interest rates are mainly traded on a computer screen or exchange floor where traders see live prices. Block trades enable market participants to strike a deal in private and afterward post it to an exchange.These trades were traditionally reserved for large transactions. But late last year exchange operators CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange began allowing much smaller trades in energy markets to qualify as blocks. In US crude oil options the minimum block size is now 100 contracts, down from 1,000 in early 2012. In markets such as coal and electricity the threshold is as little as five.Traders embraced blocks as an alternative to over-the-counter derivatives as the latter became regulated under the Dodd-Frank financial law. But some regulators are concerned the vogue for blocks will encourage trading outside transparent exchanges.Staff of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are now studying methodologies that would raise minimum block sizes in some futures markets. If approved by commissioners, their work may result in a proposed rule or a “concept release”, people familiar with the effort said.One question under consideration is whether to allow exchanges to continue to set futures block thresholds or dictate formulas from Washington. The staff are also examining ways to make trading in futures consistent with OTC swaps, where new block rules are pending.Bryan Durkin, CME chief operating officer, said at a public meeting last month: “We believe the thresholds we have established need to stay in place absolutely until the full extent of the swap rules are clearly defined and evident to the marketplace. We also need to give appropriate time for the marketplace to adapt and adjust to whatever that criteria is going to be.”The prospect of higher block minimums has sparked anxiety in energy markets. Mercuria, the Swiss-based trading house, warned it could abandon US futures markets if the CFTC tried to manage the size of block trades.“We strongly believe that the commission should refrain from trying to fix something that is not broken. In other words, block trading is working,” Jerry Jeske, Mercuria chief compliance officer, said at the meeting.LCM Commodities, a New York broker, said in a note to clients: “If minimum block sizes were raised to the old 1,000 threshold, liquidity in energy options would be so drastically diminished that it could jeopardise the adequate functioning of the market itself.”
327;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-02-25T21:51:25Z;Mediaset gives poll mixed reception;;European indices swung from multi-session highs to more modest gains as Italy’s election gripped markets Monday.“I am shocked, need to drink water and think again,” said the chief strategist at a leading Swiss asset manager.Italy’s benchmark FTSE MIB rallied by as much as 4 per cent on early exit poll figures indicating a narrow victory for Pier Luigi Bersani’s centre-left Democratic party.The mood quickly turned as the picture became less clear, with Silvio Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party gaining a bigger share of the votes.Inconclusive election results at market close left investors concerned over the possibility of a hung parliament.The FTSE MIB closed up 0.7 per cent at 16,351.99.Mediaset, the Italian television company controlled by Mr Berlusconi, soared by as much as 10 per cent before closing up 2.1 per cent at €1.72. UniCredit, Italy’s largest lender, followed a similar trajectory, closing up 2 per cent at €4.19.The wider pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 dipped into negative territory before closing flat at 1,166.07.Elan outperformed the market on news that private equity group Royalty Pharma made a bid to acquire the pharmaceutical group in a potential deal that values its equity at $6.6bn. The shares gained 6.9 per cent to €8.52.Deutsche Börse was boosted by speculation that CME Grouphad approached the German exchange for merger talks. The shares rose 5.6 per cent to €49.30. But Deutsche Börse denied it was in talks with CME.Vivendi rallied after Brazilian media reported the French media and telecoms group was closing in on a deal to sell a stake in GVT, its Brazilian telecoms unit.The shares climbed 3.2 per cent to €15.95.Satellite communications company SES had some of the biggest losses. Shares fell 3.4 per cent to €23.00 after analysts at HSBC and Exane BNP Paribas separately cut their ratings on the stock to “neutral”.
328;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-02-25T21:41:28Z;US stocks sell off on Italian poll results;;US stocks suffered their biggest single day decline in nearly four months, after a sell-off that began with investors nervously awaiting the outcome of the Italian parliamentary election.The benchmark S&P 500 lost 1.8 per cent to 1,487.85, reaching its lowest level since January 18 and recording its worst loss since November 7. Stocks turned increasingly sour throughout the day and closed at a session low.All ten leading industry groups on the benchmark recorded losses on the day, with defensive sectors such as utilities and telecoms seeing more limited declines.Financial sector stocks were the worst performing and fell nearly 2.7 per cent. Investment bank Morgan Stanley lost 6.6 per cent to $22.03, leading the losses among the country’s largest financial institutions.Investors started selling riskier securities as exit polls from the Italian election suggested that the European country’s new government would likely be divided, potentially fueling greater instability in the country.“Nervousness out of Italy led to the initial sell-off,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. “The market then fell below the 1,500 level, which led to an onslaught of selling into the close.”Wall Street’s fear gauge, as measured by the Vix index, jumped 34.4 per cent to 19 to reach its highest level since the start of the year when the country faced the fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax hikes.“Today’s losses and the jump in the Vix show just how fragile things are right now ahead of this week’s US sequester [talks],” Mr Kinahan added.The sharp declines also extended to the other major US benchmarks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.6 per cent to 13,784.01. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 1.4 per cent to 3,116.25.Among individual stocks, Barnes & Noble shares soared as the wider US market declined heavily after the US bookseller’s chairman said he was preparing a bid for the struggling company’s bookstore business.Shares in the bookseller, which is the last national chain remaining in the US, rose 11.5 per cent to $15.06.The gains came as Leonard Riggio, who owns 30 per cent of the company, said he was interested in buying assets related to its retail business.According to a securities filing, an offer would exclude the company’s Nook Media digital business, which has struggled to gain traction against competitors such as Amazon and Apple.Analysts at Credit Suisse said: “The issue is whether there is positive value in the money-losing and increasingly poorly positioned, Nook Media division.”Shares in Amazon, maker of the Kindle e-reader, declined 2.1 per cent to $259.87. Apple, which makes the iPad tablet, dropped 1.8 per cent to $442.80.Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, fell 4.8 per cent to $35.86 even as it reported quarterly results that beat analysts’ estimates.The company said it saw a pick-up in business from rebuilding efforts that took place after superstorm Sandy damaged homes along the US east coast last year.CME Group lost 0.9 per cent to $57.78 after it was reported that the global derivatives exchange operator had pushed for talks with European rival Deutsche Börse.Online game maker Zynga rose 7.8 per cent to $3.44 after the state of Nevada legalised online gambling late last week.Zynga has sought to revitalise its business, with shares off 73.5 per cent in the past year, by pushing into online gambling.Dillards, the US department store chain, lost 9.4 per cent to $76.92 as its earnings fell short of analyst forecasts in its latest quarter.Chesapeake Energy declined 6.8 per cent to $19.11 after the natural gas company it would sell a 50 per cent stake in a US oil and gasfield to Sinopec for $1bn.Hertz Global Holdings, the car rental company, climbed 1.7 per cent to $19.04 after it said its latest quarterly profits beat analysts’ estimates and projected a strong year ahead.
329;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-02-25T12:48:40Z;CME pushes for talks with Deutsche Börse;;CME Group, the US derivatives exchange operator, has pushed for talks with Deutsche Börse in a sign that the consolidation that is sweeping through the world’s largest trading venues shows little sign of slowing.The two parties have held talks, at CME’s behest, in recent months as both sides consider their long-term strategies following IntercontinentalExchange’s planned $8.2bn purchase of NYSE Euronext, according to two people familiar with the situation.The response from Deutsche Börse has been lukewarm, however, with the German group still bruised from its failed attempt to merge with NYSE Euronext just over a year ago, the people said. European regulators blocked the deal on concerns the combination would lead to a monopoly in interest rate derivatives trading in Europe.“Deutsche Börse is not in merger negotiations with CME Group,” the German group said in a statement. “As previously communicated, [our] primary strategic focus is on organic growth, mainly by expanding its business into growth regions in Asia, extending its services for unsecured and unregulated markets, and expanding its combined market data and IT business.”CME, the world’s largest futures market operator, declined to comment.“In the case of a merger being pursued, we anticipate political and anti-trust risk, since the combination would bring together the largest futures exchanges in the US and European markets,” said Peter Lenardos, director of diversified financials at RBC Capital Markets in London.Deutsche Börse shares, which rose as much as 10 per cent before the denial was issued, closed up 5.6 per cent at €49.15 on hopes of further exchange consolidation.The move comes as rivals examine ways to grow as persistent low interest rates damp volatility and investor appetite for trading asset classes such as derivatives and equities.The industry faces a significant shake-up after ICE agreed a deal for NYSE in December. The deal, currently going through regulatory and shareholder approval, is likely to create one of the world’s largest derivatives markets operators, and a serious competitor to CME and Deutsche Börse.While the CME has little interest rate derivatives business in Europe, it has applied to set up a derivatives exchange in London. Interest-rate futures trading is the CME’s biggest business in the US, trading eurodollar futures and euribor futures while Deutsche Börse’s Eurex platform dominates long-term trading of Euro-Bund derivatives.A move by the CME would look to exploit weakness in the valuation of Deutsche Börse. The American group’s $19bn market capitalisation is about 60 per cent greater than that of its German rival, whose shares have remained flat after the failed merger with NYSE. Like other US exchanges, CME shares have climbed since the start of the year and are up 15 per cent in the year to date.
330;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-02-21T19:38:43Z;CFTC sues Nymex over information leaks;Two former employees also face allegations;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is suing the New York Mercantile Exchange, a unit of CME Group, and two former employees for allegedly giving secret customer trading information to an external broker.The case is the first time the CFTC has sued Nymex since the 1980s, an official said. It reflects a growing push by regulators to hold exchange operators responsible for alleged misconduct.The CFTC alleges that from early 2008 until November 2010 William Byrnes and Christopher Curtin, the former employees on CME ClearPort Facilitation Desk, provided a broker with order flow information, including “the identities of the parties to specific trades, the brokers involved in trades, the number of contracts traded, the prices paid, the structure of particular transactions, and the trading strategies of market participants.”CME Nymex was accused of failing to fully investigate a 2009 customer complaint alleging that someone named “Billy” was divulging customer information. Mr Byrnes was identified by the exchange but was never questioned, the CFTC alleges.It was only after a second complaint, the CFTC alleges, that the CME investigated and fired Mr Byrnes.Mr Curtin is now vice-president of the control desk, a customer relations platform, for ELX Futures. A spokeswoman for ELX had no immediate comment. Mr Byrnes could not be immediately reached for comment.The CME said the lawsuit was “disappointing because it relates to incidents that CME Group has already addressed and handled appropriately, and involved no harm to any customer or the markets.”It added that it had fired the relevant employees after its own review in 2010, but the CME did not address the CFTC claim that it did not act when first alerted to the possible wrongdoing a year earlier.CME said: “We simply do not believe the CFTC’s claims in this case are fair to Nymex.”The Nymex energy exchange hosts flagship contracts including US crude, natural gas and heating oil futures. Its ClearPort platform processes swaps derivatives, largely in energy, for backing by the exchange clearinghouse.CME acquired Nymex in August 2008.The CME ClearPort desk is responsible for facilitating customer transactions reported for clearing.The Securities and Exchange Commission sued NYSE Euronext last year for giving customer flow information to some clients over others. NYSE paid a $5m penalty, the first time in its history, to settle, without admitting or denying wrongdoing.In November 2012, CME sued the CFTC in a rare legal move as it sought the right to bundle trade reporting for swaps with other services, calling a pending commission rule “arbitrary and capricious.”The exchange operator withdrew the suit after CFTC dropped its insistence that swaps traders be given a choice of venues to report their transactions.Additional reporting from Gregory Meyer
331;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-02-10T20:01:24Z;CME to push clearing rate swaps in London;;The US is to make a concerted push into European derivatives with CME Group, the world’s largest futures market operator, set to begin clearing off-exchange swaps in coming weeks.The Chicago-based group has won approval from UK regulators to clear interest rate swaps, the world’s largest asset class traded by notional value over-the-counter. The new service, operated from London, is expected to be running by April.Clearance from the Financial Services Authority will pitch the world’s second largest exchange by market value into battle with the incumbent LCH.Clearnet, a clearing house being bought by the London Stock Exchange, and an emerging rival service run by Deutsche Börse, Europe’s largest markets operator.At stake is a slice of the $640tn OTC derivatives market, which countries from the G20 have pledged to overhaul in order to safeguard financial markets. Authorities want more of the market processed through clearing houses, which stand between two parties in a deal and guarantee the deal in the event of a default. US and European regulators are expected to set out the rules and deadlines for mandatory clearing in coming months.Bourses have been eyeing the market as it allows them to make a profit from managing the risk from open-ended contracts, opening the door for new entrants such as CME.An interest rate swap is a derivative contract that enables two trading firms to swap a fixed rate of cash flow for a floating or variable rate and accounts for around $500tn, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements.The imminent arrival of the service underlines how regulations are overhauling the clearing market. To secure its future and help it meet tougher rules around regulatory capital, LCH.Clearnet is planning to sell a controlling stake to the LSE. The deal is awaiting regulatory approval from UK and Dutch authorities. SGX, the Singapore exchange, is also in talks with the two parties about taking a stake in LCH.“Now we have FSA approval, we expect to begin clearing interest rate swaps by the end of the first quarter,” William Knottenbelt, managing director of the group’s Europe, Middle East and Africa business, told the Financial Times.CME’s US clearing business has cleared around $1.4tn of interest rate swaps to date, with around $820bn of contracts currently open. However, it lags behind LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear service, which has cleared around $18tn and has around $4tn of contracts on open interest. The CME is setting up in Europe as some clients were concerned that some operators “have no knowledge of US law”, said Mr Knottenbelt.Last week Eurex signed up its first hedge fund and first independent asset management firms to its new service, EurexOTC Clear.
332;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:23:53+0000;Weak trading activity hits CME earnings;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, said it was hopeful for a boost in trading activity in 2013 after low volumes hit earnings last year.“We remain cautiously optimistic about the trading environment,” said Phupinder Gill, chief executive, as the company announced fourth-quarter earnings.Lower trading activity took its toll on exchange operators and the wider securities industry last year, leaving companies searching for new sources of revenue.New clearing mandates that are part of Dodd-Frank legislation that was passed in response to the financial crisis may benefit CME, which is one of the biggest global clearing houses, Mr Gill said on an analyst call.The mandates, while will be phased in from March, will move more of the vast over-the-counter derivatives market on to exchanges and through clearing houses similar to CME’s.In the fourth quarter, CME reported earnings of $166.8m, or 50 cents a share, compared with a split-adjusted $746.7m, or $2.25 per share, during the same period last year. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were inflated by a $377m tax benefit. Last May, the company announced a 5-for-1 stock split.Wall Street analysts had expected fourth-quarter earnings of 63 cents per share. Revenues in the quarter fell 11 per cent year on year to $660.9m, against analysts’ expectations of $660.1m.“Despite facing a difficult environment with low volatility in 2012, we made significant progress in advancing our global strategy while preparing for the changing regulatory landscape,” said Terry Duffy, executive chairman, in a statement accompanying the results.Average daily contract volume in the three months to December fell roughly 13 per cent to 10.2m compared with the same period a year ago. For the full year, volumes fell 15 per cent to 11.4m.Last month Mr Duffy told the Financial Times that any increase in volumes this year would depend on whether “we stop trading government fundamentals and start trading corporate fundamentals”.“I don’t think we’ve been able to do that for a number of years because of the euro crisis, the US debt crisis, the debt ceiling and the fiscal cliff,” Mr Duffy said.He said CME’s recent acquisitions, including the Kansas City Board of Trade, meant the company remained competitive in the face of IntercontinentalExchange’s $8.2bn acquisition of NYSE Euronext, which is awaiting regulatory approval. He said he was unsure if that deal would spur further consolidation in 2013.People familiar with the situation said the CME had expressed interest in parts of NYSE’s derivatives business, before NYSE agreed to ICE’s bid.On Monday, the CME said it would move wheat futures pits to Chicago from Kansas City, ending 157 years of floor trading there.At the end of the fourth quarter, CME paid an annual variable dividend of $1.30. The timing was advanced in order to avoid any possible tax increases on dividends.CME reported full-year diluted earnings of $2.71 per share on revenues of $2.91bn, against $5.43 per share on $3.28bn in revenues during 2011.Its shares fell nearly 2 per cent to $58 in after-market trading.
333;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-02-05T12:26:10Z;Exchange groups ramp up cost cutting;;Two of the world’s largest exchange groups have stepped up cost cutting in a sign of the pressure on bourses from low trading volumes.NYSE Euronext, the transatlantic exchanges operator, said on Tuesday it would cut more costs ahead of its planned $8.2bn sale to US rival IntercontinentalExchange, slated for this year. It said an extensive cost reduction programme was far ahead of targets, with $115m last year compared with a forecast of $63m.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE, said: “The lacklustre trading environment continues to impact our results.” He said it was too soon to tell if a pick-up in trading for US equities in January, which has been accompanied by inflows into mutual funds, would continue.“While one month doesn’t make a trend, we’re hopeful that this is an indicator of the re-emergence of the retail investor and the resurgence of interest in the US equity markets,” he said.Deutsche Börse, whose planned merger with NYSE was blocked by the EU last year, said preliminary annual net revenues fell 9 per cent to €1.9bn and outlined plans to reduce costs by €70m annually through voluntary redundancies and other cuts.The steps would help it grow in Asia and other emerging markets, Deutsche Börse said.The results come as the US exchange prepares to take a planned deal with US rival ICE, predominantly a commodity and derivatives exchange, to antitrust authorities in the US and Europe.The cash-and-shares deal, in which the 12-year-old ICE will purchase the 220-year-old owner of the New York Stock Exchange, will create a rival to CME Group and Deutsche Börse as one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges by contracts traded.NYSE said revenues for the three months to December 2012 fell 11 per cent to $562m while net income for the period fell from $110m to $28m year on year as it took charges for writing off investments in its European clearing house, unwinding its stake in BlueNext, the carbon-trading exchange, and other merger expenses.“Our fourth-quarter results reflect both the beneficial actions we took to refinance our debt and rationalise our clearing plans for Liffe in connection with the announced move to ICE Clear,” said Mr Niederauer.Alongside the ICE deal in December, NYSE agreed to move clearing of contracts traded on its Liffe derivatives exchange to ICE’s London-based clearing house, rather than build its own operations.The move will allow NYSE to compete for business as new rules around derivatives markets come into force over the next 18 months. Bourses are looking to exploit a push by global regulators to move more of the vast over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market on to exchanges and through clearing houses.Exchanges will be able to earn profits from managing the risk on open-ended derivatives contracts. NYSE was planning to spend $20m on its European clearing operations last year.Deutsche Börse said operating costs would rise overall because of greater investment. It said most of the costs of the efficiency measures would be between €90m and €120m, with the majority of the total to be incurred this year.Trading volumes in the German group’s cash equities business fell 18 per cent last year while derivatives volumes were down 23 per cent. Deutsche Börse said adjusted net income would be €660m, compared with €833m last year.Shares in NYSE rose 0.4 per cent to $35.01 in New York. Deutsche Börse gained 0.6 per cent to €48.26 in Frankfurt.
334;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-02-04T20:48:01Z;CME severs wheat ties with Kansas City;;CME Group has announced it will move wheat futures pits to Chicago from Kansas City, Missouri, ending 157 years of floor trading in a city that over the decades was a centre of agricultural markets.The move follows the exchange group’s acquisition of the Kansas City Board of Trade, the historic home of futures and options on hard red winter wheat. Open-outcry trading on the bread ingredient will shift to CME’s Chicago trading floor on July 1.Kansas City, a riverside town near the heart of a Great Plains wheat region, has long played an important role in trading the commodity. Merchants founded its board of trade in 1856.Traders said Kansas City’s floor had been moribund for years after most flocked to an electronic trading platform owned by CME. The majority of options on hard red winter wheat were still handled on the Kansas City floor, however.CME is the latest futures exchange to close or consolidate futures pits, once thronged by brokers and market-makers yelling orders in colourful jackets, as technology changes the face of trading.IntercontinentalExchange last year closed the floor of its New York soft commodities exchange after finding success listing options on its screens.CME merged its floor with the Chicago Board of Trade after acquiring the bourse in 2007.When CME agreed its acquisition of the Kansas City exchange for $126m in cash last year, it committed to keep the floor open for six months.“When the announcement came down, we looked at it as the beginning for the end for the floor. The floor guys down there have been a dying breed,” said Jason Britt, president of Central States Commodities, a futures broker based in Kansas City.For the Kansas City exchange’s 192 equity members, the purchase price represented a 37 per cent premium to the last recorded seat price of $480,000 but below peak prices of late 2007, according to exchange data.CME already lists benchmark futures on lower-protein soft red winter wheat.“Throughout the integration process, we’ve remained focused on our customers who manage global price risk associated with these two classes of wheat,” Bryan Durkin, CME’s chief operating officer, said.“By moving Kansas City wheat to the Chicago floor later this year, we will make it as efficient as possible for our customers to trade both products and the spread between the two.”The Kansas City exchange sale leaves the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, home of hard red spring wheat, as the last independent US grain exchange.
335;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;The OTC data conundrum;;One of the tenets of the G20 agreement in Pittsburgh in 2009, which is overhauling financial markets, is the development of trade repositories. This in turn raises the intriguing question of what becomes of all the data that will be generated by their introduction.These repositories will create a map of information for off-exchange derivatives trades around the world, allowing regulators to monitor trends in interest rates swaps, credit default swaps and currency swaps. Lack of information about the use of credit-based products in over-the-counter markets was blamed as one of the factors that led to the financial crisis.Companies such as CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation have regulatory approval in the US. Similar repositories are either planned or in the process of being established elsewhere, including Europe and Asia. The companies say that setting them up is a natural extension of the post-trade services, such as clearing, that they already perform for clients.Most of the concern to date has, rightly, centred on the potential fragmentation of the repositories around the world, which could make it harder for regulators and the industry to find an aggregated picture.But another interesting issue is the commercial potential of this data gold mine. After all, two of the exchanges that are building out trade repositories, CME and ICE, are for-profit companies with obligations to shareholders.We are only in the early stages of finding out how this trade-off between “public good” provision of sensitive data and its collection by a commercially minded business will play out.One example of how it might work is the UK’s Regulatory News Service. It distributes material corporate information – as mandated by law – on UK listed companies, such as earnings results, profits warnings and executive appointments, and is owned by the London Stock Exchange.Known to all as RNS, it is available free of charge on a variety of websites such as Investegate and the LSE site in real-time. As my colleague Bryce Elder on Alphaville documented this week, any threat to this free access is usually greeted with concern.Market insight: Instant market news and commentaryThe LSE is conducting a consultation into RNS. The areas it is studying include the number of professional consumers of RNS information, service levels, fee structures, regulation and product development. The results were due last summer but discussions with market participants are ongoing.There are fears about where the consultation is going. Bloomberg reported last May of user concerns that the LSE will start charging them to receive statements. Others ask why the LSE is trying to form a better profile of its users. After all, this is the world of web 2.0, they say. If you’re not paying for the content, you’re the product.We await the outcome of the consultation but the example of RNS throws up two points.First of all, it is not widely realised but competition to RNS was mandated to the provision of corporate news a decade ago. That also, in theory, broke up the market for critical market-moving information as the LSE began to compete with rivals such as Business Wire and PR Newswire.A decade on and it’s clear that fragmentation fears have been overblown. The market has a preference for one provider – RNS accounts for 70 per cent of regulatory announcements – but can live with a few others.The second point is that one of the spin-offs of this fragmentation was that it allowed the LSE and others to charge for distributing the news, even though the data are free to end users. So far that balance between users and corporate providers of the data seems equitable.The outcome of the LSE consultation, should there be any changes, may provide others with food for thought. To date, operators of trade repositories have said little about future developments, preoccupied with just getting them operational and approved by regulators. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation thinks data should not be a commercial entity. Both CME and ICE say any fees or charges will be equitable, uniform and non-discriminatory.The past few years have seen Facebook, LinkedIn and other web 2.0 companies redefining what can be done with data. Even supermarkets, with their brand loyalty cards, understand how to exploit consumer data and sell it back to us, in the form of targeted offers.But a word of warning to those optimistic that financial markets data may also provide a serious commercial opportunity. As even Facebook has repeatedly discovered, providers of your content tend to push back forcefully if you try to exploit them too much.
336;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;NYSE deal drew interest from Buffett;;Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and the CME Group each considered bids for parts of NYSE Euronext shortly before it agreed to be sold to IntercontinentalExchange for $8.2bn last year, according to people familiar with the matter.Berkshire made an “indicative proposal” of interest in NYSE after it was approached by Perella Weinberg, the investment bank advising NYSE Euronext on a sale. However Berkshire’s proposal was lower than a bid already offered by ICE, and was conditioned on due diligence and the sale of NYSE’s European derivatives business for a minimum unspecified price.Details of the late November talks were revealed in a proxy statement filed on Monday, which said that Perella Weinberg approached “a large industrial and financial holding company” about purchasing NYSE – Berkshire, according to a person familiar with the deal.The proxy also said that a “large US-based derivatives exchange” had expressed interest in parts of NYSE’s derivatives business, known as Liffe. That exchange was the CME, people familiar with the deal said.NYSE, ICE, CME and Berkshire declined to comment. News of Berkshire’s interest was first reported by CNBC.Separately, ICE now plans to ask the EU to review its plan to purchase NYSE to speed up the deal and prevent it from being bogged down in examinations by 16 regional jurisdictions.ICE said on Monday in a US regulatory filing that in normal circumstances, the merger would go before authorities in 25 areas, including the UK, Portugal, the Netherlands and Spain.Its decision to go before European authorities reflects ICE’s desire to close the deal rapidly as new rules around derivatives markets come into effect later this year in the US.Global regulators want more off-exchange trading business to go on to electronic trading venues, with deals processed through clearing houses, in order to safeguard the financial system.US rules, under the US Dodd-Frank act, are set to come into force during the year. Similar rules in Europe are due in the next 18 months.Exchanges such as ICE, NYSE Euronext, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse want to exploit the policy in their long-term growth strategies.The filing also revealed net debt of the combined group would be $5.3bn, slightly more than originally forecast.ICE is also considering floating a collection of Euronext assets that includes the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Brussels. Analysts have estimated the business could be worth between $1.5bn-$2bn.While the deal involves two US-based exchanges, ICE could take control over four European stock exchanges and London-based Liffe, Europe’s second-largest derivatives bourse. The latter is a key part of ICE’s long-term growth plans, as it bids to expand into interest rates derivatives trading.However, the European Commission has the power to review larger cross-border deals, in much the same way it ruled over Deutsche Börse’s ill-fated bid to merge with NYSE Euronext a year ago.The European Commission has 25 working days to make a decision once the two parties have lodged their application. It also has the option to open a deeper, formal investigation which must be completed in 90 working days. ICE and NYSE expect to formally submit a notification form in the first half of this year.Morgan Stanley and Perella Weinberg, advisers to ICE and NYSE respectively, were each paid $3m when the deal was announced. Both advisers stand to earn about $18.5m-$19m if the deal completes.The filing also revealed that ICE had initially approached NYSE in mid-October with a bid predominantly composed of shares that implied an offer of $29.25 per share. The two parties finally agreed on a cash and shares deal that valued NYSE at $33.12 per share.
337;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;CME surveys grain traders on hours;;The biggest US futures exchange opened the door to shorter grain trading sessions amid discontent from some of the most important names in agribusiness.CME Group, which lists benchmark corn, soyabean and wheat contracts on its Chicago Board of Trade platform, on Tuesday began formally surveying producers and other traders to gauge views on near round-the-clock grain trading hours begun last year.In May the exchange operator lengthened its grain trading day to 21 hours from 17 after rival IntercontinentalExchange launched lookalike grain futures that tracked price moves in Chicago. The all-electronic ICE upset the established rhythms of agricultural markets by enabling trading 22 hours per day.The changes meant market-moving statistics from the US Department of Agriculture were now published in the middle of the trading session. The department this month started releasing the reports at noon instead of 8.30am Eastern time to hit markets when they were most active.The longer trading hours also drew fire from companies whose hedging forms the backbone of the futures market. An official at Louis Dreyfus Commodities told USDA that the release of crop statistics amid trading hours resulted in “extreme market volatility”.Alberto Weisser, chief executive of Bunge, told Reuters last year that 21-hour trading was “too much”.“We’ve received significant customer feedback about the extended hours we implemented for CBOT grains last summer,” said Tim Andriesen, CME managing director of agricultural commodities and alternative investments. “As we start a new year, we think the timing is right to review those changes and industry feedback more formally to ensure we’re continually meeting our customers’ needs.”The threat from ICE appears to have receded. The exchange had 799 open corn futures contracts last week. More than 1m such contracts are open on CME.“We’ve been consistent in the past that the decision to expand hours was for competitive reasons, and that we would retain those hours as long as we needed to from a competitive standpoint. We do take customer feedback seriously,” CME said.CME said it would speak to traders through conversations, focus groups and an online survey open through January 31.The National Grain and Feed Association, a group of US grain handlers that previously sought a one-hour pause in trading around USDA report release times, said it looked forward to giving feedback.The CME announcement comes a week ahead of the annual meeting of the Commodity Markets Council, whose members include many of the largest physical commodities trading houses as well as CME and ICE.
338;CME;CME Group Inc;2013-01-17T19:13:03Z;CME derivatives land grab sparks anger;;CME Group is facing the wrath of leading financial groups in a dispute over US derivatives rules, which has pitted Wall Street against Chicago.At stake is whether the Chicago-based global exchange operator can bypass industry-owned utilities, such as Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, and bundle services for clients that clear swaps via CME.Across Wall Street, many have long feared that financial reform of over-the-counter derivatives trading in 2010 would ultimately open the door to CME, which dominates US listed derivatives futures. With regulators set to finalise rules this year governing how swaps will trade under Dodd Frank, the strong riposte from the DTCC is a signal of industry concern that the CME is set to emerge as the big winner, with OTC derivatives shifting towards the exchange.“The CME is fully cognisant of the opportunity in OTC swaps and it has been a strategic matter of timing before making their push,” said Will Rhode, of Tabb Group. “They are now ramping up to secure every part of the trade process as they feel rulemaking has reached an inflection point.”The dispute is over data reporting requirements on cleared swaps, or derivatives in which a third party steps in to a bilateral transaction to assume the risk from each.CME wants to require counterparties that clear swaps on its platform to report transaction data to its own data warehouse. DTCC, as the leading swaps data warehouse, objects to CME’s plans.It has generated litigation threats from DTCC and letters to regulators from Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Moore Capital Management, which all oppose CME’s plans and accuse it of not acting in the public interest.The CME has a consortium of energy companies and firms that trade commodity swaps on its side. They say CME’s proposal will lead to lower costs.“When we clear a swap, we have that data,” said Tim Elliott, CME executive director. “It is the most efficient way for the CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] to get access to it.”The DTCC and its allies – some of which own the co-operative – say the CME is engaging in anti-competitive behaviour, limiting choice, and will eventually increase systemic risk if swap data becomes fragmented across several data warehouses. The US CFTC is due to decide the dispute, one of many rules that it hopes to finalise this year.Regulators at the CFTC and other US agencies have argued for the need to have as few swap data warehouses as possible. The fewer the data sources, the easier it is to examine the industry. But they are mindful that anti-competitive practices could take hold as a result.During the early process of fleshing out rules for Dodd Frank, the CME maintained it was going to focus on clearing swaps and not compete more aggressively with Wall Street.That changed when the CME launched a swap futures contract last December and sought to set up a swap repository in competition with the DTCC.
339;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-12-21T16:13:00Z;ICE sets $750m break fee on NYSE deal;;IntercontinentalExchange has agreed to pay NYSE Euronext a $750m break fee in the event the US derivatives market operator fails to gain antitrust approval for its $8.2bn takeover of the owner of the New York Stock Exchange.The two groups have also set out fees of $450m payable to the other party if one board were to change their recommendation in favour of the deal, a regulatory filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday showed.Both will pay a $300m break fee if they were to abandon the deal in favour of another proposal while, either ICE or NYSE will pay $100m if the other’s shareholders fail to approve the deal.The high break fees further underscore the difficulties rival exchanges would face in breaking up the deal as they digest the plan unveiled this week by ICE, founded 12 years ago, to acquire NYSE, its totemic 208-year-old rival. Neither ICE nor NYSE expect to meet significant opposition from competition watchdogs, arguing they compete in different asset classes in the market.In the most recent comparable exchange deal, NYSE agreed a break fee of $340m (€250m) with Deutsche Börse in their merger terms.Analysts expect few parties would have the financial capacity to challenge the deal. The purchase price, amounting to $33.12 per NYSE share in a mixture of cash and shares, was a 38 per cent premium to its closing share price on Thursday.Peter Lenardos, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that in tough markets the valuation of NYSE at 14.5 times next year’s consensus earnings forecast was “quite a high price for ICE to pay to gain meaningful access to European derivatives”.“However, we acknowledge that with regard to historical transaction multiples, the deal appears reasonably priced,” he said.The takeover also underlines how derivatives trading has become a global business since the financial crisis as investors turn to assets that can hedge risk.ICE would become the third-largest derivatives market operator in the world by the volume of contracts traded, allowing it to compete on a more even footing against Deutsche Börse and CME Group, the US-based market leader.Derivatives are highly lucrative for exchanges. That is in part because bourses are able to carve out dominant niches in a diverse market but they can also charge costs for offsetting the risk against open-ended contracts through clearing.Profits in equities trading, by contrast, are low-margin as fierce competition, underpinned by high-speed technology, has eroded exchanges’ market share.However Jeff Sprecher, founder and chief executive of ICE, has committed to keeping the US equities business of NYSE. The European equities businesses, which include Amsterdam, Paris, Lisbon and Brussels, may be spun off.The filing also revealed the corporate code words for the project. ICE was the “Braves” and NYSE the “Yankees” – references to the baseball teams of the bourses’ home cities, Atlanta and New York respectively.
340;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-12-20T20:18:05Z;ICE chief makes biggest bet with NY deal;;In the past decade Jeff Sprecher and IntercontinentalExchange have been the exchange industry’s upstarts.An ultimately ill-fated attempt to buy the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 was launched when Mr Sprecher delivered his bid during the industry’s big annual conference, slipping his offer under the hotel door of the CBOT chairman.As the ICE chief executive acknowledged on Thursday: “I like competing and I like competing against incumbents, and I like going into markets and seeing where we can effect change.”Indeed Mr Sprecher has emerged as a central force in turning what was once a sleepy sector into one of the liveliest areas of mergers and acquisitions in the past decade. From start-up in 2000, Mr Sprecher has built up ICE through a series of deals into energy and commodities trading exchange valued at $9bn.Now the ambitious, relentlessly positive Mr Sprecher has taken his most ambitious shot yet: buying NYSE Euronext, owner of the totemic New York Stock Exchange, to see if he can effect change there.Analysts estimate that the combined group will have a market capitalisation of $15bn. That suggests Mr Sprecher’s business is moving closer to reaching the dominant global exchange operator, CME Group, which has a market value of about $17bn.The acquisition of the US equities business marks a departure for ICE because it has never had an interest in share trading before. Indeed, Mr Sprecher stressed that his real interest lay in NYSE Euronext’s futures business, in April 2011. At the time ICE had combined with Nasdaq OMX to try to break up an agreed but doomed merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse.NYSE Euronext itself has been built by mergers and acquisitions. Three European stock exchanges formed Euronext, which then bought the London-based Liffe derivatives exchange, before merging with NYSE in 2007.Among Mr Sprecher’s first tasks was to stress that ICE would be keeping the US equities business and its distinctive Wall Street building. “It is a tremendous revenue and cash flow generator,” he said. “When you start to peel away parts of the onion, you see that they are a very healthy equities business that looked a lot more attractive than what we appreciated.”One adviser on the deal said: “While equities trading is low margin, the listings business and data are very high margin. Everyone wants to list on NYSE and the listings throw off a lot of cash.”But it is far from a full conversion to equities. At the same time NYSE and ICE signalled they planned to spin off the European equities, options and indices businesses via either a listing or a sale, should regulators allow. “We want to expose what a good solid company Euronext is if organised properly,” said Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext.NYSE’s technology businesses will be given only until the completion of the deal, expected in the second half of 2013, to prove themselves worthy of further investment.The merged company envisages an additional $300m of cost savings on top of the $150m Mr Niederauer has targeted in the next two years for NYSE Euronext.But the real prize for ICE is Liffe, the derivatives exchange, and the opportunity to expand into interest rate derivatives. That was the opportunity denied Mr Sprecher when he lost out to CME for CBOT in 2007. Interest rate derivatives are among the largest assets classes and used increasingly by investors to offset risk.The deal will make ICE the third-largest derivatives markets operator in the world by number of contracts traded and put pressure on CME, the market leader, and Deutsche Börse as proposed rules shake up the sector.Global regulators want to move more OTC derivatives trading on to transparent trading exchanges, and have more deals processed through clearing houses. Exchanges are aiming to grab market share from banks and brokers with a range of products that mimic traditional products such as swaps.However, volumes on both NYSE and ICE have fallen about 15 per cent this year on weak investor appetite for trading and flat global interest rates.“Despite the current low interest rate environment, this is an area Jeff has sought for over five years,” says Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill. “With the OTC Dodd-Frank regulatory transformation, this acquisition makes the competition between exchanges only more interesting.”Illustrating how fierce the competition has become, Morgan Stanley on Thursday agreed to buy a stake of US-based start-up Eris Exchange, which specialises in “swap futures”, which are expected to gain favour.
341;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-12-10T22:03:09Z;Fiscal cliff talks weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street stocks saw muted traded gains on Monday as fiscal cliff negotiations in Washington to prevent a possible economic recession continued to hang over US equities.The S&P 500 traded within a limited range before finishing roughly flat for the day at 1,418.55.The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.3 per cent to 2,986.96 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 13,169.88.Investor focus remained squarely on talks between Republicans and Democrats to resolve the pending expiration of tax cuts and mandatory spending cuts at the end of the year.News that President Barack Obama and Republican John Boehner met privately at the White House on Sunday to discuss the fiscal cliff provided a little relief.But investors said the incremental signs of progress did little to alleviate downward pressure on US equities. On Monday, many tried to assess the likelihood of a successful resolution as well as its possible effect on stocks.David Bianco, US equity strategist at Deutsche Bank, said: “Averting the cliff before Christmas will probably rally the S&P 500 to 1500 by year-end or early January, provided the 2013 fiscal drag does not exceed 1.5 per cent and is not mostly tax hikes.”However, some investors were less optimistic that politicians would resolve the host of budgetary issues.Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays, said: “In the near-term, we believe risks for both earnings and stocks are on the downside given the low probability of a grand bargain in the budget negotiations, [which would put] public sector debt on a sustainable path.”Shares in McDonald’s rose 1.1 per cent to $89.41 as the world’s largest fast-food restaurant chain by sales reported a stronger-than-expected increase in same-store sales for November.However, Andy Barish, analyst at Jefferies, said the results did little to ease the challenges McDonald’s faces next year, which included pressure on its gross margins.Financial sector stocks fell 0.3 per cent on the day ahead of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting set to kick off on Tuesday.JPMorgan Chase shares fell 0.6 per cent to $42.31 while Goldman Sachs added 0.4 per cent to $117.01.American International Group shares were down 2.3 per cent to $33.36 as the US insurance group said it would sell a majority stake in its plane-leasing unit, ILFC, for $4.23bn.Shares in Marathon Oil lost 1.8 per cent to $30.36 as its chief operating officer, who some analysts had expected was in line for the top job at the upstream oil company, resigned unexpectedly.Apple continued its recent struggles as the iPhone and iPad maker saw its market capitalisation fall back below $500bn.Shares in the world’s largest company by market value declined 0.6 per cent to $529.82.The losses weighed initially on the information tech sector, which slipped as much as 0.8 per cent. But stocks in the sector rebounded and were trading in positive territory on strong gains by chipmakers Micron Technology and Nvidia Corp.Shares in Micron were 3.7 per cent higher to $6.67 while Nvidia rose 3.4 per cent to $12.36.Groupon, the daily deals company, lost 9.3 per cent to $4.25, as it gave back some of its gains from Friday when its shares rose by nearly $1 on takeover rumours.CME Group, the futures exchange operator, declined 1.6 per cent to $54.05 after analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded their rating on its shares from “buy” to “sell”.“Although we view CME as the leading global futures exchange, with resilient margins and a powerful capital deployment strategy, we believe the [market consensus] is too optimistic on CME’s near-term earnings per share outlook given the most recent volume and open interest trends,” the Goldman report said.
342;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-12-06T21:54:26Z;Apple rises in volatile trading after dip;;Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalisation, rose in volatile trading after touching its lowest intraday level since March.Shares in the maker of the iPad and iPhone closed 1.4 per cent higher to $546.09 on heavy volume after having dropped to as low as $518.63 in early morning trading.The company’s market cap briefly dipped below $500bn for the first time in months as it initially extended losses a day after its worst single session decline in nearly four years.The company’s shares have fallen 22.2 per cent since reaching their all-time high in September of $702.10.Earlier in the morning, Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, revealed plans for the company to return some of its manufacturing to the US.Mr Cook said Apple would spend $100m next year to shift parts of its Mac computer manufacturing back to the US from China.The rebound in Apple’s fortunes helped to boost information technology stocks on the benchmark S&P 500, which were up 0.8 per cent.The broader US equity market was flat for most of the day before finishing near its highest point for the day. The S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher to 1,413.94.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.5 per cent to 2,989.27. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 13,074.04.CME Group, the futures exchange operator, became the latest company to declare a special dividend ahead of potential tax rises next year.Shares in the company rose 1.4 per cent to $55.03 as it declared a payout of $1.30 a share.Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said the size of the special dividend was roughly in line with expectations.Deutsche Bank’s US-listed shares fell 1.3 per cent to $45.49 after the Financial Times reported that former employees of the German bank said that it had concealed losses during the financial crisis to avoid a potential government bailout.Shares in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold continued to come under pressure after it announced plans to re-enter the oil exploration business and take over two companies in deals worth about $20bn.Freeport lost 4.2 per cent to $30.81.Energy sector stocks were 0.3 per cent higher even as benchmark crude prices declined more than 2 per cent on the day.ExxonMobil, the US oil major, reversed early losses to finish 0.3 per cent better to $88.Starbucks, the US coffee retailer, climbed 5.7 per cent to $53.17 a day after the company announced plans to expand its presence in the Americas.The company said on Thursday that it could see greater tax charges in the UK after criticism of its practices earlier in the year.Meanwhile, US wholesale retailer Costco was the biggest loser on the S&P 500. The company, which announced a $7-a-share special dividend last week, was 0.5 per cent lower at $98.47.Shares in Consolidated Edison were 0.1 per cent higher to $56.11 after Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York City, said the US electricity utility would spend $250m to upgrade its systems.The company was criticised by many residents along the US eastern seaboard after prolonged power outages following superstorm Sandy last month.Akamai Technologies, the IT cloud services company, rose 10 per cent to $39.06 as AT&T, the US telephone group, said it had decided to form a partnership with the company instead of competing with it on content delivery. AT&T shares declined 0.8 per cent to $33.65.Vera Bradley, the US women’s designer company, dropped 11.7 per cent to $23.14 as it lowered its full-year sales outlook.
343;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-12-05T22:53:00Z;S&P warns over outlook for exchanges;;The credit outlook for exchanges and clearing houses was turning negative as the industry faced another year of declining revenues from trading and high fixed costs, Standard & Poor’s has warned.The credit rating agency on Wednesday forecast the global drop in volumes that has depressed the results of the world’s equity and derivatives bourses would extend into 2013.That will pressure profitability and operating cash flows for an industry faced with higher capital requirements for clearing houses as mandatory clearing for over-the-counter derivatives comes into effect, it found.The downbeat outlook comes after a year in which the industry has had to adjust to a 20-30 per cent year-on-year decline in trading volumes. Many have reorganised internally, shedding senior and middle-management jobs.“In our view, financial institutions’ cost-cutting can only go so far without jeopardising operations and can only partially offset higher regulatory costs, especially at systemically important central counterparties,” S&P warned.“Therefore we expect a pick-up in mergers and acquisitions activity if the trend in falling volumes does not turn around in the next year or two.”Bourses such as CME Group, the London Stock Exchange, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX have been diversifying into other businesses, such as indices compilation and technology sales.However, analysts Charles Rauch and Giles Edwards pointed out that exchanges would still exhibit a high degree of operating leverage. “Every additional dollar of trading fees flows directly to the bottom line because the marginal cost to execute a trade is close to zero,” they said.They also warned the industry push into derivatives clearing – seen by many as a potentially large market – could be undermined by new regulations for clearing house stability and ongoing costs investing in infrastructure.Standard & Poor’s estimated the industry had $11.8bn of outstanding debt, with $2.2bn due in 2013. Refinancing or refunding near-term debt maturities could help offset their potentially weaker operating results.Of the 17 exchanges and clearing houses it rates, two-thirds has double A or A ratings while eight had negative outlooks or ratings on CreditWatch negative. The other nine had “stable” outlooks, indicating the agency saw little change in their outlook over the next 18-24 months.
344;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-12-03T17:24:42Z;CME investigates former Goldman trader;;Glenn Hadden, the well-known US Treasuries trader who was hired last year to head Morgan Stanley’s interest rates business, is being investigated by regulators at the CME Group over trades he made while at Goldman Sachs.The CME is looking into Treasury futures orders “placed on the expiration date in December 2008”, according to a report by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Morgan Stanley declined to comment beyond confirming that Mr Hadden is still in his current position.Mr Hadden joined Morgan Stanley in early 2011. He was formerly head of government bond trading at Goldman Sachs, where he was a partner.A person familiar with the CME’s investigation said both Morgan Stanley and Goldman only learnt of the matter in recent months. However, Goldman put Mr Hadden on paid leave for about a year in 2009 after receiving a separate complaint regarding his Treasuries trading from another regulator, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Mr Hadden is known for his bold trades and Morgan Stanley had been seeking to boost the reputation and market share of its fixed income business back in 2010, when Goldman told its workers Mr Hadden was leaving the firm.However, those big bets have sometimes backfired. Last year, Morgan Stanley lost tens of millions of dollars after Mr Hadden’s interest rate group made a wrong-way bet on US inflation expectations.At Morgan Stanley, Mr Hadden has also taken on ambassadorial roles including acting as a judge in the investment bank’s annual prize for excellence in financial markets.It’s not the first time Morgan Stanley has hired a trader from Goldman who later became enmeshed in regulatory investigations. Matthew Marshall Taylor was last month accused by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of defrauding Goldman of $118m and concealing a futures position worth more than $8bn.A lawyer for Mr Taylor told Reuters in a statement: “Matt Taylor is disappointed the CFTC filed a complaint about trades in a Goldman proprietary account which took place five years ago . . . He strenuously denies all of the allegations.” He reportedly left Morgan Stanley in July.Mr Hadden’s lawyer, James Benjamin of Akin Gump, said: “The CME matter concerns technical risk-management activity in a one-minute period four years ago during which Mr Hadden acted properly and followed established market practice. There is no legal or factual basis for any suggestion of market manipulation.”The CME investigation into Mr Hadden was first reported by the New York Times.A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The CME declined to comment.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer
345;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-11-29T21:45:53Z;CME withdraws CFTC swaps lawsuit;;CME Group has withdrawn its lawsuit against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, after the regulator dropped its insistence that swaps traders be given a choice of venues to report their transactions.The lawsuit, filed earlier this month, had threatened to delay or disrupt new transparency rules introduced as part of the Dodd-Frank legislation that regulates the $650tn swaps industry for the first time.The law demands that all trades must be reported to a registered “swap data repository”, or SDR, so that regulators can keep tabs on the system as a whole and monitor any risks building within it.CME Group, which operates one of the largest swaps clearing houses, is one of three firms approved to operate an SDR. It had demanded the right to bundle trade reporting with other services to its clients, and it sued the CFTC over what it called “arbitrary and capricious” rules which said it couldn’t.CFTC staff said late on Wednesday that they were withdrawing their guidance banning bundling of data reporting with other services so that the full commission could debate the issue. Sources say that the commission is set to grant CME Group the permissions it wants.Staff believe that obtaining the data are sufficient to satisfy the demands of the Dodd-Frank laws, leaving room for different business models among the players collecting the data.CME Group’s lawsuit sought a judicial review of the rules, accusing the regulator of exceeding its authority and failing to properly weigh the costs against the benefits of its actions. It is only the third time in the CFTC’s history that it has been sued by an industry participant.Announcing its decision to drop the suit, the company said it still believed SDRs duplicate the data collection that CME Group already does as a clearing house, and it urged the CFTC to reconsider the rules in their entirety.The CFTC’s climbdown provoked a furious reaction from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which runs a rival SDR and which had previous argued successfully that swaps traders should be given a choice of reporting options.In a statement, it said: “The industry has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to be fully prepared to meet reporting obligations that will become effective in one month. This action will cause market participants to question the finality of any commission rule or interpretation.”
346;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-11-17T02:53:47Z;CME Group veteran to head Index Industry Association;Rick Redding is appointed as the first executive director of the trade body;Rick Redding has been appointed as the first executive director of the Index Industry Association (IIA), the trade body set up this year by leading index providers to promote best practice standards.Mr Redding spent most of his career with the CME Group, the exchange operator, where he held the post of managing director, products and services at CME.He has a wealth of experience in the indexing industry and played an integral part in the creation of S&P Dow Jones Indices, the indexing joint venture that was created last year by CME and McGraw-Hill, the parent company of S&P.“I am looking forward to working with the industry and the relevant regulatory bodies to promote practices that will benefit investors,” says Mr Redding.The IIA’s membership has now expanded to six providers. Russell Investments has just joined the association, following in the footsteps of Barclays and Nasdaq OMX which became members in June. The IIA was set up in March 2012 by FTSE, MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices.Ron Bundy, chief executive of Russell Indexes, says Russell has joined the IIA to help investors develop a better understanding of the role of indices and to participate in establishing standards across the industry.Mark Makepeace, chief executive of FTSE and chair of the IIA, says: “Building an independent association is key to maintaining the health and high standards of the index industry.”
347;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-11-17T02:53:47Z;Strategic alliances change face of industry;Index providers risk conflicts of interest;Index providers and stock exchange operators are forging new alliances as the fortunes of these two sectors become more intertwined and the influence of index-linked instruments and investment vehicles grows.Exchange traded funds accounted for almost one-fifth of US equity trading last year, illustrating the vital role that index-linked investment vehicles now play in the activities of exchange operators.But indices also provide the basis for thousands of derivative contracts, which are increasingly being traded on-exchange rather than in private bilateral over-the-counter deals.So exchange operators view indexing businesses as strategic partners that can bring a new growth dynamic to their existing operations – a trend that is illustrated by three deals.In October, Nasdaq OMX group bought the Mergent family of dividend indices. This deal further expanded Nasdaq’s indexing business, which has grown to include a family of US equity indices, shares, commodity, green and fixed-income indices.Alan Price, sales director at Indxis, the index service provider which is part of Mergent, says alliances with index providers allow exchange operators to offer a fuller range of services beyond trading and listings.“Exchange operators’ revenues from trading and listings have been under pressure, but deals with index providers can bolster their earnings by fostering stronger relationships with ETF providers, market makers and traders,” says Mr Price.Last year, the London Stock Exchange acquired control of the FTSE International index business from Pearson, the education and information group that owns the Financial Times.David Lester, group director of corporate strategy at London Stock Exchange Group, says exchange operators are looking for growth and ways to diversify their income streams.FTSE’s business has been enjoying double-digit revenue growth since its formation in 1995. Mr Lester says that taking full control of FTSE will help the LSE to deepen its relationships with asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard and Fidelity.Buying FTSE is also a key component of LSE Group’s derivatives strategy. “ FTSE’s indexing business with over 200,000 indices from over 80 countries brings a wealth of intellectual property to LSE Group. This will allow us to develop a range of products for customers that can be traded and hedged as derivatives on our trading platforms,” says Mr Lester.That deal followed an agreement in 2011 between the exchange operator CME Group and McGraw-Hill, the owner of S&P Indices, which united their indexing businesses in a joint venture, and brought the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index together in the same company.The deal is expected to result in big costs savings as the data processing, index calculation and technology platforms of both companies are unified.As part of that deal, S&P Dow Jones Indices will receive a share of the revenues that CME Group generates from activities on its trading platforms.S&P Dow Jones Indices has also said it plans to intensify its efforts to commercialise its indexing business, in part by exploring partnership opportunities with other exchanges.Critics have questioned whether or not end users will see any benefits as a result of this deal.But Alex Matturri, chief executive of S&P Dow Jones Indices, says the combined business will be able to launch new products more efficiently across a wider set of asset classes as it will have more resources for research and development, while customers will benefit from having one source for all their indexing needs.Deals between index providers and exchange operators have also prompted concerns that these intimate relationships could generate conflicts of interest that might affect end-users negatively.Mr Matturri says S&P Dow Jones Indices is a firm believer that any index that underlies an exchange- traded product should be calculated free and clear of that product, thus avoiding any potential conflict of interest between the product issuer and index provider.“It is a simple matter of appropriate and responsible market governance.”He emphasises that S&P Dow Jones Indices is not in the asset management business and does not trade on its own account so there is no incentive to interfere with the calculation of its own indices.Understanding the vested interests of the party creating an index is essential for regulators and investors, says Mr Matturri. He argues that conflicts of interest are more likely to arise for banks in the indexing business when they supply prices, calculate indices, design and build investment products based on their indices and then sell those products to investors.He says banks in the indexing business will have to rethink their business models, separating the index calculation function so that their customers know this has been calculated independently.Mr Matturri says he expects the indexing industry to look very different in the next five years with today’s big players becoming even larger and more separation between smaller, niche players.
348;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-11-15T01:41:31Z;CFTC proposes swaps position reports;;Traders would be able to track the scale of bets in off-exchange interest rate, credit, equity and commodity derivatives under a plan that has been unveiled by regulators.The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposes to introduce futures-style position data for previously opaque swaps in the latest sign of how new rules stand to transform the $650tn over-the-counter derivatives markets.The agency invited public comment on Wednesday on the new “swaps reports” which would offer a weekly snapshot of the size, risks and participants involved with swaps trading for the first time.Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, compared the proposed reports to so-called commitments of traders reports, which outline the long and short positions of broad categories of traders as well as open interest in exchange-listed futures markets.“For years, the public has benefited from the futures market data we have published in our commitment of traders reports. Our goal is to provide similar transparency to the public for the swaps market,” Mr Gensler said.The Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010 aimed to bring more transparency to privately negotiated derivatives markets. The near-collapse and $180bn bailout of AIG highlighted the dangers lurking in large but unaccounted-for derivatives positions.The new reports would include trading volumes and the notional dollar values of four swap markets: interest rate, credit, equity and commodities. The CFTC had already begun publishing commitments of traders reports on some energy swaps in 2010.The law demands that all swaps trades, whether centrally cleared or not, must be reported to a registered “swap data repository” so that regulators can keep tabs on the system as a whole and monitor any risks building within it.So far, two firms – the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, an industry-owned business that already provides traders with back office services for the clearing and settlement process, and IntercontinentalExchange – have been registered as SDRs.CFTC plans to base the reports on staff estimates and data from DTCC, the clearing house LCH.Clearnet and external sources such as the Bank for International Settlements.The CFTC is currently fighting a lawsuit over the transparency rules. Last week, CME Group, which operates a swaps clearing platform, accused the regulator of making “arbitrary and capricious” rules that force swaps traders to duplicate existing reporting requirements.The CME is refusing to pass trade data on to either of the SDRs, and instead has applied to become an SDR itself so that it can keep control of customer data. On Tuesday, the CFTC said it would not currently penalise CME for its refusal to comply.
349;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-11-13T12:23:42Z;Quick View: The US swaps dispute sideshow;;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission appears to have found a knight in shining armour, though the petty battle it faces is anything but heroic.The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation has ridden to the side of the US regulator, offering to help it defend a lawsuit filed last week by CME Group over the CFTC’s new rules on the reporting of swaps trades.The CME accused the regulator of promulgating “arbitrary and capricious” rules, of exceeding its authority and of failing to properly weigh the costs against the benefits of its actions. It is only the third time in the CFTC’s history that it has been sued by an industry participant.Except that the real target of the CME’s suit seems not to have been the CFTC but rather the DTCC and the real aim seems not to be saving the world from a capricious regulator so much as carving out as much market share as possible for the CME in the new world of swaps trading.The DTCC asked late on Monday to be allowed to join the case as an “intervenor”, or defendant, and to file an answer to the CME’s claims.It is to be hoped that the court, in the District of Columbia, allows the DTCC to intervene. It is only right that it take over some of the costs that would otherwise fall on the shoulders of the taxpayer-funded CFTC.At issue are the rules surrounding new “swap data repositories” (SDR) envisioned under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform laws, which are revamping the $650tn swaps industry. Instead of vast liabilities being traded between banks, with little oversight, the law mandates that the bulk of swaps must now be traded through central clearing houses and that there must be more transparency even around those that are not.One key plank demands that all swaps trades, whether centrally cleared or not, must be reported to a registered SDR so that regulators can keep tabs on the system as a whole and monitor any risks building within it.So far, only the DTCC, an industry-owned business that already provides traders with back office services for the clearing and settlement process, and a CME rival, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), have been registered as SDRs.The CME, which is a major clearing house for swaps, has always claimed that SDRs duplicate what it does already, namely accumulating trade data and making them available to the CFTC behind closed doors when asked. That data are a competitive advantage it has never wanted to give up.However, CME comprehensively lost that debate and the rules on SDRs have been in place for 10 months. Belatedly, the company registered to become an SDR itself, but it is now in a dispute with the CFTC about whether it can induce its clearing customers to use its in-house SDR over a rival’s – and DTCC has been stirring the pot in letters of objection to the regulator.With that dispute unresolved, the CME faced a November 13 deadline, after which it had to start sending data on its cleared swap trades to one of the two existing SDRs.The timing of the lawsuit seems designed to bounce the CFTC into agreeing looser terms that might enable the CME to bundle trade reporting with clearing and other services, in ways that may not promote strong competition. Alternatively, it could delay implementation long enough that the CME can revise its plans and catch up with the DTCC and ICE.The lawsuit demands an injunction and a judicial review. The rollout of new swaps rules – not just trade reporting, but registration of swaps dealers and mandates for electronic trading – got under way last month after long delays, but there are many rules still to be finalised and large questions over how to harmonise the new US regime with regulations in other countries.That is more than enough work for the CFTC to be getting on with, without getting caught up in a petty competitive dispute on matters that it settled months ago.Swaps users could do without the risk of additional postponements and confusion.
350;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-11-06T00:28:59Z;Storm delays CME’s new interest rate swap;;The CME has delayed the launch of a new interest rate swap contract that it hopes will lure traders looking for a cheaper alternative to traditional swaps.The Chicago-based exchange blamed the effects of superstorm Sandy for the three-week delay, saying that many potential users of the product were still recovering from disruption caused by the storm.Trading in the new deliverable interest rate swap futures contract was due to begin on November 13 with the market support of four major banks but has been put back to December 3, the CME said on Monday.“This move is designed to give our market participants additional time to prepare for the launch,” a spokesman said.The CME had been touting the margin benefits of using swap futures as an alternative to swaps, since major banks and investors face tighter capital standards and clearing fees for trading over-the-counter derivatives under the Dodd-Frank Act. Upon expiry, the swap futures will convert or be delivered into an OTC swap that would be cleared by the CME.It remains unclear how many users might want to actually take delivery of the physical swap instead of rolling over into a new futures contract, however, not least because accounting treatment and clearing rules are still to be finalised.“Clients are still not fully versed in the post-Dodd-Frank universe and they are looking for guidance from the banks,” said one market participant.Announcing the details of deliverable swap futures in September, the CME said it will list quarterly futures for the key benchmark maturities of two, five, 10 and 30 years. These are the most liquid maturities that are traded in the current OTC market and are expected to largely trade electronically once final rules for swap execution facilities are published later this year.While new futures contracts can often struggle to garner sufficient volume, the CME named Citi, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley to serve as market makers.
351;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-10-31T18:38:10Z;Nasdaq acquires Mergent indexing business;Evidence of growing competition among index providers;The Mergent family of dividend indices have been snapped up by Nasdaq OMX group in a deal that will further strengthen the exchange operator’s existing indexing business and provide it with greater exposure to the rapidly growing exchange traded funds industry.The deal also provides further evidence of the deepening relationship between exchange operators and index providers.Last year, the London Stock Exchange acquired control of the FTSE International index business from Pearson, the education and information group that owns the Financial Times.That deal followed an agreement between the exchange operator CME Group and McGraw-Hill, the owner of Standard & Poor’s, which united their indexing businesses in a joint venture, bring the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index together in the same company.Mergent is the creator of the dividend achievers indices which track companies with strong long-term dividend growth.These indices provide the benchmarks for some of the fastest growing ETFs, such as Vanguard’s VIG which has attracted just under $2bn in inflows so far this year.Invesco PowerShares, the fourth largest US ETF provider, also offers ETFs based on Mergent’s dividend indices.About $15bn in assets is currently benchmarked against Mergent’s dividend indices, mainly in ETFs, so they will provide a healthy income stream to Nasdaq OMX from licence fees.John Jacobs, executive vice-president, said the deal would mean that at Nasdaq OMX’s index business would become one of the largest providers of dividend-themed indices.“We see a growing need for indices to provide rules-based and transparent benchmarks for dividend and income themed investments,” said Mr Jacobs.Assets of ETFs licensed by Nasdaq OMX are expected to increase 30 per cent as a result of the acquisition.Mr Jacobs said the Mergent deal was the just latest step in the expansion of Nasdaq’s indexing business which has grown to include a family of US equity indices, a range of sharia indices, commodity and green indices and fixed income indices.“We recognise that the world of indexing is changing and there is room for more efficient and effective index providers,” said Mr Jacobs, adding that Nasdaq intended to apply some of the efficiencies of its exchange operating business in its indexing activities.Nasdaq recently launched a new data distribution system that allows its customers to analyse its indices more easily. It plans to launch a further 24,000 equity indices before the end of the year and to offer a new global equity index calculator to clients.Mr Jacobs emphasised that as well as offering technological improvements and more efficient data distribution, Nasdaq intends to compete aggressively on cost against rival index providers.“Index providers are in competition with each other. Indexing costs matters if you are an ETF manager and we believe that we can produce our indices better, faster and cheaper than anyone else in the industry,” said Mr Jacobs.

Shares in the company lost 0.1 per cent to $27.88 on the day.Microsoft is looking to retain the pre-eminence of its core Office suite of software services as its share of the market has shrunk amid challenges from companies such as Apple and Google. The company’s shares are up just 4 per cent over the past year, compared to a 15 per cent rise in the S&P 500.Shares in Apple declined slightly in after-market trading as the iPad and iPhone maker said its earnings fell short of analysts’ forecasts for its latest quarter and reduced its forward outlook. Earlier in the day, Apple shares slipped 1.2 per cent to $609.54.Colin Gillis, analyst at BGC, who rated Apple at “hold” with a price target of $600, said: “Our price target is below the current price levels because while we respect Apple’s success as a company, and enjoy the products, we mention that competition is increasing for the company.”Mr Gillis cited concerns with the company’s gross margin, the effects of a slowing economy in China and over-optimistic expectations as possible setbacks for the company. Apple shares have risen 50.6 per cent in the year to date.Amazon lost 2.9 per cent to $221 in after-hours trading after the eretailer reported its first quarterly loss since 2003 and said sales fell below analysts expectations for the period.Earlier this week, Anthony DiClemente, analyst at Barclays, said market data suggested that the company’s pace of revenue growth may have modestly slowed in August and September.Meanwhile, analysts at BGC Partners said investors should be concerned with the lack of visibility Amazon gives into parts of business, including sales of its Kindle ereader and the profitability of its hardware products.Wall Street stocks fluctuated between gains and losses for the day, before settling higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,412.98 to record its first day of gains for the week after three consecutive losing sessions.Fresh labour market data on Thursday showed that first-time jobless claims decreased last week. Meanwhile, new data on corporate spending showed that durable goods orders saw limited growth in September.Ford said it would shutter two UK manufacturing plants and cut 1,400 jobs as the US carmaker looked to curb losses from its European business. The company said it expected losses from its European division to be more than $1.5bn for 2012.

But analysts at Sterne Agee & Leach said the company would need to take further steps to restore its valuation.“For any meaningful appreciation, the core business needs to turn around meaningfully and we think there is little visibility on this front currently,” they said in a note to clients. Zynga shares are 74.8 per cent below their IPO price.The S&P 500 information technology index lost 0.2 per cent.CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, lost 2.7 per cent to $55.00 after it reported that net income fell 30 per cent in its latest quarter due to poor levels of trading activity.Best Buy, the big box consumer electronics retailer, lost 10.3 per cent to $15.17. The company said late on Wednesday that it would reshuffle its senior management and that it expected earnings to continue to decline amid falling sales.Analysts at Barclays said the warning was “especially troubling” heading into the critical holiday selling season, a period in which the company earns more than 60 per cent of its earnings per share.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher to 13,103.68. Boeing shares fell 1.6 per cent to $71.54 as investors weighed the impact of weak macroeconomic conditions on the aircraft manufacturer’s growth prospects.Cliffs Natural Resources dropped 10.5 per cent to $38.20.

353;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;US swaps reform triggers futures rush;;Looming US rules for “over-the-counter” derivatives deals are starting to transform credit and energy markets as traders adjust to new strictures and costs.Tradeweb, the electronic fixed income trading platform, has seen a fourfold jump in US credit derivative index volume over the past week since barriers to trading between market participants were lowered.CME Group, the futures exchange and clearing company, has meanwhile seen volumes in energy derivatives traded over the counter shift sharply in favour of futures since making changes in mid-October. The contracts are essential to oil companies such as BP and Shell, banks and hedge funds that are the biggest participants in energy markets.The changes have taken place ahead of federal rules that require the registration of swap dealers, processing of standard derivatives at clearing houses and trading platforms called “swap execution facilities”. A more open and transparent OTC derivatives market is a key aim of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, but the swaps industry fears that futures are gaining ground.The Tradeweb trading platform, partly owned by big Wall Street dealers, has boosted volumes by allowing banks that provide live prices in credit default swap indices to not only transact with clients, such as hedge funds and institutional investors, but also with each other.Historically, the swap market has been strictly divided between the so-called interdealer and bank to client sectors. The move is seen as posing a challenge to interdealer brokers, who only negotiate swap trades between dealers.CME plans to trade a swaps futures contract next month with the support of four major banks, while IntercontinentalExchange is launching a CDX future next year.Tradeweb is allowing clients and dealers to access the same streaming bid and offer prices for US investment grade and high yield CDS indices on its platform.Lee Olesky, chief executive officer, said the company had “evolved the rules of engagement for Tradeweb’s marketplace to provide the best experience for all participants”.Large energy traders were worried new swap rules would qualify them as “swap dealers”, which under the new regulations face a raft of new oversight and costs.ICE responded by converting all its existing cleared energy swaps into futures on October 15. CME Group has given traders the option of making the same oil and gas trade as either a swaps contract, which in 2013 will carry the new regulatory burden, or as a futures contract.Exchange data show a large share of energy traders have shifted to futures since CME began listing the products on October 15. More than half the energy volumes on CME’s ClearPort over-the-counter platform are now executed as a block futures trade, up from about 13 per cent before the change.
354;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Falling trading volumes hit CME;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, said a large fall in volumes across its business led to profits dropping by nearly a third in its latest quarter.Lower trading activity has taken its toll on exchange operators and the wider securities industry this year, leaving companies in the sector searching for new sources of revenue.Shares in the company fell 3.5 per cent to $54.55 by midday in New York.Terry Duffy, chairman, said: “This year was setting up for a disaster for volumes from day one as we had so many different macro events going on.”He added: “People have had no certainty as far as government policy issues . . . so hence what we have seen is corporations hoard cash and individuals hoard cash at the same time.”Average daily contract volume in the three months to September decreased 26.3 per cent to 10.8m, compared with the same period a year ago. The company attributed the declines to robust third-quarter trading activity in 2011.Net income fell 30.7 per cent to $218m, or 66 cents a share, down from $315m, or 95 cents, the same time a year ago. Excluding the effect of a one-off $16m tax hit, earnings per share would have been 70 cents, in line with analysts’ forecasts the quarter.Net revenues, which fell 21.8 per cent to $683m in the period, were also hampered by a fall in sales of market data and information services.Christopher Harris, exchange analyst at Wells Fargo, said the results were aided by improved cost controls by the company. In the quarter, total expenses were reduced by almost 5 per cent to 287.2m.CME Group has sought to take advantage of regulatory changes in the over-the-counter derivatives markets to bolster its business. Recently, the company said it would launch interest rate swap contracts with the market support of four of Wall Street’s biggest banks.“Interest rate swap futures were created to meet strong demand from financial market participants including banks, hedge funds, asset managers and insurers,” said Phupinder Gill, chief executive of CME Group.Despite the day’s losses, shares in CME Group have risen 12.6 per cent so far this year as the company has also sought to explore new opportunities across the Atlantic.This month, the company said it was planning to offer 30 foreign exchange futures products when it launches its European bourse next year. The move away from its base of operations in Chicago was seen as part of a drive to capture derivatives trading business in currencies and interest rate swaps form Asia, Europe and the Middle East.In the US, the company purchased the Kansas City wheat exchange for $126m in cash last week, adding to its dominance in the grain futures market.
355;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-10-17T17:26:56Z;CME buys Kansas City wheat exchange;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, acted to cement its dominance in grain futures markets on Wednesday with the purchase of the top US exchange for bread wheat.The US derivatives exchange, said it agreed to acquire the member-owned Kansas City Board of Trade for $126m in cash. The 156-year-old Kansas City exchange lists futures and options on hard red winter wheat, a variety grown in the US great plains and prized by bread bakers.CME, whose Chicago Board of Trade hosts flagship futures on soft red winter wheat, corn and soyabeans, faces new competition in the grain market from rival IntercontinentalExchange.For the Kansas City exchange’s 192 equity members, the purchase price represents a 37 per cent premium to the last recorded seat price of $480,000 but below peak prices of late 2007, according to exchange data. It will make a special distribution of excess cash to members after the deal closes.The Kansas City exchange in early spring formed a special committee to sound out potential buyers and received bids from “a number” of interested parties, said chairman Steven Campbell.Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, said of the purchase: “It’s not a defensive move. It’s a growth move for CME.”The deal leaves the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, the home of the hard red spring wheat futures contract and a fledgling contract in apple juice concentrate, as the lone independent US grain bourse. Mr Duffy declined to comment on prospects for a deal with Minneapolis.Futures traders are already accustomed to executing Kansas City wheat transactions on CME’s Globex electronic trading platform, which gets the bulk of futures volume. The New York Mercantile Exchange, an energy futures hub, also used Globex before it was bought by the CME in 2008.The majority of options on hard red winter wheat futures still trade on the Kansas City floor, which CME committed to keep open for at least six months.The deal comes as food commodities prices have surged in the wake of the worst US drought in half a century. In the quarter ended September 30, CME agricultural commodities volume rose 14 per cent on the same period in 2011, bucking declines in other product lines.Overall volumes have declined by 25 per cent in Kansas City so far this year.
356;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-10-16T18:25:44Z;Credit derivatives to trade on exchange;;Trading in credit default derivatives is to be offered on an exchange for the first time following a tie-up by IntercontinentalExchange, the US futures bourse, and Markit, the data provider.ICE, which dominates clearing of credit default swaps, said on Tuesday it would licence North American and European corporate CDS indices from UK-based Markit to develop exchange-traded futures and options contracts.CDS provide insurance against a default on bond payments and are used by investors to insure against risk and speculate on creditworthiness.ICE’s move illustrates how exchanges are eyeing new opportunities brought about by wide-ranging reforms of the over-the-counter derivatives market. G20 regulations have mandated that more of the vast $650tn OTC derivatives market be processed through central clearing and that more trades be backed by collateral or insurance. A clearing house stands between two parties, ensuring a trade is completed if one side defaults.New US rules related to the G20 mandate that tightened regulation of swap dealers came into effect last Friday. Exchanges like ICE and its rival CME Group have been racing to switch popular OTC products like cleared energy swaps into futures contracts. This is partly because standardised futures contracts require less margin to trade than a bespoke OTC product.Also on Tuesday, ICE said it had completed its transition of cleared OTC energy swaps to futures. The CME has an extension for OTC physical commodity swaps until the end of the year.“It shows that the market response to regulation is product innovation,” said William Rhode, director of head of fixed income research at New York-based Tabb Group, the capital markets consultancy. “I think there will be certain CDS products that will have enough liquidity to trade on exchange. Not all, but certainly some.”Many OTC swaps, such as interest rate swaps, have already been moved through clearing houses as part of the impending regulatory changes, but the CDS market has been relatively untouched. According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a derivatives trade body, only about 10 per cent of a market with an adjusted annual average outstanding notional value of $30tn had been centrally cleared last year.European antitrust officials have been investigating the CDS market. Brussels is probing allegations that 16 of the biggest investment banks tried to shut out competitors through their use of Markit to supply information in the CDS market. A second leg of the investigation concerning the European operations of ICE was suspended because of lack of evidence.ICE expects to launch the futures contract in the first quarter of next year. Further details of the contracts, such as their listing location, will be announced at a later date.
357;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;CME Europe to debut with 30 forex products;;CME Group, the US derivatives exchange, is planning to debut with 30 foreign exchange futures products when it launches its European bourse next year.The disclosure came as UK competition authorities launched a formal six-week public consultation to assess the Chicago-based group’s application for a local exchange licence.Further details of the exchange’s planned rules, procedures and contract specifications were also released on Thursday. Britain’s Office of Fair Trading said it was “expected to focus on the CME’s rules on participation criteria and the arrangements for clearing and settlement of trades.”A European hub is a key part of the bourse’s strategy to build extensive operations beyond its US heartland and capture customers keen to trade derivatives such as currencies and interest rate swaps from Asia, Europe and the Middle East. A formal application for the business, called CME Europe, was lodged in August and is expected to open mid-2013.Like many exchange rivals, CME is looking to grab business from sweeping incoming global derivatives market reform. Countries from the G20 have mandated that more of the $650tn over-the-counter derivatives market be moved on to electronic trading venues and processed through clearing houses. A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, ensuring the deal is completed in the event of a default.CME will initially begin with thirty currency pairs, including major ones involving the dollar, euro and renminbi. Its focus on foreign exchange futures reflects London’s long-term strength as a global centre for derivatives and foreign exchange trading, but also its growing importance as a destination for offshore renminbi trading.Markets in which CME has traditional strengths in the US, such as energy, commodity and fixed income trading, are dominated in Europe by its rivals IntercontinentalExchange, NYSE Liffe and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex. While foreign exchange is the world’s largest and most liquid market, trading is highly fragmented and the CME is one of the world’s largest trading venues, behind ICAP’s EBS.Proposals laid out by the CME to the OFT stipulated that members should have minimum capital requirements of at least £100,000 and would be subject to Basel III capital rules. It is expected to open from 11pm in London on Sunday and close at 10pm on Fridays and add other asset classes over time.Customers of CME Europe will also operate under UK insolvency laws in the event of a default, which differ from US laws. Most UK clearing houses operate a principal-to-principal model, in which a broker is entitled to a legal share of positions and assets. The US operates under an agency model, which recognises the principals are the clearing house and the client.CME Europe will use the group’s electronic trading platform Globex and its London-based CME Clearing Europe for clearing. The group has spent the past two years developing its operations in Europe, including the setting up of a clearing house. Earlier this week it formally unveiled an IT hub in Belfast in Northern Ireland.
358;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-10-08T23:04:30Z;Shift of gears at 40 puts winner in the fast lane;How Lance Uggla gave up a successful trading role in order to set up Markit in a barn;"Lance Uggla is the founder and chief executive of one of the UK’s most successful privately held companies, and yet, unless you work in financial services, you may never have heard of either Mr Uggla or the company he founded.Ten years ago Markit started life with a handful of people working in a barn at the end of Mr Uggla’s Hertfordshire garden; today it employs 2,600 people, many of them paper millionaires. The company ended its last financial year with a market capitalisation of $4.5bn, according to Mr Uggla’s estimates, and 30 per cent of Markit remains in the hands of its employees.Mr Uggla, the overall winner of this year’s Ernst & Young UK Entrepreneur of the Year awards, grew up in Vancouver with “really hard-working parents” and went to Simon Fraser University to study business administration. “British Columbia was where you might think of a career in natural resources or maybe tourism, but certainly not banking,” he says.He won a place at the London School of Economics to do a masters in accounting and finance and his career trajectory seemed set.At not quite 40, Mr Uggla was a successful securities trader in charge of TD Securities’ $20bn European and Asian portfolio.“I had a good job at the time and was enjoying life,” he says. However, he saw an opportunity to build a company providing financial information. “When I told them I wanted to resign I think they thought ‘interesting’. Markets were booming, things were going really well. ‘Are you absolutely crazy?’” he recalls. Nevertheless TD Securities agreed to bankroll Mr Uggla’s barn-based start-up – to the tune of $17m.“When they sold their share, the company had a $2bn market cap. They didn’t do too badly out of it,” says Mr Uggla.While accurate financial information in, for example, the currency market was readily available, the same could not be said for the credit market – loans, bonds and credit derivatives. “The original vision for the company was to become the definitive credit pricing company,” says Mr Uggla, who cites his main competitors as Icap, Thomson Reuters and credit rating agencies.“We felt that our methodologies of processing and cleaning on a daily basis was going to give us a competitive edge,” he says. “And it did.”The business model was based on increasing market transparency by aggregating prices from a wide base of players, some of which were also Markit’s shareholders. It was only as the company grew and became profitable, says Mr Uggla, while “we deepened our relationships with buy and sell-side customers and providers, that I felt we could expand”.Today about 40 per cent of Markit’s revenues are derived from financial information, including “a lot of proprietary information sets – economic indexes”, says Mr Uggla.What the company classifies as its “solutions” business includes building “some of the most active websites in the world, including the financial components of FT.com and the FT’s first iPad app”.Markit is an obvious candidate for an initial public offering, but Mr Uggla is in no rush. While he and his 2,600 employees own 30 per cent of the company, 13 per cent is held by funds and 57 per cent by an undisclosed list of banks.In January 2010, General Atlantic, the equity investment firm, bought 7.5 per cent of Markit for $250m, valuing the company at about $3.3bn at that time. “Providing liquidity for those shareholders is a challenge,” Mr Uggla acknowledges, but “shared ownership creates a whole different energy around the company that is our competitive edge. It allows me to say that even with 2,600 employees, it is a very entrepreneurial company and I feel very entrepreneurial leading it.”Nobody could accuse Mr Uggla of having small ambitions. He wants Markit “to be the best of the largest” financial information companies in the world, to compete with McGraw-Hill, Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, CME Group.For all that, he doesn’t underestimate the task ahead. “You have to have a lot of resilience and endurance. You have to be thinking about the long game. Nothing comes easy. Everything you think is going to take one year, takes two years.”"
359;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-09-20T22:07:31Z;Futures group offers risk guidelines;;Europe’s derivatives brokers, investors and exchanges have developed new guidelines to mitigate risks from electronic trading as the industry struggles to comply with toughened regulatory requirements.The Futures and Options Association, a trade body representing more than 100 participants in the derivatives industry, on Tuesday published technical guidelines to more effectively manage trading risks such as errant algorithms.The move comes amid uncertainty in the industry over how to comply with broad principles laid down in guidelines introduced in May by the European Securities and Markets Authority, the region’s market regulator. It wanted exchanges and brokers to take the lead in policing electronic markets and high-frequency trading.Guidelines set out by the FOA included standards for developing so-called “kill switches” for both trading venues and investors and more extensive testing of trading algorithms in simulated markets. The guidelines have received backing from a working group of brokers, Citi, electronic market makers, proprietary traders and software providers like Fidessa.NYSE Liffe and IntercontinentalExchange, two of the region’s largest derivatives trading exchanges, have agreed to make available data for the performance testing of algorithms in a simulated environment. CME Group has also agreed to the proposals, assuming it wins approval for its application to run a London-based derivatives market from next year.Regulators around the world have become particularly concerned by risks to market stability posed by the growing use of automated trading and the use of computers to trade in and out of positions in fractions of a second. Incidents such as the flash crash of 2010 and the errant trades made by Knight Capital on the New York Stock Exchange in August have heightened the sensitivity.“We’re trying to show with this document that industry takes collective responsibility for monitoring seriously,” said Sam Tyfield, partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman and member of the FOA’s e-trading working group.The guidelines mark a push for brokers who act as clearing agents in the market to improve their risk management systems. They would be “on the hook” for potential losses but have had little ability to actively stop excessive risk-taking by their customers in a timely manner.Esma guidance includes banning so-called “naked access”, in which investors can access an exchange by using on a broker-dealer’s membership. The FOA defined naked access as “the relevant firm does not have arms-length, imposed risk controls”.Publication of the guidelines comes less than a week before a vote in the European parliament on the Mifid review, the new rules governing Europe’s financial markets. Representatives will vote on a text which sets out the parliament’s stance on the future shape of the region’s markets ahead of a trialogue that will determine the final, legally-binding regulation.“It’s intended to obliquely inform policy advisers. It’s speaking to advisers beyond politicians – to regulators who will look at the technical requirements,” said Blake Stephenson, regulation manager at the FOA.
360;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
361;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-09-20T19:41:34Z;Goldman to gain from new CME swap future;;The success of a proposed new swap future by the CME, the US’s largest futures and options exchange, stands to reward Goldman Sachs since the bank holds the intellectual property rights to the contract.This week, the CME said it planned to launch interest rate swap contracts in November with support from Goldman, Citi, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley as market makers.The new futures contract, which will turn into an over-the-counter swap at a later date, is based on a US patent granted in April 2011 to Oliver Frankel, a managing director at Goldman. Both Goldman and the CME confirmed the patent but declined to comment further.The move by the CME and large banks, who are prominent dealers in the OTC swaps market, is seen as a sign that the industry is being propelled towards a futures exchange model.While new futures contracts often take time to garner sufficient liquidity and broad market support, the collaboration of the CME, which up to now has been focused on clearing OTC swaps and dealers, is significant.It is seen as laying down a strong challenge to plans by other entities setting up so-called “swap execution facilities” as mandated by the Dodd Frank Act.“We believe the big banks’ participation is a strong indication that they are seeing the writing on the wall not only in regards to the mandatory clearing required by Dodd Frank, but also the potential ‘listed futurisation’ of OTC interest rate swaps,” said Richard Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill.He said a successful launch by the CME “stands to outmanoeuvre the many SEFs that are being created to trade the OTC IRS products under soon to be released Dodd Frank Sef guidelines”.The new CME contract will be less expensive to trade than an OTC swap under Dodd Frank on a SEF, from the perspective of posting margin.Another potential advantage for large banks and investors in trading swap futures that can become OTC swaps at a later date is that the exchange will probably have less onerous rules than SEFs for executing large so-called block trades.Proposed restrictions on block trades for SEFs have been a major point of contention between swap participants and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is in the process of finalising rules for SEFs.“The [CME] contract is a forward swap and if you can have more discretion about what constitutes a block trade, it make sense to trade that,” said Will Rhode, director for fixed income research at Tabb Group.Sean Tully, managing director of interest rate products at CME Group, said: “We will propose block trading rule recommendations and the CFTC will review them.”
362;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;Ex-CME programmer pleads guilty to theft;;A former programmer at CME Group, the largest US futures exchange operator, has admitted to stealing proprietary software while pursuing plans to provide help to an electronic exchange in China.Chunlai Yang, a 49-year-old naturalised American, pleaded guilty to two counts of trade theft on Wednesday. He faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each count.Mr Yang confessed to downloading more than 10,000 files containing software critical to CME’s business with the aim of using the code to establish a futures exchange in China and to sell trading software.“The source code and algorithms that made up the supporting programs were proprietary and confidential business property of CME Group, which instituted internal measures to safeguard and protect its trade secrets,” the US attorney office’s said.Mr Yang admitted that he and two business partners planned to form a business in China to provide technology to increase volumes on the Zhangjiagang Exchange, an electronic chemicals trading platform.As a senior software engineer at CME, Mr Yang had access to software programs that support the company’s Globex electronic trading platform through which a majority of its trades are conducted. Federal authorities said the potential loss in damages from the theft was between $50m and $100m.“Trade secret theft is a serious economic crime that affects the interests of corporations, as well as our national interest, in protecting intellectual property,” said Gary Shapiro, acting US attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.Edward Genson, Mr Yang’s lawyer, said: “The fact is that nobody was harmed, no one lost any money, nobody lost any proprietary information and my client didn’t make any money. Hopefully the judge will take that into account when sentencing.”Born in China, Mr Yang joined CME as a computer programmer in 2000 and worked there until his arrest in July 2011 after two-month investigation by the company and the FBI.He is set to be sentenced in a US district court on February 20.
363;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-09-19T17:44:37Z;Investors refine bets on crude price gap;;Forget the sharp slide in oil prices. What’s really concentrating minds in oil markets is the huge sums at stake in a bet on the direction of Brent and WTI – the world’s most heavily traded crude benchmarks.Here the debate is about more than the prospect of rising Saudi oil output or a jump in US stock. It is not so much about the actual price of oil, but the huge differences in the cost of the two crude streams.For nearly two years oil extracted from the middle of the US and Canada has traded at steep discounts to oil delivered in ocean tankers as North American drillers pump more than pipelines can take to refineries.Now investors including Pimco and Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street bank with the biggest commodities business by revenues, say these discounts will narrow. Others including PBF Energy, a company chaired by refinery investor Tom O’Malley, and oil transport company Magellan Midstream Partners see the discounts lasting for years.This debate matters. At stake are hundreds of millions of dollars worth of trades and investments as well as fees for commodities exchange operators CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange.The discount is most visible in futures markets, where $92-a-barrel West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark crude, sells for $16 less than Brent, the North Sea benchmark. Changes in pipeline flows and the use of rail routes to carry crude produced inland to the coast have led to bets that the discount will diminish.Goldman argues that a recent change in direction of oil flow along the Seaway pipeline is draining 150,000 barrels a day from the glutted WTI delivery and pricing point of Cushing. The pipeline’s capacity is due to rise 400,000 b/d in 2013.New rail infrastructure will carry more barrels from inland fields, reconnecting Cushing with the waterborne market. This should in turn shrink the WTI discount to $4, or the Seaway tariff, says David Greely, Goldman’s head of energy research. The bank is recommending clients buy WTI and sell Brent for delivery next June.“In the second quarter of next year we think that spread has to come in pretty sharply,” says Mr Greely.Mihir Worah, who oversees a $30bn commodities portfolio at Pimco, says the fund has bought WTI and sold Brent futures for delivery in December 2013.“Late 2013 is when the physical oil offtake is going to grow dramatically. But clearly, if this becomes a certainty, which we expect, the market will start to narrow well before that,” Mr Worah says.The difference between the December 2013 contracts was $10.50 on Wednesday. “We think it should be trading $5 to $6,” Mr Worah says. There is a feeling, too, among traders that the glut at Cushing could soon ease.“Volume in WTI-Brent has been massive over the last few weeks. Many people anticipate the pipeline logjam is about to clear up,” says a dealer in swaps that track both oil benchmarks.The market has flashed false signals before. After hitting a record $28 last October, the spread contracted to $8 after Seaway’s owners announced the pipeline reversal, only to expand again. HollyFrontier, a central US refiner that has enjoyed fat profit margins largely thanks to stranded inland crude markets, believes the wide spread is here to stay as production keeps outpacing pipeline projects.“Our best guess is we are going to see it higher longer,” says Neale Hickerson, vice-president.Magellan is spending $375m to reverse a pipeline to carry 225,000 b/d from west Texas to coastal Houston and is contemplating another 278,000 b/d line in the same direction. Both projects would steer rising production away from Cushing.Mike Mears, chief executive, nevertheless says it will take years for pipeline capacity to shrink WTI’s discount to tariff levels. “The four-year, five-year timeframe is probably the right timeframe for that to happen,” he says.At its refinery in the east coast state of Delaware, PBF is investing $60m to build a rail terminal to offload more than 100,000 b/d from trains loaded in North Dakota and Canada. “We believe crude differentials are sustainable for the foreseeable future . . . it’s going to continue to be a volatile, disconnected, regionalised market,” says Neil Wizel, director at private equity firm First Reserve, which co-owns PBF.This week Brent has fallen faster than WTI, narrowing the spread by more than $1. But Mr Greely warns: “It’s a buy-and-hold trade. It could be a bumpy ride.”
364;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Meet Cargill, the news wire;Agricultural trader says it is an information provider for clients;It is said that the internet allows anyone to be a member of the media. This apparently also applies to Cargill, the world’s biggest agricultural trading house.The company has urged the US Department of Agriculture to end the practice of giving news wire services such as Bloomberg and Reuters privileged advance access to market-moving crop reports. The so-called “lock-up”, in which reporters are sequestered in a room to prepare detailed stories for publication as soon as crop reports are released, dates back decades.Cargill, whose employees give farmers market information as well as grain bids, has problems with this tradition and in a filing to the USDA has proposed a radical change.“As we understand it, the current lock-up and release process allows some members of the news media to access the reports early,” Cargill said in the filing. “That has never been an issue in the past because markets were closed at release time. But in an environment in which markets are actively trading while critical reports are being released, anyone with early access will have an unfair advantage.”The Financial Times also competes with news services covering markets including agricultural commodities, but does not regularly station a reporter inside the USDA lock-up.The comments come after US futures exchanges extended hours to allow trading through big USDA reports. Previously markets took a break round the time of releases, and traditionalists complain the new system prevents them from digesting facts before trading on them.The USDA is considering shifting release times and may announce a decision as soon as this week, a person familiar with the matter says. Cargill revealed its stance towards the lock-up in response to a call for public comments.Cargill said it would prefer markets to close during report release times. A trading halt was also suggested by CME Group, owner of the Chicago Board of Trade, which said that the hiatus should last no more than 30 minutes. Louis Dreyfus Commodities, a rival of Cargill, requested the reports be released out of trading hours to “give all market participants the chance to fully understand and use the data”.But Cargill added that if markets were not closed, “all users should get access to the reports at the same time” – including the news services.The suggestion that news services have an unfair advantage will strike many journalists as absurd. Cargill has huge positions in commodity futures markets and millions of dollars to gain or lose on government data. The sole job of news services is disseminating information, not trading.Mark Klein, a Cargill spokesman, says the distinction between media and market participant is not so neat. At Cargill divisions such as AgHorizons, which offers farmers grain marketing help and agronomic advice, and Grain and Oilseed Supply Chain, where employees dispense knowledge alongside bids.“The wire services are in the business of selling information and part of our business is providing information to our farmer customers, so in a sense we’re in the same business,” Mr Klein says. “Everyone should be able to analyse the information at the same time.”gregory.meyer@ft.comThe Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
365;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-09-18T21:54:55Z;CME to launch interest rate swap contract;;The CME has announced plans for a new interest rate swap contract as the Chicago-based exchange prepares for the new era of regulated over-the counter derivatives trading.With regulators still finalising rules under the Dodd Frank act that will govern how swaps trade, the CME plans to launch a deliverable interest rate swap futures contract on November 13 with the market support of four major banks.The exchange expects the new contact will compliment its existing three-month eurodollar interest rate and benchmark Treasury futures.The CME on Tuesday touted the margin benefits of using swap futures with major banks and investors facing tighter capital standards and clearing fees for trading OTC derivatives. Upon expiry, the swap futures will convert or be delivered into an OTC swap that is cleared by the CME.“Our customers will now have a complementary standardised product that provides the advantages offered by futures contracts including pricing transparency, the automatic netting of positions and margin savings achieved through cross margining versus all other futures and options cleared through CME Clearing,” said Sean Tully, managing director of interest rate products at CME, in a statement.CME said it will list quarterly swap futures for the key benchmark maturities of two, five, 10, and 30 years. These are the most liquid maturities that are traded in the current OTC market and are expected to largely trade electronically once final rules for swap execution facilities are finalised later this year.While new futures contracts can often struggle to garner sufficient volume, the CME said major banks will serve as market makers.“Citi, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are among the firms who are planning to serve as market makers for the product, enabling market participants to access deep and liquid markets,” said the CME.“Swap futures fill an important gap in the rates market, as they’ll allow clients to access swap exposure while providing cross-margining with the efficiencies of futures products” said Glenn Hadden, head of global interest rate products at Morgan Stanley.The CME will formally compete with the Eris exchange, a futures trading platform for interest rate swaps set up by alternative market makers including Getco and DRW in 2010.

367;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-09-13T08:03:59Z;CME Group to launch renminbi futures;;CME Group will launch offshore renminbi futures, putting it into battle with the Hong Kong exchange, in an effort to tap growing international demand for the Chinese currency.These will be the first deliverable renminbi futures available on exchanges, creating hedging and investment opportunities that had previously been absent from China’s drive to promote its currency as a rival to the dollar.The offshore renminbi future contract developed by Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing will start trading on September 17.CME said its alternative will launch in the coming months, without specifying a date.Leo Melamed, chairman emeritus of CME and a pioneer of financial futures, said the debut of renminbi futures was an important milestone on the currency’s path towards global prominence.“We don’t willy-nilly start a contract,” he told the Financial Times. “China is ready to internationalise the renminbi. All the indications are there and it’s the right time for this.”Only a tiny amount of renminbi had ever moved beyond China’s borders until three years ago when the government began to allow exporters to pay for goods using the currency. The pool of renminbi held abroad has grown very quickly since then, especially in Hong Kong, and daily trading volume in the offshore spot market has reached about $3bn.Growth of the offshore market has cooled in recent months as expectations of renminbi appreciation have weakened in line with China’s economic slowdown, but many analysts and investors believe that this will only be a temporary setback in the renminbi’s ascent.The biggest obstacle blocking it from becoming a more widely used currency in international markets is China itself, because it maintains a tight grip on its capital account, limiting the renminbi’s convertibility. Beijing has vowed to relax these controls but it is wary of the instability that could arise from moving too fast.Even with the limitations on the renminbi, there is demand for deliverable futures from asset managers, hedge funds and corporations which have started accepting renminbi as payment. Until now, hedging has been done primarily via non-deliverable forwards and dollar-settled renminbi futures.“We think the one [the deliverable future] we’re launching now will be the grand entry in the market,” Mr Melamed said.CME plans to list its renminbi products in the US in the fourth quarter and in Europe next year, which will help bring the currency to a broader global investor base. But it will face stiff competition in Hong Kong from HKEx.In selecting Hong Kong as the global hub for offshore renminbi trading, Beijing has worked closely with HKEx to develop a range of renminbi products, from bonds to real estate investment trusts. HKEx has also said that the launch of renminbi deliverable futures is an important part of its strategy to expand beyond equities.
368;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;CBOE eyes move into Asia after London push;;Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US derivatives bourse operator, is considering opening a hub in Asia to trade its volatility derivatives contracts once it has bedded down its new London base.The exchange said last week it planned to extend trading of futures contracts based on its Volatility Index, commonly known as the Vix, around the clock, five days a week to allow investors outside the US to trade.CBOE’s push to exploit growing global demand for its best-known products comes as the industry searches for ways to counter soft dealing volumes. Investor appetite for trading some derivatives products – such as options and futures on stocks – on the CBOE and larger domestic rivals such as CME Group, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX has dwindled amid uncertainty for the global economic outlook and the eurozone. The CBOE has been more insulated than some of its rivals as investors have also stocked their portfolios with products that offer a broader hedge against risk, such as the Vix futures contracts.The contract is based on an index derived from the cost of buying short-term options on the S&P 500. It tends to fall when equity markets rise and frequently acts as a measure of investor expectations of market volatility, earning it the tag of Wall Street’s fear gauge. CBOE had record volumes last year and trading in Vix futures in the year to date till the end of August was up 59 per cent to 13.8m contracts.In moving to 24-hour trading, the CBOE plans to place its matching engines in a London data centre, if its plan is approved by US regulators. The move would extend opening hours beyond the current eight hours.Bill Brodsky, chief executive, said CBOE could widen its operations beyond Europe. “We would certainly contemplate Asia. Asia is clearly in our sights,” he told the Financial Times. Of his company’s decision to extend beyond its US heartland he said: “It’s not something we just thought about. We know our customers are there in Europe. [The Vix] is a unique proxy for the equity markets. We have a unique product.”He said CBOE would not, as yet, be following its Chicago rival CME Group in seeking a licence for a London derivatives exchange.Christopher Harris, an analyst at Wells Fargo, described CBOE’s futures franchise as “one of the best growth stories among exchanges”. “Future enhancements could be fairly impactful to results over time,” he added.Like the CME, CBOE estimates that about 20 per cent of its business comes from overseas. Its success has helped shares in CBOE rise 20 per cent in the past 12 months, giving it an equity market capitalisation of $3.8bn.www.ft.com/tradingroom
369;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-09-06T21:35:41Z;Traiana pushs ‘kill switch’ into futures market;;Two of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges are part of a service with a “kill switch” to limit damage from errant trading by algorithms, as futures bourses look to bolster investor confidence in their markets.Futures commissions merchants will be able to halt or limit trading activity at high speed on CME, operator of the world’s biggest futures exchange, and NYSE Liffe, one of the Europe’s dominant futures and options markets, if a computer begins to malfunction or a customer breaches risk limits.The service, run by Traiana, the post-trade services group owned by UK interdealer ICAP, will apply to exchange-traded derivatives products.CME is one of the biggest US venues for trading on-exchange derivatives contracts while Liffe and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex enjoy a duopoly in Europe.The application of the service illustrates how bourses that trade other asset classes are looking closely at the experiences of US equity markets. There, investors have become increasingly concerned about authorities’ ability to police markets where trading is largely conducted by high-speed computer algorithms.High frequency and algorithmic trading, which use superfast computers to make, hold and cancel quotes in fractions of seconds, accounts for up to 50 per cent of average daily trading on US equity markets. However, many investors trade both equities and on-exchange derivatives, with buying and selling of futures contracts in Chicago often offset against index securities trading in New York.Traiana’s deal with CME and NYSE also marks an extension of the service, called Harmony CreditLink, from foreign exchange markets.“It was a natural next step to extend it to the exchange-traded derivatives market, specifically for direct market access and sponsored access trading,” said Andrew Coyne, chief executive of Traiana. He added that other exchanges were in the process of connecting the service.Longstanding fears about the ability to minimise the market impact of software errors were fuelled last month by a high-profile glitch on systems used by Knight Capital, a US equity market maker.Orders triggered by an errant algorithm led to huge price swings in dozens of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange over a 45 minute period. The errors cost the market maker $440m in pre-tax profits and threatened its future before it was bailed out by other trading firms.Next week the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator, will convene an equity industry roundtable to discuss potential remedies, including “kill switches”.Volumes of exchange-traded derivatives have been rising rapidly in recent years as buyside investors, such as pension funds, include derivatives as part of their overall trading strategies. According to the World Federation of Exchanges, global turnover rose 11 per cent to 24bn contracts last year.
370;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-09-06T10:28:28Z;CBOE looks to set up London base;;Trading of the world’s most popular volatility gauge is set move around the clock as part of wide-ranging expansion plans laid out by the Vix’s owner, the Chicago Board Options Exchange.The derivatives exchange is set to follow its larger Chicago rival CME Group and develop a London-based trading hub next year for its futures exchange.The move will triple the trading hours available for its popular Volatility index (Vix) futures contract, commonly known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”.Its decision illustrates how exchanges with extensive derivatives operations are looking to broaden their appeal to investors around the world keen to trade popular assets and products.Low appetite for trading is likely to crimp bourse profits this year.It also strengthens London’s role as a developing financial centre for derivatives trading as the industry prepares to comply with incoming global reform of the industry.G20 regulators want to move more over-the-counter derivatives trading on to electronic exchanges but market participants are concerned about being caught in regulatory jurisdictions they consider unfavourable.Consequently, exchanges are looking to offer customers a choice of location to trade and clear derivatives.“Around-the-clock hours for Vix index futures and a CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE) London hub offer the ultimate in flexibility,” Bill Brodsky, chief executive of CBOE, told the company’s risk management conference in Ireland.He added that Vix index futures would be the first contract traded on a CBOE Holdings exchange on a near 24-hour basis, five days a week, pending regulatory approval.“There’s definitely a need for access to US markets from people in London and Europe,” said Jack Boyle, senior director, financial futures and options execution, at Newedge in Chicago.“CBOE’s presence in the UK could broaden its exchange to a new set of users in Europe that prefer to trade on localised venues,” said Christopher Harris, an analyst at Wells Fargo. He added that the move could attract new users who prefer not to hold overnight positions.The CBOE’s focus on London adds to the growing list of US bourses using the UK capital as their principal base for overseas operations.CME Group last month applied for a derivatives exchange licence.NYSE Euronext, via its Liffe derivatives unit, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), and Nasdaq OMX have all also made the UK capital the headquarters for their European derivatives businesses.www.ft.com/tradingroom
371;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-09-05T21:01:57Z;CME leads exchanges lower as trades slow;;"Shares in US stock exchanges fell after CME Group reported official August trading volumes that pointed to a significant slowdown in activity both on a year-on-year and month-on-month basis.The largest US exchange by market capitalisation fell as much as 2.2 per cent while many of CME’s peers also came under pressure after reporting soft data.CME pared its losses in late afternoon activity to close even at $55.31.NYSE Euronext lost 0.2 per cent to $25.39 and IntercontinentalExchange was down 0.8 per cent to $135.54.Alex Kramm, exchanges analyst at UBS, said the sector was protected from further downward pressure because low trading volumes had been signposted in recent weeks.Mr Kramm also remained upbeat on CME despite lowering his forecast for the company’s third-quarter earnings.“We continue to look for multiple expansions as opportunities from OTC derivatives reform become more visible,” he told clients.Elsewhere, markets were flat as investors weighed Tuesday’s soft economic data from the US against newswire reports fleshing out details of a bond-buying programme that the European Central Bank is expected to unveil on Thursday.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower to 1,403.44 and the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 13,047.48.US analysts continued to stress the importance of ECB intervention for the US equity market. David Brown, the chief market strategist at Sabrient Systems, said continuing deterioration in the eurozone would not just weigh on global demand for the goods and services of US companies, but could also lead to the dollar strengthening against the euro, hurting exporters.Earnings growth for the S&P 500 index in the second quarter has been almost flat compared with the same period last year.With a significant majority of second-quarter results now in, analysts are forecasting year-on-year earnings growth of just 0.85 per cent, which would be the lowest growth rate since the third quarter of 2009.In a further sign of the vulnerability of US companies to weak global growth, shares in FedEx fell 2 per cent lower to $85.80 after the package delivery company sharply lowered quarterly earnings estimates on Tuesday, citing “weakness in the global economy”.Credit Suisse analysts lowered their price target and suggested clients should not buy the stock, even though FedEx has said it is planning a restructuring programme to boost profitability.“Restructuring efforts generally signal that the underlying business is deteriorating; thus, we prefer to wait on the sidelines for now,” Christopher Ceraso told Credit Suisse clients.FedEx is considered a bellwether for the global economy because of its role in shipping goods for companies, and other freight and delivery companies also lost ground.United Parcel Service, one of FedEx’s main rivals, lost 2.4 per cent to $71.94.Safeway shares climbed 4.3 per cent to $16.50 after the supermarket group said it would sell a minority stake in its Blackhawk Network Holding business via an initial public offering of shares.The pre-payment card business generates at least $100m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to Safeway.Jonathan Feeney, an analyst at Janney, said the Blackhawk business could be worth almost $1bn and would likely trade at a premium to industry peers because of its “niche” position in the industry.Shares in the education company DeVry climbed 5.2 per cent to $20.20 after it announced it would buy back up to $100m of shares.Advanced Micro Devices, a semiconductor manufacturer, fell 3.6 per cent to $3.51 after UBS analysts lowered their price target on the stock, arguing that the growth of tablets and ultrabook computers will hit sales of personal computers, which AMD supplies with processor chips.Goldman Sachs rose 3.3 per cent to $109.94, outperforming as financials in the S&P 500 index were generally flat.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.2 per cent to 3,069.27. Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the Nasdaq, declined 0.7 per cent as investors awaited the iPhone makers latest iterations of its popular mobile device.Shares in Facebook bounced 4.8 per cent to $18.58, having hit a fresh low of $17.55 on Tuesday. Investment bank Jefferies initiated coverage on the social network with a bullish outlook."
372;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-08-20T18:21:00Z;CME confirms expansion drive in Europe;;Since CME Group regained its position as the world’s largest exchange operator by market capitalisation in May, the Chicago-based group has come to view its market as a global one.The group confirmed on Monday that it would file an application for a London-based derivatives bourse, its first outside the US. It also named Bob Ray, a veteran Chicago exchange expert formerly with the Chicago Board of Trade, as chief executive of CME Europe, which is expected to open in mid-2013.It marks the next step for CME as it looks to use Europe and in particular London as the launch pad for its global ambitions. Staff numbers at its London offices have doubled in three years to about 120, while a full operation for over-the-counter clearing began in May last year. Almost a fifth of its volume originates in Europe. In June it failed in a bid for the London Metal Exchange, which would have given it the licence it now seeks.“When the CME says it’s setting up an exchange in Europe, you have to take it seriously,” said Steve Grob, head of strategy at Fidessa, a UK trading technology company.But in Europe CME enters a competitive market for trading and clearing of derivatives. The London Stock Exchange, in part through its purchase of a controlling stake in clearing house LCH.Clearnet, and Nasdaq OMX also plan to enter a market where Liffe, owned by NYSE Euronext, and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex dominate trading of European equities, government bonds and interest rates.“This exchange is aimed at a client base that wouldn’t trade in the US,” Phupinder Gill, chief executive of CME, told the Financial Times. “It’s for clients that are not trading at CME. We will offer whatever our clients want.”CME Europe will start trading foreign exchange futures products, which until now were a small part of the US group’s overall business.Nearly a quarter of CME’s revenues at the end of the first quarter came from energy markets and contracts such as the WTI and Brent oil contracts and natural gas. Interest rate swaps, an OTC market, accounted for 21 per cent of turnover. Only 6 per cent was foreign exchange but, as Mr Grob pointed out: “By going with FX futures [to start], they aren’t trying to take on Liffe and Eurex at their own game.”Richard Perrott, an analyst at Berenberg Bank, added: “It’s likely that the CME would only compete more directly with the incumbent exchanges in the longer term by looking to trade similar products.”The CME’s move also aims to exploit regulatory reforms on both sides of the Atlantic. G20 countries are looking to move more of the OTC derivatives market, which has $700tn of annual notional volume, on to electronic trading venues and to have trades processed through clearing houses, which stand between two parties in a trade, ensuring a deal is completed in the event of a default.UBS estimates that interest rate clearing could add $500m, or $0.90 a share, to CME’s annual earnings, equivalent to 25 per cent earnings growth on its 2013 earnings per share estimate of $3.82.“Expanding into Europe ahead of these changes makes sense given that close to half of global OTC activity occurs in London,” says Mr Perrott.European antitrust regulators have also encouraged more competition in the regional market. In February the European Commission blocked the merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, citing a desire for increased competition for derivatives in Europe. Deutsche Börse and NYSE unsuccessfully argued that the CME, rather than each other, was the main competition in a global market.The ruling gave CME the best of both worlds. While Europe is seeking more competition, US regulators have shown little interest in addressing the “vertical silo” model in the futures market, in which the exchange also owns the clearing house. It has allowed CME to keep its 95 per cent share in the interest rate futures business.Any change could be far-reaching for the CME, whose share price multiple of 16 times 2012 earnings, higher than many rivals, is based partly on its vertical silo. Four years ago the US Department of Justice indicated it was unhappy with the structure. CME shares dropped 18 per cent in a day, but nothing has come of the DoJ’s call.While competition remains limited in listed US derivatives, investors are welcoming the greater choice being offered elsewhere. Walt Lukken, chief executive of the Futures Industry Association, says: “I think this is a sign global competition is strong and FIA welcomes more choices for its members.”
373;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME plans Europe derivatives exchange;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, has unveiled plans for a European derivatives market in a move that will pitch it into battle with Liffe and Eurex, the continent’s biggest derivatives trading bourses.The group, which dominates US futures trading via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, will file an application with UK regulators in coming days for a London-based bourse that would operate with its own management team.CME’s decision to launch an exchange in London will strengthen the city’s role as a financial centre. Rivals NYSE Euronext, via its Liffe derivatives unit, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), and Nasdaq OMX have all made the UK capital the headquarters for their European derivatives businesses. Frankfurt-based Eurex is owned by Deutsche Börse.CME’s decision also illustrates how expansion in Europe has become a priority for CME as exchanges look to grab emerging business in global derivatives trading and clearing.Group of 20 regulations such as the US Dodd-Frank act have mandated that more of the vast over-the-counter derivatives market be moved on to exchanges, and processed through clearing houses. Clearing houses stand between two parties in a trade, ensuring a deal is completed in the event of a default.The CME dominates US derivatives trading and takes 80 per cent of its revenues from North America. It has become increasingly constrained by regulators, however, and over the past 18 months has expanded significantly its London-based staff. Employee numbers have doubled in three years to more than 150 as it opened a clearing house.A successful application would be only the sixth Recognised Investment Exchange licence granted by the Financial Services Authority.The CME intends to begin trading by mid-2013 with foreign exchange futures but will expand into other products. The business, to be called CME Europe, will be headed by Robert Ray, currently managing director, products and services, at CME. It will also use CME’s electronic trading platform Globex, and CME Clearing Europe for clearing.Phupinder Gill, chief executive of CME, said: “Our application to establish an exchange in Europe fits within our strategy to grow organically and is an important next step to meet the growing regional demand from our customers.”The decision to open its own derivatives exchange follows CME’s failed bid to buy the London Metal Exchange this year. It faces a battle in its new target market, however. Liffe and Eurex, account for virtually all of trading in derivatives in Europe. Their parent companies unsuccessfully tried to argue to European antitrust authorities that CME was their main competitor when they tried to merge earlier this year. Officials blocked the merger in February.Liffe also competes with the CME for customers wanting to trade dollar-denominated futures products at the short end of the yield curve.Nasdaq OMX announced plans in June for a European derivatives trading business while NYSE Euronext said in March it would expand its Liffe business following the failure of its merger with Deutsche Börse. ICE Futures Europe is strong in the trading of commodity and emissions futures, such as the Brent oil contract.
374;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-08-20T13:57:41Z;CME – eyes on Europe;Setting up in London makes sense and the timing is canny;"OK, Europe, which is it to be – Sox or Cubs? Because it will soon be time to choose. CME Group, which owns and operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, and (phew) New York Mercantile Exchange, is planning a derivatives exchange in London. CME says 20 per cent of its trading volume originates in Europe. It has been bulking up on staff and already has a clearing operation in London. Setting up in Europe makes sense and the timing is canny.CME has a limited presence in London, but not for want of trying. It had been pursuing London Metal Exchange, which would have given it a fully fledged market infrastructure in the City at a stroke. But it was eliminated from the bidding for LME, which fell in June to Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing for £1.4bn. The real motivation, though, must be the EU’s veto of the proposed merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext in the spring. That was an invitation to enter the European market.The NYSE/DB merger was vetoed on competition grounds, even though both parties had argued – not unreasonably – that the greater competitive threat to their business came not from each other but from CME.The Chicago group is the world’s biggest exchange operator by market capitalisation ($18bn; its closest competitor is HKEx, at $15bn). It is also, with 98 per cent of the market, the monopoly provider of futures trading in the US. No wonder it has its eye on Europe, where regulators are shepherding more and more derivatives trading on to regulated markets and where London is the hub of global foreign exchange trading. CME intends to start with forex futures.NYSE’s Liffe and DB’s Eurex, which are big profit generators for their parents, could ultimately be vulnerable to the competition. NYSE and DB could also point the finger at Brussels, meanwhile, and shout “We told you so”. Winning business from them will not be easy: CME will need to offer new products. Still, welcome to Europe.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
375;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-08-15T18:33:18Z;LCH.Clearnet to pay €30m for Nasdaq’s IDCG;;LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French clearing house, said on Wednesday its deal to purchase International Derivatives Clearing Group from Nasdaq OMX valued the US derivatives clearing business at around €30m ($36m).The two groups, who have been in advanced talks since April, finalised terms of the deal. LCH will issue shares to Nasdaq at €19 a share, giving Nasdaq a pro forma share of 3.7 per cent in LCH. That equates to a valuation of around €30m, according to Richard Perrott, an analyst at Berenberg Bank.The share price is the same valuation that the London Stock Exchange agreed to pay to acquire a majority stake in LCH in March. Nasdaq will retain that stake even if the LSE deal is passed by regulators.The purchase reinforces LCH.Clearnet’s US business as the market prepares for the introduction of wide-ranging reforms to the clearing of over-the-counter derivatives, which includes $700tn in notional value swaps.Countries in the G20 have mandated that more bilateral, off-exchange derivatives trades be processed through clearing houses, and the US is furthest ahead in its preparations. LCH is the largest global clearing house for bank-to-bank swaps clearing but faces a battle from companies such as CME Group for a share of the emerging bank-to-customer portion of the market.Some buyside institutions have been concerned that LCH.Clearnet could have been subject to UK bankruptcy laws if a member defaulted.New York-based IDCG, launched in January 2009 to clear interest rate swap futures, has struggled to capture market share. However, it provides LCH.Clearnet with a US-recognised clearing house licensed to clear swaps and futures trades.“It’s a very clear commitment to the US marketplace,” Ian Axe, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet, told FT Trading Room. “With a domestic licence, I can think about future product expansion in the US,” he said, citing OTC forex clearing as a potential new market.Nasdaq and LCH said the deal would preserve the so-called “horizontal” model, which separates ownership of trading and clearing. Clearing houses that are not owned by an exchange are free to offer services to any trading platform. Some rivals such as the CME and NYSE Liffe own the execution platform and the clearing house, an integrated model known as the “vertical silo”, which allows them to lock-in profits.LCH said the deal would also allow it offer customers combined swaps and futures clearing, which has become a key offering for all clearing houses. Known as portfolio margining, it will allow banks, asset managers and hedge funds to offset the collateral they are required to post against other positions they hold while trading and clearing over-the-counter interest rate swaps. Many market participants face a shortage of quality top-rated collateral ahead of expanding clearing requirements in the US and Europe.Before this move, LCH.Clearnet agreed to develop a portfolio margining offset with NYSE Euronext, which operates the NYSE Liffe US futures market and is co-owner, with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, of New York Portfolio Clearing, a clearing house.The deal, subject to regulatory approval, will see IDCG renamed LCH.Clearnet (US).

377;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-07-31T16:08:04Z;ICE shifts OTC energy swaps to futures;;Intercontinental Exchange, the transatlantic exchange and clearing house operator, will convert all its cleared over-the-counter energy contracts into futures as the company responds to greater post-financial crisis regulation.The development is one of the biggest signs that some OTC markets could shift over to the listed futures markets – where there are fewer concerns about counterparty risk and where trading costs are cheaper.It could be followed by similar moves from other exchange operators that clear swaps, such as CME Group.The move will benefit ICE, since it will force traders to use its proprietary listed products, rather than giving them the freedom to clear their swap contracts at any clearing house, as new rules stipulate.It could be detrimental to the banking sector, which has historically benefited from selling customised swaps to a range of customers seeking to hedge their risks in the market.Although some customers may continue to use bespoke swaps, many could follow a similar strategy using standardised futures.ICE currently clears energy swaps such as crude and refined oil, natural gas, electric power and natural gas liquids.The company said that, from January, all North American natural gas, electric power, environmental products and natural gas liquids swaps will be listed on its US futures exchange while oil products, freight and iron-ore swaps will be listed on its London exchange.The move comes ahead of regulatory reforms that are likely to take effect by next year in the US.The new rules, which are aimed at making the $650tn swaps market more transparent, demand that most swaps be cleared.However, the new regulations will also make it more expensive to trade swaps because margin requirements will be higher than for listed futures contracts. Similar rules are being drafted in Europe and Asia.If traders continue to use swaps in the same way, they will have to put up some $2,000bn in collateral under the new rules, according to a report by the Tabb Group, a research organsation.Three-fifths of respondents to the survey said they would consider using futures instead of swaps if the rules made the latter much more costly.ICE said it was responding to the higher costs swaps traders will incur under the new regime.“Based upon our extensive analysis of new swap rules and consultations with a wide variety of customers, we believe that these policies will increase the cost and complexity for swaps market participants, both in absolute terms and relative to that of futures market participants,” said Chuck Vice, ICE president and chief operating officer.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst at Raymond James Equity Research, said ICE’s initiative reflected the similarity between traditional futures markets and increasingly standardised OTC markets, where contracts are moving to a centrally traded and cleared model.“The move is being billed as a response to increased regulations of the OTC derivatives market … but we believe the transition makes sense regardless as there is little difference between cleared OTC products and futures contracts trading on ICE Futures Europe,” Mr O’Shaughnessy said.
378;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-07-26T20:14:11Z;ICE to close New York trading floor;;The ICE Futures US exchange plans to bring the curtain down on an era in New York commodities markets by ending open-outcry trading on its floor this year.The bourse, formerly the New York Board of Trade, is the main venue for US futures and options on cocoa, coffee, cotton, orange juice and sugar. A predecessor was the scene of the frenzied climax to the 1983 film Trading Places.IntercontinentalExchange, which bought the exchange in 2007, said yesterday that from October 22 all options listed on ICE Futures US will trade exclusively through its electronic trading system.The decision is the latest chapter in the decline of open-outcry futures markets, where traders gesture and shout across pits to trade.ICE shifted all futures trading to computers more than four years ago but allowed the floor to remain as a venue for options on futures.Options, which give the holder the right to buy or sell futures contracts at a set price before a fixed date, have been seen as too complex to trade on computers alone. Traders have flocked to screens in the past year, however. The share of electronically executed options volumes rose from 10 per cent in April 2011 to more than 75 per cent on ICE.Ben Jackson, ICE Futures US president , said: “The rapid adoption of electronic trading by options market participants is strong validation of the capabilities ICE has built into its electronic trading platform.”In January, ICE imposed a $6,000 annual access and usage fee on floor traders who failed to meet volume targets. About 100 floor traders remain today, down from 150 a year ago and 330 when ICE ended floor-based futures trading in March 2008.“I don’t see how the floor closing better serves the customer or the merchant that uses options products,” said Thomas Butler, a cotton broker who chairs the ICE executive floor committee. “I feel it was a little bit premature, but inevitable.”The New York Board of Trade moved into the space in 2003, after the September 11 attacks destroyed its former home in the World Trade Center.ICE Futures US rents the space on the seventh floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange building from arch-rival CME Group under a lease that expires in June 2013.IntercontinentalExchange plans to move in 2013 to office space in Manhattan that was formerly occupied by collapsed futures broker MF Global, according to people briefed on its plans. An electronic “dealing room” will be available for brokers who need one, the exchange said.Just over a year ago extreme volatility in soft commodities lured some oil options traders to the ICE floor, whose history dates back to the New York Cotton Exchange, founded in 1870, and what later become the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. The two merged to form the New York Board of Trade in 1998.

Excluding extraordinary items, net income was $296m or 89 cents per share, down from $563m or $1.70 per share last year, but ahead of Wall Street expectations of about 82 cents per share.The fall in profits underlines the challenges facing the company. First, trading volumes have dipped. Some 12.4m contracts changed hands at CME in the second quarter, down from 13.5m in the same period in 2011.Second, CME is fighting to restore customer confidence in the futures markets after two recent high-profile broker collapses that left big holes in customer accounts.The company was rocked by the failure this month of Peregrine Financial Group, an Iowa-based futures broker, whose collapse exposed a $200m shortfall in its customer segregated accounts.The collapse of Peregrine came eight months after the downfall of MF Global left some $1.6bn in customer funds missing. Brokers are obliged to segregate and protect customer funds.Both cases have eroded customers’ trust in the futures markets. “This fraud, following MF Global, has shaken the very core of our industry,” Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman and president, told a hearing of the US House of Representatives Agriculture Committee on Wednesday.CME says it is considering a proposal to strip futures brokers of the right to hold customer funds beyond the amount needed to back trading positions. Currently, excess customer money is held by brokers, which are permitted to reinvest the funds and collect interest.CME said this week it could instead hold the excess funds in its clearing house and return just the interest to the brokers. It is far from clear, however, that such a move would restore customer confidence.“It has been a challenging year for the financial industry,” Mr Duffy said on Thursday. “In light of recent events, we have intensified our efforts in working closely with Congress, regulators and the entire futures industry to strengthen customer protections and ensure the integrity of these critical markets.”CME this month underwent a 5-for-1 stock split intended to attract more investors to buy the exchange groups’ shares.
380;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-07-25T21:33:21Z;LME members approve sale to HKEx;;Shareholders in the London Metal Exchange on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to sell the historic exchange to Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing for £1.4bn ($2.1bn).The sale is the latest move in a wave of consolidation that has swept the global exchanges industry.It marks the end of the LME’s 135-year history as a member-owned exchange – one of the last such in the world – which began in the 19th century when traders gathered in coffee houses in the City of London to deal in metals.It will catapult HKEx, whose focus has until now been almost exclusively on equity markets, into the global league of exchanges, challenging established players such as CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) for dominance in commodity futures.Charles Li, HKEx chief executive, said: “Our shared vision for global leadership in the commodities market will allow us to respectfully build on the proud heritage of this unique institution.”The £1.4bn bid was approved by 99.2 per cent of shareholders – largely the banks and brokers who use the exchange – voting at an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday, with an almost full turnout of 99.6 per cent.The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, conditional on approval from the UK’s Financial Services Authority, although Sir Brian Bender, LME chairman, said that so far “no red flags” had been raised.HKEx triumphed last month in a global bidding war for the LME as the industry’s heavyweights, including ICE, CME Group and NYSE Euronext, vied to buy the metals exchange.Mr Li has pledged not to move the LME from London and to keep its open-outcry trading floor, where dealers shout orders to one another – known as the “ring” – the last such in Europe.People familiar with the matter said the few dissenters at Wednesday’s vote were likely to be small industrial users of the LME. Gabriela Grillo, who represents such users on the LME’s board, voted against the idea of selling the exchange at a meeting last month, the people said.The sale will deliver a windfall to the banks and brokers who own the LME. At £1.4bn, JPMorgan would receive £151m for its shares, Goldman Sachs would get £132m and the Bagri family, owners of Metdist, would receive £130m.At £1.4bn, HKEx is paying a multiple of 180 times last year’s LME earnings.
381;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-07-23T22:07:05Z;CME explores ways to hold customer funds;;Futures brokers could be stripped of the right to hold customer funds beyond the amount needed to back trading positions under a proposal floated by CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange operator.The move is aimed at restoring confidence in the industry following two high-profile broker collapses that left big holes in customer accounts.Peregrine Financial Group, an Iowa-based futures broker, failed this month, exposing a $200m shortfall in its customer segregated accounts, eight months after the downfall of MF Global left some $1.6bn in customer funds missing. Brokers are obliged to segregate and protect customer funds.Both cases have eroded customers’ trust in the current system, under which excess customer money is held by brokers, which are permitted to reinvest the funds and collect interest.In a letter sent to customers on Monday, Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, and Phupinder Gill, chief executive, said they were “appalled by the recent misuse of [customers’] segregated funds”.The letter acknowledged that Peregrine and MF Global had implications far beyond any alleged wrongdoing. “While these firms may have been at fault, it’s nevertheless our problem as an industry, and this problem needs a solution,” Mr Duffy and Mr Gill wrote. “Not protecting customer funds is such a fundamental breach of trust that, without question, the current system in which customer funds are held at the firm level must be re-evaluated.“We are exploring the concept of having clearing houses or other depositories hold all customer segregated funds while returning any interest earned on that money back to the [futures brokers], increasing protections while preserving the operating model for the vast majority of firms who respect and comply by the rules.”Retaining customer funds at CME’s clearing house but allowing brokers to collect interest may allay some concerns among brokerages that they will be denied a source of revenue.However, a representative of traders affected by MF Global was unimpressed by the measure.“Centralising everything at CME and creating one gigantic point of contact ends up putting the government and ultimately taxpayers on the hook if CME fails,” said James Koutoulas, head of Typhon Capital Management, a commodity trading advisory that had accounts at both Peregrine and MF Global. “CME is now considered too big too fail.”A financial oversight council created by the new Dodd-Frank regulations last week named CME one of a handful of “systemically important” financial market institutions.Separately, a top regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a letter to Congressional leaders on Monday that lawmakers must create an insurance fund to protect futures industry customers.Bart Chilton, a CFTC commissioner, said in a letter that unlike banking and securities customers, futures customers have no federal insurance protection available to them and that they “deserve to be better protected by such an insurance fund”.Additional reporting by Shahien Nasiripour
382;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-07-10T19:43:36Z;Peregrine woes exacerbate industry gloom;;As senior futures traders made the rounds at a CME Group customer golf outing outside Chicago on Monday the mood was bleak: another broker was in deep trouble.Russell Wasendorf Sr, founder of Peregrine Financial Group, had reportedly attempted suicide that morning outside company headquarters in nearby Iowa. He was found with a note “saying he had done something wrong,” the company later said.The suicide attempt alerted regulators to what has now become the second instance in a year of what was once unthinkable in the futures market: that millions of dollars worth of segregated customer money had gone missing.The futures industry, centred around CME’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade exchanges but traded worldwide, was already reeling after last October’s collapse of MF Global, the broker-dealer led by former Goldman Sachs chief Jon Corzine.The disappearance of $1.6bn in customer funds from MF Global “dealt a severe blow to the public’s confidence in the financial integrity of our futures markets,” the National Futures Association self-regulatory body said in a filing last May.A smaller amount – $200m – is missing from Peregrine. But the reason is in some ways more alarming as regulators say the customer shortfall existed for years. Civil charges were laid against Mr Wasendorf and Peregrine in a Chicago federal court on Tuesday.The news threatens to overtake the futures industry’s efforts to mend itself after the MF Global collapse and motivate Washington to take a harder line in protecting customer funds. The NFA had previously failed to detect shortfalls regulators now say dated to February 2010. One possible change is the establishment of an insurance fund such as the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which guarantees the accounts of stock traders.“It’s a blow on top of a blow that’s already taken place,” says Fred Grede, the bankruptcy trustee for Sentinel Management Group, a futures broker that left behind a $600m customer shortfall when it failed in 2007. “I guess my fear is that this is going get taken out of the hands of the futures industry.”John Roe, partner at BTR Trading, a high-frequency futures group, says: “We are aghast of the regulators who are supposedly protecting customer property. The only thing that protects against this type of fraud is account insurance.”Peregrine, which branded itself PFGBest, was a smaller broker in a sector where declining interest rates and shrinking commissions has made business difficult.Mr Wasendorf is a prominent leader in the futures circuit, having built Peregrine over the past 40 years from a group that hosted seminars and educational programmes on futures to a company that held – or was supposed to have held – $400m on behalf of clients.“Toughness and rugged ability to navigate highly challenging markets is part of our DNA,” a letter from Mr Wasendorf says on the Peregrine website.At the golf outing at the Glen Club, “most people were looking around dumbfounded and with pure surprise that something like that happened,” a participant says. “Regardless of what was taking place at the company, Russ was a well-known figure and there was a lot of concern about his situation.”
383;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-06-29T16:38:08Z;Hopes wilt for bumper US corn harvest;Heatwave threatens large chunk of the crop;"The most intensive planting of corn in 75 years has done little to assuage fears a heatwave will wilt a significant chunk of this year’s US crop.The US Department of Agriculture said on Friday that US farmers seeded 96.4m acres with corn this spring, the most since 1937 and 541,000 acres more than they told government surveyors in early March.But many of the biggest increases took place in states such as Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and Ohio where temperatures above 38ºC (100ºF) are now sapping life from stalks entering a fragile pollination phase.Analysts say the heat will likely cut how much each field yields, eroding the potential boost from higher acreage at a time when global corn stocks are relatively low.The USDA said it expected farmers would harvest only 88.9m acres of corn, lowering its estimate from mid-June.“The acreage was won and lost in all the wrong places in this report,” said Nick Higgins, commodity analyst at Rabobank.US farmers also boosted soya plantings, devoting 76.1m acres to the oilseed, up 1 per cent from last year to the third highest amount on record. The soya crop, which is crushed into vegetable oil and into livestock feed, is not yet as vulnerable to heat as corn but farmers are wary.The outlook for the US corn and soyabean crops is critical to global food prices and the agribusiness industry because the country supplies almost half of global corn exports and a third of the world’s soyabean exports. Demand for both has risen as consumers in emerging countries eat more meat.CBOT December corn, against which the bulk of this year’s crop will be delivered, rose as much as 18 per cent on the week to $6.55 a bushel before paring gains by midday on Friday. CBOT November soyabeans, the new crop contract, was up 3.6 per cent on the week to $14.25½ a bushel.Prices for the corn crop left over from last year’s harvest also rose after a separate USDA survey showed that the country’s silos contained less corn than the market had anticipated. The USDA counted 3.15bn bushels of corn in farm bins and commercial elevators as of June 1, down 14 per cent from the same date last year.All eyes were on thermometers in the US Midwest, however. “We’ve seen the report; now let’s go back to trading weather,” said Rich Nelson, director of research at broker Allendale.Friday marked the first time the market-moving acreage and stocks reports appeared during trading, after exchange operator CME Group extended its grain trading session to 21 hours a day."
384;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;US approves first swap trade repository;;US regulators have approved the first data warehouses for storing details of derivatives trades as they look to comply with looming deadlines in legislation that will reshape off-exchange dealing.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday granted provisional approval for a trade repository owned by IntercontinentalExchange, the futures trading platform.The warehouse, called ICE Trade Vault, will collect information on swaps data as the industry builds the infrastructure needed to comply with new trading rules.The Group of 20 has mandated that many opaque, off-exchange derivatives trades move on to electronic venues, with deals processed through clearing houses and their details reported to trade repositories.The CFTC’s approval for ICE Trade Vault comes ahead of a deadline for US regulators to begin receiving data from clearing houses under G20 agreements and the terms of the Dodd-Frank Act.CME Group, a rival futures exchange operator to ICE, has also made an application to the CFTC.DTCC, the principal US clearing and settlement house, is also making a strong push into the market.Bruce Tupper, head of ICE Trade Vault, said: “Global market participants will benefit from our functionality and compliance tools, which will help them manage new reporting requirements through a well designed, cost efficient solution.”But others in the sector have worried that a proliferation of venues around the world, each containing trade details, may serve to complicate rather than simplify the tracking process.Issues surrounding the number of global trade repositories, their location and joint technical standards have been the subject of prolonged debate since the efforts began.Some say that even with all the data recorded, the new practices will rely on consistent scanning and understanding of large quantities of information. All of which, they say, throws into question whether the efforts can prevent another financial meltdown.After testing its trial system in the spring, ICE said it expects to launch the trade repository later this year. The company said the service would reach more than 250 of its customers, which include brokers.
385;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-06-27T00:16:46Z;Brewery Beat: IDX worries over regulatory reach;;Many of the top luminaries from the derivatives world met in London on Tuesday with one thought uppermost in mind – if we were doing business here, what US laws could affect us?The background to this year’s International Derivatives Exchange conference in London, held on the site of a former brewery in the City, was comments made last week by Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, who said that London’s light-touch regulation serves as a “loophole” for US banks trading over-the-counter derivatives.Regulators are working through the mind-numbing complexity of turning a G20 mandate to move more of the OTC market on to electronic trading venues into practical reality. Mr Gensler worried that US banks could exploit the UK regulators’ legal inability to patrol the loophole and wants to apply US rules as laid down in broad terms by the vast Dodd-Frank act. As a regulator, he wants a system to cover when things went wrong. His duty is to US taxpayers and to avoid future bailouts, he said.It has been clear for a while that other regulators and derivatives industry executives have had issues with defining when regulatory jurisdiction extends beyond physical borders, a concept known as extraterritoriality.What concerns many is that the CFTC could end up policing the world’s derivatives markets, which would likely affect London. In the wake of Mr Gensler’s comments, the industry and regulators queued up on Tuesday to remind each other of their concerns in case they had forgotten.David Lawton, acting director of markets at the Financial Services Authority, the UK regulator, kicked off proceedings by saying international consistency was one of the most difficult but important aspects of the reforms. The FSA’s policy, he said, was to avoid extraterritorial application of its rules outside the UK. It preferred “substituted compliance”, which relies on local jurisdictions applying equivalent regulations.“In our view this is the best way to reduce a potential conflict of laws. It avoids creating a situation where our or other regulators’ rules cannot be enforced effectively owing to a lack of jurisdiction,” he said. He also called for a global system of regulation for the OTC derivatives market based upon mutual recognition or substituted compliance where possible.The call for resolution was reiterated by Phupinder Gill, chief executive of the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange.“Everybody wants to get clarity from the CFTC,” he said. “There is sometimes an assumption in the US that the rest of the world does not know what they are doing. This is the US’s way.”The CFTC struck a conciliatory tone. Ananda Radhakrishnan, the CFTC’s director of clearing and risk, spoke of the need to strike a balance between the requirements of Dodd-Frank and the pushback from other regulators around the world.“The statute gave us, I am trying to be charitable, an uncomfortable task. I am not sure whether we can say we can have no cross-border reach at all,” he said.Yet even as the industry expressed its concerns, there have been hints that regulators are working behind the scenes to come to some agreement, such as delays in the publication of rules.Last week the CFTC was supposed to publish draft rules covering overseas banks but postponed that. On Monday the European Securities Markets Authority, the pan-European regulator, published its consultation document for the draft technical standards for a key piece of financial markets regulation covering clearing houses, known as the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (Emir). Yet Esma left out the extraterritoriality issue and said it was working on a separate consultation paper to be released “in the near future” to address the issue of the extraterritorial application of Emir.Mr Lawton used the term “substituted compliance”, a phrase little heard until Mr Gensler used it 10 days ago. “We are not at the finishing line yet but I remain optimistic we will get a mutually satisfactory finishing point,” Mr Lawton said in his speech.As John Damgard, former head of the Futures Industry Association, a US trade group, noted in his introductory remarks, the industry was having to deal with many issues, from low volumes to falling profits and a wave of regulation. The failure of MF Global also still pains the industry. For many, certainty cannot come soon enough.
386;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
387;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-06-26T19:24:17Z;CBOT sued over new grain price settings;;Two dozen pit traders at the Chicago Board of Trade are suing the exchange to block a new way of calculating grain prices, in the latest sign of friction over electronic futures dealing.CBOT, owned by exchange operator CME Group, on Monday combined quotes from computer screens with prices from its floor pits to calculate official closing prices for all grains and oilseeds. Before, corn and soyabeans were settled in the pits while rice, oats and the main wheat contracts were settled exclusively on screens.CME’s move came after the US commodities regulator questioned the integrity of basing settlement prices in the pits alone. CBOT said it made the changes “as trading in our markets evolves. We believe the new settlement methodology accurately captures contract value across both the open outcry and electronic trading venues during the settlement period”.Electronic trading now comprises more than 80 per cent of the volume in benchmark grain futures, up from percentages in the single-digits six years ago. The new settlement method is the latest reaction to this shift. The exchange recently lengthened its grain trading day to 21 hours from 17 as traders connect around the globe, a move that unnerved traditionalist grain merchants.In a civil lawsuit filed in a state court in Chicago, the pit traders said the change threatened their incomes and could spell the end of the open-outcry system of trading agricultural futures. The CME, however, wants the case to be decided in a US federal court instead and arguments on this issue were heard on Tuesday .In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs said their main livelihood was trading and filling orders in Chicago’s open-outcry market, especially during the closing period when prices settle.Under the new settlement policy, most floor traders “will lose the vast majority of their business almost immediately and will have to close their operations forever,” said the lawsuit. “As a result of this rule change, hundreds of jobs supported by these traders, including their clerks, runners, information technology and other support staff will – and are being – eliminated”.The traders also claimed the exchange did not honour a requirement to let exchange members, which include some plaintiffs, vote on the new policy before it took hold.“We believe CME and CBOT did not follow their own rules,” said George Sang, an attorney for the plaintiffs.CME declined to comment specifically on the litigation.

Despite a slump in the price of oil and other minerals as global growth slows, currencies of countries that are big commodity exporters have failed to follow. In fact, they have been holding up rather well.The “commodity currencies” – those belonging to industrialised nations with large net exports of commodities such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway – have fallen just 3 per cent-4 per cent against the US dollar in the past three months. By contrast, Brent crude has fallen 26 per cent, thermal coal has dropped 18 per cent, and copper is down 12 per cent.That has created what analysts at Deutsche Bank call an “extreme dislocation” between commodity currencies and the prices of raw materials.The move has caught out some hedge funds, who were selling currencies such as the Australian dollar as a bet on falling commodity prices and weaker growth.It is also creating a problem for commodity producers in countries such as Australia and Canada by keeping their local-currency denominated costs high even as their dollar-denominated revenues tumble in line with prices.There is a simple explanation for the mismatch. Investors typically hunt for yield, and the commodity currencies are among the highest yielders of the industrialised nations.Real interest rates are still above zero in Australia, which has the highest nominal rates of any industrialised nation at 3.5 per cent. That helps to explain why, despite recent rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia, the currency has remained supported.Derek Sammann, head of currency and interest rate products at CME Group, says that trading volumes in the Australian dollar have “gone through the roof”.“The yield differential is a significant driver of that,” he says. But there is also a shift taking place that has inflated the value of some of the most important commodity currencies.Commodity currencies belong to among the few triple-A rated assets left for investors and central bank reserve managers desperate to diversify away from the eurozone.The New Zealand dollar got a boost in recent weeks after Moody’s reaffirmed its AAA status at the end of May. Australia, Canada and Norway are also among the dwindling number of industrialised nations that still hold cherished triple-A ratings.That is an important factor for central bank reserve managers and other conservative investors such as pension funds, many of whom have a mandate to invest only in the most secure assets.“Central banks are buying the last remaining AAA-rated sovereign bonds following the downgrades in the eurozone at the start of the year,” says Mansoor Mohi-uddin at UBS.While central banks hold most of their reserves in dollars and euros, nearly all are seeking to diversify their assets. Central banks including Russia and the Czech Republic have recently announced they are adding the “Aussie” to their reserves. Traders say the New Zealand dollar and Scandinavian currencies have caught the attention of reserve managers.The shift is helping to support smaller currencies such as the Australian dollar even as the commodity cycle turns and growth slows, creating problems for producers, from Australian coal miners to Canadian oil companies.Stronger local currencies hurt producers by inflating their costs; in general, however, that effect is offset by a rise in commodity prices.“The way producers look at currency is as a natural hedge,” says George Cheveley, natural resources portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management. “Some people are confused because it’s not working how they expected.”The effect is to make projects in countries such as Australia and Canada less competitive, says Colin Hamilton, senior commodities analyst at Macquarie.“Given where the commodities cycle has been you would have expected the Aussie dollar to be $0.90,” says Mr Hamilton. “That affects capex investments in the medium term.”Not all commodity currencies are created equal. The Australian dollar has held up in part because of the nation’s large exports of iron ore, which has barely fallen in price. New Zealand’s currency has held up this year because it is a net importer of oil, which has fallen sharply, and a net exporter of soft commodities, where falls have been muted.But if natural resources prices continue to slide, the economies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand would eventually look less secure, some analysts say.Schroders is avoiding commodity currencies in its foreign exchange portfolios based on the assumption they will, over the medium term, follow commodity prices lower. Analysts at Deutsche Bank also believe that commodity currencies will soon follow falling exports in their countries, and are advising investors to steer clear for now.“I think there is scope for catch up,” says George Saravelos, foreign exchange analyst at Deutsche Bank."
389;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-06-19T21:34:56Z;Savvis to double data centre capacity;;Savvis, the US data centre operator, is to double its global capacity as its struggles to meet soaring demand from banks and investors wanting to outsource more trading infrastructure.The group, owned by New York Stock Exchange-listed CenturyLink, will open new sites in London and Singapore and add further capacity at five other sites in London and the US in coming months.Savvis’s rapid expansion illustrates how becalmed equity markets, fierce competition from new entrants and lowered bank profitability are leading many trading firms and brokers to outsource more of their trading infrastructure.Data centres, often unremarkable buildings from the outside, have become key battlegrounds for the industry as it seeks to create digital trading hubs. By transmitting and receiving thousands of messages and quotes in one location, they seek to replicate the physical trading floor, although trades are conducted in microseconds.The industry has divided between exchanges such as CME Group, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, and NYSE Euronext which own their own data centres and those which outsource to companies like Savvis and Equinix. Those which own their own sites can charge rent, opening up a lucrative market servicing investors who want to place their equipment next to exchange servers.The new Savvis sites at London Docklands and Singapore will open on June 30 and August 1 respectively. Bill Fathers, president of Savvis, said, “We’re still not expanding at the rate of market growth.” Financial services accounts for around 20-25 per cent of the group’s total revenues.Savvis’s expansion also illustrates that the trends in trading and technology which have swept through equity markets in recent years are beginning to seep into other asset classes. Executing deals are frequently conducted in fractions of seconds, often by algorithms. Banks also face pressure on IT costs amid lower profitability and tougher liquidity requirements.Neil Cresswell, managing director of Savvis Europe, Middle East and Africa, said there was increasing demand in Europe. “The demand profile is changing,” he told FT Trading Room. “Trading in different asset classes is coming. FX has taken off in the last year, while there’s interest in rates and fixed income, commodities.”
390;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;HKEx agrees to buy LME for £1.4bn;;The head of the London Metal Exchange is set to make up to £10m after the institution agreed to be sold to Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing on Friday.HKEx agreed to buy the 135-year-old LME, the centre for global metals trading, for £1.4bn in a deal that will catapult the Chinese group into the global league of exchanges.Martin Abbott, a former broker who has been LME chief executive since 2006, is due to receive the payout as part of a long-term incentive scheme that vests if the sale goes ahead.While the exact value of the shares has not been disclosed, people familiar with the matter said it would be close to £10m if the deal was approved by UK regulators and 75 per cent of LME shareholders. The potential payout has raised eyebrows among some LME shareholders, who believe the sale may not be in their best interests.But earlier this year Mr Abbott told the Financial Times the suggestion he wanted to sell the LME was “absurd . . . I’d really like to stay on and finish what we started”. HKEx said it intended to retain the LME management team.Although the LME is a private company, the prospective payout comes amid a wave of investor protestover executive pay.This week, WPP shareholders delivered a rare rebuke to Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive, voting against the company’s remuneration policies.Sir Brian Bender, LME chairman, defended the payout, saying: “This is in the context of a scheme linked to value creation, notably the share price.”HKEx has triumphed in a global bidding war for the LME as the industry’s heavyweights, including IntercontinentalExchange, CME Group and NYSE Euronext, vied to buy one of the last member-owned exchanges.“This is an opportunity that you only get once in 100 years,” said Charles Li, chief executive of HKEx.Mr Li has pledged not to move the LME from London and to keep its open-outcry trading floor, where dealers shout orders to one another – known as the “ring” – the last such in Europe.The sale would also deliver a windfall to the banks and brokers who own the LME. At £1.4bn, JPMorgan would receive £151m for its shares, Goldman Sachs would get £132m and the Bagri family, owners of Metdist, would receive £130m.HKEx is paying a multiple of 180 times last year’s LME earnings and 22 times the last traded share price before the announcement.Alex Kramm, analyst at UBS, said: “Clearly from a multiple on … earnings this is a tough one to defend. But from a strategic perspective this is one of the last member-owned meaningful exchanges around the world.”The deal is being funded by a bridge loan from UBS, China Development Bank, Deutsche Bank and HSBC, but HKEx hopes to refinance this mostly with a equity issue after the deal has closed, according to a person close to the deal.The prospect of an acquisition by HKEx has unnerved some industry executives, because the Hong Kong government appoints six of its 13 directors and is the largest shareholder. Mr Li said: “The Chinese government is the Chinese government. We are in Hong Kong. It is completely separate.”Additional reporting by Paul J Davies in Hong Kong
391;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-06-14T17:27:20Z;MF Global clients to get $130m from CME;;The bankruptcy trustee charged with recouping the $1.6bn still owed to customers of MF Global, the failed broker-dealer, said he would receive $130m from CME Group.The US’s biggest futures exchange has agreed to return the money, out of a total of $175m worth of customer property held by the futures exchange, to help pay back former clients of the bankrupt company, the trustee James Giddens said on Thursday.MF Global filed for bankruptcy in October after making billions of dollars worth of wrong-way bets on the eurozone. The company’s chaotic collapse – involving hundreds of flurried last-minute transactions– eventually led to the broker-dealer dipping into segregated customers’ funds for the benefit of its own accounts.“This agreement supports my goal to expeditiously resolve outstanding conflicts with parties as we work to recover and distribute as much customer property as possible as quickly as possible, in a manner that is fair and consistent with the law,” said Mr Giddens, who represents MF Global’s US broker business.The CME agreement follows a similar accord reached with JPMorgan Chase last month. MF Global’s erstwhile primary bank agreed to return $168m in cash to the trustee, but the two are still in talks about a much larger amount of funds.The trustee says that he has traced all of the $1.6bn of customer money and is currently negotiating its return to waiting customers. The agreement with CME is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court overseeing MF Global’s case.The exchange group has been accused by many customers of not offering adequate oversight of MF Global, for which it served as the industry’s self-regulatory body. CME says it was misled as to the amount of money MF Global had in its customer accounts and was only made aware of the shortfall when the broker filed for bankruptcy. The company is the target of at least four lawsuits filed by MF Global customers seeking damages for the losses they experienced.Last week Mr Giddens painted a frenetic picture of MF Global’s final days, in a 275-page report explaining what his legal team believes led to the broker-dealer’s dramatic failure at the end of October last year. The court-appointed trustee said he will decide with 90 days whether to sue Jon Corzine, MF Global’s former chief executive, and certain other staff members, for “breach of fiduciary duty and negligence”.The trustee may file his own suit or choose to join any one of the more than a dozen class action suits already filed by MF Global customers.
392;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-06-12T13:54:54Z;Soyabean prices rise on trimmed forecast;;Grain traders have successfully navigated the upheaval in commodities caused by the release for the first time in memory of sensitive monthly crop reports during dealing in US futures markets.The US Department of Agriculture on Tuesday updated supply and demand estimates for crops including corn and cotton, lowering forecasts for US soyabean stocks and raising its outlook for world corn production. The agency also trimmed its view of the American winter wheat crop.The monthly estimates are among the the most closely monitored barometers of food commodities markets. US futures exchanges including the Chicago Board of Trade, a unit of CME Group, last month expanded hours to allow trading through the reports, ending a halt that previously surrounded the releases.The new schedule has been embraced by electronic traders seeking an immediate chance to seize on sensitive crop data and alarmed others concerned about sharper price swings.Prices wobbled as the reports appeared at 7:30am Chicago time, with corn futures ranging between $5.99 and $5.75½ a bushel within a three-minute span. Markets then assumed steadier footing.CBOT July corn later declined 1.7 per cent to $5.81¾ a bushel, CBOT July wheat fell 2.3 per cent to $6.15¾ a bushel and CBOT July soyabeans gained 0.6 per cent to $14.33 a bushel.“In some ways, I think it was more orderly than what you get sometimes on a 9:30 opening,” said Jason Britt, president of broker Central States Commodities, referring to the previous reopening times at CBOT, the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Kansas City Board of Trade.Stronger demand from domestic crushing plants and importers such as China led the USDA to project 175m bushels of old soyabeans would be left over before this year’s harvest in the US, 16.7 per cent less than its previous forecast.The USDA reduced the estimated size of the American winter wheat crop by 1 per cent to 1.68bn bushels, a smaller cut than anticipated. In the coming year the agency sees lower world wheat production, “reflecting reduced crop prospects in several exporting countries” including Russia, Turkey, the US and wheat growers in Europe.However, global corn production would increase to a new record in the coming year, the USDA said. In the US, the biggest grower and exporter, corn stocks would next year more than double to 1.88bn bushels after farmers this year aimed to plant the most since 1937, the agency said.Analysts cautioned against reading too much into Tuesday’s reports, as a more accurate picture of crops in the northern hemisphere will not emerge until later in the growing season.Richard Feltes, vice-president of research at futures broker RJ O’Brien, said in a note on Monday: “You don’t pick the homecoming queen in the fourth grade”.
393;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-06-11T15:32:09Z;New grain trading hours spark anxiety;The change has caused concern across the agricultural world;When dealing with chunky crop reports from Washington, Tim Gubbels, a Nebraska grain elevator owner, sticks to a routine. He skims the data online, scrutinises broker commentary and types futures orders before the market opens two hours later, often furiously.With Tuesday’s latest set of market-moving crop statistics, he will have almost no time at all to react.The Chicago Board of Trade and smaller futures exchanges have just extended their hours to overlap with the US Department of Agriculture’s sensitive reports.The move meets the demands of ultra-fast traders using sophisticated computer technology to deal more quickly but raises questions over who commodity futures markets are meant to serve.“The fastest computer’s going to win as far as getting the information,” says Mr Gubbels, who buys corn, oats and soyabeans from local farmers. “At North Side Grain here in little Laurel, Nebraska, I can’t afford the fastest computer,” he says.The move to near 24-hour trading brings grain markets closer to other, bigger markets, such as oil and foreign exchange, that do not take breaks for data releases. “This will become the non-farm payrolls of the grain market,” says an executive at one proprietary trading firm.But the new trading hours have sparked anxiety across the agricultural world, from farmers and country grain merchants to officials at the USDA in Washington.The change comes amid increased scrutiny of computerised trading in commodities, particularly the impact of so-called “high frequency” strategies in which speculators dart in and out of the market in fractions of a second.The concerns run beyond the grain community. One US hedge fund manager with large positions in agriculture called the new hours a “mistake”, saying crop futures are not liquid enough to trade almost round the clock. “The grain markets are not the FX markets and they are not the global bond markets,” he says.The reform was set in motion last month, when the Intercontinental-Exchange listed five grain contracts that duplicate Chicago grain futures. They were offered 22 hours per day, five more than Chicago, “making electronic trading available during important events like crop reports”, the ICE web site says.Chicago-based CBOT, home to world benchmark grain futures, responded with its own 22-hour day for electronic trading, since trimmed to 21 after grain merchants complained. Exchange owner CME Group then extended floor trading on crop report days such as Tuesday to let open-outcry options traders in on the action.The schedule means crop reports that serve as monthly applications of market dynamite will now appear in the thick of trading. USDA economists estimate soyabean and wheat traders average a return on collateral of more than 20 per cent on crop report days late in harvest season.Dave Smoldt, vice-president at broker FC Stone, says that when the reports hit “people may react to one number, then the other numbers follow and they realise overall the report isn’t quite as bullish or bearish as people thought”.And analysts accustomed to having two hours to digest the USDA’s 40-page monthly supply and demand estimates will now have to pass judgment after the market has already delivered its verdict. “This change is going to force analysts to be less confident in what they write,” says Richard Feltes, vice-president at broker RJ O’Brien.USDA, aware of its market impact, is seeking comment on whether to adjust report release times. It has a history of doing so: in 1994, the agency shifted the publication time for its crop supply report to the early US morning in response to complaints that traders in Tokyo, not Chicago, were getting the first chance to act on its numbers.Yet, for all the complaints, other markets still function amid a stream of complicated, and sometimes contradictory, government data. In agricultural markets, as well, New York-based cotton futures and Paris-based wheat futures have long been open while the USDA publishes its monthly reports.Scott Irwin, a University of Illinois professor of agricultural economics, says: “I don’t see it as being any more complicated than the unemployment report or the CPI release or the Fed minutes being released.”
394;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-06-11T08:50:20Z;LME race heads to nail biting finale;The winner is ‘too close to call’ ahead of board decision;It has been a long nine months since the bidding war for the London Metal Exchange kicked off. But anyone who has stuck with the drama of the contest has been rewarded with a nail biter.On Thursday the two finalists, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing and IntercontinentalExchange, resubmitted their bids. Following a preliminary look by the LME’s bid committee that evening, the metals exchange’s board is this week expected to make a choice – at long last.The conversations I have had over the past few days suggest that the decision will be a difficult one. “Too close to call” is the verdict of several people I have spoken to who are well acquainted with the board’s deliberations.The future of the LME matters. The 135-year-old exchange is the place where the price is set for metals from copper (found in almost every electric wire) to aluminium (used to make aircraft, trains and fizzy drinks cans). It is also an important City of London institution, directly and indirectly sustaining thousands of jobs by ensuring that London is the centre of the global metals markets.The most obvious means of differentiation is price. But I am told the two bidders have submitted valuations for the LME that are too close for the money to be the deciding factor.The magic number shareholders have been talking about is £100 a share – which translates to a value for the whole exchange of £1.29bn. And they will probably get it. A couple of weeks ago, when CME Group dropped out of the race, both bidders were within range of that valuation.Even after last week’s “final” bids, there is still time for the bidders to put more on the table (there is always time for that). Nonetheless, shareholders should not hope for wildly higher valuations: £100 a share is 168 times last year’s net profit, already a heady number. Any bidder paying much more than that may be forced to make significant changes to the LME’s model to get a suitable return on its investment.If not the money, then what? Simply put, the LME must decide which prospective owner it would prefer.There is not much in it. Both bidders are proposing to keep the LME’s open outcry trading floor, its warehousing network, its daily contracts, and members’ involvement in day-to-day decision making. Both have credible plans to boost the LME’s trading volumes: HKEx through its links to China, ICE through its admirable expertise in clearing and technology.After two weeks of meetings between shareholders and bidders, it is my sense that HKEx is slightly preferred by the members. But there is no overwhelming consensus, and indeed many shareholders have not expressed a strong preference, instead leaving the board to decide.If it were a football game, this would be the penalty shoot-out.The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
395;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-06-09T05:29:49Z;Anger and loss of trust follow US bankruptcy;A wave of new rules may not close the matter;James Giddens, the bankruptcy trustee for MF Global, could be forgiven for stating the obvious last month when he called for stronger customer safeguards for the futures industry.Mr Giddens was the latest voice in a growing chorus demanding that the industry beefs up regulation of its markets, widely viewed as essential if it is to regain public trust following the collapse of the broker-dealer in October.Over seven months later, more than 30,000 of MF Global’s former customers are still unsure if they will receive back all the money from their accounts, after some $1.6bn was found to be missing from client funds – money that was apparently transferred from segregated customer accounts.In spite of several disbursements by Mr Giddens, most former MF Global customers are still waiting for more than one-quarter of their funds to be returned, their money frozen by the bankruptcy court.That has severely dented trust in the industry. As Daniel Roth, president of the National Futures Association (NFA), the self-regulatory organisation, put it earlier this year, MF Global’s bankruptcy “has dealt a severe blow to the public’s confidence in the financial integrity of our futures markets”.By dipping into segregated client funds, MF Global broke a cardinal rule of US futures markets – keeping customer cash separate from house funds. That action has reverberated across the industry.The incident is “the single biggest blow the industry has ever had to its business and credibility”, according to a former senior executive at CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange.In part, that reflects the size and influence MF Global had in the industry. The company was a dominant force in Chicago’s agricultural trading markets and the largest broker on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Moreover, it was headed by Jon Corzine, a former US senator, New Jersey governor and ex-chief executive of Goldman Sachs, whose idea of turning the broker into an investment bank was behind the risk-taking that ultimately led to its demise.Prior to MF Global, the industry often touted that through its 160-year history, investors had never lost money due to a broker default. The experience of MF Global has changed that, shaking customer confidence and bringing to light the notion that futures investors can quickly become victims if firms collapse.While futures brokers say many professional investors and institutions have returned to the futures markets, the MF Global saga has dampened interest in futures trading among retail investors and farmers, who traditionally use them to hedge the risk of selling agricultural produce at spot prices.Mr Corzine, once one of the most respected figures on Wall Street, has become a figure of loathing in the financial industry. Although he has not been formally accused of wrongdoing, many will not be satisfied until they see him personally punished. The former MF Global chief maintains that he never told anyone to take money from customer funds.Much customer anger has also been directed at CME. Although the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government regulator for US futures markets, CME, as a designated self-regulatory organisation, is the chief auditor for futures brokerages such as MF Global. It has been accused of failing to do its job diligently enough in the run-up to the firm’s collapse.The exchange group responds that no regulator can guarantee against deliberate fraud, and has resisted the idea that it should be stripped of its oversight role. “In the case of MF Global, we did everything we could within our regulatory power, but MF Global broke exchange rules and government regulations designed to protect customer funds. Because the firm failed to comply with regulations, that does not mean the system failed,” CME has said.Nevertheless, there is a widespread acceptance that the system of oversight must be changed in the wake of MF Global in order to restore customer trust. A range of new rules has emerged aimed at preventing anything similar happening again.In February, for example, CME announced a $100m protection fund for farmers and ranchers, designed to protect them in the case of the failure of a clearing firm.Similarly, Mr Giddens recommended this month a “modest protection fund” to aid futures customers in the event of a similar bankruptcy. Even setting a low cap for individual claims could help greatly, Mr Giddens said, noting that more than three-quarters of MF Global’s customers had claims of less than $100,000.The NFA proposed several measures last month, including what has become known as the “Corzine rule”. That would require the chief financial officer or another designated senior officer of a futures brokerage to give written approval for the withdrawal from customer accounts of more than 25 per cent of excess funds, the money brokers hold beyond the amount needed for margin.Like CME, the NFA also endorses stricter and more frequent reporting requirements for brokers to self-regulatory bodies. From last month, CME requires all brokers to file daily reports on the status of accounts, which must be signed off by their chief executive or chief financial officer.The NFA proposes that all futures brokers should have clear policies for handling excess funds held in customer segregated accounts. The CFTC has also proposed stricter rules on what brokers may do with excess customer funds, which they traditionally invest and collect returns. Ultimately, the CFTC will also be in charge of detailing and implementing proposals such as the “Corzine rule”.However, this wave of new rules may not close the matter. Jill Sommers, a CFTC commissioner, expects that the US Congress will also propose legislation to strengthen the protection of customer funds in futures broker bankruptcies.
396;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Barclays clears $1tn of OTC derivatives;;Barclays has cleared more than $1tn worth of over-the-counter derivatives arranged with clients globally, the latest in a series of moves as some asset managers rush to embrace some forms of clearing as a way to relieve burdens on stressed capital.The clearing of interest rate, credit and foreign exchange swaps via CME Group, LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear unit, and IntercontinentalExchange’s ICE Credit Clear comes well ahead of the final version of the Dodd-Frank Act rules that will require a bulk of the swaps market to be centrally cleared.“While this volume of clearing is significant, we believe it is only a very small portion of what will be cleared as regulatory deadlines approach and more clients move to a centrally-cleared model,” said Ray Kahn, head of OTC derivatives clearing at Barclays.He added that more investment by the industry in the ability to clear was needed before the final Dodd-Frank rules came into place, set to be later this year. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is first considering the definitions of swaps before it sets final clearing requirements.Regulators in the US, Europe and Asia have been pushing banks and their clients to stop privately negotiating the payment flows on swaps contracts and instead move them into central clearing houses, so that they can reduce counterparty risk. The clearing house stands between the parties and collects collateral and margin.Some banks have feared this shift will eat into the substantial revenues generated by assuming clients’ clearing risks, and that clearing will force standardisation on the market because clearing houses will not want to assume the risks of bespoke contracts. Banks earn higher fees on bespoke trades.The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a trade body controlled by banks, has warned that a proliferation of clearing houses could increase costs for market participants and concentrate risk.But a number of banks have been increasing the flow of their client business that goes through third parties, both due to client demands as asset managers such as BlackRock and Pimco build up their clearing capacity, but also in order to reduce their own capital needs.Barclays said that it had cleared 11,000 contracts, with a notional value of $1tn, on behalf of regional banks, fund managers, pensions, insurers, government agencies and hedge funds. Barclays also said the clearing was processed via its BARX electronic trading platform. The clearing unit sits within Barclays’ prime services unit.The bulk of cleared client swaps have been interest rate swaps, and Barclays has made up a substantial share of it. SwapClear and CME Group have cleared some $2tn between them, though that is just a fraction of the larger dealer-to-dealer clearing market
397;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-24T01:41:58Z;Tax protests disrupt CME annual meeting;;Protesters disrupted CME Group’s annual shareholder meeting in Chicago, repeatedly challenging management about tax relief the company received from the state of Illinois.About 50 people threw the meeting into chaos before they were ejected, repeatedly chanting slogans such as “pay your fair share” and “give the money back”. They were objecting to a measure passed by the Illinois legislature last year to give tax relief to CME, Chicago Board Options Exchange and Sears, after the three companies threatened to leave the state.Illinois raised its corporate income tax rate from 7.3 per cent to 9.5 per cent last year as the state worked to tackle recurrent budget deficits, unfunded pension liabilities of at least $83bn and more than $8bn of unpaid bills to educational institutions and social welfare providers.The tax relief package effectively reversed that measure for the three companies, giving back $85m annually to CME and CBOE by levying tax only on financial transactions executed in the state of Illinois.Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, rejected the protesters characterisation of the tax relief. “There’s a perception that we got a tax break,” he said. “That’s not true. We were being taxed on an outdated assumption that all our business was done in Illinois.”Mr Duffy said the measure had brought CME in line with other corporations operating in the state. “We pay all rates for the business we do in Illinois,” he said.After being ejected, the protesters joined a larger demonstration of about 500 teachers and activists, which quickly identified CME as a target. Demonstrators marched around downtown Chicago brandishing banners criticising CME and chanting against “corporate greed”.Earlier in the day, police arrested 15 protesters campaigning outside the Chicago Board of Trade building, where CME has its trading floor.At the meeting itself, a proposal by the Norwegian central bank, a shareholder, to allow shareholders to nominate director candidates for election was defeated, though 38 per cent of voting shareholders voted in favour.Mr Duffy was repeatedly asked in the meeting about CME’s handling of the MF Global bankruptcy and criticised for the way the exchange handled the transfer of some affected customer positions and for its communications in the wake of the broker-dealer’s collapse last year. Mr Duffy trenchantly defended CME’s performance.
398;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:34:32+0000;Electronic trading comes to OTC oil swaps;;A group of brokers has signed on with exchange operator CME Group to offer electronic trading of over-the-counter oil swaps, a specialised market where most deals are still negotiated by telephone.CME said interdealer brokers including Marex Spectron, Tradition and Tullett Prebon had licensed technology allowing trading of the exchange operator’s benchmark energy futures on the same computer screen as oil swaps, which are traded less frequently and tailored to niche markets such as jet fuel or heating oil.The move comes as regulators are crafting rules for swap execution facilities, or Sefs, platforms open to a variety of traders that are required by the Dodd-Frank financial reforms. Voice brokers have fought to preserve their business model in face of a push towards futures-style electronic trading.While other over-the-counter energy markets such as natural gas have shifted to screen trading, oil remains dependent on phone transactions. Traders say the oil market’s multiplicity of products and delivery locations favours voice broking.“It’s a largely bespoke market, and it’s the combination of being bespoke and volatile that lends itself to the nuanced dealmaking that a voice broker can bring to the table,” said Mark Vonderheide, managing partner of Geneva Energy Markets, a New York oil swap dealer.CME’s new services follow other attempts to bring privately traded oil swaps markets into the electronic realm. The New York Mercantile Exchange, which was acquired by CME Group in 2008, discontinued oil trading on its ClearPort over-the-counter platform in the absence of volume. ClearPort survives as a tool for transferring the risk of OTC derivatives to the CME clearing house.ICAP, the interdealer broker, introduced a combined voice-electronic broking service for OTC oil swaps in 2010, using technology from IntercontinentalExchange. That exchange’s WebICE platform also offers futures and oil swaps trading on the same screen, though most swap trades are still handled by brokers.“We feel that it’s necessary and inevitable that screens become more prominent, but they haven’t because there hasn’t been the correct solution,” said Michael Anderson, global head of oil at Tradition. “A hybrid model between voice and screen is most likely to succeed long term in oil OTC.”CME’s technology, called CME Direct, comes from Elysian Systems, a London-based company that the exchange operator acquired in 2010. Brokers or their customers will be able to post prices on the OTC side of the platform, said Michel Everaert, CME managing director of OTC solutions.Mr Everaert said that while brokers using the technology would probably have to register as Sefs, it was not yet clear whether CME Direct would also meet the Sef definition.“At a minimum it’s a Sef aggregator,” he said.CME’s principal source of revenue from the over-the-counter part of the system will be fees for clearing trades, Mr Everaert said.

399;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-22T16:43:54Z;CME knocked out of race for LME;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange by value, has been knocked out of the running to acquire the London Metal Exchange after bidding £1.05bn ($1.65bn).The move to eliminate CME, which followed a meeting of the LME’s board on Friday, has narrowed the field to just two bidders: IntercontinentalExchange and Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing. The two have submitted bids of about £1.1bn-£1.2bn ($1.75bn-$1.9bn), according to people familiar with the matter, although there is still room for adjustment as they jostle for the lead.CME was the only one of the three remaining bidders already offering metals contracts. Its US copper contract, listed on its Comex division, is one of the LME’s few direct competitors. It has also expanded in recent years into the steel market, seen as one of the most important growth areas for commodities trading. CME declined to comment.NYSE Euronext, another US exchange group, was knocked out earlier after bidding about £800m.The 135-year-old LME is seen as one of the last prizes in a wave of consolidation in the exchanges industry. It hosts global benchmark contracts for metals from aluminium to zinc.The two remaining bidders are likely to have an opportunity to engage directly with shareholders in the coming weeks before the board selects one of them, according to two people familiar with the process. To succeed, any bid must win the support of three-quarters of the shares.In a statement, the LME said it had “decided to continue discussions with two parties regarding their proposals for the potential acquisition of the LME”.“This will involve obtaining a detailed understanding of their plans for the future governance and operation of the market and the deliverability of their respective proposals, as well as the value offered.”The LME’s shareholders – the largest of which are JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Metdist, a family-owned metals trader – will enjoy a windfall if the sale goes ahead.A valuation of £1.2bn represents about 19 times the last traded price before the sale process was announced in September, following an unsolicited approach by ICE.The focus will now turn to the bidders’ plans to expand the LME’s business.HKEx offers close ties to China, the world’s top consumer of metals, and could potentially help the LME register warehouses in China and to launch clearing in renminbi.ICE offers a large network of customers in Asia, the most important region for the industry, already trading commodities on the exchange through its benchmark Brent crude oil and gas contracts.
400;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-17T21:47:38Z;LME’s suitors’ bids pass £1bn mark;;The three remaining contenders to acquire the London Metal Exchange have all valued it at more than £1bn and promised to preserve its open outcry trading pit, setting the scene for a close-run contest as they attempt to snatch control of the historic bourse.The finalists in the bidding process, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEx) and CME Group, have offered similar valuations in a range of about £1bn-£1.2bn, people familiar with the situation said, although there is still time for bids to be adjusted. NYSE Euronext was eliminated last week after bidding about £800m.Still owned by the brokers and banks that use it, the 135-year-old LME is seen as one of the last prizes in a wave of consolidation in the exchanges industry. It hosts global benchmark contracts for metals from aluminium to zinc.Each bidder has also proposed to keep the LME’s idiosyncrasies– such as its “open outcry” trading, daily contracts and global network of warehouses – that are prized by members.Many feared a sale would lead to the closure of the exchange’s trading pit – known as “the ring” – the last in Europe where traders still shout orders to one another.The valuations, at the higher end of early expectations, together with the proposals for continuity, should assuage concerns among some shareholders that buyers would seek drastic changes.The LME’s shareholders, the largest being JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Metdist, a family-owned metals trader, will enjoy a windfall if the sale goes ahead. A valuation of £1bn represents about 15 times the last traded price before the sale process was announced in September, following an unsolicited approach by the ICE.The focus will now turn to the bidders’ plans to expand the LME’s business.HKEx offers close ties to China, the world’s top consumer of metals, and could potentially help the LME register warehouses in China and to launch clearing in renminbi.CME has a wide range of contracts linked to the steel market, seen as one of the main areas of growth in commodities trading and a natural fit because many steelmakers trade metals such as nickel and zinc on the LME. It also has experience running a network of warehouses through its ownership of New York’s Comex.ICE offers a large network of customers in Asia, the most important region for the industry, already trading commodities on the exchange through its benchmark Brent crude oil and gasoil contracts.The LME and the three bidders declined to comment.Additional reporting by David Gelles and Philip Stafford
401;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-16T12:05:02Z;Costs and investments cut LME profits;;The London Metal Exchange suffered a 19 per cent drop in profits last year as higher costs and investments outweighed a sharp rise in trading volumes.The results highlight the challenges facing the 135-year-old exchange should it remain independent in an increasingly competitive and more stringently regulated industry. They also underline the dilemma for the LME’s shareholders, the banks and brokers that use it, as they decide whether or not to sell the exchange.The LME is the subject of a bidding war that is in its final stages, with Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, CME Group and the IntercontinentalExchange in the running to acquire the metals exchange, seen as one of the last great prizes in a wave of industry consolidation. The highest bids are expected to value it at about £1bn.The exchange disclosed it would pay Moelis & Co, its financial adviser, a £3.5m fee plus 0.5-0.7 per cent of the valuation of the exchange if it is sold. It will pay a further £500,000 to “other advisers”, likely to include RLM Finsbury, the public relations firm. The LME has also retained Freshfields has a legal adviser.According to figures disclosed in the LME’s annual report and seen by the Financial Times, revenues at the LME rose by a fifth last year. That was on the back of a 22 per cent increase in trading volumes in its contracts, which serve as global benchmarks for metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc, but net profit fell from £9.5m to £7.7m on the back of higher costs.“The investment requirements of being a global exchange have changed the economics of the business,” Martin Abbott, chief executive, wrote in the report.The fall in profits is unlikely to worry bidders, since LME’s profits are expected to rise significantly in the coming years as it brings clearing in-house and increases trading fees.The moves have divided opinion in the traditionally clubby LME, leading to a rare public disagreement over the fee increase this year. Many shareholders remain wary of changes that a sale could bring and prefer the current model under which LME is run, not to maximise profits but for the benefit of its users.“The LME is not for sale,” Mr Abbott wrote in the report. “But we cannot stop people from trying to buy it and it will be interesting to see whether bidders can show a good reason for shareholders to sell.”He added: “The new fee will allow the exchange to maintain an appropriate investment programme, to maintain its regulatory capital requirements and to continue to grow in an increasingly competitive market.”The results highlighted the weight of investment that the LME is planning in the coming years. It had signed contracts for £44m of expenditure at the end of last year, more than doubled from £21m a year earlier, on the back of investments in technology.Mr Abbott pointed out that before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and the cost of the clearing project and the bid process, the LME registered record profits last year.The board proposed paying no dividend, due to the uncertainty about the exchange’s future ownership.
402;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-15T18:44:04Z;Backlash to longer grain futures sessions;;Exchanges face a growing furore over a longer trading day in grain futures as traders fear it will lead to knee-jerk reactions to sensitive crop reports.The backlash puts CME Group, the biggest US futures exchange operator, in a delicate position as it fends off new competition in agriculture and balances the needs of farmers and grain handlers with electronic traders.The Chicago Board of Trade, a CME exchange, next week plans to allow electronic trading of crop futures including corn, soyabeans and wheat for 22 hours a day, extending sessions by five hours. The move comes after the rival IntercontinentalExchange this week launched lookalike contracts, challenging Chicago’s dominance in the grain pits.The new hours overlap with the release of crop reports that regularly move markets. Until now, the US Department of Agriculture’s lengthy reports were released while trading was halted.RJ O’Brien, a large Chicago-based futures broker, on Tuesday implored exchanges and regulators to freeze trading on the 15 days each year when the USDA publishes its crop production, acreage and grain stocks reports.“Many RJO clients worry that contract volume and liquidity in the initial minutes after release of the major crop reports will be impeded by the inherent delay necessary to digest all of the updates,” said Gerald Corcoran, chief executive. “This low initial participation could trigger extreme price reactions and wider bid/ask spreads, thus increasing hedging costs, which ultimately will be passed on to consumers.”Last week grain handling groups including the National Grain and Feed Association said longer hours “could lead to competitive inequalities and impose significant additional costs” in personnel and technology.Grain is one of the few markets where trading halts around important data releases. Oil futures stay open when weekly US petroleum supply numbers appear.Smaller agricultural markets, such as Liffe milling wheat in Paris and ICE canola in Canada, already trade during USDA releases and to a degree are proxies for other commodities during the Chicago hiatus.John Stotts, director of commodities at Infinium Capital Management, a Chicago proprietary trading firm, said the longer trading day was “destined to happen”.“Exchanges have a global client base. These customers will want to be able to trade data in real-time, and not wait around for one timezone to open up,” he said.Hubert Hamer, chairman of the USDA’s Agricultural Statistics Board, said the agency is discussing the longer sessions. “Any change to the report release schedule is complex, has far-reaching impact, and would be taken very deliberatively,” he said.
403;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-15T17:18:30Z;NYSE Euronext knocked out of LME race;;NYSE Euronext has been knocked out of the race to acquire the London Metal Exchange after submitting too low a bid.NYSE was one of four bidders to submit binding bids for the exchange last week, and it is the first to be eliminated. Those remaining are Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, CME Group, and the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE).NYSE’s bid valued the metals exchange at roughly £800m, according to people familiar with the matter, suggesting that shareholders’ aspirations of a bid in excess of £1bn may be met.Martin Abbott, LME chief executive, said this month that “as a matter of personal pride, as the CEO, I’d like to think that we’d get there [to a valuation of £1bn] at least.”NYSE said: “We put a proposal in that we believe was a fair valuation for the business and we wish them well.”The elimination of NYSE thwarts another attempt by the transatlantic exchanges operator to diversify its business after regulators blocked a merger with Deutsche Börse in February.NYSE had not been seen as a likely bidder for the LME until the collapse of its deal with Deutsche Börse. However, the group could have integrated the LME with its existing soft and agricultural commodity derivatives business, part of NYSE Liffe. It would also have been able to send trades done on the LME for clearing at NYSE Liffe Clear.However, it was not prepared to enter into a bidding war with the other exchanges, people familiar with the matter said.The LME, still owned by its members, is seen as one of the last great prizes in a wave of consolidation in the exchanges industry. It accounts for 80 per cent of global turnover in metals futures and hosts industry benchmark contracts for commodities such as copper, aluminium and zinc.The board of the exchange met last Thursday to begin narrowing down the field before putting a possible bid to a vote.The decision-making process is complicated by many shareholders being as concerned about keeping the LME’s structure constant as they are about valuation. The board is therefore weighing the relative merits of the business models proposed by the bidders, together with the price they are willing to pay.Any bid must receive the support of at least 75 per cent of the LME’s shareholders, meaning the three largest shareholders – JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Metdist – could together block a bid.
404;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-13T14:28:29Z;Nasdaq set to take on US banks and brokerages;;Nasdaq OMX is moving into direct competition with banks and brokerages, filing plans to make basic trading algorithms available as part of its US equity trading platform.It also aims to expand its small futures market to trade Treasury futures later this year, joining rival NYSE Euronext in taking on the CME Group in the market for listed interest rate derivatives.The moves are part of a series of initiatives aimed at bolstering the global exchange operator’s foothold in US markets. Like other exchanges, Nasdaq is facing a slowdown in stock trading volumes just as bank-owned “dark pools” are grabbing a larger share of trading.Dark pools are private trading venues that do not publicly display prices. The largest pools are owned by Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs, as are trading firms such as Knight Capital and Getco also own such pools.These groups often prefer to trade using dark pools, because they do not have to pay exchange fees to make trades. Off-exchange trading hit a record share of US volume in February at 34 per cent.That has taken a bite out of the revenues and market share of Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. Nasdaq OMX’s shares have fallen 6 per cent since the start of the year.Nasdaq this week filed plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch its “benchmark orders” programme. It will make automated trading tools, often called “algos”, available to traders. The aim is to draw traders to Nasdaq’s market via its algorithms.These will be basic algos aimed at helping an investor trade large positions in stock at the volume-weighted average price, or trade as a percentage of volume.The offering, aimed at smaller and medium brokerages, would compete with big banks that “white label” such algos to smaller brokers.Nasdaq is also planning to roll out new trading techniques, such as auctions of shares for retail traders, and speed bumps to slow high-frequency trading and encourage institutional trading, pending regulatory approval.The move into trading of Treasury futures, sketched out to analysts last week, would also bring Nasdaq back into the evolving market for products that derive value from interest rates. Last month, Nasdaq said it was in talks to sell its stake in a rate swaps clearing house.Rate trading, a large portion of which takes place in private swaps markets, may move more toward regulated exchanges as part of the Dodd-Frank Act’s emphasis to move trading away from bank-to-bank trades.CME currently dominates this trading, however: About 98 per cent of Ten-year Treasury futures’ open interest is in CME’s market.
405;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-10T22:55:41Z;US swaps regulator delays block trading rule;;The US futures and swaps market regulator has responded to concerns expressed by exchanges, delaying a proposed rule that would have limited block trading and forced some contracts to be delisted.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s rule, known as core principle nine, would have required that at least 85 per cent of a listed future or swap’s volume to be traded in small lots on an exchange’s floor or electronic order book, rather than in large blocks outside the exchange.Blocks are a critical issue for the derivatives industry, which is fighting a host of Dodd Frank Act rules being formulated by the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission that could limit trading. Banks argue that blocks are critical to serving large customers and must be done outside of liquid exchanges to give them time to hedge big trades.The move by the CFTC could signal that it is flexible on the issue, which would be a huge relief to the industry, especially wholesale brokerages such as ICAP, Tullett Prebon and GFI Group, which trade large blocks of swaps between banks.The rule was intended by the CFTC and Dodd-Frank Act lawmakers to encourage more trading in transparent markets and discourage contracts from being traded in multiple venues.However, it was opposed by dealers, investors and exchanges. Comment letters by CME Group, NYSE Liffe US and Eris argued that they would be inhibited from launching new contracts that only slowly came to trade centrally, with market-makers providing frequent trading.Scott O’Malia, CFTC commissioner, said that “the 85 per cent centralised market trading requirement was wildly unpopular and controversial both inside and outside of the commission”.One critic said that the CFTC’s delay on the rule was contrary to its broader aim of making prices more visible. “If contracts can continue to trade in multiple platforms in fragmented markets, it’s the antithesis of a transparent market,” said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a lobby group.The review of the rule may be part of a broader effort by the CFTC to engage in additional cost-benefit analyses. The industry has been critical of regulators’ economic analysis and has sued the agency over the issue.Gary Gensler, CFTC commissioner, announced on Thursday that he had brought in an analyst from the White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, established by President Barack Obama to review rule making by agencies. The analyst will be based at the CFTC and will participate in a wide range of rule making studies.The CFTC approved a broader set of rules on the regulation of designated clearing organisations, or exchanges, that will now trade both swaps and futures. It was the first rule on swaps trading approved, but is only a precursor to the more controversial rules on swap execution facilities, or SEFs.That rule includes guidance from the CFTC that could affect swaps or futures based on private benchmarks, such as commodity prices published by Platt’s or Argus, or the London interbank offered rate, known as Libor.The guidance said that in order to prevent price manipulation, DCOs could investigate their benchmarks by undertaking a review of how they are compiled. The issue is in focus amid a broad investigation of Libor.Separately, the CFTC also formally proposed extending the effective date for new swap rules to December 31 from this coming July. Mr Gensler had already laid out a new timeline, and the measure is expected to be adopted. It would be the second delay, after the date was pushed back from last December.
406;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-04T12:03:02Z;CME wins reprieve on CFTC margin rules;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange by value, has been granted a 90-day extension to implement regulatory changes in margin requirements for speculative traders.The reprieve was granted by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator, a day after the CME said new rules would be implemented from Monday.The US futures regulator wants clearing houses such as CME Clearing, LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear and IntercontinentalExchange’s Clear Credit to increase the amount of margin – the money traders have to deposit to guarantee their transactions – on non-hedged positions that are regulated as either futures or swaps.Politicians have sought to clamp down on what they see as speculative derivatives trading in commodities markets while producing measures designed to reduce systemic risk in markets. The wide-ranging Dodd-Frank act, which is being finalised by regulators, will hand greater authority to the CFTC.The rules are set to increase trading costs for customers who had unhedged, or speculative, positions and are due to be applied to the industry from May 7. ICE Clear Credit said it would require clearing members to collect 10 per cent more margin for unhedged trades than its margin requirements for particular product or swap portfolios.CME requested a delay on Thursday amid local reports that the new margins had disrupted corn and oil markets owned by the CME.“During the extension period, CME Clearing will work with the CFTC to address member-customer concerns,” said the operator.Higher margin requirements may force investors who have borrowed a lot of capital to trade to scale down their positions or put up extra margin to continue trading.Under existing rules, CME members have been treated as “hedgers” and are allowed to build speculative positions on lower margin rates. The CME said the rules would now come into effect on August 5.President Barack Obama has proposed giving the CFTC the authority to order financial exchanges to raise margin requirements in energy trading markets, a move the CME called “confused” and likely to have no effect on prices.
407;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-03T11:58:22Z;CME to raise margins to meet new rules;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures operator by revenues and market capitalisation, will require its members to pay more in margin for speculative futures positions from next week to comply with new trading regulations.The group, which announced the changes late on Wednesday, said its new requirements had been prompted by rule changes introduced by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).The US futures regulator wants to increase the amount of margin – the money traders have to deposit with the exchange to guarantee their transactions – on non-hedged positions that are regulated as either futures or swaps.Authorities around the world have been keen to crack down on what they see as speculative trading in commodities markets using derivatives and have been producing rules aimed at reducing systemic risk in markets. The rules in the US have been enshrined in the Dodd-Frank act, which will hand greater authority to regulators like the CFTC.“There is no exception for speculative customer accounts of exchange members that fall within the regulation,” said the CME, although it noted the ruling only applied to non-hedged member accounts.Higher margin requirements may force investors who have borrowed a lot of capital to trade to scale down their positions or put up extra margin to continue trading.Under existing rules, CME members have been treated as hedgers and are allowed to build up speculative positions on lower margin rates. The rules come into effect from May 7.President Barack Obama wants to raise margin requirements in energy trading markets and has proposed giving the CFTC the authority to order financial exchanges to raise margin requirements. However, the CME last week called the proposal “confused” and said it was likely to have no effect on prices.Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, and Michel Barnier, EU internal market commissioner, have also backed proposals for tougher regulation and tighter surveillance of commodity markets trading in Mifid, the upcoming review of Europe’s financial markets directive.
408;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-01T19:22:26Z;Equinix to expand hubs for world’s bourses;;Equinix, the data centre operator, is developing a network that will allow more of the world’s stock exchanges to place trading hubs abroad, allowing them to compete for business around the world.The Nasdaq-listed group is spending tens of millions of dollars creating a platform of connection points, known as nodes, and is testing the system with a couple of exchanges. It has already signed up BT as one of its telecommunications providers.The move could allow some of the world’s smaller global exchanges to vie for investors’ business on a more equal footing with some of the largest bourses as the industry struggles with a deep slump in trading.In recent years stock exchanges have exploited rapid improvements in technology to push at the boundaries of physical geography. Large exchanges have been keen to lure investors with co-location services, in which traders place their computer servers next to an exchange’s matching engine in a data centre. The move will shave crucial milliseconds off the time it takes for trades to be done.Some exchanges, such as NYSE Euronext, CME Group and Nasdaq OMX, have looked to exploit that demand by building their own data centres and charging customers for rent. Data message rates have soared in recent years as exchanges blast out updated prices in fractions of seconds for customers.However other bourses have suffered as their matching engines have been far from the main market liquidity pools. They also lack the funds to spend on building their own data centres, particularly as trading on global markets has remained weak. Equinix is hoping its network, based on Ethernet, will effectively outsource the role, cutting the heavy IT burden allowing other exchanges to sell their market data to investors.“The matching engines will stay in the local market, but they’ll be able to open up a point of presence in a foreign market,” said John Knuff, general manager of global financial services at Equinix, told FT Trading Room. “We’re going to see more and more of this in coming years. We’ve made some pretty big bets. We think it’s the future.”RTS-Micex, the Russian exchange, and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange have already announced plans to open a point of presence in Equinix’s Slough data centre near London. ASX, the Australian exchange, has a similar hub in Chicago to attract the city’s futures traders.“Points of presence suggest a commoditisation in the market,” said Terry Keene, chief executive of iSys Integration Systems, a capital markets consultancy. “You’re at the classic buy-or-build dilemma.”Mr Knuff said that the project would not turn Equinix into an exchange, a connectivity provider or market data reseller. “Around 80-90 per cent of markets don’t need the lowest latency possible. They’re looking for economical access to local markets. It will make it less expensive for market data vendors and resellers for these exchanges,“ said Mr Knuff.Around a fifth of Equinix’s $1.6bn revenues comes from financial services. It counts Direct Edge, ICAP, BATS Chi-X Europe and JPMorgan as customers.
409;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-01T19:14:26Z;ISDA warns against competing clearing houses;;Competing clearing houses for privately negotiated derivatives could make markets less secure, warned the chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, undermining the aims of new regulation.Global regulators have made central clearing a key way to reduce the systemic risk generated by over-the-counter derivatives during the financial crisis, but the derivatives industry is fighting to keep some of the market cleared by individual dealers.“We don’t want to see a race to the bottom on margin terms, nor a fragmented market caused by a proliferation of central counterparties,” said Stephen O’Connor, chairman of ISDA and head of over-the-counter clearing at Morgan Stanley, speaking at the industry lobby’s annual meeting in Chicago.“Any trend towards a weak, fragmented clearing system will result in a market less secure than exists today,” he added.ISDA is an industry lobby of banks, service providers and users of over-the-counter derivatives. These are distinct from listed derivatives markets in that they are privately agreed, and not listed on exchanges.The group has worked to move many of those trades into central clearing houses, help counterparties match exposures to reduce collateral needs and establish data repositories.However, the industry is now fighting moves by some regulators, such as the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to push for more reform, such as requiring broad access to real-time clearing to encourage more trading in standardised central markets, such as Swap Execution Facitilies, or on exchanges.This could threaten the role of banks as dealers who make markets and trade in large sizes by allowing new firms, such as electronic market makers, to become liquidity providers.Already, exchanges CME Group and the IntercontinentalExchange have launched clearing houses for credit default swaps where clients can clear. CME Group is also competing with LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear to clear interest rate swaps.SwapClear said on Tuesday, just as the ISDA conference began, that dealer-to-client clearing volumes of interest-rate swaps had jumped 175 per cent in April from a year ago, to $712bn notional. That is still just a sliver of LCH’s $300tn notional dealer-to-dealer clearing.Mr O’Connor noted that some countries, such as Japan, India and South Korea, were considering adopting rules that trades must go through domestic clearing house. This would create complexity, and rules should allow any qualified clearing house to act as a central counterparty, he said.The clearing houses have been expanding the range of acceptable collateral to additional currencies and securities such as high-grade corporate bonds. They have also been promoting measures to cut margin requirements by allowing traders to offset their swaps trading exposure to interest rates with any futures positions they hold.They argue these measures do not imperil risk management, but reduce costs while quality collateral is at a premium and will see increasing demand by central clearing mandates.Luigi Zinagles, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, told the ISDA conference that “OTC markets tend to be opaque and unstable. They rely heavily on some market maker that [is] central to the transaction”.“Sometimes competition evolves naturally, but when you have an oligopolistic [market], the creation of those rules will not be great,” he said.
410;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-05-01T10:20:40Z;Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing/LME;Race for mutually owned metals exchange heats up;"There, they’ve said it. Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing is the first bidder to confirm publicly its interest in the London Metal Exchange. The bidding deadline for the centre of the metals world is Monday and HKEx will probably be up against an exchange world who’s who, including NYSE Euronext, CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange.Of course they all want the LME, one of the few remaining mutually owned exchanges. Still, that status makes a valuation tricky. Private share trades last autumn valued it at £540m – 57 times 2010 profits – but simply adding a profit-seeking motive would boost income. A bidding war could push the price north of £1bn.Debt-free HKEx had more than that in cash at the end of last year and borrowing for a deal would be easy enough. But its rivals are hardly stretched; the most “extreme” is NYSE Euronext with net debt worth just 1.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The real question is what LME members would demand over and above cash. Some protection of key features, such as the daily contract structure seem a given. Fine. Retention of the trading floor is open to debate but immediate closure seems unlikely. Any arrangement to retain the LME’s ring, however finite, would cut into early-year income.HKEx’s big attraction to LME members could be its China links; last week the exchange approved its first Chinese member. But HKEx does not have the same experience in absorbing and modernising another exchange as the others do; just ask CME and NYSE about coping with resistant and outspoken traders. Overpaying for such a unique asset could be justified merely to stop a rival getting it, but boosting the revenues to make good the price tag in the longer term would take a lot of skill.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
411;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-30T23:07:53Z;Chicago aims for share of OTC derivatives;;Chicago’s trading community is stepping up its attempt to wrest control of over-the-counter derivatives markets from New York-based dealer banks.New York’s vice-like grip on over-the-counter derivatives may loosen with the implementation of rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act, which overhauled US markets in the wake of the financial crisis. Stricter capital requirements are also making it harder for big banks to take on customers’ risk.That could give an edge to the already highly regulated market for exchange-traded futures, which is primarily based in Chicago, to take share from privately negotiated swaps, which the dealers in New York control.On Monday, Eris Exchange said it had struck a deal with CME Group, both based in Chicago, to allow traders to reduce their costs by combining the clearing of futures and swaps trades. Eris was founded in 2010 by a consortium of Chicago trading firms to trade listed futures meant to replicate over-the-counter interest rate swaps.The announcement comes a day ahead of the annual general meeting of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the bank-run industry body for over-the-counter derivatives. ISDA is meeting in Chicago this year, just blocks away from the home of the CME, the world’s largest listed futures market.The new offering, which goes live on May 7, will be used to offset collateral and margin requirements for trading in interest-rate swaps on Eris, and eurodollar and Treasury futures positions at CME.If successful, the Eris-CME effort could bolster Eris’s efforts to challenge the banks’ over-the-counter trading. It could also drive swaps clearing into CME Group’s central clearing house that is already the world’s largest for futures trading.A new study by Greenwich Associates this week found that a key cost for traders will be how much collateral they will need to post against their trades. “The need to post collateral would cause them to …cut back their activity in interest rate derivatives,” the survey said.Eris claims that the offsets could reduce the margin need for interest-rate swaps, which are highly correlated with eurodollar and Treasury futures, by up to 95 per cent.Supurna VedBrat, managing director at BlackRock, welcomed the move, saying it “provides the market with a new source of liquidity for cleared interest rate swap exposure delivered with cross-product portfolio margin efficiency with CME Group futures directly at the individual client level”.Neal Brady, Eris chief executive, told the Financial Times the offering was aimed at financial traders such as hedge funds and asset managers. “Interest-rate swap clients are increasingly looking for ways to minimise operational and financial costs as they begin to migrate bilateral OTC swap activity to central counterparty clearing,” he said.Eris represents one of several attempts by the Chicago financial trading community, which pioneered exchange-traded financial derivatives in the 1970s, to seize the initiative on the changing OTC markets from Wall Street dealers.The Chicago Board Options Exchange and DRW Trading, a Chicago-based trading firm that is the chief backer of Eris, announced a deal last week to launch listed futures contracts that mimic equity-based swaps.CME is also using margin offsets as a key offering in its battle for a share of interest rate swaps clearing with LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear. SwapClear is the global leader in bank-to-bank clearing, but the two groups are fighting for the new market for bank-to-customer trading.CME rolled out margin offsets earlier this year in interest-rate swaps. LCH has partnered with NYSE Euronext’s Liffe US market to develop its own competing product.
412;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-30T16:33:13Z;Trading slump dents NYSE Euronext profits;;NYSE Euronext blamed regulatory uncertainty for holding back trading activity and new investments in technology, as low volumes continued to put pressure on its revenues.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive, told analysts on a conference call that potential new rules and investigations on high-frequency trading were a factor in the slowdown. High-frequency traders, who deal in millisecond speeds, contribute a large share of volume to US and European markets in equities, options and futures.“Whether an unintended consequence or not, the rhetoric from politicans…may be leading high-frequency trading firms [to] thinking about other alternatives and accelerating their move into other asset classes and geographies,” said Mr Niederauer.The US futures regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, recently began a broad review of potential abuses in speed trading. Other exchanges, such as Nasdaq OMX and Deutsche Börse, have increased the fees charged for data traffic generated by blasting buy and sell orders in millisecond increments.Though Mr Niederauer said that NYSE could not report high-frequency activity precisely, he suggested that more of their trading was shifting into “dark pools” away from public exchanges, “from regulated to less regulated markets”.US off-exchange trading volume hit a record 34 per cent in the fourth quarter, though many analysts have cited falling volatility as the driver. Dark pools allow traders to place orders at undisplayed prices as they wait for someone to trade at the same price.NYSE Euronext reported a 44 per cent drop in quarterly net profits from a year ago to $87m, including $31m of costs related to its failed merger with Deutsche Börse, which was blocked by EU antitrust authorities.Net revenues fell 17 per cent to $952m. Turnover at NYSE Technologies rose 4 per cent to $121m in the first quarter, but below its target of 10 per cent quarterly growth.Results were also depressed by financial groups holding off on new investments, slowing NYSE Euronext’s transformation from relying on trading into a diversified tech vendor.“A lot of our big customers who are the most obvious users are going through their own business reinvention,” said Mr Niederauer, referring to rising capital requirements under Basel III, and the shift of over-the-counter trading to central platforms via new rules in the US and Europe.Mr Niederauer said the group was seeing “unused cabinet inventory in Mahwah and Basildon”, its data centres built in the US, outside New York, and the UK, outside London.But he committed to the group’s 2015 target of $1bn in revenues from tech, citing the possibility of “bolt on” acquIsitions and “deals in the hopper”.“Success in that arena will determine the long-term success of our enterprise,” he said.
413;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-30T11:22:05Z;HKEx confirms interest in LME;;Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing said on Monday it was interested in buying the London Metal Exchange, pitting the Chinese bourse against rivals from New York and Chicago.The news confirms months of rumours that the Hong Kong group hoped to acquire the world’s leading metals exchange as part of its plans to push into new businesses, such as commodities.The bidding deadline for the LME is Monday May 7, with shareholders hoping for a valuation in excess of £1bn.HKEx, which has a monopoly on equity trading in Hong Kong, is the world’s biggest exchange operator by market capitalisation and would easily be able to finance an acquisition of the LME.The group has already started talks with banks about a loan to finance a bid for the 135-year-old metals exchange, according to people familiar with the matter.The Hong Kong group is expected to be bidding against established commodities bourses including CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange, and NYSE Euronext, according to people familiar with the matter.The LME, which hosts futures contracts used as global industry benchmarks for base metals from copper to nickel, is one of the last member-owned exchanges in the world. It is home to Europe’s last trading pit – known at the LME as the ring – where traders shout orders to each other.Many of the LME’s shareholders look favourably on a potential offer from Hong Kong, believing that stronger ties with China would benefit the exchange.Last week the LME approved Bank of China as its first Chinese member, and is also considering adding renminbi to its range of currencies available for trading and settlement.Nonetheless, shareholders – primarily the banks and brokers that trade on the exchange – are unlikely to approve a bid that does not promise to preserve the LME’s business model.Explore deals on the table and those that have fallen by the waysideCharles Li, HKEx chief executive, said in January that commodities was the next asset class on its list as it seeks to expand beyond equities. Mr Li said at the time: “Although commodities may prove to be the most difficult, the opportunity is also the greatest.”As China’s influence in commodities had expanded, Mr Li said the country needed access to financial and commodity derivatives markets in renminbi and in the Asian timezone.
414;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-29T15:52:05Z;MF Global leaves industry scarred;Lack of information has shattered confidence;Exactly six months after MF Global filed for bankruptcy, former customers of the failed futures brokerage are still waiting to find out how much of an estimated $1.6bn in missing funds will be returned to them.The lack of information about exactly what occurred at the collapsed futures brokerage has caused a sense of frustration across the industry. It has shattered confidence and kept many of the traders affected away from the markets, particularly among the roughly 36,000 former customers of MF Global who remain out of pocket, their funds frozen by the bankruptcy court.Most customers have received 72 per cent of the money from their accounts from James Giddens, the bankruptcy trustee.Mr Giddens said last week that his staff’s research into what happened to the missing money “is substantially concluded”. However, it is far from clear that it will all be recovered and returned to customers.US Congress has held multiple hearings on the issue, federal regulators are investigating and a grand jury has convened in Chicago. Yet there are increasing doubts that these probes will uncover evidence of intentional misuse of customer money.There was excitement last month when politicians in Washington released an email that appeared to be a “smoking gun” linking the shortfall in customer funds to Jon Corzine, the former US Senator and New Jersey governor who ran MF Global, and who denies any wrongdoing.The email, written by Edith O’Brien, MF Global’s assistant treasurer, referred to a $200m transfer that may have included customer funds as having been “Per JC’s direct instructions”. However, when she was hauled before Congress, Ms O’Brien refused to testify. Mr Corzine’s lawyers deny he authorised any illegal transfers. The email was, therefore, inconclusive.Many in the industry are now resigned to the idea that ultimately there will be no criminal charges. “There may be civil action, based on failure to supervise,” says Gary DeWaal, general counsel at Newedge, the world’s biggest futures broker. Mr Giddens said last week he favoured such action. But Mr DeWaal is sceptical. “That could lead to a fine, but it wouldn’t really harm anyone except the creditors,” he says.The lack of a more decisive conclusion worries many in the industry. “When you have a systemic breakdown of this magnitude, it’s one of two choices: it was bad actors or a bad system,” says a senior US futures executive. “So if all the investigations prove that no one really acted improperly and there were no bad actors, all you’re left with is the idea that there’s a broken system.”CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange and the organisation responsible for overseeing MF Global, is keen to avoid that perception. Without saying it directly, CME has, some feel, gone as far as it dares towards accusing the failed futures brokerage of fraud.Two days after the bankruptcy, the exchange accused MF Global of moving customer funds “in a manner that may have been designed to avoid detection”. Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, subsequently claimed the bankrupt firm “falsified reports” by telling the exchange it had excess funds in customer segregation days before it collapsed.Proving that reports were deliberately rather than mistakenly false, however, is likely to be tricky. In his report about the final days at MF Global, Mr Giddens described a shambolic scene in which employees were overburdened by having to meet vast funding needs.“The company’s computer systems and employees had trouble keeping up,” Mr Giddens wrote. “A number of transactions were recorded erroneously or not at all.”That picture is echoed by a senior investment banker who was invited in to look over the firm’s books in its dying hours as it tried desperately to sell itself. “It was a complete mess in there,” he says. “If you had seen how chaotic it was, you would understand that the money probably went missing because of sloppy record-keeping.”If that is the final version of events, many customers will feel permanently wronged, says John Roe, leader of the Commodity Customer Coalition, a customer group, and an introducing broker at BT Trading in Chicago, a firm that had all $15m or so of its client funds at MF Global.Mr Roe says his members would be “beyond dejected” if there were no prosecution. “There should be a criminal consequence,” he says. “The system itself is at risk if there isn’t.”“Someone at MF Global made the decision to swipe customer money,” Mr Roe adds. “They need to pay a price for that. Otherwise, our members will feel the marketplace isn’t what they thought it was.”The MF Global saga has already led to plans to improve protection for futures customers. Brokers and clearing houses will have to hold more capital from their customer accounts. The guidelines on how futures brokerages can invest customer funds have been made stricter.The danger for the industry, however, is that without a criminal case, these rule changes will fail to restore customer confidence.“This was a massive theft,” says Jeff Carter, a Chicago futures trader and blogger. “The futures industry battles the equity industry for dollars. Brokers compete against each other. If I am a customer and have a choice between trading crude oil futures or a crude oil ETF, the equity broker has a huge leg up against the futures broker if no one from MF stands trial – specifically, top management.”Mr Roe says not even fully refunding customers can guarantee customer confidence. “Whether or not we get our money back, there was misuse of customer funds and so the damage in some respects has already been done,” he says.“If nothing happens, this means people can misuse customer funds and have no criminal liability, that they can get away with it.”
415;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-26T15:21:19Z;Obama ‘confused’ about energy trading, says CME;;CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange operator, attacked a White House plan to raise margin requirements in energy trading markets, saying President Barack Obama was “confused” on the issue and the measure would have no effect on prices.Mr Obama called on Congress last week to pass legislation to increase oversight of energy trading markets and stiffen penalties for price manipulation.As part of the plan, the president proposed giving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator, authority to order financial exchanges to raise margin requirements – the money traders have to deposit with the exchange to guarantee their transactions.The White House said this would enable the regulator “to address increased price volatility or prevent excessive speculation or manipulation” and “will help limit disruptions and reduce volatility in oil markets”.Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, hit back at the plan on Thursday. “The worst thing to do to try to control prices is to utilise margins,” he said. “There’s been multiple studies that no matter what you do with margins, it’s not going to affect the price in the long term.”“We raised margins on energy …five times in the past 12 months and in our oil markets the price still marched straight up,” Mr Duffy added. “The president, I think, may be a little bit confused and some of his advisers may be a little bit confused.”Mr Duffy made the remarks as CME reported that its profits fell by 42 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year as trading volumes dropped and the company had a higher expenses bill.However, the earnings nevertheless exceeded Wall Street expectations. CME’s net income in the quarter was $267m or $4.02 a share, down from $457m or $6.81 a share in the same period a year ago, but above the $4 of analysts’ average consensus forecasts. Revenues were $775m, slightly below analysts’ expectations of about $779m.Expenses rose to $323m in the quarter, up from $308m a year earlier, primarily due to an increase in pay and benefits to $135m from $122m last year.Average daily trading volume in the quarter was 12.3m contracts, down 11 per cent from the same period a year earlier. CME’s average daily futures volume so far in the current quarter is 10.6m contracts, 15 per cent below last year.CME’s markets, where traders come to hedge positions and manage their risks, have been hit by the US Federal Reserve’s low-interest rate policy, the relative lack of volatility in equity markets and the hangover from the collapse of MF Global, which has dented confidence in futures markets.Some $1.6bn of customer funds are still missing after MF Global filed for bankruptcy in October. Many former customers of the broker-dealer are concerned they will never be repaid in full. This would mark the first time that futures traders had lost money as a result of a shortfall in customer funds held at a brokerage.CME shares were trading down 1.75 per cent at $268.37 by mid-morning in New York.
416;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-24T19:30:29Z;LCH.Clearnet set to acquire IDCG;;LCH.Clearnet is continuing to expand its US base ahead of over-the-counter derivatives clearing reforms, striking a preliminary agreement to acquire the International Derivatives Clearing Group from Nasdaq OMX.The latest move on the clearing house chessboard comes as US regulators near the finalisation of rules requiring more private, OTC derivatives trades to be moved to central clearing houses.LCH.Clearnet is the largest global clearing house for bank-to-bank swaps clearing. But the Anglo-French group has been competing with CME Group for a share of the emerging bank-to-customer portion of the $700tn in notional value swaps market.IDCG, which was founded in 2007 and sold a majority stake to Nasdaq in 2008, has not yet become a significant participant in the emerging market for dealer-to-customer clearing of private derivatives trades, particularly interest-rate swaps.However, it provides LCH.Clearnet with a US clearing house that is licensed to clear swaps and futures trades. That will aid LCH.Clearnet’s plans to match CME Group’s ability to allow customers to combine futures and swaps clearing to reduce costs.“There are a lot of details to work through, but we are attracted by IDCG’s staff and relevant OTC and clearing expertise to build on our US talent pool,” Michael Davie, chief executive of SwapClear, LCH.Clearnet’s swaps clearing platform, told the Financial Times.“This would be a strategic move for us, really evidencing to the US buyside that we’re deadly serious about providing a comprehensive range of services in the long term,” he added.Combining swaps and futures clearing – known as portfolio margining – has become a key offering for clearing houses, as banks, asset managers and hedge funds face a shortage of quality top-rated collateral ahead of expanding clearing requirements in the US and Europe.Earlier this year, Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, signalled the company’s intention to seek a buyer for IDCG, in part to free up capital for Nasdaq’s own business.The deal has not yet been finalised, and the terms are not agreed. But it will be a swap of shares. LCH.Clearnet has agreed to sell a majority stake to the London Stock Exchange. Nasdaq would remain an LCH.Clearnet shareholder.“We are pleased to begin our strategic relationship with LCH.Clearnet on both sides of the Atlantic,” said Eric Noll, executive vice-president for transaction services at Nasdaq.The market for client-to-dealer clearing is still in its early stages, though it accelerated late last year. SwapClear has so far cleared a notional total of $686bn in interest-rate swaps.It is not yet clear whether LCH.Clearnet will retain IDCG's process of converting swaps into futures. That process was the subject of a lawsuit by Jefferies, the investment bank, which was resolved in arbitration.But adding IDCG may also allay concerns expressed by some US trading firms that having LCH.Clearnet subject to UK bankruptcy laws could have complicated matters if a member defaulted. LCH.Clearnet has said that local laws would govern any default in US in its US swaps clearing.“While the company has a US offering, we have heard certain market participants in the US have not fully embraced it. IDCG could be a way for LCH to better penetrate the US market,” said Christopher Harris, analyst at Wells Fargo.Before this move, LCH.Clearnet had made an agreement to develop a portfolio margining offset with NYSE Euronext, which operates the NYSE Liffe US futures market and is co-owner, with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, of New York Portfolio Clearing, a clearing house.CME Group, which operates its own clearing houses and is home to the world’s largest futures market, began offering margining offsets in interest rate swaps earlier this year. The IntercontinentalExchange is offering the same for credit default swaps.
417;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME sells part of iconic Chicago building;;CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange operator, has sold most of the Chicago Board of Trade building – one of the city’s best-known landmarks – to a joint venture between two US property developers for $151.5m.The company announced on Monday that it had sold two of the Art Deco skyscraper’s three towers to GlenStar Properties, a Chicago property developer, and USAA Real Estate, the property investment arm of USAA, the Texas-based insurance company.CME put the building’s north and south towers up for sale last year. The company retains ownership of the structure’s east tower, which houses its financial trading floor. It will lease back the space used by its agricultural commodity-trading “open outcry” pits.When putting the building up for sale, CME reassured traders that it had no plans to close the open outcry trading floor, which with the growth of electronic trading now handles only about 10 per cent of trading volume.Jamie Parisi, CME chief financial officer, reiterated that commitment on Monday. “CME Group, which has been headquartered in Chicago for more than a century, continues to be committed to this city and to maintaining our trading floors and office space in the [CBOT] building,” he said.CME, formerly the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, took over the building as part of its deal to buy the Chicago Board of Trade, its longtime rival, in 2007 for $11bn. It subsequently merged the two exchanges’ trading floors and housed them at the CBOT, while the company’s executives remained at the CME’s headquarters a few blocks away.The edifice, a typical Chicago “armchair” design decorated with agricultural motifs to highlight the exchange’s connection to crop commodities, was designed by Holabird and Root, a legendary Chicago architecture firm.It opened in 1930, revealing the ambition of the Chicago futures markets. It is topped by a 9-metre high statue of Ceres, the Roman goddess of grain, that has no facial features – reportedly because the designers assumed it would always be the city’s tallest building. It was overtaken in 1965.Mr Parisi said the sale would “allow CME Group to continue to focus on what we do best – running our exchanges and providing risk management tools to the world”.
418;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-21T00:02:49Z;Trading Technologies lays off 100 staff;;Trading Technologies International, a developer of futures trading software used across Wall Street desks and in the pits of the Chicago exchanges, is laying off a large number of staffers just weeks after the rollout of a major new product.The privately held firm is cutting some 100 of its roughly 600 staffers, including 80 in its home office in Chicago and the rest spread out across its offices, which are in London, New York, Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong.“As we’ve become more focused and efficient over the past few years, we made a difficult but necessary decision to lay off about 100 employees,” the company said in a statement.The cut comes amid persistently weak volumes in derivatives markets that have pressured revenues for trading technology firms, as it has for traders, banks and brokerages. CME Group said that average daily futures volumes were down 21 per cent so far this quarter versus the same period a year ago.However, a person close to the group said that the move is an “organisational restructuring”, the result of an overexpansion just before the financial crisis. This is the first staff reduction for Trading Technologies since 2001.“It’s been clear for the past six months or so that headcount was too high,” this person said. “This is not a reflection of trading volumes.”The cuts will come from a variety of roles, but primarily engineers and IT support staff.Despite the poor volumes, Trading Technologies has continued to unveil new trading tools. In March, it launched a new version of its core platform, X_TRADER. This included the Algo Design Lab, known as ADL, which allows traders to visually assemble automated trading engines and quickly launch them.The company also recently named Rick Lane, the developer of ADL, as its chief technology officer. Mr Lane had left the group after it acquired the maker of ADL, to work at Google, but rejoined Trading Technologies last month.Traders increasingly rely on automated decision engines known as algorithms, or “algos”, to rapidly trade futures or pair trades of related assets.In addition to software, Trading Technologies also offers “co-location” services to put traders’ systems close to exchange hubs to increase their speed.Though common to equities and the subject of scrutiny by some regulators such as the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, algos are seeing growing use in other asset classes. ITG and Bank of America Merrill Lynch rolled out new electronic futures trading tools for their institutional clients last year.
419;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-16T16:04:58Z;CME focus on London as European beachhead;;"Cricket may not seem the most obvious spectator sport for a company based in Chicago, home to two US baseball teams.However, CME Group, operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, recently signed up for corporate entertainment rights with the Professional Cricketers’ Association, based at the famous Oval cricket ground in London.The move was a sign that for a company which still derives 80 per cent of its revenues from North America, expansion into Europe has become a priority as exchanges race to capture as much of global demand for derivatives trading and clearing as they can beyond their home bases.“The CME’s realised that with a concerted sales effort we should be able significantly to increase the business that comes out of here,” says William Knottenbelt, a British former head of futures trading at RBS who was appointed head of CME’s European business five months ago.CME is by far the biggest futures market operator in the US. It is not as much of a household name in the City of London as the Liffe derivatives exchange operated by its rival NYSE Euronext. Yet CME is growing fast in London, where it has more than doubled the number of employees to 150 since 2009.In a sign of its determination to globalise its operations, CME quietly shifted the heads of two of its biggest products – metals and FX derivatives – to London from the US in the past year. The only product line run out of its home base of Chicago is agricultural contracts; energy and its interest rate business are now conducted out of New York.Technical support for the initiatives will come from a new office in Belfast, set to open later this year. Last month CME raised its stake in the Dubai Mercantile Exchange and last week acquired GreenX Holdings, a London-based operator of the second-largest carbon emissions market by volume after the European Climate Exchange, from investors including Vitol, an energy trading company, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and ICAP, the interdealer broker.The focus on London as a European beachhead does not make CME unique. Rivals are doing the same as the battle between exchanges increasingly focuses on opportunities in the post-trade business of clearing, thrown up by G20 regulations such as the US Dodd-Frank act that require greater use of the process in over-the-counter (OTC), or off-exchange, derivatives markets.Clearing houses stand between two parties to a trade, ensuring that a deal is completed if one side defaults, helping to minimise disruption to the financial system.Last week the London Stock Exchange said that it had received more than 70 per cent shareholder acceptances for its offer to take a majority stake in LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French clearing house which, together with the biggest banks active in OTC derivatives, operates the SwapClear interest rate and FX swaps clearing service. It is the biggest clearer of OTC interest rate swaps in Europe.CME rival IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), based in Atlanta, has operated a clearing house in London since 2008, clearing OTC credit default swaps and energy contracts traded on its London-based futures exchange, itself based on ICE’s acquisition in 2001 of the International Petroleum Exchange. The US operator also owns ECX, which is based in London.Mr Knottenbelt says that CME, which launched its own London-based clearing house last year, will offer OTC interest rate swaps clearing on it this year. That will be “more or less a copy” of CME’s existing US-based rates clearing service, against which SwapClear competes from a base in New York. Last week CME said it had cleared $394bn in total notional value of interest rate swaps since the service began, making it the biggest clearer of such products in the US.CME’s London clearing push was to have started with CDS more than a year ago but was abandoned after what CME said was “customer feedback”. The business then launched with clearing of OTC commodity contracts, including biodiesel, propane, ethanol and rapeseed oil.Mr Knottenbelt says that even with the planned entry into interest rate swaps clearing business of more competitors – Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing subsidiary is working on a service that could be live by the summer – there is room for more, pointing out that 65 per cent of the OTC derivatives market takes place in London.“We’ve talked to existing clients in Europe and we’ve had a relatively good response. From a client perspective, you want to have choice,” Mr Knottenbelt says. “For us, it is very competitive here but part of it is having an array of products that allows you to compete and then winning over the users of the markets to the view that what you’re offering is better.”"
420;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-13T21:23:58Z;CME floor traders protest block trades;;Independent futures traders at one of the CME Group’s most high-profile trading pits have walked off the job in a highly unusual protest against “block trades”, large, privately negotiated deals struck off the floor and reported to the markets after a delay.The trade in question was a deal on Thursday for 215,000 Eurodollar options contracts, much larger than the typical trading size of about 500 contracts. During regular trading hours, CME Group, the biggest US futures exchange, gives parties to block trades five minutes from the time of the deal to report them to the wider market. Outside regular hours, the permitted delay is 15 minutes.Independent floor traders, who trade with their own money and are known as “locals”, say the 13-year-old system denies them the opportunity to participate in such transactions by offering better prices.Although trading in most CME contracts is largely electronic, the Eurodollar options pit in Chicago has one of the highest proportions of floor-based trading, with more than 90 per cent of transactions taking place in the pit. Eurodollar futures are a financial instrument that captures the interest rate on dollar deposits held outside the US.Most of the locals in the Eurodollar options pit participated in the walkout on Friday, leaving the pit at about 8am. Although many had returned within a few hours, the stoppage was rare.“This is the first time I’ve ever heard of something like this happening at the CME,” said Jeff Carter, a veteran CME local.CME said the block trade had been “a legitimate, well-managed trade”.David Stein, a leader of the protest, said the locals were angry at the lack of competition and transparency in block trading. He told CNBC that such trades should be displayed to the entire market to offer quotes.However, one of the parties to the block trade that sparked the protest said customers who make big transactions should not be forced to display them to the market. Don Wilson, chief executive of DRW Trading, a Chicago firm that is the biggest block trader in Eurodollar options, told the FT he had fought in the past to reduce the reporting delay, but said a delay was necessary.“If someone wants to move a big trade, they want to be able to do it and not necessarily let everyone else know about it right away,” said Mr Wilson. He said placing large orders openly would allow independent traders to profit by trading ahead of them. “If you do the trade in the pit and everyone sees it, everyone will front-run it.”
421;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-13T21:07:51Z;CBOE names new compliance chief;;One of the US’s biggest options exchange companies has signalled that it would tighten up its oversight of trading by naming a new top compliance officer with power to establish and implement new rules on regulation.CBOE Holdings said on Friday that Alexandra Albright, a former leading lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission, will take on the new role of chief compliance officer, starting on April 23. The appointment is in response to a federal investigation into CBOE’s regulatory practices.The company, which operates the Chicago Board Options Exchange as well as a smaller exchange for futures, equities and a second options-trading platform, revealed in February that the SEC was “investigating CBOE’s compliance with its obligations as a self-regulatory organisation under federal securities laws”. The group is the regulator for one options market-maker and 25 equities broker-dealers, according to its website.The investigation is part of regular SEC inquiries into the role that exchanges play as private regulators of market behaviour, according to people familiar with the investigation. They are meant to ensure that exchanges have adequate written policies.The role of exchanges as regulators has come into focus after more than $1bn of customer funds went missing after the collapse of MF Global. Some of MF Global’s activities were overseen by CME Group, for its futures trading, and CBOE, in securities.Two of CBOE’s top compliance officers – Patrick Fay, senior vice-president of compliance, and Linda Gerdes, head of market regulation – have resigned in recent months in the wake of the SEC launching its inquiry. The exchange is also undertaking its own investigation into unusual trading behaviour.CBOE said Ms Albright would be responsible for “establishing, implementing and maintaining policies and procedures” on regulating its exchanges and ensuring they comply with regulations laid down by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Ms Albright worked at the SEC from 2001 to 2006, latterly as senior counsel for the division of enforcement in the office of market surveillance. She currently works at Kirkland & Ellis, a Chicago law firm.Bill Brodsky, CBOE chief executive, said Ms Albright’s “in-depth knowledge of securities markets and her legal experience in both market regulation and the corporate sector will be invaluable in assuring that our exchanges fulfil their obligations as self-regulatory organisations”.
422;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-12T20:45:36Z;NSE inks FTSE 100 derivatives deal;;The National Stock Exchange of India, the country’s largest exchange operator, has deepened its push into derivatives trading after securing a licence to trade futures and options based on the FTSE 100 index.The bourse will begin trading rupee-denominated derivatives contracts based on the London benchmark index owned by FTSE International, part of the London Stock Exchange, from May 3.Discussions between the two parties have been going on for several years and an outline agreement predates the LSE’s purchase of the 50 per cent of FTSE it did not own in December. However a formal launch has been held up pending approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the local regulator.Nevertheless, the deal underlines how exchanges in western markets are focusing on India as a key area for growth, often using their ownership of index businesses as a starting point.Last year the NSE’s main domestic rival, the Bombay Stock Exchange, signed a licensing agreement with the International Securities Exchange, the US options exchange owned by Deutsche Börse, to launch derivative contracts. The NSE also has deals in place with CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, to trade rupee-denominated futures contracts based on two key US indices, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.Competition between Indian exchanges has also been rising as rapid advances in technology are allowing algorithmic and high-frequency traders to make inroads into new markets and trade new asset classes like derivatives. Bourses are modernising their trading systems, and the LSE last year signed a deal to sell its trading technology to the Delhi Stock Exchange.The NSE is hoping the contract will further boost its derivatives business. While it has offered the US contracts since last August, North American markets trade while Indian markets are closed. There will be a three-hour overlap in trading hours between London and India, allowing investors to arbitrage markets.“The FTSE 100 Index will help Indian investors to diversify their portfolios further and have access to one of the world’s widely tracked equity indices, whilst minimising currency risk, “ said Ravi Narain, chief executive of the NSE.Exchanges have faced erosion of their market share at the hands of smaller competitors and banks’ own trading platforms and been looking at index businesses as a way to lock in new revenue. By launching new products and distributing them widely, index businesses can attract institutional investors seeking new ways to gain exposure to emerging markets or automated traders wanting to trade different asset classes, such as derivatives.Mr Narain intends to focus on organic growth at the NSE in coming years amid rapid change. Last week, Indian regulators cleared the country’s main stock exchanges to list, while the BSE announced the unexpected departure of Madhu Kannan, its chief executive, to Tata Group.
423;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-12T18:09:59Z;ICE takes on rival CME on grains;;IntercontinentalExchange is bringing its rivalry with CME Group to US grain markets, listing five new futures contracts that settle against the Chicago exchange operator’s benchmarks including corn and wheat.The new products are the latest cash-settled “lookalike” futures, in which one exchange ties the price of a contract to futures settled by physical commodity deliveries at another.The ICE cash-settled US West Texas Intermediate crude oil contract was launched in 2006 and now has a quarter of the open interest of the physical crude it mirrors on CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange.CME also lists lookalikes including futures that track cocoa, coffee, cotton and sugar futures on the ICE Futures US exchange in New York.Trading in the four contracts is sparse. Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, last year told the Financial Times that cash-settled futures were “a parasitic, second-order derivative”.ICE’s move comes as grain markets have gyrated over the past year owing to disappointing crops and strong demand from livestock farmers, ethanol refiners and other consumers.Average open interest has roughly doubled in the past five years for corn, soyabean and wheat futures and options on CME’s Chicago Board of Trade, partly fuelled by commodities’ advent as an asset class.The new ICE futures and options would start trading next month and settle against Chicago-listed corn, soyabeans, soyabean meal, soyabean oil and wheat.Ben Jackson, chief operating officer of ICE Futures US, said the exchange listed the contracts in response to demand for an alternative place to trade as regulations tighten for off-exchange derivatives markets.“A fundamental belief of our customers is that competition will improve these markets,” he said. “They believe competition will make these markets tighter and more liquid for them to facilitate the type of transaction they need to do to protect themselves from volatile price movements.”Atlanta-based ICE is also trying to appeal to ultra-fast electronic traders, an important part of its customer base.A web page announcing that the new futures and options says ICE has the “fastest matching engine in [the] futures industry with sub-millisecond transaction time”.Corn, wheat and oat futures, introduced in 1877, are the oldest Chicago grain futures contracts still trading. Soyabean futures were first offered in 1936.CME said: “CME Group agricultural products, including CBOT grain futures and options, are global benchmarks that continue to offer the deepest and most liquid markets to customers around the globe.“We believe competition is good for business and we will continue to work with our customers to meet their needs for agriculture risk management.”Sterling Smith of broker Country Hedging in Minneapolis doubted the tradition-bound agricultural futures market would migrate away from Chicago’s legacy marketplace.“I am not entirely sure there is a lot to be gained by having these contracts,” he said. “The ICE is definitely going to face an uphill challenge in trying to get liquidity to move out of the CME.”
424;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:34:32+0000;NYSE Liffe to launch new repo future market;;NYSE Liffe US will launch its new repo futures in July, bringing to market a product that the group believes can supplant the troubled existing benchmarks for short-term lending.It is the newest in a series of products that NYSE Liffe US, the New York based futures trading arm of NYSE Euronext, has launched with the hopes of attracting significant trading volumes and taking share from CME Group, where nearly all US interest rate-related futures are traded.The group hopes that the futures on the average rate paid for the most active traded repurchase agreements will win traction as a benchmark. So called “repos” are a $400bn market for short-term loans of high-quality collateral such as US Treasuries or agency mortgages in exchange for cash.Libor, which is a daily fixing of interbank overnight dollar lending rates, set in London, is the globally agreed benchmark for many lending rates. But it has been under scrutiny following a probe by UK, US and Japanese authorities for alleged manipulation.Additionally, trading in futures on the core rates set by the Federal Reserve has also dropped off after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation placed a tax on transactions in Fed Funds.NYSE Liffe US’s futures will be based on the GCF Repo Index compiled by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation in New York.Thomas Callahan, chief executive of NYSE Liffe US, said at an investor meeting earlier this month that the product had “massive potential for 2012 and 2013”.“The two things that market participants would usually look at in terms of a short-term benchmark, fed funds and Libor, are both in their own way broken right now,” he said. “The market needs a new benchmark and we think that this could be it.”The product is also part of a larger strategy by NYSE Euronext to capture a greater share of rates trading as more products shift from over-the-counter to centrally cleared.The exchange said the repo futures may be cross-margined with other trades cleared by New York Portfolio Clearing, a clearing house co-owned by DTCC and NYSE Euronext.NYSE Liffe US is one of several groups competing for a share of the emerging centrally-cleared over-the-counter interest rate swap market, the result of the Dodd-Frank Act’s move to push more derivatives trades into clearing houses.CME Group plans to offer cheaper trading by combining the costs of trading listed futures and interest rates swaps. This week it also announced it was exploring launching an exchange in London to trade interest rate futures.NYSE Liffe US hopes to follow by building its own listed futures rate market and aligning with LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear unit, which clears OTC swaps.
425;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-09T21:02:42Z;CME considers London futures platform;;CME Group is considering opening a futures exchange in London as a way for the US operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to expand in Europe.The development is a sign that if the Chicago company does not win the bidding for the London Metal Exchange, it could build a European futures exchange to complement its existing clearing business.CME is one of a handful of global exchanges, including NYSE Euronext, that have submitted initial bids for the LME, with IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) also believed to have bid.It underscores how London is emerging as the key battleground for derivatives trading and clearing as new regulations, such as the US Dodd-Frank Act and similar European legislation, force over-the-counter derivatives to be processed through clearing houses.The London Stock Exchange last week said shareholders had approved its acquisition of a controlling stake in LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest clearer by volume of OTC interest rate swaps.NYSE Euronext, operator of London’s Liffe futures exchange, said last month it would complete a fledgling derivatives clearing house in the capital that would handle OTC derivatives as well as Liffe’s existing euribor interest rate futures contracts.CME has operated a clearing house in London since last year, building on a sales office that was its beachhead in Europe when it opened in 2004.William Knottenbelt, head of CME’s operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, said that CME had OTC derivatives clearing in London, but because of the group’s wide product range, “We would have to consider what we would do on the [exchange-traded] futures side, so we would need to have an exchange [in London].”“It’s something which we are considering, but the decision to actually do it has not been made,” Mr Knottenbelt told the Financial Times. He declined to comment on a potential bid for the LME.CME’s main US rival, ICE, has operated a London energy futures exchange since its purchase of the International Petroleum Exchange in 2001.It also operates a clearing house in London for OTC credit default swaps, OTC energy contracts and all its energy futures business.LSE is expected to use its LCH.Clearnet acquisition as the launch pad for a push deeper into exchange-traded futures and to increase OTC interest rate swaps clearing, already handled by LCH’s SwapClear service – which also competes with CME in swaps clearing in the US.Deutsche Börse is also set to enter the fray with the launch of OTC interest rate swaps clearing at its Eurex Clearing subsidiary, based in Frankfurt, by the summer.Mr Knottenbelt, global head of futures and global clearing at RBS until he was hired by CME last November, said CME would later this year launch clearing in London of OTC interest rate swaps.He said even with SwapClear and the imminent entry of Eurex Clearing, there was room for a third competitor given that about 65 per cent of the global market for OTC interest rate swaps originated in London.“We’ve talked to existing clients in Europe and have had a relatively good response. From a client perspective you want choice,” he said.
426;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-03T14:05:25Z;CME takes over GreenX emissions exchange;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, is to push deeper into emissions trading after taking control of UK-based GreenX Holdings, the world’s second-largest carbon exchange.The Chicago-based group said on Tuesday that it bought the 60 per cent stake it did not own in GreenX for an undisclosed sum from a consortium that included ICAP, the world’s largest interdealer broker, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Vitol, the energy trader.The purchase came as carbon prices tumbled to record lows on fears the market is oversupplied with the permits that give polluters the right to emit specific volumes.Official data this week showed a bigger than expected drop in the amount of pollution emitted by power plants and factories and a greater proportion of electricity generated by renewable sources such as solar and wind farms.A 60 per cent fall in carbon prices in the past year has prompted concerns about whether emissions trading schemes, such as the one run by the European Union, could achieve their goals of encouraging low-carbon investment.Bryan Durkin, chief operating officer said GreenX’s contracts would continue to be traded on Globex and cleared through ClearPort, the over-the-counter clearing service of CME Clearing.“GreenX’s global product slate will be more closely integrated with our energy complex and customers will benefit from the valuable clearing and margin offsets that we offer,” he said.Exchanges are pushing into so-called portfolio margining, which allows customers to calculate their net exposure to assets after combining their exposures in swaps and futures. The move comes at a time when market participants are looking to tackle a shortage of collateral in financial markets.However GreenX is a distant second to IntercontinentalExchange, with roughly 7 per cent of ICE’s emissions volumes in 2011.“This [move] could help attract open interest given potential capital efficiencies although market liquidity, which currently favors ICE, is likely to be a more important driver,” said Christopher Harris, an analyst at Wells Fargo.Deregulation is increasing competition among exchanges, leading many to seek mergers and acquisitions as a way of increasing scaleGreenX gained market share in Europe last year from rivals such as European Energy Exchange, controlled by Deutsche Börse, and Bluenext, a venture between NYSE Euronext and Caisse des Dépôts. It took 10 per cent of the overall market for over-the-counter cleared futures contracts while volumes across all contracts on the exchange rose more than fourfold to 450,000.Volumes in the benchmark EU Allowance futures, the most liquid carbon futures contract, soared nearly 700 per cent last year.The CME said existing contracts and open interest would continue to be subject to the GreenX rules until the contracts and open interest were moved to a contract market approved by US regulators.GreenX had been owned by a consortium consisting of CME, Constellation Energy, Credit Suisse, Evolution Markets, Goldman Sachs, ICAP Energy, JP Ventures Energy Corporation, Morgan Stanley, RNK Capital, Spectron, TFS Energy, Tudor Investment Corporation and Vitol.
427;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-02T20:05:42Z;NYSE Euronext to start UK spread bets market;;NYSE Euronext announced it is launching a contract-for-difference derivatives market in the UK and Europe next year, part of a series of initiatives announced as the exchange looks past its scrapped merger with Deutsche Börse.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive, also said the company would launch a new cost-cutting programme expected to slash $250m in annual expenses by 2014, or 15 per cent of its expected 2015 cost base.NYSE has already laid out a return to a previous strategy of building a clearing house in Europe, and has said it will continue to invest in new products in its nascent US futures market. Yet among tepid trading volumes, investors have been focused on capital return and cost cutting to generate income.But at Monday’s investor meeting, Mr Niederauer defended the potential of his group to continue to grow. “We really think there are opportunities to grow the top line,” he said.Mr Niederauer also said that NYSE Euronext would continue to pursue “tuck-under” and “strategic” mergers, adding that European regulators’ rejection of the Deutsche Börse deal “has not left us with scars”.One new initiative is the expected launch of a CFD market in the first quarter of 2013. It has been in development for nine months, at a cost of $11m, and is expected to be profitable by 2014.The $8bn CFD market has grown rapidly in the UK and Europe. CFDs are designed to profit from the difference in price of two securities, and are marketed primarily to retail investors and day traders.CFDs benefit from advantageous tax treatment in UK, where the stamp duty does not apply, since no physical securities are swapped. But such trading is not allowed in the US, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has restricted spread betting. It is also mired in controversy at the moment, following the collapse of the brokers MF Global and Worldspreads.The offering will differ from existing CFD markets in that NYSE Euronext will not act as a counterparty. It will instead enlist market-making firms and professional traders to take the other side of trades with retail customers in a multilateral trading facility, or MTF. The MTF will allow contracts on securities and products listed on any exchange.“This is very exciting. The size of this market is massive, and we’ll have first-mover advantage in the sense that we will not be trading against our clients,” said Garry Jones, NYSE Euronext’s head of global derivatives.NYSE Euronext also announced its cost cuts, to be called “Project 2014”. This will include technology initiatives and shrinking its real estate footprint.The company has been under pressure from analysts to bring its margins more in-line with peers. Its 38 per cent operating margin in 2011 trailed that of Nasdaq OMX, at 46 per cent, and BATS Global Markets, at 54 per cent. CME Group sits at the top, at 63 per cent, according to the analysts Raymond James.
428;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-02T19:09:41Z;NYPC names chief executive;;"New York Portfolio Clearing has named former swaps trader Alexander ""Sandy” Broderick as its permanent chief executive, the latest in a series of moves as it prepares to take on over-the-counter products ahead of impending financial reform.Mr Broderick joins NYPC, the joint venture between NYSE Euronext and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, from Société Générale, where he was head of British pound derivatives and bond trading. He was previously a swaps trader at Bank of America.While at SocGen, Mr Broderick aided in the development of SwapClear, the global OTC interest-rate swaps clearing system backed by LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house. He was also chairman of OTCDerivNet, which represents global banks in efforts to develop clearing tools.LCH.Clearnet and NYPC recently announced a ”Project Trinity” alliance, along with NYSE Liffe US, a listed futures exchange, to explore ways to offer margin efficiencies to traders of swaps and futures, and compete with integrated exchanges CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, told investors on Monday: “Hopefully we can be the swaps solution on this side of the pond [in the US], the way OTCDerivNet and SwapClear are on the other side.”Such efficiencies have emerged as a critical battleground in the burgeoning trading and clearing landscape, which is being reworked by the Dodd-Frank Act in the US, and Emir in Europe, to push more over-the-counter trades into central clearinghouses in order to reduce risk.But with a shortage of available collateral, many banks and trading groups are worried about the huge costs of posting margin to clearing houses.In response, clearers such as CME and the ICE have rolled out tools that will enable members to net their margins across products; the “trinity” aims to join them.“The impending change in market regulation makes NYPC perfectly placed to serve and help market participants adapt to the new environment,” said Mr Broderick in a statement.Mr Broderick replaces interim chief Murray Pozmanter of DTCC, who was filling in following the departure of Walt Lukken.Mr Lukken was a former commissioner of the US futures regulator, who is now head of the industry lobby, the Futures Industry Association."
429;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-04-01T16:26:00Z;NYSE Euronext moves on after failed merger;;NYSE Euronext begins the next phase of its life on Monday, as it holds its first investor meeting since its failed Deutsche Börse merger amid questions about how it now plans to grow its clearing and technology revenues.Since a series of proposed global exchange mergers last year were blocked by shareholders and regulators, NYSE Euronext and its peers have been fighting the perception that they have become more utilities, which are now expected to pay dividends rather than expand their companies.Many incumbent exchanges continue to lose market share to start-up electronic markets and bank-owned pools. NYSE Euronext saw its share of US stock trading fall to less than 24 per cent in the first quarter, according to analysts at Sandler O’Neill.“Given the soft volume environment, we are very interested in what they have to say about cost-cutting, the capital return programme and what they’re doing to grow new businesses,” said Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.NYSE Euronext has said it expects to use the $550m remaining on a share buyback programme from last year, and could authorise more. But its 16 per cent share price decline in 2012 has outpaced rivals such as Nasdaq OMX, CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange.On Monday, Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, is expected to delve deeper into its post-merger strategy. He has already identified clearing as a “key focus”, which had also been a central rationale for the Deutsche Börse deal.Clearing houses stand between buyers and sellers in a trade, and are expected to see sharply rising revenues as G20 countries urge more complex derivatives to be centrally cleared.The group recently announced an $85m revival of a two-year-old plan to expand its London-based derivatives clearing house and sever some of its existing ties with LCH.Clearnet. It has also hinted at further investment in its US futures trading and clearing effort, and submitted a bid for the London Metal Exchange, the commodities bourse.But analysts say the larger opportunity lies in clearing over-the-counter swaps trades for customers, and LCH.Clearnet is the global leader in clearing interest-rate swap trades between banks.Attention will also be focused on NYSE Technologies, the group’s fastest growing business. Turnover last year rose 10 per cent to $490m, but that fell short of targets, and is still halfway to its target of $1bn by 2015.
430;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-29T13:30:04Z;Calypso turnover rises to $220m;;Calypso Technology, a US trading technology company, is targeting emerging markets and asset portfolio management as the rush to build infrastructure to comply with new rules on derivatives trading pushed its annual turnover over $200m for the first time.The group said revenue for the year to December 31 rose from $160m to a record $220m, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose more than 30 per cent to $72m. During the year it won deals to provide the technology for clearing over-the-counter derivatives for BM&FBovespa, the Brazilian exchange, CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.The catalyst has been a mandate from the G20 group of economies in 2009, keen to strengthen the global financial system in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Regulators want more of the OTC derivatives market processed through clearing houses, with some requiring clearing of trades to be done “as soon as technologically practicable”.It has sparked a flurry of technology projects around the world as exchanges, banks and institutional investors build technology infrastructure capable of handling the changes.Kishore Bopardikar, chief executive, called Calypso’s earnings growth in 2011 “a significant milestone in the company’s growth trajectory”. Founded in 1997, it has seen compound annual revenue growth of more than 40 per cent over the past 10 years. The group has had no outside investors and is owned by management and employs more than 600 people.Mr Bopardikar added that the company was looking at growth in OTC derivatives management for local banks in emerging markets. Large foreign banks have greater experience in the industry but are scaling back some operations as they look to preserve capital to comply with new Basel III banking rules.He also said the group would be looking at managing large asset portfolios that are being sold by banks to institutional investors.“On some of these portfolios, the capital costs that the regulators are asking them to set aside are much higher than they used to be – sometimes by 3-4 times,” he said. “When they buy these portfolios [the buy-side] don’t have the infrastructure for them.”
431;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-28T16:25:23Z;Chinese bank arm seeks LME membership;;The London Metal Exchange has received two new membership applications, including one from the first potential Chinese member, in a vote of confidence as the exchange prepares for a sale.BOCI, the international arm of the Bank of China, one of the country’s leading banks, and London based GH Financials have applied to become broking and clearing members of the 135-year-old exchange, which hosts futures contracts used as global industry benchmarks for metals from copper to nickel.The Chinese bank’s move comes as the Asian nation has become the largest buyer of many raw materials and industrial metals traded at the LME.Arthur Fan, chief executive of BOCI Global Commodities in the UK, said: “Over 50 per cent of the volume of the LME is for Chinese customers but there is no Chinese investment bank to provide hedge services directly to them.” He said the investment bank was also in the process of entering iron ore swaps trading in Singapore.The Chinese bank’s LME application also comes as European banks – the traditional players in commodities derivatives trading – are cutting back or shutting their commodities operations as they face increasing balance sheet constraints.While the LME is set to decide on the applications at a board meeting next month, the addition of the Chinese bank to its membership will increase the exchange’s attractiveness as a takeover target.The LME, one of the only a few member-owned exchanges in the world, is waiting for the second round of offers by a May 7 deadline. The exchange’s suitors include the CME Group, ICE and NYSE Euronext. The exchange is home to Europe’s last trading pit where traders shout orders to each other, and is seen as one of the few prizes left in an increasingly consolidated industry.
432;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:58:35+0000;BBA to launch crackdown on Libor rates;;The sponsors of the London interbank lending rates used in $350tn in contracts worldwide are considering imposing tighter codes of conduct and new statistical controls at a time when regulators on three continents are probing allegations that the rates may have been manipulated.Three weeks after promising a review, the British Bankers’ Association has convened a steering committee of five global banks, a wholesale broker group and the CME, the futures exchange group, to come up with revisions to the London Interbank Offered Rates that help set the price of financial products including mortgages and credit cards.The group will meet the UK Financial Services Authority, the Bank of England and the Treasury and seek input from other users and contributors, the BBA said. Participants said they hope to put out a formal reform package by midsummer.The changes are designed to “provide ongoing confidence to the rate”, Angela Knight, chief executive of the BBA, told the Financial Times. “Sensible evolution needs to take place.”Libor rates are set daily in 10 currencies under the auspices of the BBA. Panels of banks submit estimates of their unsecured borrowing costs over 15 different time periods to Thomson Reuters, which tosses out the highest and lowest rates and averages the rest to compute the daily rate.But the rating setting process has come under increasing criticism in the past couple of years. Users have complained that the short-term rates diverged from other market indices. European Union, US, and UK regulators have opened probes into whether the rate setting banks were tinkering with their bids, either to make themselves look stronger in the financial crisis, or to enable traders to make money on interest rate-related derivatives. No charges have been filed.The reform committee, which includes representatives of Barclays, Lloyds, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, will look at three specific areas and receive technical assistance from the Oliver Wyman consultancy, the BBA said.The discussions will focus on new rules about who within a bank should be consulted and informed about the daily rate submissions and exactly what financial instruments banks should use as reference points. The committee will also consider whether specific statistical safeguards can be created and put in place to insure that an individual bank’s submissions remain consistent over time.Thomson Reuters already investigates bids considered to be outliers but the review will consider whether additional safeguards are needed.“The market requires a choice of interest rate reference curves and Libor is a vital and important part of this. We are glad to be part of this project,” said David Clark, chairman of the Wholesale Markets Brokers Association.
433;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Tocom seeks closer ties overseas;;Tokyo Commodity Exchange is seeking deeper ties with rivals overseas, as the consolidation of Japan’s fragmented exchange landscape gathers pace.Speaking to the Financial Times, president and chief executive Tadashi Ezaki said he wanted to develop “more concrete relationships” with overseas partners such as CME Group of Chicago and other, unnamed, exchange groups. Tocom has loose co-operative agreements with a dozen bourses worldwide, including ICE Futures Europe of London, the Shanghai Futures Exchange and the Multi Commodity Exchange of India.The bigger and more influential Tocom can become, say analysts, the better the chances of securing good deals for its shareholders in the state-led consolidation of the industry.The ruling Democratic party of Japan has long seen mergers between the country’s nine exchange groups as a way to help the country regain its position as Asia’s top financial hub. Japan’s cabinet this month approved a plan to give the Financial Services Agency oversight of stock, commodity and grain exchanges, in a move that will make it easier to eventually combine the markets. Now, regulation is divided between the FSA and the trade and agriculture ministries.The two biggest exchanges, the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange, are expected to merge by January next year. “Regulators, politicians, the OSE, the TSE and a great number of market participants (TSE shareholders) all need this deal to go through,” wrote Jonathan Foster, a Singapore-based director at Religare Capital Markets, in a note to clients last month.Tocom, once the world’s second-largest commodity bourse after the New York Mercantile Exchange, suffered falling trading volumes between 2003 and 2010, as the Japanese government tightened regulation over sales of risky financial assets to individuals, while Japan’s trading companies chose to use more liquid markets such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the London Metal Exchange.Tocom’s total volumes had fallen to 31.7m contracts last year from the peak of 87.3m, when the government began to respond to complaints of aggressive sales practices from commodity brokers. Subsequent restrictions barred brokers from cold-calling, or soliciting business from anyone more than 70 years old. Retail trades have since fallen from about half of Tocom’s volumes to one-fifth.To spur volumes, Mr Ezaki is hoping to increase direct participation from foreign brokers, most of whom place their trades through domestic institutions. At the moment, Newedge and Credit Suisse are the only two non-Japanese members of Tocom.“We need to stress the advantages of our yen-denominated products,” Mr Ezaki said. “When the yen weakens, for example, our gold price goes up. There are unique opportunities presented by our markets.”
434;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-27T08:40:59Z;Matba in futures deal with Montevideo bourse;;Mercado a Término de Buenos Aires (Matba), the Argentine commodity derivatives exchange, has signed an agreement with the Montevideo Stock Exchange to launch Uruguay’s first futures market.The move highlights how many exchanges in emerging markets are keen to emulate their counterparts in more mature economies and attract foreign trading interest by offering trading in equities and derivatives under one roof.It is also the latest sign that Latin American bourses outside Brazil are forging partnerships and merging to challenge the regional dominance of BM&FBovespa. The São Paolo-based exchange accounts for 85 per cent of equities trading and 90 per cent of derivatives trading in south America.“Our idea is for it to be operational this year,” Ricardo Valderrama, Matba president, told the Financial Times. The statutes are ready but Uruguayan central bank approval is still required for the venture, which will be Uruguayan-run but in which the Argentine market will have a majority stake.The two markets are still defining exactly what contracts will be launched on the new market, to be called the Matba Río de la Plata Bolsa de Valores. “We are studying the best alternatives for Uruguayan investors. It is highly feasible they will need a beef [futures] contract.” Soya is also very likely, he added.The Uruguayan venture comes at a boom time for Matba, which has enjoyed the best January and February in its 105-year history, with year-to-date volumes 92 per cent ahead of the first quarter last year.The Uruguayan market will be run separately from Matba and will not divert business from Buenos Aires, Mr Valderrama said. Indeed, any new contracts traded in Montevideo which are not on offer in Buenos Aires are not likely to cross the River Plate immediately because Argentine capital control requirements and new regulations make it harder to take dollars out of the country.“Uruguay is a market which doesn’t have the legal impediments that Argentina has. If the market develops in the way we believe it will, it could attract investors from various parts of the world,” Mr Valderrama said.All activity will initially be index-based and not, like at Matba, allow for the possibility of physical delivery. “We’ll see how it develops,” he added.It will use Matba’s trading platform and internet-based trading to allow investors direct access to the market.Discussions on setting up the Uruguayan venture took nearly 18 months but Mr Valderrama declined to comment on the prospect of other international alliances. However, he said: “We are open to associations . . . we are always talking to other markets.”He hopes to be able to launch a series of “financial” contracts, which would mirror contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in Chicago, in the first half of this year. Argentine authorities have already given the green light to new silver and oil contracts but final approval for the planned dollar, euro and gold contracts is still pending.The market will wait until all approvals have been received before launching the contracts, probably starting with dollar and gold “where we think there will be most demand”, he said.
435;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
436;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-26T20:57:33Z;US regulator convenes panel on HFT;;The US futures regulator has named the participants for a key panel set to discuss a definition of and the regulation of high-frequency trading later this week.The panel was assembled by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after commissioner Scott O’Malia formulated his own definition of high-frequency trading and asked the industry for input.Mr O’Malia and Gary Gensler, another commissioner, have said that a definition is necessary before regulating any potential dangers of high-frequency dealing, though some European regulators have opted not to define the practice, arguing it would inhibit prudential regulation.The CFTC has said it has started a broad review of the role of computerised trading in markets, focusing on whether automated “algorithms” pose risks of runaway trading.The industry has also been divided on whether to define HFT, with some believing it would produce a more focused debate on market technology, but critics and others fearing that it could provide a way for some groups that use HFT, such as banks, to escape regulation by the letter of the law.The CFTC committee, which will meet on March 29 for the first time, includes representatives from some of the biggest high-speed trading firms in the world, such as Sean Castette of Getco and Chris Concannon of Virtu Financial.It also includes representatives of exchanges where high-speed traders are major customers, such as Chris Isaacon, chief operating officer of BATS Global Markets, Colin Clark of NYSE Euronext, Mark Wassersug of the IntercontinentalExchange and Dean Payton of CME Group.Several highly quantitative hedge funds, which rely on computer models but do not necessarily trade at the same speeds as proprietary market-makers, are also represented. That includes Peter Reiss of DE Shaw and Michael Mendelson of AQR Capital Management.There are also critics of high-frequency dealing, such as Joseph Saluzzi of Themis Trading and Jordan Lea, president of the American Cotton Shippers Association.Two influential academics were also included, both of whom have argued in favour of speed trading. Terrence Hendershott of the University of California Berkeley co-authored a paper last year that found that HFT played a “positive role in price efficiency”. Joel Hasbrouck of the New York University Stern School of Business co-authored a paper finding that high-speed trading “improves traditional market quality measures”.The panel will be chaired by Andrei Kirilenko, CFTC chief economist. It will also have two working groups, with one working on a definition of HFT and the other working on whether to have multiple categories of HFT.
437;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;LSE pursues ‘holy grail’ of clearing;;This week London Stock Exchange shareholders and those of LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French clearer, will receive a 169-page offer document setting out the terms of the UK bourse’s proposal to acquire a majority stake in the London-based clearing house.The move would give the LSE its own clearing house at a time of unprecedented demand for post-trade and risk management services, as regulators push for greater safety in the financial system to help prevent another financial crash.The deal also sets in motion a complex global game of chess involving LCH.Clearnet, the LSE, and rivals such as NYSE Euronext.The ultimate prize is to combine some of the most widely traded derivatives that are traded on exchanges with off-exchange, or over-the-counter, derivatives that are at the heart of G20 regulations that are pushing greater use of clearing.Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, says: “That’s the way the exchanges are definitely pursuing it and positioning themselves. The reason why they are doing this is Basel III is putting pressure on banks to be more efficient with capital. If the exchanges can provide cross-margining efficiencies that’s going to be a big help – and drive business to the exchanges at the same time.”The “holy grail” is to be able to clear both exchange-traded interest rate futures and OTC interest rate swaps at the same clearing house. There, positions in each can be offset against each other – a process known as “portfolio margining” – thus reducing the amount of insurance, or collateral, that traders have to place with the clearing house against trades failing.Exchanges with clearing houses believe this will be attractive to banks and others trading derivatives as they face extra demands on their capital thanks to upcoming Basel III rules and amid a general shortage of quality collateral.Last week CME Group, the US futures exchange operator, made the first move by unveiling portfolio margining of US interest rate futures and OTC interest rate swaps. Not to be outdone, LCH.Clearnet, NYSE Euronext and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation of the US a day later unveiled plans for a similar service – dubbed “Trinity” – encompassing repo, cash and fixed income as well.By acquiring control of LCH.Clearnet, the LSE could engineer the combined clearing of the OTC interest rate swaps already cleared at LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear service with a yet-to-be launched interest rate futures contract, industry experts say.NYSE Euronext is already home to trading of the largest European, short-dated interest rate futures contract, euribor, traded on NYSE Liffe in London. It could then start clearing an OTC product later.Yet matters are complicated because some key functions related to the clearing of euribor are tackled by LCH.Clearnet and, awkwardly, NYSE is a rival of the LSE – LCH.Clearnet’s possible new owner.With the failure of its tie-up with Deutsche Börse, NYSE Euronext is now building up a separate clearing house in London to avoid reliance on LCH.Clearnet.But a battle of wills has emerged between NYSE Euronext and LCH.Clearnet, which does not want to lose the business.NYSE Liffe carries out some of the clearing functions for trades executed on its trading platform but, importantly, the default fund that is typically provided by an exchange’s members as part of a pot of money held at the clearing house – and which guarantees trades against a default – is still held at LCH.Clearnet.In order for NYSE Liffe to complete its new clearing house, that default fund would have to shift to NYSE Liffe’s fledgling clearer.That is not a foregone conclusion. A key feature of the LSE-LCH.Clearnet deal is a pledge by Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, to maintain LCH’s “horizontal” model, under which it is happy to act as clearer for any exchange or trading venue.Ian Axe, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, says: “The beauty of our horizontal model is that we’re encouraging other exchanges to participate and have an equal amount of ‘product governance’ [in the business].”He suggests that whether the default fund shifts from LCH.Clearnet is partly a matter for NYSE Liffe’s customers. “There is a hassle factor,” he says, suggesting they might also have to come up with additional default funds as part of the shift “when capital is more important than ever to banks”.NYSE Liffe counters that the move would require little or no extra funds to be committed by customers and that the default fund would move fairly seamlessly to its new clearing house.Asked if NYSE Liffe will sever its ties with LCH.Clearnet, Garry Jones, NYSE Euronext’s head of global derivatives, says: “Yes, probably. I am also confident we will complete the build-out of our London clearing house.” He adds that it would also clear OTC derivatives.Meanwhile, Eurex Clearing, Deutsche Börse’s clearing house, is set to enter the fray in April with the launch of OTC interest rate swaps clearing.For the shareholders of both the LSE and LCH.Clearnet, how this chess game ultimately plays out is likely to be a key consideration when those documents land on their desks.
438;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-19T11:24:54Z;Brokers and exchanges set for FX clearing;;The world’s largest broker-dealers, exchanges and clearing houses have finalised preparations to clear foreign exchange (FX) derivatives in readiness for new financial rules that will reshape trading of the world’s largest asset class.On Monday six of the world’s largest dealer-brokers confirmed they would use an ICAP-owned platform that simplifies clearing for foreign exchange, while LCH.Clearnet, the European clearing house, began an FX-clearing service supported by 14 market participants. It comes only days after IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the US group, announced a similar service.The developments illustrate how many market participants, particularly sell-side banks, are readying themselves for a year-end deadline to comply with tough new US regulations for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading. The Dodd-Frank act, passed in 2009, mandated that more derivatives be traded on electronic venues and cleared through central counterparties (CCP), often known as clearing houses.A clearing house stands stands between two parties, ensuring a trade is completed if one side defaults. Upcoming regulations in Europe and Asia are making similiar provisions. Mandatory use of CCPs is a significant departure for the FX industry which has traditional conducted deals on a bilateral basis.However the new regulations have ratcheted up IT costs. Each trading venue historically has had its own software language, requiring broker-dealers to undertake complex software coding to connect to each trading venue and clearing house.The six broker-dealers - BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS - will use a platform owned by Traiana, a post-trade services group, to connect to clearing houses that clear OTC FX derivatives.The Traiana platform, known as Harmony CCP, sits between the broker and the trading venue and provides all the IT connectivity. CME Group, operator of the world’s largest futures exchange, has already connected to the Traiana network.Nick Solinger, chief marketing officer at Traiana in New York, told FT Trading Room that the group was working on interoperability - the ability of a system to work with rivals systems’ with other post-trade services providers.Also on Monday, LCH.Clearnet said that other market participants would be joining its FX clearing service in coming weeks. Among the currencies it will clear are non-deliverable futures include the Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Chinese yuan, and Indian rupee against the US dollar.It comes only days after ICE, one of its main rivals for clearing in Europe, unveiled a similar venture. It will clear derivative FX contracts for BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS.The exchange also confirmed it was working with other market participants, including investors and trading venues to develop the service further. ICE is one of the world’s largest clearers of credit derivatives and has cleared more than $28tn in gross notional value in US and European index and single name CDS. CME also began FX clearing in May last year.Institutional investors are unprepared for tough new regulations around trading off-exchange derivatives and are relying on banks and brokers to help them adapt, a survey last week found. Brokers are spending up to $1bn on technology and compliance systems upgrades to meet the Dodd-Frank rules but buy-side spending was only about $1m-$2m per participant this year, it found.
439;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-15T22:44:26Z;Boca Beat: Change essential to futures industry;As John Damgard steps down, questions abound;The cardboard cut-out photo figures of John Damgard, outgoing Futures Industry Association president, dotting the conference venue said it all.This was the end of an era that began in the 1970s when the US futures markets had only just been invented, years before “pit” trading succumbed to the electronic trading revolution that has swept the derivatives markets.At the time Damgard, now 70, was an under secretary of agriculture in the Nixon administration where he had a part in the creation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the industry watchdog.He has handed his post over to Walt Lukken, a man 26 years his junior and a former acting chairman of the CFTC. His last job was head of New York Portfolio Clearing, a business that has pioneered one of the latest developments in the plumbing of the markets: portfolio margining.The contrast between Damgard – the congressionally connected, politically savvy communicator – with Lukken – an easy-going, sharp, self-confessed “plumber” – can be overdone. The two share a background in Washington.Lukken is the public face of how the futures markets have changed beyond recognition in that time. And they are set to change further, as exchanges, clearers and banks grapple with a new world of over-the-counter (OTC) products. Acronyms like “LSOC” – legally separated, operationally commingled, a reference to how clearing collateral is handled – would have puzzled those Nixon-era types. But they are the lingua franca of the new generation running this business.As if to underscore the change, Damgard’s retirement was overshadowed by the surprise announcement by CME Group that its chief executive of eight years, Craig Donohue, was leaving after 23 years at the Chicago-based business.There was much muttering at the conference that this was at least in part the fallout from the MF Global collapse, which left CME in damage limitation mode as the debacle unfolded. Its shares have fallen sharply from a peak of over $700 before the 2008 crisis.CME was at pains to insist that Donohue’s departure had nothing to do with MF Global. Donohue himself was clear privately to delegates that he had flagged a desire to quit and regain a family life as far back as a year ago. By the end of the conference, that seemed to have worked.Donohue’s successor – like Lukken – is focused more on the plumbing. Phupinder Gill takes over in December and will bring to the job his years of expertise in clearing in Chicago.Yet overshadowing all of this was arguably a much bigger takeaway: something needs to change in the futures business that has evolved in the 30 years since Damgard arrived at the FIA.That message dropped like a bombshell into the conference, not from a disgruntled trader who had lost money thanks to MF Global, but from Asia – specifically Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, on his first visit to the Boca event. It’s worth quoting in full what he said:“We find it amazing that this thing [MF Global] which we thought would not have happened in a western, advanced economy actually could happen here. This is something that we watch[ed] with amazement. Because over the last 3-5 years after the financial crisis, many of us who [were] schooled here in this country in our basic education, particularly in our financial career, we went back there [to Asia] thinking ‘We have a great model of superiority, philosophically and functionally’. And we were essentially preaching the free market and the model that we have here. Not only was it more efficient and innovative, it was also safer and more conservative.“But [there] was a big, big reckoning. Now we go back and we feel a lot of the things that we believed dearly when we stood here, really, the fundamental legitimacy [of the model] is being threatened and challenged. You can no longer go back and say with a straight face that this model works.”HKEx is an awakening giant in the global exchange business, with big ambitions in over-the-counter derivatives and commodities. Western exchanges are eyeing it with keen interest, not least because it is the most valuable exchange business in the world by market capitalisation and has an enviable balance sheet.That probably helped to make Li’s comment sound lecturing. As one senior European exchange executive told me tartly: “Market capitalisation is no measure of capability. It will take them five years to get to the point where they have ‘something’.”But this need not be about rivalry. The US futures industry could more usefully take this on the chin and use it constructively to win back the confidence lost due to MF Global. Lukken made clear his top priority is winning back any confidence that may have been lost.Not untypically, China has already been working on its own methods for customer fund protection, the issue central to the MF Global failure.Gary DeWaal, general counsel at Newedge, the broker, was in China meeting officials to learn more. He thinks the Chinese model could offer valuable lessons for the west.The futures industry should follow up, if it is to prove that – in Damgard’s words – MF Global was only”a black eye rather than permanent damage”.After all it may not be going too far to say that in time, China – a country brought in from the cold by the Nixon administration in which Damgard served – could be the biggest source of business for the futures industry.
440;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-14T15:59:59Z;Interview: Newedge saw MF Global red flags;;Newedge, one of the world’s largest futures brokers, was cutting its ties to MF Global for months before the firm filed for bankruptcy, according to the company’s chief executive, raising questions about whether regulators were diligent enough in preventing the debacle that has followed MF’s collapse.In an interview with the Financial Times, Nicolas Breteau said the risks of the strategy that his counterpart Jon Corzine put in place at MF Global were evident at least seven months before the firm collapsed at the end of October.“We could see their records – a lot of the information was in the public domain,” Mr Breteau said. “Here was a firm with little capital saying they could make much more money in proprietary trading than in broking. We also saw how they invested customer funds.”MF Global’s bankruptcy has deeply shaken the futures industry. The firm collapsed with a $1.6bn shortfall in its customer accounts. More than 30,000 customers are still out of pocket, with more than one-quarter of their funds still to be returned. Mr Breteau said that meant that his firm – the biggest broker in the US in terms of segregated customer funds – was largely unaffected by the collapse of MF Global.“When I realised how they were making their money, through prop trading, this radical change of model from the traditional commission-based strategy, we took the decision to manage our counterparty risk before anything happened,” Mr Breteau said.The shortfall and delayed return of customer funds has prompted anger towards Mr Corzine, the former New Jersey governor and US senator who led MF Global and devised the strategy of transforming it into an investment bank.Mr Breteau said it was clear early on that was a flawed strategy. “It’s very risky to enter into a completely different business model, treading where you don’t have the right bench of technical knowledge.”There has also been criticism of CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange that was MF Global’s main industry regulator, as well as federal agencies, for failing to detect the apparent misuse of customer funds.“I don’t know where to point fingers, but the rules were not properly enforced,” Mr Breteau said. “That raises questions about regulation, whether by exchanges or [by] government regulators.”MF Global opened a “Pandora’s box that created over-reaction and confusion” in the industry, he said.As an example, Mr Breteau cited calls for full fund segregation to be imposed on every customer. “We could achieve a higher level of security with better reporting,” he said.
441;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-14T11:53:31Z;LCH.Clearnet plans swaps margining;;"LCH.Clearnet on Wednesday intensified the battle for market share in clearing of over-the-counter derivatives by offering a way for big dealers to reduce the cost of trading swaps if they have offsetting positions in exchange-traded derivatives.The Anglo-French clearing house is exploring expanding its clearing arrangements with three of the largest post-trade services providers in the US; the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), NYSE Euronext, the exchanges operator, and New York Portfolio Clearing (NYPC), a joint venture between the two companies.The move aims to create a service that would allow investors to cut the cost of trading by cross-margining interest rate futures with fixed-income, cash, repo, futures products. Its proponents envisage that dealers would be able to post margin for all products in a “single pot”. It means that in effect traders hedging their cash positions with futures would be able to save on margin costs. The owner of the single pot can build market share by appealing to traders’ desire for capital efficiency.The development comes only a day after rival CME Group said it would be launching a similar service involving so-called “portfolio margining”, which allows customers to calculate their net exposure to interest rate risk after combining their exposures in swaps and futures.Such margining tools have been in development for some time and may reduce the cost of posting daily collateral adjustments by as much as 85 per cent, CME said.It comes at a time when market participants are looking to tackle a shortage of collateral in financial markets. It also comes as regulations are concerned that clearing houses might be tempted to lower financial thresholds for access to clearing services as a way of attracting business. However, Murray Pozmanter, managing director, clearing services at DTCC said the portfolio margining move was “not about getting into a commercially driven race to the bottom in terms of amounts of collateral”.“We’re really unlocking efficiencies in the marketplace that aren’t available now because each asset class has to be individually margined,” he told the Financial Times.LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear OTC derivatives clearing service is battling CME in the US for share in the OTC interest rate swaps market while NYSE Euronext has long touted its NYPC venture as a long-term challenge to the CME’s stranglehold over the market.The new service is planning to combine NYSE Liffe’s US-traded interest rate futures contracts, which are cleared by NYPC, fixed-income, cash and repo trades cleared by DTCC and interest rate swaps cleared by LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear service into a single portfolio. The agreement would extend those benefits to one of the fastest-growing asset classes, the companies said.The companies have agreed to develop aligned default management policies and payment and settlement mechanisms for products not denominated in US dollars. They have also agreed to develop a joint governance arrangement for a combined risk management system before applying for regulatory approval in the US and Europe."
442;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-13T22:00:47Z;Broker accused of customer segregation failure;;A broker run by the high-profile US commodities trader Mark B. Fisher has been accused of violating a cornerstone protection of the futures market by failing to properly segregate customer funds.The complaint by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission comes four months after the bankruptcy of broker MF Global left an estimated $1.6bn hole in customer accounts. Regulators have been chastised for not preventing the shortfall.In a civil complaint filed in a New York federal court, CFTC said Mr Fisher’s company, MBF Clearing Corp, routinely held between $30m and $90m of customer funds in a money-market account at JPMorgan Chase without identifying it as belonging to customers. The alleged violations spanned between September 2008 and March 2010, the regulator said.Futures traders typically keep cash on hand with their brokers to meet demands for additional collateral if their positions lose money.“The CFTC’s segregated account requirements form a pillar of our regulatory scheme,” said David Meister, the CFTC director of enforcement. “As should be clear from today’s action, we expect strict compliance with these laws and will go after those that fall short of the mark.”MBF said it had placed customer funds into the JPMorgan account two days after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008 to protect customer funds “by depositing them in the safest bank in the world and in the most secure investments, namely US government securities”.As soon as CFTC notified the broker that the account might not qualify as segregated, MBF said it moved all of the customer funds out of this account and reported what had occurred to its designated self-regulatory agency, CME Group. “Not a nickel of customer money was lost,” MBF said.Gregory Mocek, a lawyer representing MBF from Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, said: “It’s obvious this meritless case has been strategically announced to distract the public’s attention away from the CFTC’s handling of the MF Global case.”CFTC said MBF acknowledged to CME Group auditors in 2009 that it lacked a letter showing customer funds were segregated. The regulator said that MBF did not obtain such a letter until June 2010.CME Group was also the frontline regulator of MF Global before its collapse.Mr Fisher is “an influential member of the futures industry at large, a globally-respected professional trader, a guest speaker at industry conferences and the best-selling author of The Logical Trader: Applying A Method to The Madness,” according to the MBF website.As CME Group negotiated with seat holders to buy the New York Mercantile Exchange in late 2008, Mr Fisher helped broker a deal. “Mark has worked hard to protect member interests and has achieved a vastly improved transaction,” two Nymex seat holders wrote in a letter to fellow seat holders.MBF, founded in 1987, this year ceased to be a clearing futures broker, and now clears trades through another broker, according to the website.
443;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-13T21:13:08Z;Financials drive S&P 500 rally;;Financial stocks surged on Tuesday to carry the S&P 500 to its highest post-crisis close on a day that saw all three major US indices move into levels not reached in years.Shares in JPMorgan jumped 7 per cent to $43.39 after it announced late in the trading day that it would raise its dividend by 20 per cent to 30 cents and undertake a $15bn buyback programme that is seen as being the first in a series for the financial sector.The major banks lifted the S&P 500 up 1.8 per cent to 1,395.96, its highest close since May 2008. The benchmark US index has now risen 11 per cent in the year to date. The financial sector – led by JPMorgan, which reached its highest mark since May – climbed 3.9 per cent on the day, clearly outpacing other groups, and is up more than 18 per cent for the year.Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs recorded gains of larger than six per cent each on the day. Shares in those major banks also reached multi-month highs, but Citigroup dropped 4 per cent after hours as it was revealed that the bank required more capital following the stress tests.Wells Fargo said it planned to increase its January declared dividend an additional 10 cents to 22 cents. Shares of the bank, which gained 5.7 per cent during the trading day, were up 0.5 per cent after hours.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7 per cent to 13,180.40, its highest point since December 2007.The blue-chip heavy index was led by earthmover Caterpillar, which rose 4 per cent at $113.30. The construction equipment provider has climbed more than 25 per cent since the new year. Miner Freeport-McMoRan was up 2.2 per cent to $39.09. Dow Chemical and DuPont each added about 3 per cent to $34.60 and $52.68.The Nasdaq Composite Index also broke into unfamiliar territory and closed above the 3,000 point threshold for the first time since December 2000. The Nasdaq was up 1.9 per cent to 3,039.88.The most heavily weighted stock on the index, Apple, continued to guide the Nasdaq’s rise, once again hitting an all-time high. The maker of the popular iPad and iPhone products added 2.9 per cent to $568.10.The announcement by JPMorgan added to other positive market indicators that came throughout the day on Tuesday. Retail data released in the morning showed sales rose to their highest in five months.Economists, however, sought to temper the significance of the retail report.Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, warned: “After a weak December, retail sales picked up considerably in January and February …However, retail sales data, like many other time series, seem to have received a boost from much better than normal weather in many areas of the country combined with overly generous seasonal adjustment factors, which is a very potent combination.”Later in the day, the Federal Open Market Committee said it would leave interest rates unchanged.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained 2.3 per cent to 428.20. Gains were led by chip makers including Micron Technology, which increased 5.1 per cent to $8.49. Advanced Micro Devices climbed 3.5 per cent to $7.76.CME, the US’s largest futures exchange, edged up 1 per cent to $272.99 after Monday’s news that its chief executive, Craig Donohue, is to step down at the end of the year. The exchange has struggled to restore confidence in its markets since the collapse of MF Global. Despite gains in recent months, shares are still trading down more than 8.5 per cent in the past year.Brad Hintz, analyst at Bernstein, said: “At the current stock price we believe CME shares offer exceptional value for a firm that can generate high single to low-double-digit growth rates long term, has stable pretax margins exceeding 60 per cent, boasts a defensible business model and has a number of real options related to mandated over-the-counter clearing.”Cyclical material stocks, such as US Steel, which was up 7.3 per cent to $28.31, also made strong gains.Retailing group Urban Outfitters was among the day’s worst performers, down 5.3 per cent to $27.95. The company reported a 48 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profits after it was forced to offer heavy markdowns to clear year-end inventories.Brian Tunick, retail analyst at JPMorgan, said: “Going forward, we continue to believe that with inventory under control and new management focused on improving product offerings, Urban Outfitters represents an attractive opportunity. We maintain a “buy” rating as we believe that the Street will remain excited over the potential improvements brought about by the “reassembled band”, setting up impressive [2012 fiscal year] opportunities.”Shares in China’s largest online video provider, Youku, fell 1.5 per cent to $31.40 after it climbed over 27 per cent on Monday as announced plans to merge with smaller rival Tudou.
444;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:34:32+0000;CME launches portfolio margining for swaps trades;;CME Group has raised the stakes in the battle to control over-the-counter derivatives clearing, rolling out a way for big dealers to reduce the cost of trading swaps if they have offsetting positions in listed derivatives.The launch is one of the most significant developments in the over-the-counter derivatives markets since G20 reforms, such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US, mandated the clearing of OTC derivatives as part of the clean-up of the financial system after the 2008 crisis.So-called “portfolio margining”, which allows customers to calculate their net exposure to interest rate risk after combining their exposures in swaps and futures, promises to reduce the expected scramble for quality collateral that is already in short supply.Such margining tools have been in development for some time and may reduce the cost of posting daily collateral adjustments by as much as 85 per cent, CME said.The move is also a challenge to CME’s competitors in interest-rate swap clearing. CME, in addition to its role as a swaps clearing house, also runs the US’s largest futures exchange. LCH.Clearnet‘s SwapClear US also clears customer-to-dealer swap trades, and has a futures clearinghouse. But it does not have an adjacent US futures exchange.“Capital efficiency is very important for dealers and end user clients,” said Laurent Paulhac, CME Group managing director of OTC products & services. “There is a good opportunity for market participants to offset their eurodollar futures with swaps.” He also noted it was a “key differentiator between ourselves and competitors”.CME and SwapClear have also been announcing additional ways to post collateral, such as allowing the use of very high-grade corporate bonds and assets denominated in other currencies as collateral.At present, CME’s offering is not yet available to customers of the banks because regulators have not yet approved it for non-”house” accounts, that is for customers who are not clearing members. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has yet to approve portfolio margining for customers.The IntercontinentalExchange also offers portfolio margining for clearing of single-name and index-based credit default swap trades in ICE Credit Clear for house accounts, but not yet with their customers. The Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve portfolio margining for CDS contracts on individual companies. Those are regulated as securities.Separately, Newedge, the largest futures broker, or “futures commission merchant”, by trading volume handled, unveiled plans to develop its clearing facilities for interest rate swaps. FCMs are mandates by Dodd-Frank to act as brokers between OTC users and clearing houses.Newedge said it would be the first independent FCM – that is, as distinct from an FCM owned by a bank – to offer services such as clearing of OTC interest rate swaps including reduced counterparty risk, default protection and “capital efficiencies from cross-margining opportunities”.Volumes in customer clearing of interest-rate swap trades are steadily rising, but still represent just a roughly $900bn sliver, split evenly between CME and SwapClear US, of the $440tn notional rate swaps market.
445;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-13T02:11:10Z;MF Global collapse shadows futures meeting;;Before CME Group surprised many in the futures industry by announcing that Craig Donohue would be retiring as its chief executive, the Futures Industry Association’s annual conference this week in Boca Raton, Florida, was set to be a somewhat introspective affair.The jamboree, which begins on Tuesday, is the sector’s first big get-together since the collapse of MF Global. With some $1.6bn still missing from customer accounts formerly held at the broker-dealer, the bankruptcy has cast a long shadow over the financial markets. The main focus of many of the conference’s sessions is MF Global or how better to protect customer funds.But news of Mr Donohue’s departure at the end of the year, when his current contract ends, will transform the event into an even-more gossipy get-together than usual.The outgoing chief executive of CME, the US’s biggest futures exchange group, denied that he was leaving because of MF Global. “These are just two things that coincide but they’re not related to each other,” Mr Donohue said in a conference call with analysts following Monday’s announcement.Mr Donohue is not the only industry veteran to be bidding the industry farewell at Boca. John Damgard, the FIA’s longtime president, is retiring to be replaced by Walt Lukken, former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Even as he leaves, Mr Damgard remains concerned that the industry’s reputation has been tarnished. “The idea that customer funds were violated is a black eye that’s going to take us a while to live down,” he says.The departures of Mr Donohue and Mr Damgard underline the sense that the futures markets need a new sense of direction and purpose. “MF Global is the biggest thing to hit this industry in years,” says John Lothian, a Chicago futures veteran who runs a popular industry newsletter. “We’re going to have to grow the industry again and be aggressive and dynamic.”That comes from a deep sense of frustration among traders in the wake of MF Global’s collapse. “The main emotion in the industry is anger,” says Chris Hehmeyer, chairman of the National Futures Association, an industry regulator.Some of that anger has been directed at CME. As the industry body responsible for regulating MF Global, it has chiefly been accused of not doing its job properly, a charge it strongly denies.But the MF Global effect goes far beyond CME. Trading volumes have been down across the financial industry as trust has been shaken and more than 30,000 customers still wait to find out how much of their funds they can recover.Those customers who have remained in the market have also changed their behaviour. For example, the MF Global saga has prompted many trading customers to be cautious about using a single clearing member for their trading, says Steffen Gemuenden, chief executive of RTS Realtime Systems, a trading software company. “It’s accelerated awareness of the risks, and more customers want to spread their risks using technology,” he says.The most immediate task for the industry is to draw up proposals to protect customers better and enhance regulation. A committee of self-regulatory organisations in the futures industry this week proposed increased reporting requirements for futures brokers and more spot checks.One hot-button topic at Boca is sure to be whether to use in the futures industry a model introduced in the new architecture of the cleared swaps markets that emerged from the Dodd-Frank act, which overhauled financial regulation in the wake of the crisis.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Washington futures watchdog, is considering pushing the futures industry to use the “legally separated but operationally commingled” model, or LSOC, which prevents a clearing house from using money from other customers to meet a defaulting member’s clearing obligations.Its proponents argue that it would protect customer funds better in the case of a default. Futures exchanges say their market is structurally distinct from the swaps industry and that the system is not necessarily appropriate.The debate over LSOC is one issue that indicates how the conversation has rapidly focused on the details of how to restore trust in the markets.That is a healthy way of channelling some of the sound and the fury MF Global unleashed. “Everyone is madder than hell at Jon Corzine,” says Mr Damgard of the former MF chief executive. “Corzine wasn’t invited to be the keynote speaker, but if he had, he would have come there at his own risk.”
446;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;Donohue to step down as CME chief;;Craig Donohue is to step down as chief executive of CME Group as the US’s biggest futures exchange operator attempts to restore confidence in its markets following the collapse of MF Global.Mr Donohue, who began working at CME as an in-house lawyer in 1989 and rose to become chief executive in 2004, will leave his job at the end of the year when his contract expires, the company said on Monday.Phupinder Gill, CME president since 2004, will take over as chief executive, but much of Mr Donohue’s public role will be assumed by Terry Duffy, the company’s executive chairman, who will also take on the role of president. CME said Mr Gill, who will report to Mr Duffy, 53, would focus on internal management.Although there had been rumours of Mr Donohue’s departure, the timing of the announcement still surprised many in the industry. Mr Donohue, 50, oversaw the acquisitions of the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 and the New York Mercantile Exchange in 2008.“It’s a surprise because there’s been remarkable continuity at the top of this organisation,” said John Lothian, a Chicago futures veteran who owns a popular industry newsletter.However, CME has come under fierce criticism for its handling of the collapse of MF Global, the broker-dealer, in October.Some $1.6bn is still missing from customer accounts formerly held at MF Global, leaving holes in the pockets of more than 30,000 traders, ranging in size from corporate giants such as Coca-Cola and ConocoPhilips to family farmers and ranchers.Mr Donohue said his departure would be “bittersweet”. He added he had been contemplating stepping down “for quite some time” but the need to make a decision had become more acute as the end of his contract loomed.He denied the suggestion that MF Global had played a part in his decision, saying “it does not factor in at all to my thinking”. “These are just two things that coincide, but they’re not related to each other,” he said. “I can’t control the timing of that.”CME was MF’s industry regulator. The company said it was misled by the firm and was only informed about the shortfall in customer funds after the company filed for bankruptcy.The failure to protect customer money has shaken trust in the markets and has helped push down trading volumes in the months since MF Global’s collapse.CME has also been attacked as having had an incoherent response to the bankruptcy. Initially, it stressed that it was in no way legally responsible for lost funds. It later offered $550m to help the trustee release money to customers and subsequently set up a $100m fund for family farmers to protect them in similar cases in the future.CME had been under pressure from shareholders before the MF Global saga, as it struggled with a low-interest rate policy in the US that hurt Treasury futures volumes. Under Mr Donohue, CME’s share price soared to more than $700 before falling rapidly during the financial crisis.
447;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Cinnober names Tordable to be chief executive;;Cinnober Financial Technology, a Swedish trading technology company, has outlined plans to go public and triple revenues in coming years after naming Javier Tordable as its new chief.The Stockholm-based group appointed Mr Tordable, the former head of Plataforma Alternativa de Valores Españoles (Pave), as its new chief executive as it looks to build a listed business with annual turnover of SKr800m-SKr1bn.The ambitious plans underline the company’s sense that momentum is building behind it after signing a deal late last year with BM&FBovespa, the Brazilian exchange. Cinnober described the deal, one of the largest in its history, as a “ major breakthrough deal” for its real-time clearing business. It is also upgrading the platform used by the Stock Exchange of Thailand and implemented a similar upgrade for the London Metal Exchange. It employs 180 people.Nils-Robert Persson, executive chairman of Cinnober, told FT Trading Room he is hoping the momentum from the company’s contract wins will propel it into a company more than three times its current size. “If the market recovers, it’s not impossible,” he said.In the year to June 30, Cinnober reported flat turnover of SKr223.3m ($32.8m), while profits fell from SKr25.1m to SKr15.1m. For the interim period to December 31, sales fell from SKr124.7m to SKr114m, while pre-tax profit fell from SKr15.6m to SKr12.1m.Cinnober, which has a 5.8 per cent stake in UK rival Ffastfill, plans to list on a stock market within three years but hadn’t made a decision on whether it would be in Stockholm. “We want to offer our shareholders a plan to grow the business or exit their investment. We have no financial advisers at the moment. We’re not in a hurry but we will do it right,” he said.Mr Persson is the largest shareholder in Cinnober, with a 19.6 per cent stake, but Nortal Investments, a Swedish group, holds a 14.6 per cent stake and former chief executive Gunnar Lindell has a 13 per cent shareholding. Original founders Gunnar Mjöberg and Peter Lenti also hold small stakes.Mr Tordable joins Cinnober from Pave, which gave up its attempt to challenge the Bolsas y Mercados Españoles’s near-monopoly of the Spanish market last month after it failed to win sufficient backing for the project. He will move to Stockholm.He has previously been an adviser to Deutsche Börse and Eurex and worked for the Chicago Board of Trade, now part of the CME Group. He also helped to establish SENDECO2, the Spanish emissions trading platform, and MTS Spain, the Spanish government debt trading platform.“I’m attracted by the aggressive targets Cinnober has for the future, in terms of technology and market presence as well as in financial terms,” he said.Per-Anders Häll-Bedman, who has been acting chief executive of Cinnober for the last four months, will return to his position of deputy chief executive.
448;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-11T21:44:02Z;SEC probes operators’ use of multiple markets;;The US market regulator has launched a broad investigation into whether exchanges favour large trading companies at the expense of smaller customers.The enforcement inquiries emerged from examinations by the Securities and Exchange Commission of how exchange operators, some of which also regulate their customers, manage conflicts of interest with hedge funds, high-frequency trading groups, banks and asset managers. The regulatory concerns were heightened by the collapse of futures broker MF Global and its missing customer funds, which put a spotlight on the role of exchange operator CME Group.According to people familiar with the probe, SEC officials are focusing on whether operators use multiple exchanges to appease customers which provide large order flows. This would allow them to grant advantages to some customers by using different rules on different exchanges, without violating rules barring discrimination on any one exchange.All major US exchanges operate multiple markets. They are often the legacy of acquisitions and use different pricing schemes or trading systems.The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) suspended one of its top compliance officers last month, according to people familiar with the matter, as the SEC’s probe homed in on regulatory practices at the company’s New Jersey-based stock exchange, CBSX.CBSX is owned by CBOE in partnership with four market making groups. Last year, CBSX acquired the National Stock Exchange, giving it two separate exchanges.CBOE revealed an SEC probe last month, saying that the agency was “investigating CBOE’s compliance with its obligations as a self-regulatory organisation under federal securities laws”. It said that it was co-operating and had launched its own internal probe. CBOE declined to comment on the suspension of the compliance officer or the specific nature of the SEC’s probe. The SEC also declined to comment.In an SEC filing last month, BATS Global Markets said it had received investigative requests from the agency related to its communications with customers, including trading firms and banks that are also its shareholders. BATS operates two US stock markets.
449;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-11T21:23:54Z;Hong Kong to bolster its clearing house;;"Hong Kong’s exchange on Sunday unveiled measures to strengthen its clearing house in the first sign that some of the world’s largest clearing houses believe they need to ensure they are financially robust enough to withstand new demands placed on them by a wave of post-2008 crisis regulations.Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEx) said that after months of consultation with market participants it would boost its “stress testing” systems, tighten up on margining and introduce a “dynamic guarantee fund” as a more sound backstop against the potential for catastrophic defaults.HKEx is the world’s largest exchange group by market capitalisation of the company as a listed entity, ahead of CME Group of the US and Deutsche Börse. It admitted last year that risk management and financial resources at its clearing house were not up to international standards and that reforms were necessary to ensure the competitiveness of the Hong Kong markets.Charles Li, HKEx chief executive, said on Sunday: “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the market for understanding the urgency and necessity of this reform, even though it may bring additional financial obligations to some market participants. The reform is a major milestone in enhancing the long term stability and competitiveness of the Hong Kong financial market.”Clearing houses already largely adhere to recommendations made in 2004 by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems – under the Bank for International Settlements – and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions – the umbrella body for national markets watchdogs.But the crisis sparked a review of those standards. The two bodies in 2010 began a consultation on strengthening clearing house standards in light of lessons learnt in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which highlighted the potential vulnerability of clearing houses, or central counterparties (CCPs), to a default that could devastate the financial system.That consultation, whose results are due soon, means CCPs are likely to have to boost the financial safeguards they use to manage the default of one or more of their members. They will be required to guard against the collapse of the CCP itself, especially as a result of G20 regulations that will push swaths of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives through CCPs. Such measures are contained in the Dodd-Frank Act in the US, and in equivalent legislation in the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, being finalised in Brussels.The shifting of large amounts of such OTC financial transactions to CCPs has led to concerns among regulators that such financial institutions should bolster risk management standards and ensure they are able to handle the default not only of one member but more, thus strengthening their so-called “default assumptions”.HKEx said it had received overwhelming agreement from respondents on a proposal to remove a long-held default assumption based on the use of 30 per cent of lossmaking positions by a trading counterparty, and replacing that with an assumption based on the default of the single largest counterparty plus that of the fifth largest.HKEx acknowledged that there was “a global trend for more stringent risk management procedures” and said it wanted to “be in line with best practices and, where appropriate, exceed the minimum international standards”.It also said it would introduce a new way of calculating margin, based on volatility; HKEx will also make it easier for its members to use cash as collateral in transactions handled on behalf of their clients. “We believe that specific cash collateral and specific stock collateral will effectively reduce margin requirement of eligible Cps [counterparties].”“Implementation of the key proposals, including changing stress-testing assumptions for all three clearing houses and the introduction of margining and the dynamic guarantee fund are scheduled for the third quarter of 2012, subject to system readiness. Detailed implementation and communication plans will be announced in due course,” HKEx said.HKEx is one of the very few clearing house operators to have suffered a near-collapse. The territory’s clearing house had to be bailed out by the local monetary authority and market participants in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, when it became clear that it would not have the resources to deal with possible mass defaults by traders on the futures exchange.But HKEx’s efforts to strengthen its CCP, years later, come as the group has ambitions to launch OTC derivatives clearing as a strategic priority.Mr Li is likely to face questions on HKEx’s clearing reforms this week when he becomes the first HKEx chief executive to attend the annual Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton, Florida."
450;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-09T19:02:55Z;Interview: Rolet plans LSE’s next move;London exchange keen to promote open access model;Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, has barely finished negotiating a deal to acquire a majority stake in LCH.Clearnet when he reveals that he is already in talks with other unnamed entities about bringing them in as customers and possibly shareholders.It is all designed to emphasise that the LCH.Clearnet move is not – as some analysts have seen it – the creation of a “vertical silo” along the lines of Deutsche Börse and CME Group. Friday’s announcement of a deal to buy a majority stake in the London clearing house was littered with references to a so-called “horizontal” business.“Horizontal is about two things: structure and governance,” he says in an interview.” First of all you share the ownership and the overall strategy and direction-setting with the clients so they have stake in that process.“Second, you have open access. Meaning that any other exchange or MTF [multilateral trading facility] or legitimately regulated platform that brings [trading] flow can use LCH and participate in the governance that we set up.”“Our door is open, frankly, to others and there are those with whom we are already talking. There’s the potential to retain them, there are already ongoing potentialities there,” Mr Rolet added, declining to name any of the parties.Judging from the rough ride that Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext had at the hands of European Commission antitrust regulators when they tried to merge, there is heightened sensitivity among European watchdogs over the creation of market structures that appear to restrict, rather than promote competition.Reforms such as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) specifically take aim at so-called “silos”, where an exchange owns both the venue a product is traded on and its clearing house. Emir will require derivatives traded off-exchange to be processed through clearing houses to protect the financial system against the potentially catastrophic effects of a big default.But Mr Rolet says the LSE-LCH.Clearnet structure is pro-competition, arguing that his deal does not look like a silo. “If it doesn’t look like a silo it doesn’t quack like one either,” he says.Asked what stance regulators are likely to take on the LSE-LCH deal, he says: “No-one can prejudge but we’ve had preliminary conversations as well as plenty of advice. What differentiates our structure is that it is actually pro-competition, not [a venue] where you can only trade if you clear, or vice versa. We think that substantially differentiates it from other more common structures but ultimately the process will have to run through.”So far 18 LCH shareholders – including the London Metal Exchange – have voted in favour of the deal, but NYSE Euronext – an LSE rival – is conspicuously absent. It has served notice that it intends to withdraw from using LCH’s clearing services fully by 2013.Mr Rolet says: “As it stands now they are gone middle to end of 2013. What they ultimately do, time will tell.” He says NYSE cannot block the transaction.Addressing future growth, Mr Rolet says SwapClear has “great potential for future expansion” in the US and Asia.“Anyone who uses the company has access to a global multi-asset class pool of collateral, there’s everything in there. That’s attractive to people who want to launch, like us, other competing products or new products. It’s a reservoir of intellectual property.”
451;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-09T15:39:43Z;Quick View: Big Bang Part II for LSE;;"The London Stock Exchange has long been mocked by rivals as a mere bit player in the global exchange game.It was slow, out of touch with the regulatory changes sweeping through the industry and bogged down in the parochial business of UK share trading and market data.As of today, those rivals need to change their story.If the LSE can garner enough shares tendered by shareholders in LCH.Clearnet – as seems possible – it will have pulled off one of the biggest coups in the exchange world with the purchase of a controlling stake in the London-based clearing house. It is hard to over-state how significant this deal is. It is as big a change for the LSE as “Big Bang” in 1986, which closed its trading floor and ushered in electronic trading.It is the biggest coup in the three-year tenure of LSE chief executive Xaviet Rolet, the former Goldman Sachs banker who took over from Clara Furse in 2009. Just nine months ago his plan to turn around the LSE looked like it was coming unstuck after the failure of the UK group’s tie-up with TMX Group of Canada.But slowly he’s also been assembling a box of essential exchange components: a new technology system (MilleniumIT); a listed derivatives business (Turquoise); a retail bond platform (Order Book for Retail Bonds); an index business (FTSE International); and now a central counterparty (CCP): LCH. Clearnet.Many of these are small. Turquoise is still loss-making and has barely made a dent in the overall share of European futures business. But these are all business that the LSE had to build, or acquire, if it was to survive and grow.Alternatively, if you prefer, it’s adding to the value of the LSE as a potential takeover target.Pulling off an LCH deal would be especially gratifying for Rolet since two other attempts – by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and an Icap-led consortium – have failed in recent years.Now, the LSE, long dependent on an eroding market share in cash equities trading and market data, has a full suite of services.Rolet can justifiably claim that he is building a diversified, multi-asset business that – on paper – is equipped to profit from sweeping G20 regulations like Dodd-Frank and the “Emir” and “Mifid” reforms in Europe.SwapClear, the over-the-counter derivatives (OTC) clearing service run by OTC dealer banks in conjunction with LCH. Clearet, its crown jewel. It is already a leader is OTC interest rate swaps, battling CME Group in the US and soon Eurex Clearing in Europe, for global share.The LSE says it expects SwapClear’s businesses – which will soon add FX with ForexClear and credit default swaps with CDSClear – to “become an increasingly significant part” of LCH.Clearnet’s business.Rolet can also expand geographically. Worth noting that the LCH.Clearnet and FTSE deals give him an entry into North America. And in a curious twist you would have London competing with Chicago in OTC derivatives clearing (note to Brussels: that’s called “the global derivatives market”).But questions remain. First, is the LSE overpaying? There was some nervousness about how much the LSE paid for FTSE.The rise in the LSE’s share price suggests investors are pleased that earlier price tags cited of around €1bn – including by me – was too high. Sticker shock relief may be one reason for the shares being up 8.9 per cent on Friday at 978p – a seven-month high.The LSE has agreed to pay a maximum of €463m for a stake of between 50 per cent plus one share and 60 per cent. That gives LCH.Clearnet an implied valuation of €813m, made up of €772m plus a special dividend of €41m payable by LCH.Clearnet in five years.Danny Garrod, analyst at Barclays Capital, says that the enterprise value of the deal – that is, adding in net debt at LCH.Clearnet – implies an ebitda of 6.8 times, with a price/earnings multiple of 11.5 times LCH’s 2011 earnings.The bankers valuing this complicated business – Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Société Générale – will have had to balance the risks of customers leaving LCH.Clearnet (notably NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange) with the upside from OTC clearing driven by regulations.“We believe these multiples reflect that risk,” Garrod says.Second, regulatory approval. As much as the LSE and LCH.Clearnet are insisting that the clearing house would still operate on a “horizontal” basis, we have little detail on exactly what that means.If NYSE Euronext and the LME withdraw their business (NYSE is already halfway there as it builds its own London clearer, NYSE Liffe Clear) then that leaves LCH.Clearnet with no big exchange customers – except the LSE itself.A top European parliamentarian, Sharon Bowles, is confident that this deal won’t encounter problems, saying: “my understanding is that this will run on an open basis which will answer many of the problems encountered by others”. But we need more detail from the LSE.But at the end of the day, this is a move that Rolet had to make. If he’d failed, it would have been seen as his “Clara Furse” moment – when his predecessor let Liffe slip from the LSE’s grasp. The LSE simply cannot let LCH.Clearnet go the same way."
452;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-09T09:33:42Z;LSE set to take control of LCH.Clearnet;;The London Stock Exchange on Friday unveiled a deal worth up to €463m to take a majority stake in LCH.Clearnet in a move that could catapault it into the front ranks of global exchanges and caps a three-year turnaround of the British bourse by its French chief executive, Xavier Rolet.The LSE has agreed to pay €19 in cash per share for up to 60 per cent of the privately held clearing house, which stands between two parties to a trade, ensuring a deal goes ahead if one side defaults.LCH.Clearnet shareholders will also be entitled to a special dividend of €1 a share after five years, giving a headline value for the deal of €20 per share. Such a figure implies a valuation of €813m for the whole of the group.Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, said the deal was a “landmark” transaction for the LSE and shares in the group rose 7 per cent to 958½p in early morning trading in London on Friday.LCH.Clearnet is 83 per cent-owned by banks and brokers, with the rest of the business split between NYSE Euronext, the US stock exchange operator, and the London Metal Exchange, which is in talks over a sale to its members.Securing LCH.Clearnet would give the LSE its own clearing house in the UK at a time when the exchange business is dominated by groups that already own their clearing and at a time of regulatory upheaval.Regulators are pushing greater use of clearing on the over-the-counter derivatives markets as a way of safeguarding the financial system against large defaults, in turn creating new business opportunities for exchanges, especially those with their own clearing houses.Ownership of a clearing house allows an exchange to collect clearing fees that would otherwise go to an external provider, and helps exchanges launch new products faster. The LSE currently outsources clearing of UK share trading to LCH.Clearnet.Daniel Garrod, analyst at Barclays Capital, said: “We believe there is strong strategic logic in LSE acquiring a majority stake in LCH … the clearer is well placed to be a key beneficiary of OTC derivatives reform.”Mr Rolet said the LSE’s aim was to emerge with a stake of 51 per cent but added that it might temporarily rise to 60 per cent depending on demand for its offer.The move would create an integrated exchange and clearing house at a time when European regulators are pushing for clearing houses – especially those owned and operated by exchanges – to open up their services to other trading venues.Other exchange groups – such as Deutsche Börse and CME Group, the US exchange, operate “vertical silos” where clearing is only made available for the exchange’s own products. That is seen by some regulators as anti-competitive and the European Commission is pushing for liberalisation of such structures in upcoming legislation.The LSE and LCH.Clearnet said that while the LSE would ultimately control the clearer, they would maintain LCH.Clearnet’s “horizontal” model of offering its service to any trading venue.Ian Axe, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, said: “The kind of structure we’re looking at will be complementary to regulators’ wishes. We’re bringing banks, brokers and trading venues together.”Asked by the Financial Times how this would work in practice, Mr Axe said: “It comes down to an ability to create a product governance model where other trading venues have an equal voice.”The LSE would operate LCH.Clearnet in a way similar to how it already operates its derivatives trading platform Turquoise, in which key trading banks are minority shareholders and co-operators.Completion of the deal is expected by the fourth quarter of 2012, the two companies said.Mr Axe will remain in his job after the deal concludes, as will Jacques Aigrain, its non-executive chairman.The LSE said it would finance the deal from its cash resources and a €420m revolving credit facility agreed in December with Lloyds TSB Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Morgan Stanley and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. It has also agreed to subscribe up to a maximum of €24m of additional capital if required by LCH.Clearnet in order to meet the regulatory capital requirements.LCH.Clearnet and the LSE had confirmed in September that they were in exclusive talks about a deal.The LSE was advised by Morgan Stanley, Citi and Société Générale, while LCH.Clearnet was advised by JP Morgan.
453;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;CME in trading system talks with Tocom;;CME Group, operator of the largest US futures exchange, is in talks with the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (Tocom) about the Japanese bourse using the CME’s Globex trading system.The move is the latest sign that the US exchange operator is expanding globally by forging product and technology alliances, rather than pursuing merger and acquisitions that have proved largely unsuccessful for rivals.It also comes as Japan is seeing the first signs of domestic exchange consolidation, with talks continuing between the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Osaka Securities Exchange about a deal to combine the two.Tocom, responding to a report in Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, that it had asked CME for capital as part of a business tie-up, said it “affirms that no such decision has been made”.Tocom later told Reuters that the exchange had been watching global and domestic exchange consolidation and that it “cannot completely deny that such a thing could happen to our exchange in the future if it would be beneficial to us and the commodities industry as a whole”.CME declined to comment.Tocom’s largest product is gold futures, which were launched 30 years ago on what was then the Tokyo Gold Exchange. Two years later that exchange merged with the Tokyo Textile Exchange and the Tokyo Rubber Exchange, forming Tocom.Tocom already has a relationship with Nymex, the US energy exchange, dating from before Nymex was acquired by CME in 2008. TTotal commodities trading volumes on Tocom are still below their peak of 87.3m in 2003, at 31.7m for 2011.In the year to March 2011, Tocom’s revenues from membership fees and exchange fees came to Y2.9bn, not much better than the trough of Y2.5bn in the year to March 2009. Last year, it made an operating loss of Y1.2bn, its fourth consecutive annual deficit.However, the exchange plans an initial public offering this year and is introducing a new trading system.Any potential closer relationship with Tocom comes eight months after CME struck a “strategic arrangement” with the Osaka Securities Exchange, under which Osaka has listed a yen-denominated version of the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures contract, one of CME’s main derivatives products.CME offers trading in an “e-micro” – or small – futures contract based on the Nikkei 225 index – Osaka’s flagship derivatives contract, a version of which is also offered on SGX, the Singapore exchange.This week, CME and Brazil’s BM&FBovespa exchange, in which the US operator has a 5 per cent stake, agreed to extend an existing cross-listing and cross-licensing agreement to S&P 500 Index and Bovespa Index futures.BM&F will also license CME’s Chicago Board of Trade “mini-sized” soyabean and Nymex light sweet crude oil WTI futures settlement prices.The agreement also allows the companies to license additional products later.
454;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-03-06T23:39:25Z;CME strengthens ties with Brazil platform;;CME Group, the US’s biggest futures-trading venue, has deepened its five-year relationship with BM&FBovespa, Latin America’s largest financial exchange, by finalising a deal to cross-list and cross-license futures contracts on stock indices, agricultural products and energy.The arrangement, announced on Tuesday, was not a surprise, as both exchanges had said they were working on a cross-listing agreement. Marcelo Maziero, BM&FBovespa’s chief products and customer officer, said last month that a deal was imminent. “It’s a matter of the contract between us and CME …It’s just a matter of paper,” he said on the exchange’s earnings call.Mr Maziero said on Tuesday that the deal “will provide much easier local access to international flagship products with little or no extra technology investment, catering for better risk management with reduced costs”.Cross listing will make it easier and cheaper for traders in both regions to access each other’s futures markets, as well create new arbitrage opportunities for traders to exploit any differences in pricing between similar products listed at the two venues.The two exchanges have been close collaborators since 2007, when the Chicago-based exchange operator struck a $700m cross-equity swap deal with BM&F, the derivatives market that merged the following year with the Bovespa stock exchange.Under the terms of that agreement, CME took a 10 per cent stake in BM&F in return for giving its Brazilian counterpart a 2 per cent stake in the US company. That was increased to 5 per cent in 2010.The two exchange groups have also collaborated in the development of Puma, a multi-asset, high-speed trading platform, on which Brazilian derivatives began trading last year and which will shortly also host equities and fixed-income products.The original tie-up contained an order-routing agreement that enabled CME’s customers access to BM&FBovespa’s products through CME’s Globex electronic trading system.Tuesday’s agreement, struck in collaboration with S&P Indices, takes that arrangement one step further, enabling the Brazilian exchange to list S&P 500 futures and to license futures on soyabeans and on WTI crude oil, while CME will list IBovespa futures, based on Brazil’s main stock index.BM&FBovespa plans to list CME’s mini-sized soyabean futures in the second quarter and WTI futures in the third quarter. Both exchanges will launch each other’s equity index futures in the second half of the year.The IBovespa futures that will be listed and cleared at CME will be dollar-denominated, while the US futures contracts at BM&FBovespa will be dollar-denominated but settled in Brazilian real.The companies said they could extend the agreement to license more products. “As our relationship expands, we will continue to explore joint technology and product opportunities with BM&FBovespa,” said Bryan Durkin, CME chief operating officer.
455;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:23:53+0000;CME was subpoenaed in probe of MF Global;;CME Group was subpoenaed by a grand jury in Chicago and regulators in Washington as part of the federal probe into potential wrongdoing in the collapse of MF Global, the broker-dealer once run by Jon Corzine.The global exchange operator said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it received the subpoenas in November, a few days after MF Global filed for bankruptcy and revealed that money was missing from its customer accounts.The estimated amount of the shortfall in customer funds has steadily grown from $600m to $1.6bn, the latest figure given this month by the bankruptcy trustee. Some $900m relates to the brokerage’s US accounts and $700m to UK accounts.The shortfall has meant that more than 30,000 former customers have been left out of pocket as a result of MF Global’s collapse.In spite of several pay-outs from the trustee, more than one-quarter of their funds remain frozen.That has hit traders’ confidence in the futures industry, which has often touted its record of protecting customer funds in spite of broker defaults. Trading volumes have fallen at CME, the US’s main futures exchange, as a result.The exchange group has been accused by many customers of not offering adequate oversight of MF Global, for which it served as the industry’s self-regulatory body.CME says it was misled as to the amount of money MF Global had in its customer accounts and was only made aware of the shortfall when the broker filed for bankruptcy.CME is the target of at least four lawsuits from former customers seeking damages for losses they incurred when MF Global collapsed.The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Washington futures industry regulator, launched investigations into what happened at MF Global soon after the company filed for bankruptcy on October 31.CME said in its regulatory filing that the subpoenas were issued by a grand jury in the Northern District of Illinois and the CFTC.The company said it had been asked “to produce information and witnesses in connection with the authorities’ investigation of the matter” but gave no further details.A grand jury determines whether there are grounds for bringing a federal case. It will add to speculation in the industry that criminal charges will be brought against certain former MF Global staff.“Grand juries aren’t convened unless there is a very strong feeling, as in this case, that there has been some criminality,” said Barry Slotnick of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, a law firm in New York.However, the existence of a grand jury does not suggest that federal prosecutors will definitely press charges over the collapse of MF Global.
456;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:46:42+0000;Bursa Malaysia in derivatives clearing launch;;Bursa Malaysia has become the latest exchange to overhaul its post-trade infrastructure with the introduction on Tuesday of new clearing and settlement system for derivatives.The move is a sign that exchanges in Asia are trying to make their systems more resilient as volume in derivatives and equities trading has been growing faster than in the more mature markets of Europe and the US.Bursa Malaysia said the new system, developed in conjunction with KRX, the Korean exchange, and CME Group, the US exchange operator, would “pave the way for the introduction of new derivative futures and options products”.CME Group has a 25 per cent shareholding in Bursa Malaysia.Dato’ Tajuddin Atan, Bursa’s chief executive, said: “Exchanges around the world are facing intense competition. In order for us to compete, we must actively pursue ways to reduce friction in the marketplace and create a more efficient trading, clearing and settlement environment.“In this regard, the introduction of a new derivatives clearing and settlement system is in line with our strategy to improve the derivatives market eco-system with global electronic trading distribution and with more straight-through processing functionality and capability.”Bursa said the new system incorporated “real-time” risk management and real time monitoring of participant exposure. Such capabilities are increasingly in demand among exchanges, including in emerging markets, which are attracting high-frequency and algorithmic traders.BM&FBovespa, the Brazilian exchange group, is in the midst of a $600m, four-year overhaul of its trading and clearing systems which started in 2010. It includes adopting a new, real-time risk management system provided by Cinnober, a Swedish technology company. CME Group has a 5 per cent shareholding in BM&FBovespa.The new clearing and settlement system, which will be used at the Bursa’s derivatives exchange, will incorporate the so-called “SPAN” margining system, originally developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, now part of CME Group. It is one of the main systems used by clearing businesses worldwide to calculate initial margin.Derivatives trading has grown faster than equities trading in Asia, with many markets in the region – such as Korea – deriving most of their volume from retail, or smaller investors.Last month Bursa Malaysia relaxed rules allowing individuals to trade derivatives on the Bursa’s derivatives exchange, replacing a “licensing examination” with a two-day “familiarisation programme”.
457;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-27T19:08:42Z;NYSE Euronext launches gold and silver options;;NYSE Euronext’s upstart US futures market has launched gold and silver options, the latest in a series of exchange moves to tap burgeoning retail and hedge fund demand for metals trades.While commercial gold trading is primarily a physical market, with most financial speculators and small investors accessing it via exchange-traded funds that own gold, exchanges are widening the options for derivatives contracts on the precious metal seen by some as a long-term hedge against inflation.Last month, Nasdaq OMX announced it would launch spot gold futures contracts, meant to simulate the owning of physical gold. CME Group has long offered gold futures via its Comex market and more recently has begun to offer similar “micro” contracts with smaller lots.NYSE Liffe US announced on Monday that it had started offering options on its “mini” futures contracts, represent a delivery of 33.2 ounces of gold or 1,000 ounces of silver.“Customers’ ability to manage risk will be enhanced and they will also be able to take positions based on volatility,” said Jennifer Ropiak, head of precious metals marketing at NYSE Liffe US.CME previously offered “mini” futures, but delisted them in favour of “micro” futures of just 10 ounces last year. Nasdaq’s new spot contracts are also for 10 ounces.Gold futures on CME have open interest of 262,000 contracts, versus some 3,400 open contracts for Liffe US “mini” futures and 2,700 for CME “micro” futures.Both NYSE Euronext and CME Group are among the companies bidding to take over the London Metals Exchange, which they believe would bolster their financial instruments tracking gold. The LME lacks the clearing house services offered by CME and NYSE Liffe.The LME offers post-trade services on over-the-counter gold trades in the London bullion market and also publishes a forward contract curve and prices for gold interest rate swaps.
458;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;LME delays fee rise after members revolt;;The London Metal Exchange has rolled back an increase in trading fees following a rare public revolt from its members.At a meeting on Thursday, the LME’s board decided that the fee rise, which would more than double the cost of some trades, would be delayed by several months and that short-dated contracts would be exempt.The change of course comes as the 135-year-old exchange, which hosts futures contracts used as global industry benchmarks for base metals from copper to nickel, is considering a sale.One of only a few member-owned exchanges in the world, it is home to Europe’s last trading pit where traders shout orders to each other, and is seen as one of the few prizes left in an increasingly consolidated industry.The watering down of the fee increase is likely to be closely watched by the LME’s suitors, which include CME Group, ICE and NYSE Euronext.An increase in fees at the member-owned LME, which are lower than those at its main competitors, would play an important role in any bidder’s valuation, according to people with knowledge of the process.However, the LME said that the move to exempt contracts for delivery in 15 days or less from the fee increase would have only a small impact on its income. “The effect of the changes are 5 per cent of total forecast revenues,” it said.Such short-dated contracts are popular among the physical metals trading and warehousing community. Some of the LME’s largest shareholders include JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which between them hold more than 20 per cent of the shares and also own warehousing companies.The climbdown on fees comes after a rare public outcry at the LME, where disagreements and scandals are usually kept under wraps.Martin Abbott, LME chief executive, said in January that there was “no provision for a revision” of the decision to raise fees.However, the banks and brokers who use and own the LME have been vocal in their opposition. Three of the exchange’s 12 board directors wrote a letter to fellow members attacking the move, while others privately voiced their concern that it could hurt their business just as the brokerage industry is attempting to recover from the collapse of MF Global.The LME has argued that the fee increase is necessary to allow it to make investments – including the cost of building its own clearing house – and to maximise profitability ahead of the possible sale.“Shareholders will be asked to consider the value of the business at some point in 2012, and it is important that they are able to compare incoming bids with the true value of the business,” Mr Abbott said in a letter to members late last year.
459;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-22T19:46:03Z;Prospect of LME’s sale puts focus on clearing;;When the London Metal Exchange said last autumn that it would consider a sale, the move kindled talk of booming investor interest in commodities and the metals price “super-cycle”.But much of the interest in the 135-year-old member-owned exchange is thanks to an altogether more prosaic boom – in the clearing industry.Long seen as the unglamorous plumbing of the financial markets, clearing has moved centre-stage in the wake of the 2008 crisis as regulators insist that clearing houses be used more widely to process over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives in order to provide more security to both parties to a trade.It is also at the heart of discussions over the sale of the LME, whose board meets on Thursday to review first-round bids.The LME, which hosts contracts that serve as the benchmarks for the global metals market, was first approached by a potential buyer after announcing that it was considering building its own clearing house last year, according to people familiar with the process.The addition of a clearing business, which could more than double the LME’s profits, is likely to be a central part of any buyer’s valuation of the exchange, they add.“Clearing is the big project,” Martin Abbott, LME chief executive, said. “It would be our most significant product.”A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, stepping in to ensure that a deal goes ahead even if one party defaults. Clearing houses, or central counterparties (CCPs), earn money by collecting a fee each time a trade is cleared, and by placing collateral deposited with them by market participants in the money markets.The attractions of that potential revenue stream have not been lost on the LME’s suitors. Exchanges such as CME Group, ICE and NYSE Euronext, which are among the roughly seven bidders for the LME, own clearing houses already. “Someone who has an up-and-running clearing house can pay more than someone who has to build one,” says a person familiar with the LME sale.Since the 1980s, the LME’s trades have been cleared by LCH. Clearnet.The focus on clearing at the LME reflects a broader shift in the industry, as exchanges increasingly view having a clearing infrastructure as essential to being able to grow their business.Beyond the additional revenues, having control of a CCP allows exchanges to bring new products to the market far more quickly than if they had to rely on external providers to help them do so.“As important as clearing is financially it’s even more important strategically because it provides futures exchanges with a significant barrier to entry by competitors,” says Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James.The attraction of clearing helps explain the wide gulf between the LME’s 2010 net profits of £9.5m and the apparently heady valuation of up to £1bn being discussed by some industry executives.But by building its own clearing house – a project that was approved by the LME’s board in December – the metals exchange could significantly boost its revenues. The LME generated total revenues of about £50m in 2010, when it last published results, and Mr Abbott says that clearing would add £12m-£13m in revenue from fees alone.“In the right interest rate environment collateral management could give multiples of that,” he adds, estimating that even in with today’s low interest rates the LME could generate an additional £9m-£13m in so-called “treasury income”.Potential buyers that already operate clearing houses could easily expand to clear the LME’s metals contracts, analysts say, significantly boosting profitability.Trevor Spanner, an industry veteran who joined the LME last year to lead its clearing project, says: “You could cut the LME business on to an existing clearing house […] and the rest drops to the bottom line.”For example, when ICE severed its ties with LCH.Clearnet in 2008 it managed to boost the amount of revenue from its benchmark Brent futures from $1.30 per contract to $1.53, according to Mr O’Shaughnessy’s estimates. “That can be directly attributed to them bringing clearing in-house,” he says.Moreover, analysts see clearing as a growth industry in its own right. In the OTC markets in particular, the shift to clearing because of G20 reforms such as the US Dodd-Frank act is likely to bring new business for exchanges that also have clearing.Even if it is not acquired, the LME intends to push ahead with its clearing house. Mr Spanner estimates that the new clearing house would pay for itself within two to three years of its launch, planned for early 2014. “The whole bid process has convinced me of the wider value of clearing,” he says.
460;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
461;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-22T10:31:08Z;Valuing the London Metal Exchange;LME could be worth as much as £1.4bn;"What price the London Metal Exchange?With the 135-year-old exchange’s board meeting on Thursday to judge the first round bids, that will be the question on everyone’s mind – particularly the shareholders of CME Group, ICE, NYSE Euronext and the other four or so companies that are bidding.Indeed, the £1bn number suggested by some shareholders – and even the £540m implied by JPMorgan’s acquisition of shares in November – appears at first blush to be remarkably high when compared to the LME’s net profit of just £9.5m in 2010.But the LME is tricky to value for two reasons.The first – according to the sales pitch – is that it is unique: the undisputed global leader in metals futures, host of global benchmark contracts for the six most widely traded non-ferrous metals.The second reason is a little more mundane. The LME is not run to maximise profit. It is therefore no simple task to calculate what its revenues would be if it were run more commercially.Numerous conversations with shareholders, bankers and industry executives suggest there are three main areas where a potential buyer could unlock value: by increasing income from trading fees; by bringing clearing in-house; and by cutting costs.Trading feesThe LME’s revenues come from a number of sources, including annual membership fees, charges for providing data, and a 1.1 per cent levy on the warehousing fees charged on LME metal.But the bulk of the income comes from trading fees. And, while there remains some dispute about the details and implementation, it is highly likely that trading fees will soon rise significantly.According to examples provided by the exchange, the overall LME income for a segregated client trade, excluding clearing fees, would rise to 70p from 36p currently, while LME income for a non-segregated client trade would rise to 70p from 27p.Under the new fee structure, which could yet be altered at this week’s board meeting, fees for broker-to-broker trades would be unchanged.The increase in the LME’s overall fee revenue depends on the relative proportions of segregated, non-segregated, and broker-to-broker trades – which the LME does not disclose. Nonetheless, the examples above suggest an increase of somewhere between 50 and 100 per cent. If a popular trade used by traders to square positions – called “tom-next” – is excluded from the fee increase as has been mooted, the overall rise could be as little as 40 per cent.That suggests that, as long as trading volumes do not suffer, increasing fees could single-handedly boost the LME’s bottom line by £15m-£40m.ClearingThe next big piece of the puzzle is clearing – which the LME currently outsources to LCH.Clearnet. The LME is in the early stages of building its own clearing house, due to be finished in early 2014. If it were bought by an exchange which already owns a clearing house, it could take its business out of LCH.Clearnet much sooner.Clearing could make a large difference to the LME’s profits, and the additional operating cost of plugging LME trades into an existing clearing house would be minimal, industry executives say.From clearing fees alone, the LME would pick up an additional £12m-£13m (the amount that LCH.Clearnet earned last year from clearing LME trades). Moreover, it could earn “multiples of that” by investing collateral, according to Martin Abbott, the LME’s chief executive. In a low interest rate environment like today’s, “treasury income” would still amount to 75-100 per cent of the fee income, he says.That means, conservatively, clearing could add £15m-£20m to the LME’s bottom line if it is bought by a company that already owns a clearing house. If interest rates rise, net income from the clearing business could rise to £30m or more – although that is likely to be offset somewhat by a fall in trading volumes when the era of easy money ends.CostsIf the LME is bought by another exchange, it is likely to be able to cut some costs – or at least halt the 20-30 per cent annual increase in the LME’s cost base of the past few years. By way of comparison, when ICE bought the New York Board of Trade in 2006, it succeeded in cutting costs by 30 per cent within two years, according to Niamh Alexander of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.If the LME’s buyer wielded its knife with the same success, it could reduce costs by about £12m.Put all that together and the LME’s net income could rise to £40m at the more conservative end, or as much as £90m on the most bullish assumptions.Throw in the value of the LME’s stake in LCH.Clearnet (unnecessary if the LME clears its own trades), which is worth £55m at the price the London Stock Exchange is offering for the clearer. Put the LME on a multiple of 15 times forward earnings (roughly where CME and ICE are trading). And, for the right buyer, the metals exchange would be worth £650m-£1.4bn (£50-£110 a share) – before a possible bidding war.All of which makes JPMorgan’s purchase of shares in November at £41.92 a share look like a smart trade. And it makes Goldman Sachs’ purchase of shares last summer for less than £5 look like a steal."

The benchmark index is now up 8.3 per cent in 2012, and having its best start to a year since 1997.However, much money remains parked on the sidelines, with US exchange-traded funds hit by their first net outflows in 2012 last week, according to Deutsche Bank, and more than $25bn redeemed from domestic equity mutual funds in 2012, according to UBS.“[A] pullback seems probable,” Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup’s chief US equity strategist, wrote in a note, in which he advised clients to halt buying in the absence of a correction.The Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 13,000 for the first time since May 2008 in the morning session, before paring back to 12,965.89. That represented a 0.1 per cent gain for the blue-chip heavy index, even as Walmart shares fell 3.9 per cent to $60.07.The world’s largest retailer by sales saw a steep fall in fourth-quarter earnings, as the company discounted heavily to drive sales growth in the US.Shares in Alcoa, the aluminium producer, gained 2.6 per cent to $10.41, after it announced a joint venture with China Power Investment Corporation to produce high-end fabricated aluminium products for the Chinese market.The transport sector of the Dow diverged further from the broad index, falling 1.5 per cent. According to “Dow theory”, a drop in the transport sector may presage a reversal in sentiment, as transport stocks are the first to feel the effects of a slowing economy.But Bill Carcache, a transport analyst at Nomura, shrugged off concerns about the rising oil price, with a bullish note on the freight container leasing space, citing “several better than expected market developments,” and forecasting 97 per cent utilisation rates for container companies.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.1 per cent to 2,948.57. Apple, which accounts for more than a 10th of the index’s market capitalisation, gained 2.5 per cent to $514.85, as it threatened legal action against ProView of Taiwan, in a long-running dispute over use of the iPad name in China.Although tech stocks make up 20 per cent of the S&P 500, and Apple shares have gained 25 per cent this year, Morgan Stanley analysts said the sector’s outperformance could continue.“Mega-cap technology stocks look extremely attractively valued against mega-cap stocks in other sectors,” Adam Parker, the investment bank’s chief US equity strategist, wrote in a note.Wynn Resorts climbed 6 per cent to $119.40 as investors responded enthusiastically to the board’s move to forcibly buy out the stake of Kazuo Okada, a Japanese billionaire, who is alleged to have made unauthorised payments to gambling regulators.While most of the share price move appeared to stem from hopes that the long-running boardroom feud may soon be over, Jon Oh at CLSA securities also said the terms of the forced buy-out were favourable to shareholders.Macy’s shares were up 1.2 per cent at $36.69, after fiscal fourth-quarter earnings for the department store chain climbed by 12 per cent.Bank investors appeared to take heart from the Greek bail-out deal, with Morgan Stanley up 0.5 per cent to $19.26 and Citigroup climbing 1.3 per cent to $33.36.Bank of America rose 1.1 per cent to $8.11, rallying again, after shares suffered their first weekly fall of 2012 last week.Shares in the CME Group, the largest US exchange group by market capitalisation, slipped 1.3 per cent to $290.08 as Alex Kramm at UBS removed the stock from his “top pick’s” list after a rally, which has seen shares gain more than 20 per cent by the end of last week.Gas exploration and production companies were hit as US natural gas futures fell on Tuesday, having reached February highs last week.Cabot Oil & Gas fell 1.7 per cent to $36.01, as a joint venture with Williams Partners to build a pipeline from the Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania to New York failed to generate enthusiasm.
463;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-21T18:41:17Z;CME doubles stake in Dubai bourse;;CME Group is doubling its stake in the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME), a strong sign of support for the Middle Eastern exchange’s attempt to establish a new global benchmark for oil futures.DME contends that its futures contract could become a benchmark for trading in the Middle East. It argues that the region’s crude should be priced in the region, with the eventual idea that the contract could compete with Brent and WTI, the established global leaders.CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, said on Tuesday it had increased its stake in the Dubai exchange to 50 per cent from 25 per cent, while the Oman Investment Fund had raised its holding to 29 per cent. Those increases reduced the share of Dubai Holding to a 9 per cent stake. Other minority partners, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Royal Dutch Shell, will hold 12 per cent.Bryan Durkin, CME chief operating officer, said the investment would enable futures traders in the Middle East and Asia “to access transparent pricing and risk management products as global energy markets focus ever further eastward”.“DME’s development into a prominent venue for price discovery will prove to be of significant strategic and financial value for the oil markets,” said Hassan Al Nabhani, chief executive of Oman Investment Fund.The CME’s investment in Dubai comes as it eyes expansion in Europe. The group has submitted a bid for the London Metal Exchange, according to people familiar with the matter, and is seen as a frontrunner to buy the 135 year-old bourse.The Dubai exchange was launched in 2007 as a joint venture between the Dubai and Omani governments and the New York Mercantile Exchange, which was subsequently acquired by CME.Ahmad Bin Byat, chief executive of Dubai Holdings, said the move was “a vote of confidence in the future growth of the exchange”.Trading volumes at DME grew 19 per cent last year, although average daily volumes remain low at 3,505 contracts for 2011. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.

Under the so-called Phase III of the Emissions Trading Scheme, the European Union wants to sell most of its allowances. Since its inception in 2005, it has given them away for free.To cope with the shift, the EU is building its own centralised auctioning platform but three of Europe’s three biggest polluters – the UK, Germany and Poland – have opted to conduct their own national auctions. They have tendered for bidders to operate them. Analysts have estimated more than half of the 2.3bn metric tons of allowances may be sold on exchanges next year.The UK deadline passed on Friday. ICE Futures, the region’s largest carbon trading platform, is in competition to host the UK platform with European Energy Exchange (EEX), controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Börse. A decision from the UK government is expected in April. BlueNext, a venture founded by Caisse des Depots and NYSE Euronext, has also submitted a tender. GreenX, the exchange partly owned by CME Group, has decided not to bid for of the auctions as it doubts operating the auction platform will make commercial sense.ICE Futures confirmed it had submitted a tender to the Department of Energy & Climate Change and added it planned to put forward a tender for the European platform.“ICE Futures Europe is well positioned to provide European auction facilities, fulfilling requirements which are an important aspect of Phase III,” said David Peniket, president of ICE Futures Europe.The auction for the UK trading platform comes as the European carbon trading market faces the most difficult period of its short life. Contracts have hit record lows of €6 this year after the market was hit by a succession of scandals and investor concerns about slowing eurozone economies. Furthermore the inclusion of the aviation industry in the emissions trading programme has exacerbated oversupply of permits.ICE Futures is Europe’s most liquid market, accounting for 90 per cent of all European emissions trades.
465;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;NYSE Euronext and CME kick off race for LME;;NYSE Euronext and CME Group, the two US exchange groups, have submitted bids for the London Metal Exchange, valuing it at up to £1bn and kicking off a contest for the commodities business, according to people familiar with the matter.The 135-year-old exchange, which hosts futures contracts used as global industry benchmarks for base metals from copper to nickel, is one of the last member-owned exchanges in the world. It is home to Europe’s last trading pit – known at the LME as the ring – where traders shout orders to each other.The LME, which is owned by the banks and brokers that use it, announced in September that it had received preliminary expressions of interest from 10 potential suitors.One person familiar with the sale process said that roughly half of the 15 or so companies that looked at the LME’s books had made an offer for the exchange in the first round of bidding that closed on Wednesday. IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), CME’s main rival and long seen as a frontrunner for the LME, had also submitted a bid and has hired JPMorgan as adviser, according to one person. ICE declined to comment.The preliminary bids, which are likely to be honed in the coming months, offer valuations for the exchange roughly in line with the £1bn that had been mooted by shareholders last year, though one person described that number as ­“aspirational”.The LME’s board will meet to consider the bids on Thursday February 23. The idea of a sale has divided the LME’s members with some members reluctant to give up control of the exchange while others are keen to profit from their shareholdings. Shareholders would enjoy a windfall if the sale went ahead, with a valuation of £1bn representing more than 15 times the last traded price before the sale process was announced.Several potential suitors, including Deutsche Börse, decided not to bid, the people said, with the London Stock Exchange also unlikely to bid. CME Group, long seen as a frontrunner, and NYSE had submitted a “first round” bid, they said. Some bidders may have been put off by a public dispute among the LME’s board members about a decision to raise trading fees, in part designed to maximise the LME’s profitability ahead of a potential takeover.NYSE Euronext was not previously seen as a likely bidder, in part because it was heavily involved in an attempted tie-up with Deutsche Börse, a deal that collapsed this month.However, it is interested in the LME because of a possible fit with its existing soft and agricultural commodity derivatives business, part of NYSE Liffe – the former London International Financial Futures Exchange. That includes coffee, sugar, cocoa and wheat futures. The LME and NYSE Liffe already use many of the same warehouses for delivery of commodities.The US exchange would also be able to send trades done on the LME for clearing at NYSE Liffe Clear, a fledgling clearing house that NYSE Euronext is building in London. Being able to combine the trading and clearing of securities under one roof is increasingly important to exchanges as they seek new sources of profits.Ownership of the LME is restricted to its 93 members. The largest shareholders are JPMorgan Chase with a 10.9 per cent stake, Goldman Sachs with 9.5 per cent, and Metdist, a family-owned metals trader, with 9.4 per cent. Those three companies could between them block the sale, since any offer needs 75 per cent shareholder support.JPMorgan last November bought the shares that had been owned by bankrupt brokerage MF Global in a deal valuing the exchange at about £530m.The LME’s shareholders are likely to be more concerned about preserving the status quo of the exchange’s business model as they are about the value of the bids, numerous shareholders have told the FT. Maintaining parts of the LME’s infrastructure such as its network of registered warehouses and the complex structure of its futures contracts are likely to be critical.The LME is being advised by Moelis & Co. The companies declined to comment.

For a few minutes this week, the capacious floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange was again the beating heart of the US oil market.At about 2:08pm on Monday, exchange owner CME Group unexpectedly halted oil trading on Globex, its electronic platform through which 99 per cent of US crude futures traded on Nymex now change hands.It was 22 minutes before settlement, typically one of the busiest times of day. The official closing price would be based on what transpired on the floor.At a time when many fear algorithms are running the show, floor traders responded with amazing speed. Some ran over from the oil options pit, while others abandoned desks upstairs, flashed coded name tags and began trading the old-fashioned way. “They were a little bit rusty on their bid and offering skills,” Peter Donovan, a floor broker at Vantage Trading, told me.The outage highlighted the potential risks of an all-electronic market. If trading were to halt on the floor, participants would quickly know the reason. But more than 24 hours after trading stopped on Globex, they were still mystified as to why.“It was crazy,” one big electronic oil trader said, speculating that “someone abused the system and shut it down.”CME wasn’t elucidating what happened, other than a “technical issue”. A person familiar with the matter said the problem related to CME’s ability to publish market data, not an abusive trader.Nanex, a market data analysis group based outside Chicago, said quotes for Nymex crude started piling up untransmitted just before 2pm New York time. Then, 38 seconds later, the quotes were sent to the exchange in a burst. More blasts of quotes hit the exchange a dozen times for the next few minutes before Globex stopped, to be reopened at 3:15pm.“Fortunately, crude oil hadn’t moved much during the period,” said Eric Scott Hunsader of Nanex. “If it had, each one of these blasts would have gyrated the market,” especially for traders arbitraging between crude futures and exchange-traded funds that track crude on stock markets, which did not shut down.At a time when some exchanges have no floor – the rival ICE Futures Europe of London is purely electronic – Monday’s action served as a reminder of why humans are still relevant.“People were able to get business done,” says Raymond Carbone of Paramount Options, a Nymex floor broker. “An instance like this shows what we have that no one else has, and that is manpower. In a pinch you can go back to the old ways. You can write down other people’s names on a pad and it works.”View the full speaker list for the FT Global Commodities Summit on April 24-25 in Lausanne, Switzerland.
467;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-15T00:25:03Z;CME warns of Volcker rule impact on Treasuries;;The CME Group has warned that the proposed Volcker rule could impede the primary dealer system used by the US Treasury to sell government debt.In a comment letter filed this week, Craig Donohue, chief executive of CME, the US’s largest futures market, wrote that the Volcker rule’s exemption for US Treasury debt did not go far enough by failing to extend to the use of Treasury derivatives such as futures and options contracts.US lawmakers added the exemption to the Dodd-Frank Act in order to preserve the ability of US dealers, which include the largest US banks and non-banks, such as Jefferies, and foreign banks, such as RBS, to underwrite the regular sales of US government debt.The US Treasury sells at least $160bn in coupon securities each month in order to fund the budget deficit and relies on the primary dealer system to purchase and distribute the debt to investors.Mr Donohue wrote in a comment letter on Monday that the cash Treasury exemption should be extended, as “primary dealer banks rely heavily on the market for Treasury futures and options”.Separately, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System Investment Office, or Calpers, the US’s largest pension fund, said that while it “strongly supports” Volcker, Treasury futures “are used by many market participants and primary dealers as hedging instruments”.Morgan Stanley also called for the Treasury exemption to be extended to derivatives, saying “futures and derivatives are integral to the orderly functioning of the US government bond market”.CME, which dominates the trading of Treasury futures and derivatives, said that without allowing banks to take proprietary bets on Treasury futures and options, usually in the form of short hedges, the result could be fewer bids for Treasuries at government auctions. It also raised the possibility that the status of primary dealers could be imperilled.“The responsibility of a primary dealer bank [is] to stand ready at a moment’s notice to transact as a counterparty with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,” wrote Mr Donohue. “Failure to participate …could result in [the Fed] withdrawing the bank’s primary dealer status.”The New York Federal Reserve, which operates the primary dealer system on behalf of the Treasury, declined to comment.The Treasuries exemption has also sparked a stream of letters from foreign governments such as the UK and Japan. They argue that the exemption would hand a liquidity advantage to US obligations that would not exist for other countries’ debts and raise their costs of borrowing.Many foreign banks have called for the exemption to be struck from the law. The European Banking Federation wrote: “The exemption proposed has the potential to adversely affect the liquidity and pricing of EU and other countries’ sovereign debt.”Goldman Sachs in its comment letter also warned that US banks may not be able to continue as primary dealers in other countries’ sovereign debts.The bank said the Volcker rule’s exemption for market-making and underwriting may not be sufficient to “satisfy …obligations as primary dealers of sovereign debt in non-US jurisdictions where they may, for example, be required to purchase allotments even if they cannot be resold to customers in the near term”.
468;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-13T12:10:27Z;Superfast trading heads to Malaysia;;Malaysia is set to let high-frequency traders into its share markets after the country’s main exchange, Bursa Malaysia, said it was preparing to allow the ultra-fast style of dealing later this year.The move is a sign that high-frequency trading, which uses computers to trade in and out of shares and other asset classes at the blink of an eye, is spreading to equity markets in Asia.The region’s derivatives markets have already attracted such traders but equities markets have been slower to develop amid a lack of competition between trading venues and stamp duty in some markets, which has put HFTs off.The move by Bursa Malaysia also comes as HFT faces regulatory scrutiny in Europe amid concerns about the computer algorithms running out of control. Regulators are discussing whether HFT provides significant liquidity to markets.HFTs point to academic studies showing that such trading provides valuable liquidity to markets.Dato Tajuddin Atan, Bursa Malaysia’s chief executive, said: “Markets are about liquidity. As they say, liquidity begets liquidity. And these [high frequency traders] are providers of liquidity,” he told a briefing for local media. His comments were confirmed by a spokeswoman.Mr Tajuddin Atan gave no timetable for the introduction of HFT on its equity markets.Bursa Malaysia said last week that average daily trading volume in its equities markets was 14 per cent higher last year than in 2010.Chong Kim Seng, chief executive of that business, said that if the Bursa did not provide services for HFTs this would deprive the exchange of liquidity that was expected to grow in coming years. HFT already accounts for about 6 per cent of derivatives trades on the Bursa’s derivatives platform.CME Group, the US exchange operator which has a 25 stake in Bursa Malaysia’s derivatives platform, recently made the Bursa’s palm oil futures contracts available on CME’s Globex trading system. That has allowed the Bursa to tap HFTs already using the CME’s derivatives products.Japan and Australia are the only two markets in Asia that have so far attracted significant amounts of HFT trading in equities. That is because such equity markets have started to fragment beyond the main national exchange as new upstarts such as Chi-X Global have launched, providing arbitrage opportunities for HFTs between multiple venues.Such fragmentation has not yet happened in Hong Kong and Singapore, however, where there are relatively high stamp duties, or taxes.Steve Edge, principal of Asiaetrading.com, a website on Asian trading and exchanges, said: “There’s a lot of potential in Japan and Australia and in India and China. But until [bid-offer] spreads come down and the costs of trading like stamp duty come down it’s just not going to happen in Singapore and Hong Kong.”
469;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-12T20:43:49Z;LCH.Clearnet to gain from market reforms;;Ask Ian Axe about the business he inherited last year and he answers with a biblical reference. “It was a bit of a Noah’s Ark. There were two of everything,” says the chief executive of LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house.The company was formed in 2003 from the merger of the London Clearing House and Clearnet, clearer for the Paris markets. But it made slow progress in eliminating overlapping technology platforms.Now LCH.Clearnet is caught up in sweeping regulatory changes and industry consolidation. The 2008 financial crisis sparked an overhaul of safety systems in markets, producing reforms by the G20 economies such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, finalised in Brussels last week.They propel clearing houses such as LCH.Clearnet to the forefront of efforts to prevent another financial collapse by insisting that swaths of the over-the-counter derivatives markets be processed through clearing houses.A clearing house acts as buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer in shares, derivatives or bonds, guaranteeing that the deal is completed even if one side defaults.LCH.Clearnet is in pole position to capitalise on these developments. But it faces competition from CME Group, the Chicago-based exchange and clearing house operator, for a share of OTC interest rate derivatives clearing business that is increasingly coming from asset managers and other non-bank users of derivatives.This has persuaded Mr Axe that LCH.Clearnet must become more commercially driven, even though it is not publicly listed like CME and Deutsche Börse. the German exchange. Like the CME, the Börse owns its own clearer and, fresh from the collapse of its planned tie-up with US operator NYSE Euronext, enters the fray with the launch of OTC interest rate derivatives clearing in Europe in March.LCH.Clearnet is 83 per cent owned by banks and brokers, with the rest held equally between NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange. Both are the clearer’s single biggest customers.“The old strategy was far more of a utility mindset but it is now one of a commercial mindset where we can reinvest in ourselves,” says Mr Axe.Since he became chief executive 10 months ago, LCH.Clearnet has been expanding its SwapClear OTC interest rate derivatives clearing service in the US to capitalise on the Dodd-Frank act.Last week, the clearer said increased OTC interest rate clearing volumes helped drive a 16 per cent rise in clearing income, contributing to an 81 per cent rise in operating profit to €106.9m.There are plans to launch clearing of foreign exchange derivatives shortly. Mr Axe says the group will expand into “carefully chosen pockets of excellence in Asian listed markets”.But LCH.Clearnet’s future as a standalone entity is in doubt. In October, the clearer and the London Stock Exchange said they were in exclusive talks about the UK bourse taking a 51 per cent stake. Reports have said the LSE is willing to offer up to €21 a share, valuing LCH.Clearnet at about €1bn.LCH.Clearnet’s governance and ownership make it hard to value. Two attempts to buy the clearer – one by The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade group, and the other by a consortium led by interdealer broker Icap – ended in failure, partly for that reason.The chances of an LSE deal are seen to be better this time, in part because the LSE appears to be offering a premium. Analysts also see industrial logic in the UK bourse owning its own clearer at a time when the G20 agenda is driving much of the exchange and clearing business.Mr Axe indicates that talks are nearing an end but will not comment on a possible deal. “I think my board want me to focus on running the business and driving the transformation as best and as efficiently as possible,” he says.
470;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-10T20:02:52Z;Quick View: A NYSE-LCH alliance?;The latest puzzler will set minds buzzing;"Duncan Niederauer says he did have a Plan B all along.The chief executive of NYSE Euronext revealed on Friday that a team led by Larry Leibowitz, chief operating officer, had been working on a range of initiatives that could be sprung into life if the Deutsche Börse deal failed.That wasn’t the impression many in the industry had. Whatever the truth, we now know one thing for sure: work is resuming quickly on building a full-service clearing house in London.That makes sense. NYSE Euronext needs a clearing strategy at a time when its peers – CME Group, Deutsche Börse’s Eurex, etc – are all jostling to take advantage of G20 reforms that will require more clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.The plan is to finish work that had started pre-Deutsche Börse on building up NYSE Liffe Clear in London to “become a full service CCP [central counterparty] to clear all of Liffe’s products and deliver many of the operational and capital efficiencies that we envisaged in the merger”, Mr Niederauer told analysts.He pointed out that with “legislation beginning to crystallise” on the G20 commitments, the time was right. Indeed, Europe this week finalised the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), which mandates greater clearing of OTC derivatives.With Liffe’s current contract with LCH.Clearnet on listed derivatives expiring in mid-2013, NYSE could by then be doing all the clearing for its Liffe products in London.The arrangements with LCH.Clearnet for European cash equities are to be put under an “accelerated review”. That contract – involving the use of Clearnet in Paris for the Euronext markets – expires at the end of next year.But what did Mr Niederauer mean by delivering all the operational and capital efficiencies envisaged with the Börse deal?One clue came in the answer to a question about how LCH.Clearnet might fit into NYSE’s clearing strategy. LCH.Clearnet, coincidentally, released full-year earnings on Friday. Ian Axe, its chief executive, hinted that its exclusive talks with the London Stock Exchange might soon result in something.Mr Niederauer’s comment on LCH.Clearnet was: “We think that the company has a great deal of potential under Ian Axe, but whether it’s LCH or other alliances given the shifting landscape and the clients’ need for capital efficiencies, I think it would be foolish for us not to continue to consider various alliances between exchanges and clearing houses.“Mr Niederauer went on to dangle the alliance that NYSE already has with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp – they jointly run New York Portfolio Clearing, a CCP for futures in the US – as “a great example of that; it’s unprecedented”.One rumour doing the rounds is that Liffe might yet move clearing of euribor to Eurex Clearing. That would fit with Mr Niederauer’s comment about “delivering all the operational and capital efficiencies envisaged” with the Börse deal.But what about some sort of arrangement with LCH.Clearnet? Mr Axe suggested last summer the two parties could have a longer-term agreement on cash equities when they extended the clearing notice period. But what about a deal over OTC clearing?That’s the latest puzzler that will set minds buzzing next week."
471;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-10T19:47:32Z;NYSE sets ‘full service’ clearing house for London;;NYSE Euronext has pledged to make building up a “full service” clearing house in London a priority as the US-exchange operator sought to draw a line under its failed tie-up with Deutsche Börse.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE chief executive, said the group’s portfolio of clearing businesses would be “a key focus” this year, as G20 regulations designed to expand use of clearing in the vast over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets move towards completion.“Our immediate focus in 2012 will be Europe …and the build out of Liffe Clear [in London] and of new OTC clearing solutions,” Mr Niederauer told analysts on a fourth-quarter earnings conference call. Developing the post-trade business would be “critical for us in 2012”.His comments come as rivals have been expanding into clearing, a crucial post-trade process that helps guarantee that securities and derivatives trades are completed even if one party defaults.Clearing, especially in London, has become a priority for many of the world’s exchanges as they see a business opportunity in offering clearing services as more activity is forced to be cleared through post-2008 crisis regulations.London is already home to clearing houses recently set up by NYSE rivals IntercontinentalExchange and CME Group, both of which are using the UK capital as a beachhead to push into Europe. The London Stock Exchange is in exclusive talks with LCH.Clearnet, an Anglo-French clearer based in London, about taking a controlling stake .NYSE Euronext has a fledgling clearing house in London known as NYSE Liffe Clear but it shares some of the clearing of the Liffe futures exchange’s derivatives with LCH. Clearnet.The aim is to convert NYSE Liffe Clear into a “full-service” clearer that would not only handle Liffe’s futures contracts but also offer clearing of OTC derivatives. Part of Liffe Clear’s expansion would require altering the relationship with LCH. Clearnet.At present, Liffe derivatives are processed through Liffe Clear, but the treasury and risk management services – the heart of what a clearing house does – are outsourced to LCH. Clearnet.“We want to get all the revenues, and then have a platform to launch new products like over-the-counter interest rate and credit [default] swaps,” said Michael Geltzeiler, chief financial officer of NYSE Euronext, in an interview. He said the group would lay out specific details at an analyst meeting in early April.NYSE said its Liffe US futures market, launched last year to compete against CME Group, was expected to become profitable in 2013 after the roll-out of new products this year. NYSE also was looking at “the possible addition of new partners” at a US clearing house that clears Liffe US products and is run jointly with Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, the dominant securities post-trade group in the country.Mr Niederauer said that NYSE was still “in a position to grow through strategic M&A”, pointing out that it had cut its net debt to earnings before interest, debt, tax and amortisation ratio to 1.6 times – the lowest level since before the NYSE group bought Euronext, the European network of stock exchanges, in 2007.The group’s net income in the fourth quarter fell from $135m to $110m after charges of $46m for merger expenses and exit costs, mostly related to the Deutsche Börse deal. “I don’t regret what we tried to do for a second. It’s onward and upward from here,” Mr Niederauer said.Pressure on NYSE also came from weak trading volumes, especially in Europe. Net revenues from derivatives fell 1 per cent from a year ago to $186m. However, turnover in its technology business, which sells trading software and direct connections to the exchange, grew 16 per cent over last year to $127m.
472;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-10T11:19:33Z;LCH.Clearnet/LSE talks near endgame;;LCH.Clearnet is expected to make an announcement “shortly” on months of talks with the London Stock Exchange that could see the UK bourse taking a controlling stake, the Anglo-French clearing house’s chief executive said on Friday.The LSE already uses LCH.Clearnet as clearer for UK shares and its fledgling futures business but four months ago entered exclusive talks about taking a 51 per cent stake in it as a way of securing its own clearing infrastructure.Asked about the state of talks, Ian Axe, LCH.Clearnet’s chief executive since April last year, said: “We hope to announce something shortly.” However, he declined to comment on the likelihood of a deal, or what a deal might involve.LCH.Clearnet later said: “There can be no certainty that the discussions will result in any transaction.”If a deal were consummated, it would be the first large-scale transaction to be completed in more than a year of failed exchange consolidation.This month, European regulators blocked a proposed combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse. That would have intensified competition for the LSE and LCH.Clearnet.People familiar with the matter have said the LSE has offered up to €20 a share for LCH.Clearnet, valuing it at about €1bn. The LSE beat Markit, a market data company, to exclusive talks status with LCH.Clearnet in September. Market had offered €11 a share.Markit’s approach had at one point included NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, both LSE rivals.LCH.Clearnet is one of the most prized assets in market infrastructures given a focus by G20 regulators on pushing swaths of over-the-counter derivatives on to clearing houses to help safeguard the financial system against the fallout from another Lehman-style default.On Thursday, European regulators reached a milestone in achieving that G20 commitment by agreeing on a new regulation that would require the clearing of OTC derivatives in Europe.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, ensuring a deal goes ahead if one side defaults.Mr Axe’s comments come as speculation swirls around the future of LCH.Clearnet, which operates under a complex governance structure as a non-profit entity in which market participants have 83 per cent ownership, with NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange holding the rest.Since taking over, Mr Axe, a former Barclays Capital banker, has streamlined the clearer in an attempt to turn it from a utility into a more commercially driven business.LCH.Clearnet faces competition in OTC derivatives clearing globally from CME Group, the US-listed operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and will soon face Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing in Europe when the Frankfurt-based group launches clearing of OTC interest rate swaps, in March.Mr Axe said: “The old strategy was far more of a utility mindset but it is now one of a commercial mindset where we can reinvest in ourselves.”His comments came as the clearer, formed from the 2003 merger of the London Clearing House and Paris-based Clearnet, reported an 81 per cent jump in operating profit for the full calendar year, to €106.9m, compared with €58.9m the previous year.Underlying net revenues rose by 16 per cent to €387.2m, compared with €335m last time.
473;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Brazil eyes expansion in OTC trades;;Brazil’s main exchange operator, BM&FBovespa, has signalled ambitions to expand into the over-the-counter derivatives business with plans to develop a platform for storing electronic records of OTC trades.The move comes as G20 economies outside the US and Europe are muscling in on opportunities thrown up by reforms enacted after the 2008 crisis designed to clean up the financial system, especially the OTC derivatives markets.Legislation such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US mandates that “standardised” OTC derivatives be traded on exchanges or new platforms known as “swap execution facilities” (SEFs), while similar rules working their way through Europe would do the same.That is designed to shift them from the control of big banks that long controlled pricing of such instruments and on to more formally organised trading systems, where prices could be seen more easily by a wider set of market participants and by regulators.Regulators also want electronic records of all OTC derivatives to be reported to and stored at “trade repositories”, to create an audit trail of trading activity.BM&FBovespa is building a trade repository for OTC products as part of a $600m, four-year project that started in 2010. That involves creating a new trading system for equities and derivatives, integrating the group’s four clearing houses into one, and building a data centre for high-frequency traders, said Eduardo Guardia, the group’s chief financial officer.“OTC products are less than 1 per cent of our revenues at the moment, but we do see an interesting opportunity in the OTC business in Brazil,” he said in an interview at City Week, a conference in London.BM&FBovespa in November hired Calypso, a US technology company, to develop the OTC repository.OTC derivatives markets are tiny in Brazil, partly because the country’s regulations have ensured that most financial instruments be traded on an exchange after the collapse of the Rio de Janeiro exchange in the 1980s. That left Brazil with one of the most robust, transparent market structures in emerging economies.But the G20 push to move OTC derivatives on to more formal platforms has been seized on by exchanges and clearing houses elsewhere as an opportunity, with Eurex Clearing, the clearer owned by Deutsche Börse, set in March to launch clearing of OTC interest rate swaps.CME Group, which owns 5 per cent of BM&FBovespa, IntercontinentalExchange and LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear unit are already active in OTC derivatives clearing.Mr Guardia said that once the consolidation of the four clearing houses at BM&FBovespa was complete, this would save market participants in foreign exchange, equities and derivatives up to 40 per cent in reduced collateral expense.The new clearing system would use a new risk management system that would allow BM&FBovespa to see all traders’ positions. Mr Guardia said that such a feature was all the more important after the collapse of MF Global, the US futures broker, which highlighted shortcomings in the US futures industry.
474;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:46:42+0000;CME to accept corporate bonds as collateral;;Corporate bonds will be accepted as collateral for swap trades by the CME Group’s clearing house from next month, the result of a shortage of high-quality assets amid a broadening regulatory push for central clearing of derivatives.Clearing houses in the US have been moving to expand their offering to buyside groups such as asset managers, pension funds and insurers.This comes as the Dodd-Frank Act requires that most swap trades have a central counterparty to limit systemic risk are phased in over the next year.But as the $440tn market in notional interest rate swaps moves towards being cleared, it requires trillions of dollars of additional collateral to be posted to clearing houses.Initial collateral requirements on swaps trades, relatively risky by clearing house standards, are often in the range of 10 per cent of the value of the swap.The move toward clearing is coming at the same time as investors globally are scrambling for “safe” assets to avoid risks such as a European sovereign default, and central banks are buying bonds to create liquidity.As a result, notes such as highly rated corporates and mortgage-backed securities are entering the picture.Swap clearing companies such as the CME and SwapClear, a unit of LCH.Clearnet, the established interdealer clearing house, have been moving to ease the collateral shortage by allowing customers to post new kinds of margin, or allowing them to net exposures across all their cleared trades.CME’s members, as of March 12, will be able to post up to $3bn in certain corporates, depending on the margin requirements of their customers.“Expanding our collateral programme allows us to continue to meet the needs of our very diverse customer base, particularly as we approach the new regulatory realities that require more collateral from market participants,” said Kim Taylor, CME Clearing president.LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear US recently announced it had also expanded the range of acceptable margin to include US mortgage bonds backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as collateral priced in a wider range of currencies.The collateral shortage is being felt across markets. Fitch Ratings this week said that some banks were using more mortgage-backed securities, once labelled “toxic” assets, in overnight loans. Some central banks, such as the Bank of Japan, are also moving into holding corporate bonds.“This is an important step in empowering life insurers and other buyside firms to clear their OTC derivatives in a capital-efficient manner,” said Jason Manske, head of rates, currencies and equities at MetLife Investments.However, one trader at a midsized dealer said that while the move would ease shortages, corporates may at times be more expensive to use as margin, since they tend to move in tandem with market declines, rather than act as hedges when investors flee risk.“If you’re posting margin on a credit-risky asset in a credit downturn, it can exacerbate your margin call if you don’t model it correctly,” this person said.CME said it had a record day for clearing of interest rate and credit default swap trades on Thursday, with $13.2bn in notional trades passing through the clearing house, surpassing the previous record set in late November.
475;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-09T01:32:44Z;S&P cuts CME’s rating over raised risks from MF Global;;"Moves to compensate the customers of MF Global have taken their toll on CME Group’s creditworthiness, rating agency Standard & Poor’s said as it downgraded the group’s long-term credit rating from double-A to double-A-minus.The agency said on Wednesday that CME had taken on additional risk by branching out into clearing of over-the-counter derivatives contracts and maintained its negative outlook.The move came after CME, the world’s largest futures and derivatives exchange, last week said it would establish a $100m fund to protect family farmers and ranchers from the default of a clearing member. That followed a $250m guarantee offered last November to speed distribution of MF Global funds back to customers.CME has been criticised in the wake of MF Global’s collapse and the subsequent confusion about the whereabouts of $1.2bn of protected customer funds. MF Global was a member of CME’s clearing house and under its regulatory supervision.S&P said that CME’s moves to protect customers were not immediate financial threats; its credit rating remains in the top 25 among S&P 500 companies.However, it warned: “While we believe CME Group is making a rational business decision to support the liquidity and integrity of its market, such support raises incremental risks that were not previously factored into our ratings on the company.”Michael Shore, a CME spokesperson, said: “We have acted aggressively to speed the return of customer monies – not because we had to, but because it was the right thing to do for our customers.“We are working with the industry to develop recommendations that strengthen customer protections at the firm level.”S&P warned that CME might see a drop in volumes in the wake of MF’s collapse. CME reported a decline in average daily volumes of 2 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year ago, though profits were still up 22 per cent.“MF Global’s customers, who number in the thousands, have been very vocal about not having full access to their segregated funds or frozen cash balances. This appears to be affecting volumes on CME Group’s exchanges,” the agency said.Despite the move, CME shares rose 3.2 per cent to $284.82. CME said that energy trading hit record high volumes on Tuesday.The agency last year issued a negative warning for CME after NYSE Liffe US launched a competing futures market. S&P maintained the negative outlook, citing CME’s expanded dividend ahead of $750m of long-term debt coming due in August 2013.S&P also reiterated its broader industry view, expressed in a note last month that CME’s clearing of over-the-counter credit default swaps represented a new risk “outside the clearinghouse’s historical expertise”."
476;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-08T14:28:20Z;ICE says China backing US futures trades;;Chinese banks are filling in for European lenders in US agricultural finance, helping preserve trading activity in sugar and other commodities in the wake of MF Global’s collapse, according to a US exchange chief.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), told analysts that volumes in its US futures business, formerly the New York Board of Trade, had been affected by MF’s bankruptcy last year, as it was one of the largest sugar brokers in the market.However, he said that volumes for ICE Futures US had rebounded, in part because while European banks had been pulling back from lending to US agricultural businesses, Chinese banks were emerging to provide that finance. Businesses needed to pay for hedging expenses and for warehouse space“A bigger impact [than MF Global] has been restructuring of European banks,” said Mr Sprecher. “But what we have seen in recent times is that gap is being filled by new banks coming into this market. We have started to see a recovery of open interest …in sugar.”Data from the exchange show that open interest in sugar has rebounded to some 695,000 contracts after bottoming out at fewer than 500,000 contracts leading up to MF’s bankruptcy in late October. ICE Futures US still saw a 7 per cent decline in average daily volume in the fourth quarter on last year.However, strong commodities trading across US and UK markets run by ICE, drove an rise in profits and revenues. Net income rose 28 per cent on the year to $127m, on the back of a 15 per cent jump in revenues to $327m.ICE’s shares rose 5.8 per cent to $129.79, their highest level since last October.While rival CME Group, which also had large markets in financial futures, saw its volumes fall 2 per cent in the fourth quarter on the previous year, ICE’s overall average daily volumes rose 12 per cent in futures and 10 per cent in over-the-counter derivative markets.The exchange has benefited from a shift in oil trading from US West Texas Intermediate as the universal benchmark, which is primarily traded by CME, to many traders looking at Brent crude, which is traded by ICE Futures Europe in London.Mr Sprecher said that natural gas trading volumes were holding up despite record low prices for gas in the US following a boom of drilling in shale formations, because worries about storage capacity were driving longer-term hedging activity.“OTC energy commissions for January …running above $2m a day mark a big surprise given expected headwinds from low natural gas prices,” said Alex Kramm, analyst at UBS.This article is subject to a correction and has been amended.
477;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-07T00:20:22Z;MF Global dipped into customer funds earlier than thought;;MF Global began using customer funds a day earlier than previously believed as it struggled to deal with customer withdrawals and margin calls in the run-up to its bankruptcy filing on October 31, according to the first official account by its court-appointed trustee.A preliminary status report released by the trustee on Monday said the broker began dipping into customer funds on October 26, resulting in a deficit of $300m that day. Eventually, the shortfall mushroomed to $1.2bn at the futures broker, which was run by Jon Corzine.The report, which described sloppy records and an “unprecedented” volume of transactions totalling $205bn in the company’s final days, said the ultimate recipients of the transfers were banks, counterparties, exchanges, clearing houses and customers. A person familiar with the matter said investigators believe customer money is tied up at the same entities.“We will analyse where the property wired out of bank accounts established to hold segregated and secured property ultimately ended up” and whether there is a legal way to obtain it for customers, said James Giddens, the trustee. About $4bn has been returned to customers in the three months since MF’s Global’s collapse.Futures brokers are allowed to use “excess” money kept in customer accounts but are prohibited by law from dipping further into actual customer money.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Bureau of Investigation and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating whether MF Global employees knew they used customer money to cover debts.The report found MF Global “ regularly” used excess customer money to fund its daily operations. The transfers were less than $50m a day, but as a loss of confidence led to a run on the company, it increased the amount, expecting to replace it at day’s end, the report said.“The trustee’s investigation has revealed that while personnel may not have been immediately aware of it, MF Global Inc experienced a shortfall” in customer funds on Wednesday, October 26, according to the report. Concerning liability, a spokesman for the trustee added: “We have not made a conclusion about the deficit, only that it occurred.”Last year, Terry Duffy, CME Group’s chief executive, told Congress the CME had “no reason to believe” customer accounts were misused on October 26, but lacked proper documents to fully match the accounts. CME said an initial MF Global report stated there was $200m in excess customer funds on October 27, but that was later revised as a deficit. That testimony was the first public statement identifying a deficit.Mr Duffy also testified that a CME auditor had told him that Mr Corzine knew customer funds were used to settle other accounts.Mr Corzine told Congress he did not instruct anyone to use customer money improperly nor was he aware that anyone had. He said he learnt of the shortfall on Sunday, October 30.He also testified that employees in MF Global’s Chicago office had told him that a roughly $200m transfer made to JPMorgan Chase later that same week was appropriate.
478;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-03T23:12:45Z;Positive employment data lift US stocks;;A week that started with eurozone clouds over Wall Street ended with the focus squarely back on the domestic economy, as a strong employment report gave another leg to the new year rally.Stocks had opened sharply lower on Monday as a eurozone summit once again weighed on sentiment, but the market rallied through the rest of the week, before a fall in unemployment to 8.3 per cent, a three-year low, pushed markets sharply higher on Friday.Equity strategists had been worrying that the “surprise” ratio of US data – a measure of how often domestic economic reports surprise to the upside, boosting stocks – had started to tail off, but bulls seized on the employment report to advance the argument that US markets can decouple from their eurozone peers.“Our economy is growing, and faster than we thought. That reduces the dependence of US equity markets on eurozone news flow,” said Randy Warren, principal of money manager Warren Financial, who said he was adding to his domestic equity position in anticipation of further rallies in the S&P 500.The S&P 500 ended the week up 2.2 per cent, at 1,344.9, 25 points into bull market territory and at a new six-month high.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index hit a post-dot com bubble high after climbing 3.2 per cent to 2,905.66, as Facebook’s long-awaited IPO filing drove a two-day rally in internet stocks from Chinese social network Renren to offers website Groupon.Zynga benefited the most. Shares in the social-game developer climbed 33.2 per cent over the week to $13.39, trading comfortably above its $10 IPO price for the first time since its stock market debut in December last year.That came after Facebook’s filing showed Zynga accounted for 12 per cent of Facebook’s 2011 revenue, up from 10 per cent in the prior two years. But other moves appeared to have little to do with any Facebook-specific information.Professional networking website LinkedIn climbed 4.3 per cent over the week to $79.88, Groupon surged 21.9 per cent to $24.43, well above its November $20 IPO price. Chinese internet businesses, including SINA, which owns a Twitter-like service and gained 7.2 per cent to $75.00, also benefited.“There’s nothing I saw in the Facebook filing that justifies a 20 per cent rally for Groupon or LinkedIn say,” warned Aaron Kessler at Raymond, “this is clearly all about sentiment, which makes the stocks vulnerable to a pull back if say earnings were to disappoint.”Options traders appeared to be taking note, with bearish traders buying $18 Groupon puts in large volumes on Friday, a trade that would require the stocks to pare gains significantly in the next two weeks to yield a profit.The tussle between eurozone tail risk and upbeat US economic data was summed up in a 17 per cent rise for Genworth Financial, which ended the week at a post-July close of $9.17.The market capitalisation of the US insurer halved in 2011 on fears of a deep recession in the eurozone, where it sells a consumer debt insurance product.The company declared its first quarterly profit since 2010, after a sharp fall in losses on its core domestic mortgage insurance products, as the default rate on its US mortgage book fell.“Sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth we’d expect to see a seasonal uptick in delinquencies,” said Steven Schwartz at Raymond James. “That we didn’t may indicate that we’ve reached a peak default rate for Genworth’s mortgage book, and will see falls form here.”Bank stocks rallied strongly through the week, with Morgan Stanley, whose shares climbed 9.4 per cent to $20.31 over the week, to the fore as the investment bank secured the coveted lead underwriting role for Facebook’s IPO.Bank of America hit a post-August high of $7.89 before ending the week up 7.5 per cent at $7.84, although the bank is still only trading at 40 per cent of the book value of its assets.The New York Stock Exchange fell 0.3 per cent to $27.49 in the week that the European Commission blocked its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse. Rival CME Group saw its shares climb 14.2 per cent to $273.43.Earnings were the other big driver of stocks during the week. Amazon shares fell 3.9 per cent over the week to $187.68, as revenue and sales growth fell unexpectedly at the online retailer.Whirlpool surged 25.8 per cent to $68.66 for the best performance in the S&P 500, as the dishwasher manufacturer delivered unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter results, after substantial cost savings.
479;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-03T19:48:00Z;EC block clouds outlook for big exchange mergers;;Almost exactly a year after it was unveiled, an ambitious plan to create the world’s largest exchange by combining Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext was blocked this week by the European Commission.The decision was taken as a sign that large cross-border exchange mergers are unlikely for the foreseeable future amid a hardening of antitrust attitudes towards such businesses wielding greater market power.The two exchange groups criticised the move, which followed a recommendation made by Brussels antitrust authorities. The authorities said the combination of the Börse’s Eurex derivatives exchange and NYSE’s Liffe derivatives exchange would create a near-monopoly in exchange-traded derivatives in Europe.Yet NYSE and the Börse countered that the market in which the derivatives exchanges operate – and would operate post-merger – is global and that they would still face competition from CME Group in the US and emerging Asian exchanges.Reto Francioni, the Börse’s chief executive, called the decision a “black day for Europe”. But Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said: “There were real problems. This was not patriotic analysis, not protectionist attitudes, not at all.”Attention shifts next week to the only remaining exchange deal facing antitrust scrutiny: a proposed takeover of TMX Group, operator of the Toronto exchange, by a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds known as Maple.

Shares in the social-game developer climbed as much as 20 per cent to hit an all-time high of $12.91 before closing at $12.39, a gain of 16.8 per cent.That came after Facebook’s filing revealed Zynga accounted for 12 per cent of Facebook’s 2011 revenue, up from 10 per cent in the prior two years. Zynga shares ended the day comfortably above their $10 IPO price, for the first time since the company’s own stock market debut in December.But other moves appeared to have little to do with any Facebook-specific information.Professional networking website LinkedIn climbed 8.2 per cent to $76.87, Groupon climbed 7.4 per cent to $23.08 and Renren was up 8.2 per cent to $5.42. SINA, a Chinese social-media company, which owns a Twitter-like service, climbed as much as 5 per cent before closing up 1.9 per cent to $75.30.“This rally is really all about sentiment,” said Herman Leung, a tech analyst at Susquehanna. “We’re seeing big share price moves for anything with a whiff of social about it on no real news, while old school internet companies underperform.”Yahoo slipped 0.1 per cent to $15.72 and Google climbed 0.7 per cent to $585.11.Elsewhere, US stocks were generally flat with the S&P 500 inching up 0.1 per cent to 1,325.54.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,705.41, as Pfizer fell 0.9 per cent to $21.11 after the drug maker recalled 1m packets of birth control pills amid fears that faulty packaging could potentially lead to unwanted pregnancies.Merck shares also fell 0.5 per cent to $38.44 although Pfizer’s rival swung to a fourth-quarter profit, beating analyst expectations. The second-largest US drug maker by revenues predicted a relatively flat 2012, with profits expected to be hit by cheaper generic forms of its biggest product, asthma drug Singulair.Retail stocks were volatile as clothing stores updated investors on fourth-quarter expectations.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch slumped 13.7 per cent to a 52-week low of $40.40, as the clothing store warned fourth-quarter profit will come in well below expectations.The company said sales growth of 16 per cent in the quarter ended January 28 was driven almost exclusively by new store openings, as same-store sales came in flat.Rival clothing company Gap jumped 10.6 per cent to $21.52, despite forecasting a fall in same-store sales across its brands of 4 per cent and a 2 per cent fall in overall sales. Analysts had been braced for much worse, but sales at Banana Republic stores surprised on the upside.However, Robert Drbul at Barclays Capital noted that apparel, footwear and textiles stores underperformed the S&P 500 in January, while, “exposure to Europe remains a concern given the soft macroeconomic environment”.Earnings were responsible for other big movers, with JDS Uniphase falling 7.2 per cent to $12.19 even though quarterly earnings came in better than expected as the fibre optics manufacturer recovered strongly from supply-chain disruption in Thailand.Nikos Theodosopoulos at UBS downgraded JDS to “neutral” from a “buy” recommendation, telling clients that, “while orders looked good we struggle to place a higher than 15 [times earnings] multiple on JDSU’s cyclical business.”Qualcomm shares climbed 2 per cent to $60.73 as strong sales of smartphones drove demand for its wireless networking products, helping deliver better than expected fiscal first-quarter results and strong guidance for 2012.“A healthy market, ongoing share gains and conservative guidance should yield further upside in the shares,” said Jeff Kvaal at Barclays Capital.CME Group rose 8.4 per cent to $257.13. The largest US exchange group by market capitalisation said fourth-quarter profit rose, with a tailwind from an Illinois tax benefit. Meanwhile NYSE Euronext rallied 1.9 per cent to $26.94 after retreating on Wednesday, as the European Commission blocked its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse.Electronic Arts gained 6.1 per cent to $19.57 after the second-largest US video-game publisher reported a 70 per cent increase in third-quarter profit.MasterCard shares, which climbed 66 per cent in 2011, were on the move again, gaining 6.7 per cent to $381.57. The credit-card company delivered strong earnings, once a $495m after-tax charge against litigation was stripped out of fourth-quarter numbers.
481;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:46:42+0000;CME Group creates $100m fund after MF Global;;CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange operator, is creating a $100m protection fund for farmers and ranchers as it attempts to restore confidence in futures markets after the collapse of MF Global.The exchange group is also raising its dividend by 59 per cent to try to “invigorate” shareholders and attract investors as it has come under intense scrutiny over its role as the industry body responsible for regulating MF Global.The credibility of the group, which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, has been dented by the increasing expectation that funds belonging to customers of the bankrupt broker-dealer will not be repaid to them in full.This would mark the first time that futures traders had lost money as a result of a shortfall in customer funds held at a brokerage.Some $1.2bn of customer funds are still missing following MF Global’s October 31 bankruptcy. Until the funds are located, more than a quarter of the money owed to 36,000 former customers of the broker has been frozen.Many of those affected are farmers, whose relatively small trading accounts meant they could not open futures trading accounts with big Wall Street banks, but instead were limited to independent brokers such as MF Global. A significant proportion of such customers are thought to be avoiding the futures markets, which has led to a fall in CME’s trading volumes.CME said the new fund was designed to protect farmers and ranchers in the case of the failure of a clearing firm. The fund will cover accounts held by individual farmers or ranchers up to $25,000 and will cover co-operatives up to $100,000 in the event of any losses.“This is a constituency that basically started these businesses way back when,” said Terry Duffy, CME chairman. “They do need to rely on our markets … These are not speculator-type participants. These are purely bona fide hedgers … we felt it was critically important to give them an additional comfort zone.”Mr Duffy stressed that the fund is not retroactive, and so will not help victims of MF Global. He said the move represented a “first step” in restoring faith in the futures markets, but indicated that more fundamental structural solutions would have to come from the industry as a whole.Separately, the group signalled a big increase in dividends this year. The company raised its first-quarter regular dividend by 59 per cent as it increased its pay-out target from 35 per cent to 50 per cent of the prior year’s cash earnings. In addition, CME introduced an annual variable dividend, which it set at $3 per share for 2012.CME has come under fire from some shareholders for using cash on hand to repurchase shares rather than raising dividends. The company’s share price has fallen by about 16 per cent over the past year. Jamie Parisi, chief financial officer, said that with the new dividend policy, “we want to invigorate our existing shareholders and attract new ones”.The company made the two announcements as it reported quarterly earnings that fell short of expectations.CME earned a net income of $746m or $11.25 per share, but that included a tax incentive, without which the company’s net profit for the fourth quarter was $236m or $3.55 per share, up from $196m or $2.93 per share a year earlier.That was below analysts’ forecasts of about $3.64 per share. Revenues were $740m, below consensus estimates of $749m.Average daily trading volume was 11.7m in the quarter, down 2 per cent from a year earlier and 20 per cent below the prior quarter.CME shares were trading up 5.8 per cent at $259.79 at mid-day in New York.

We see upside from less exposure to Europe and a potential transaction tax”.Mr Rutschow added that other incumbents could benefit from the collapse of the deal.“If the merger had gone through, there would have been concern that Nasdaq in particular was becoming an also ran in the exchange space globally, but now competitors are under less pressure to do their own deals.”CME Group climbed 2.5 per cent to $245.41, Nasdaq OMX gained a cent to close at $24.77, although shares were hit by fall in fourth quarter net income, and IntercontinentalExchange was up 0.2 per cent to $114.69.Elsewhere, Wall Street was back in tune with global markets, as US stocks climbed higher after a rash of positive global manufacturing survey data.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent to 1,324.08, back once again into bull market territory, although the index tended to face resistance from sellers taking profit whenever it moved above 1,325 in January.Banks led the rally with Morgan Stanley up 4 per cent to $19.39, as reports gathered momentum that the investment bank has won the race to be the lead underwriter of Facebook’s IPO.Goldman Sachs lagged behind, up just 1.8 per cent to $113.45, on suggestions it may also have been beaten by JPMorgan to the role of second underwriter in the Facebook deal.Large commercial banks also climbed, with Citigroup up 2.9 per cent to $31.60 and Bank of America climbing 3.2 per cent to $7.36 on reports states’ attorneys-general may be looking at a comprehensive deal on mortgage-related litigation that has been hanging over bank stocks since the financial crisis.Amazon shares fell 7.7 per cent to $179.46 after the company’s fourth-quarter results disappointed on Tuesday evening. Wall Street had been primed for a fall in margins, as the online retailer has pursued growth through heavy spending on its Fire tablet and promotions, but analysts were taken aback by a fall in revenue and sales growth.Brian Nowak at Nomura was equally concerned about the company’s cautious outlook.“This is the seventh straight quarter in which Amazon’s forward . . . guidance has come in below the Street, and the second consecutive quarter where the midpoint of revenue missed guidance. We are lowering our forward estimates,” he told clients.Broadcom climbed 8.1 per cent to $37.13, with management upbeat on the company’s current quarter prospects, without quite calling a bottom to the semiconductor market. That was vindication for analysts who had called for investors to buy the stock in the wake of Apple’s blockbuster results.JPMorgan analysts once again picked out Broadcom’s supplier relationship to Apple smartphones and tablets as they predicted the company will “outgrow the overall semiconductor market [in 2012]”.Whirlpool shares soared 13.5 per cent to $61.64, approaching levels last seen in July, before last summer’s market sell-off. Quarterly profit at the dishwasher manufacturer surged by a fifth on cost savings.Marathon Petroleum shares climbed 9.6 per cent to $41.88, as the company announced a $2bn share buy-back programme. Shares in refiners have slumped in recent weeks after a succession of oil companies announced collapsing margins on refining operations, as the discount of WTI to Brent crude fell in the fourth quarter, increasing input costs for refiners.Shares in hard disc drive manufacturer Western Digital climbed 4.6 per cent to $38.03, as profits at its rival Seagate Technology surged. Seagate shares climbed 20.8 per cent to $25.53.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 12,716.46, and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.2 per cent to 2,848.27.Gas exploration and production companies sold off again, as natural gas prices reversed their recent rally. Chesapeake Energy fell 0.8 per cent to $20.97, Southwestern Energy was off 2.3 per cent to $30.41 and EQT Corp was off 1.1 per cent to $49.98.Chesapeake, among other companies, has announced cuts in production this year in a bid to put a floor under gas prices.
483;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-02-01T20:15:48Z;IDCG in talks with banks over stake sale;;The International Derivatives Clearing Group is in discussions to sell a stake to a group of banks, as the US regulatory process pushing more derivatives trading to central counterparties moves into the late stages.Nasdaq OMX confirmed on Wednesday that it was reviewing its stake in IDCG, with a resolution expected by the end of February and possibly early March. The business is majority-owned by Nasdaq but operates independently of the bourse.Nasdaq has held talks with a consortium of banks to discuss a deal that would enable the bourse to withdraw some of the $75m of capital it is using to back the clearing house.“We’re engaged in active dialogue for a proper home over the long term,” said Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times.IDCG is one of several clearing houses that has emerged since the financial crisis to clear over-the-counter trades in interest-rate swaps and other derivatives between big-bank dealers and their customers.The space has been evolving slowly as the final rules on clearing are completed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other regulators. IDCG, like rivals launched by CME Group and LCH.Clearnet, has seen only test trading thus far.But one thing that is becoming clear is that smaller broker-dealers and pension funds and asset management groups, known as the buyside, are for the most part not becoming direct members of clearing houses, as had initially been envisioned.Instead, buyside firms are clearing via brokerages known as futures clearing merchants, or FCMs, which are mostly attached to large banks such as Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan.By bringing in banks as partners, IDCG may be opting to follow a similar model. The group declined to comment on its plans. The minority investments in IDCG are from Bank of New York Mellon and other firms.Last year, IDCG was sued by Jefferies, the US investment bank and owner of a mid-tier FCM. Jefferies accused it of mispricing swaps transactions it was converting into futures positions. The two groups agreed to resolve the suit via arbitration earlier this month.

The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
485;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Why Brussels rejected DB/NYSE deal;;In summing up why he opposed the merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, Europe’s competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia left little room for doubt, saying: “The deal would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide.”Now that the plan to create the world’s biggest exchange operator by revenue has been blocked by the European Commission, it is possible to examine the thinking behind the Brussels antitrust officials’ decision to oppose the deal, which has been made public for the first time.From the outset Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, and Reto Francioni, his counterpart at Deutsche Börse, had argued that bringing together NYSE Liffe and Eurex, the groups’ respective derivatives businesses, would create little overlap on the biggest products that each offers - interest rate and government bond futures.Liffe’s flagship euribor interest rate contract is at the short end of the interest rate yield curve, while Eurex’s German bond futures operate at the long end.But Mr Almunia’s case team said: “While European short-term interest rate derivatives are based on European interbank lending rates and European long-term interest rate derivatives on European government debt securities, the market investigation showed that the boundaries between the two are becoming blurred.”Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext had tried to argue that CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, served as serious competition in a range of products in a global market. This view was challenged by the antitrust team which said CME “has very limited presence in derivatives based on European underlyings which are at the heart of this case”.Its view was that CME focused on US interest rate, equity index futures, and commodity futures and was unlikely to become “a credible competitive force”. “This is because it would face considerable obstacles as, owing to its very different product portfolio, it could not offer collateral savings comparable to those offered by the parties individually or the merged entity in the product area concerned.”It also argued that Eurex and Liffe were by far the largest companies in the world offering trading in European financial derivatives on a global basis.“Except for them [Eurex and Liffe] there are only two other exchanges offering trading in these contracts: CME in euribor and the Singapore Stock Exchange in derivatives based on Stoxx indices.“None of these achieves significant volumes. Indeed, since it started offering trading in euribor futures, CME achieved a volume of around 2,000 contracts in comparison with close to 250m traded by Liffe annually. Therefore, whether the market is global or European, the merger would lead to a near monopoly in this product area.”When it became clear that the Commission had serious concerns about the proposed merger, Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext offered a series of remedies. They included the sale of part of NYSE Liffe’s European single stock derivatives business, and access to the merged entity’s clearing house for materially “new” interest rate, bond and equity index derivatives contracts.However, these failed to satisfy Mr Almunia’s antitrust team. “The market test showed that overall, this remedy package would be insufficient in scope, difficult to implement and unlikely to be effective in practice,” the Commission found. “As a result, no competitor showed credible interest in the commitments as a whole.”
486;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;NYSE board stands by Niederauer;;The board of NYSE Euronext is “fully supportive” of Duncan Niederauer remaining as chief executive of the US exchange group despite the failure of its attempted tie-up with Deutsche Börse.“Not just me personally but the whole board is fully supportive of Duncan,” Jan-Michiel Hessels, NYSE chairman, said in an interview with the Financial Times on Wednesday.“We feel he has done an excellent job not only with this deal but in running the business. Duncan seems highly motivated to continue,” he added.The comments came after the European Commission decided to block the proposed combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, agreeing with Brussels antitrust authorities that it would stifle competition in European derivatives markets.Both exchange operators had lobbied furiously in recent weeks, arguing that the derivatives markets are global, not regional – as Brussels antitrust authorities have decided. Brussels also contended that the off-exchange, or over-the-counter markets did not provide significant competition for exchange-traded derivatives.Mr Niederauer said: “It is still remarkable to me that after the [European] Commission stating repeatedly [in recent years] that the derivatives markets were global and OTC was certainly part of the equation, and to denounce all of that and base a prohibition on a narrow market definition, I find a bit surprising.”Both NYSE and the Börse have argued that the combined group would still compete globally with the CME Group in the US and emerging exchanges in Asia.Mr Hessels said: “I think it’s a missed opportunity for Europe and European capital markets. The Chinese and the Hong Kong exchanges one day will be even stronger and if we are not careful Europe will still be fragmented and weak.”Earlier, Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said: “The merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide. These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive.”Mr Niederauer said the New York-based group’s priority now was to build up its post-trade infrastructure in London. A key element of the DB/NYSE deal was to have been that NYSE would move clearing of its Liffe derivatives contracts to the Börse’s Frankfurt-based clearing house.Analysts have said that if the deal collapsed, NYSE would need to develop its own clearing strategy, especially at a time when clearing has become a key weapon in exchanges’ ability to compete against rivals.Mr Niederauer said that work had already started “in earnest” in building up NYSE Liffe Clear, a fledgling clearing house in London, as a full clearing house.“You can expect that to get done by the end of the year. I think that will be the strategic priority in the near term,” he said. “Our priority is clearly in the post-trade space.”
487;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-27T16:52:51Z;Bruising finale for NYSE-D Börse tie-up;;NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse’s nine-month attempt to win regulatory approval for their proposal to create the world’s largest exchange has reached a bruising finale after the US group’s chief executive said their chance of success was slim.Duncan Niederauer admitted he had misjudged Brussels’ determination to define the derivatives market as European, as opposed to global, for the purpose of its antitrust analysis.The two groups have spent the week engaged in a frenetic lobbying campaign, much of it focused on top European policymakers assembled in Davos for the World Economic Forum.The aim has been to convince them and the European Union’s 27 commissioners that the deal should be approved in the interest of creating a “European champion” better able to compete globally with the CME Group, the dominant US derivatives exchange, and other emerging exchanges in Asia.However EU antitrust authorities oppose the deal on the grounds that in Europe, the combination would bring together the Börse’s Eurex futures exchange with NYSE’s Liffe platform, creating a player with 95 per cent of futures trading and stifling competition.The EU commissioners make their final decision next week. Mr Niederauer said: “You don’t give up until the end. It certainly looks like a low probability of success. But it’s not hopeless.”The strong line taken by EU competition authorities highlights how successive exchange mergers in the past 12 months have fallen foul of tough antitrust scrutiny – a new development in the exchange business.Mr Niederauer said this was likely to mean the end of large-scale, cross-border mergers and acquisitions by exchanges for now.
488;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-26T20:12:43Z;NYSE chief sees little chance of Deutsche Börse deal;;Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, has admitted he “misjudged” European antitrust authorities’ approach to his exchange’s attempted tie-up with Deutsche Börse, saying there was only a “glimmer of hope” the deal would succeed.His comments are the first sign the German and US groups have all but given up hope that European politicians will approve the deal after Brussels competition officials blocked it this month.That decision – backed by Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner – was based on a view that the combination would create a dominant player in derivatives markets in Europe, stifling competition.Of the 27 EU commissioners who must make a final call on the proposed deal by February 1, only about six are understood to sympathise with the exchange groups’ arguments: that trading both on and off exchange is a global market, so a European concentration in some on-exchange areas is the wrong basis for a decision.“I misjudged the process,” Mr Niederauer said, referring to the antitrust authorities’ analysis of the markets in which the two exchanges’ derivatives platforms operate.Asked in a Financial Times video interview if he had given up on the deal, he said: “You don’t give up until the end. It certainly looks like a low probability of success. But it’s not hopeless.”Deutsche Börse shares rose 3 per cent to €45.33 in Frankfurt on Thursday, while in New York NYSE Euronext shares were 0.5 per cent lower at $27.31 in afternoon trading.Mr Niederauer’s comments come amid an intense lobbying campaign by NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse to convince EU commissioners and other decision-makers that the antitrust authorities’ definition of the market was flawed. The NYSE chief has shuttled to and from European capitals in the past week to make his case.NYSE and Deutsche Börse say the two derivatives exchanges they operate, Liffe and Eurex, already compete with CME Group, the largest US derivatives exchange operator, and would continue to do so once merged.However, Brussels has privately made it clear to the groups that a combination of Eurex and Liffe – which would control 85 per cent of trading in benchmark euro-denominated interest rate and German government bond futures – would reduce market choice in Europe.Mr Almunia has appeared unmoved by the argument – accepted by many in the derivatives industry, including CME – that the market definition should be global, not European.One senior person close to one of the two exchanges said on Wednesday night: “Duncan has good relations with a lot of top European officials, including [International Monetary Fund managing director, Christine] Lagarde, and I think he thought he’d be able to persuade Almunia. But that was not going to work with Almunia.”The exchanges’ bruising encounter with Brussels is a sign regulators are taking an unexpectedly tough stance on exchange mergers. Many have collapsed in the past 12 months on antitrust or nationalism hurdles, including an attempt by the Singapore Exchange to combine with ASX of Australia.Mr Niederauer said regulators and politicians had clearly turned against the concept of large-scale dealmaking in the sector after the financial crisis. “There is a lot of nationalism, a lot of protectionism. Globalisation is being put on hold,” he said. “There will be no more mega M&A in this space.”Bob Greifeld, his counterpart at rival exchange operator Nasdaq OMX, expressed the opposite view in remarks to reporters in Davos, saying deals were still possible.Mr Niederauer said NYSE Euronext would continue to pursue smaller-scale acquisitions, particularly in the areas of technology and post-trade services.
489;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:46:42+0000;MF Global: Uncertain futures;The question is how can regulation now be tightened;"David Kasouf did not feel like celebrating over the festive season. The 32-year-old independent futures trader from Long Island is one of the 36,000 former customers of MF Global whose money is yet to be returned to them in full.Almost three months after the spectacular collapse of the broker-dealer, former customers such as Mr Kasouf, as well as farmers, grain transporters and small manufacturers, are still waiting to find out the whereabouts of $1.2bn in missing funds. Until regulators and investigators discover what happened, more than a quarter of the money once held in MF Global customer accounts will remain frozen.People such as Mr Kasouf increasingly feel they will never get their money back. As Christmas app­roached, with a wife and two children to support, he considered selling his house or declaring bankruptcy. Ultimately, the 72 per cent of his funds MF Global’s bankruptcy trustee has since returned prevented this, but his view of the markets has been shaken. “This has practically destroyed my trust in the whole system,” he says.Since MF Global filed for bankruptcy on October 31 and revealed that customer money was missing, attention has been focused on Jon Corzine, the firm’s former chief executive. Once a Wall Street “master of the universe”, with a career including stints as head of Goldman Sachs, a US senator and governor of New Jersey, Mr Corzine is now one of the most reviled figures in finance.There has also been intense scrutiny of CME Group, America’s biggest futures exchange operator and the in­dustry body responsible for regulating MF Global’s commodities business. Some customers are angry at what they say was a lapse in oversight; others say a for-profit entity should not be regulating its own customers. CME responds that no watchdog can guarantee against fraud.But the MF Global scandal is more than just a question of tarnished reputations. It has had a profound effect on the entire financial industry. The realisation that customers could lose money kept in segregated accounts separate from the firm’s own money – thought by many to be as safe as a bank – has severely damaged confidence in the 163-year-old US futures market. Before the financial crisis, futures were among the fastest-growing of all exchange-traded products.“This is unprecedented. It’s the single biggest blow the industry has ever had to its business and credibility,” says a former senior CME executive. “It has forced us to ask the question: is the model of the futures industry so flawed that it can never be the same again?”Such soul-searching is rare for a business that in the past 30 years has transformed itself from an agricultural backwater. Futures markets – which enable producers such as manufacturers to fix for the longer term the prices at which they buy or sell rather than expose themselves to the risk of volatility on the daily spot markets – were once seen chiefly as a system of crop insurance for farmers. Today investors trade agreements to buy and sell in the future anything from oil to financial products.MF Global’s fall is a fresh embarrassment for an industry that has worked hard to disown a history of scandal, writes Gregory Meyer.Since the US futures markets were founded in the 19th century, many scandals have involved “corners” – buying up large quantities of a commodity to drive up the price. In 1888 Benjamin Hutchinson, known as Old Hutch, amassed wheat supplies and shipped them out of town in order to corner the Chicago futures market, according to a book on futures by Robert Kolb and James Overdahl. The resulting scarcity meant traders who had agreed to deliver the grain to him and other buyers at a lower price found it extremely costly if not impossible to honour their contracts. Some reportedly killed themselves in the face of financial ruin.In the 20th century’s most notorious corner, the Hunt brothers tried to gain control of the silver futures market in 1979-80, more than quintupling the price. This unleashed a flood of scrap silverware into the market – which, combined with the intervention of regulators, deflated the bubble.With the advent of financial futures in markets from interest rates to currencies, the industry has attracted a broader clientele, from Wall Street banks to pension funds. “It had much more of a Wild West feel, with many larger-than-life characters, prior to the 1980s,” says Professor Craig Pirrong of the University of Houston.Still, in 1985 the fall of the Volume Investors brokerage over a gold trade cost customers money. In 1998 the bankruptcy of Griffin Trading, a Chicago-based futures firm, caused big losses to traders in London, driving several out of business.“The futures industry has worked very hard for decades to overcome that stigma and image of itself,” says Emily Lambert, author of The Futures, a market history.The sector is proud to have made itself a central element of global financial institutions’ risk-management strategies. CME, once a member-owned trading club, is now one of the world’s most powerful exchange groups. The MF Global debacle threatens to undermine those achievements. The most obvious indication of the loss of trust in the industry is a fall in futures trading volumes since the collapse of MF Global, which was a dominant force in Chicago’s agricultural trading markets and the largest broker on the New York Mercantile Exchange, an energy-trading venue also owned by Chicago-based CME. Most ob­servers say the effect ofMF Global’s collapse is the primary explanation.The impact has reverberated across the industry. “Even brokers who didn’t necessarily have their accounts at MF Global are seeing incredible trepidation, especially from international market participants,” says Christine Cochran of the Commodity Markets Council, a Washington industry group whose members include big agricultural traders such as Archer Daniels Midland, food companies such as Kraft, hedge funds and futures brokers. “They will pull their money out every night …It remains to be seen if that trust can be repaired.”At groups such as Scoular, which handles grain at 58 silo complexes in North America, risk managers are rethinking how to insure against price fluctuations. “The industry felt using the commodity exchanges was a way to transfer risk without having to worry about counterparty risk [that trading partners would go bankrupt],” says Bob Ludington, Scoular’s chief operating officer. “When the MF Global situation happened, that really woke everybody up. They said: ‘Wait a minute, there is counterparty risk.’ Then the question is, who do you do business with?”Regulators have viewed futures as a model for reforming the vast markets in swaps – derivatives that are privately negotiated rather than traded on exchanges – such as the credit default swaps made infamous by the financial crisis. But the collapse of MF Global has prompted some grain merchants to move in the opposite direction. Scoular, for example, is buying from big banks more agricultural swaps, where physical delivery of the underlying commodity is not required. Unlike futures, these derivatives are not “cleared”, or protected against the risk of default by an exchange clearing house. “It’s basically taking bank counterparty risk as opposed to [futures broker] counterparty risk,” says Mr Ludington.…Before MF Global fell, CME often touted the fact that no customer had lost money as a result of a clearing member default. Futures brokers reiterated that claim, leading customers to leave plentiful money in their accounts to cover margin calls – increases in the deposit traders must leave at the exchange clearing house to indicate good faith in fulfilling their contracts. Indeed, futures brokers depend on this, making their profits by reinvesting excess capital and receiving interest on the investments.As it turns out, unlike bank deposits, futures trading accounts are uninsured by the federal government. And there is no industry body akin to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which has a reserve covering securities customers for up to $500,000, to help clients of failed futures brokers.In the wake of MF Global’s collapse, traders are scrutinising brokers more closely. However, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Washington futures watchdog, this week said 70 firms subject to an emergency spot check were compliant.“People are really evaluating, who am I doing business with?” says Scott Cordes, president of Country Hedging, a Minneapolis-based futures broker. The lack of trust, he adds, could prompt clients to take their chances in spot markets. “If we can’t restore the integrity back in the marketplace, long term I think you’ll have people taking on more risk than they should be. They might not be hedging.”Since the missing money was held in MF Global’s own accounts, CME is not legally obliged to make up the shortfall in customers’ funds. Had this happened before CME became a public company a decade ago, its members might well have clubbed together to bail out its traders. Now, its shareholders would be loath to do so.CME did offer a guarantee of $550m to encourage the bankruptcy trustee to release more frozen funds. That has not, however, stopped calls for CME to come up with all the money itself.Yet even if the money is found or replaced, it is far from clear confidence can be rebuilt without a change in oversight. “The damage has been done,” says John Lothian, who runs MarketsWiki, an industry website. “There are some structural issues that need to be addressed – bankruptcy, self-regulation – and they will be.”…The affair has already spurred changes. Last month the CFTC revived a rule limiting brokers’ investment options for customer cash. On January 11, as it passed new rules imposing stricter protection for big traders that use cleared swaps, it said it might consider similar safeguards for futures.Self-regulatory bodies including CME and the National Futures Association are working on possible rule changes for customer funds. The Futures Industry Association, which represents brokers, has set up a task force to suggest reforms.CME’s role as a designated self-regulatory body is under intensifying scrutiny. Barney Frank, the congressman who spearheaded the overhaul of financial regulation, has suggested stripping it of this function. “How did the government allow a for-profit company to have such major regulatory authority?” asks the head of one Chicago futures broker. “It would certainly appear that there’s a conflict of interest there.”CME demurs. “The self-regulatory model is really a misnomer for a complex system of organisations that work together to ensure effective regulation,” says Anita Liskey, a CME spokeswoman. “It is a proven system that has withstood the test of time. For over 75 years, customers have lost money due to a shortfall in their segregated accounts only once, and that was due to a firm’s actions in violations of law. That record compares very favourably to alternative approaches.”CME argues that because it guarantees trades, it has a vested interest in ensuring firms are fully compliant. It also says it has the expertise to do so and notes that self-regulation does not cost taxpayers. It employs 200 auditors and regulators, at an annual cost of $40m, to carry out its duties.Brokers, too, face further scrutiny. “CME, along with the industry, is ex­ploring additional protections for customer collateral held at the firm-level,” says Ms Liskey. “That is where the failure occurred, not at the clearing house, and that is where we and others in the industry believe we need to focus.”The debate has gone further, however, with some questioning the very structure that allows brokers to make profits. “The model has always been that you hold the customers’ cash, you invest it and keep the interest,” the former CME executive notes. “It’s the customers’ money – why shouldn’t they keep the interest?”Already, changes made by the CFTC threaten brokers’ business model. Limiting their investment options will cut a crucial source of revenue. Fees might be increased as a result, which could put off retail investors.Ultimately, a quick fix looks un­likely. “Trust has been completely shaken and it’ll be a long, slow, hard climb back,” says the futures broker’s head. “When farmers and small-town banks don’t trust us, we need to take a long look in the mirror.”"
490;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-24T20:44:50Z;Quick View: Last-minute lifeline or false hope?;Barnier or Almunia? Brussels right or wrong?;"As my Brussels-based colleague Alex Barker reports, Michel Barnier, Europe’s heavyweight head of the region’s internal markets, has reserved the right to oppose his antitrust colleagues in Brussels, who are saying the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext deal should be blocked. Meaning: he may come out and say it should be allowed after all.It is potentially a big development and the only bit of good news the two exchanges have had since it became clear that Joaquín Almunia, competition commissioner, was dead set against the deal.The feeling in Brussels – where I have just spent two days – is that the two groups badly misjudged Mr Almunia’s determination – from quite early on in the process – to turn the deal down.His department made clear that the combination of Eurex and Liffe, the groups’ two derivatives exchanges, would not only control a whopping 95 per cent of the listed (ie exchange-traded) derivatives markets in Europe, but would stifle new entrants.On strictly antitrust terms, Mr Almunia’s staff are absolutely correct.It is also impossible to argue against someone saying: “More competition is good, right?”But here’s a funny thing: a lot of people I spoke with in Brussels, while they accepted that point, said that Brussels was also wrong.They pointed out that the listed derivatives market simply cannot be treated as solely “European” and that it is global. This is, of course, the line that D Börse/NYSE are hammering home in their frenetic lobbying campaign, which kicks into high gear on the snowy slopes of Davos, where the World Economic Form is convening.Yes, there is a universe of hedgers who have euro exposure and need to hedge that exposure. The only place they can do that is on Eurex/Liffe. And the only place you can trade German Bund futures is Eurex. Ditto euribor futures in Liffe (assuming you dismiss the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s recently launched rival euribor contract as not that serious or practical an alternative).But, equally, Liffe’s biggest product, euribor, operates at the short end of the interest rate yield curve, the opposite end to Eurex’s biggest product, German Bund, Bobl and Schatz futures. And don’t tell me that the shifting of the Bund contract in the 1990s from Liffe in London to Eurex in Frankfurt was a result of “competition” between them; that happened because the contract was repatriated with a lot of help from the German banks, as many people involved at the time will tell you (how else do you shift “open interest” from one platform to another in futures markets?).I am not privy to Mr Barnier’s thinking but, as the guy with a 30,000ft view of markets, market infrastructures and a need to deal with his US and Asian counterparts regularly as part of his day job, he may see that D Börse and NYSE have a point.I also suspect that as a sceptic when it comes to the value of off-exchange or over-the-counter markets (and that probably puts it mildly), he sees the creation of a mega European exchange, carrying with it the reassuring labels of “transparency” and “fully regulated”, as the perfect antidote to the “opaque” and “unregulated” OTC markets.We know Mr Barnier’s views on the OTC markets from his statements on Mifid II (the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), whose thrust is to shift as much OTC trading on to exchanges and other formal platforms as possible.What Mr Barnier’s possible intervention shows is that, rightly or wrongly, there is more to the D Börse/NYSE deal than a narrow definition of the derivatives market and that definition being “Europe”.In fact, there are some I spoke with in Brussels who fear that the way the antitrust people have defined the market has sent the wrong signal globally, that Europe is too blinkered to see beyond its own borders when, patently, the derivatives markets are global. There are suggestions of narrow protectionism.And exchanges that are looking beyond the D Börse/NYSE deal – and its possible collapse – are very keen to understand what is going on because Brussels’ market definition could imply significant limitations on what they might do, M&A-wise, in Europe in future. Think of IntercontinentalExchange , which has a clearing house in London and runs what used to be the International Petroleum Exchange. And of CME Group, which also has a clearing house in London. Both have ambitions in Europe.On balance, I still think the deal is probably doomed. But this latest twist shows there are ramifications that go far beyond the deal itself. Which makes it all the more fascinating and difficult to call."
491;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Osaka to delay key futures contract launch;;The Osaka Securities Exchange, Japan’s second-largest bourse by market capitalisation, has delayed a venture to launch a key new derivatives contract even as its principal markets suffered a heavy drop-off in volumes in the last quarter.OSE gave no new date for the launch of its planned Dow Jones Industrial Average futures contract but said the change was due “to the status of the preparations in various areas for the launch of trading”. It had been due to go live at the end of February.The postponement comes as a blow to the exchange, which like many regional rivals, saw a pronounced slowdown in trading in the final months of the year. The introduction of yen-denominated Dow futures is expected to add to volume on the OSE as the bourse gears up for a merger with the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).Japan, for so long the undisputed largest and most liquid capital market in Asia, faces a long-term threat from China and its maturing exchanges. The combination of Japan’s largest cash and derivatives markets will consolidate the TSE’s position as the third largest in the world by market capitalisation of company listings.But many of region’s largest markets, including Singapore and Tokyo, experienced a heavy decline in trading volumes in the last quarter.On the OSE, trading value and volume of total derivatives fell by 24 per cent and 13.1 per cent in the three months to December 31, compared with the same period a year ago. The OSE said trading in its flagship products – the Nikkei 225 Futures, Nikkei 225 mini, and Nikkei 225 Options – all saw double-digit declines in trading volumes. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Futures was hardest hit, down 22.7 per cent.The declines were in part offset by a near doubling of volumes and value of foreign exchange trading, the group added.OSE has licensed the DJIA contract, which is based on the 30-stock benchmark of the US equity market, from CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange. The OSE confirmed that Nikkei 225 Volatility Index Futures would be launched on February 27 as planned.Third quarter operating revenues at the OSE rose 1.8 per cent to 16,634m yen owing to a 12 per cent increase in clearing fees.
492;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-21T02:24:55Z;Changes bring global flurry of innovation;Exchange trading and central clearing of OTC derivatives will have huge impact;Gone in 1.932 seconds. That’s how long it took for a group of swap market participants and CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, to execute and clear 21 off-exchange trades totalling a notional $4.1bn last month.It was a piece of one-upmanship typical of an industry obsessed by speed but it also encapsulated a dramatic change the industry is still feeling its way around – the impact of moving swathes of the vast $6tn over-the-counter derivatives (OTC) market on to electronic venues and through central clearing.“Due in part to the sheer size of the market, the migration of OTC derivatives to exchange trading and central clearing will change financial relationships to the greatest extent since the electronification of equity trading in the 1980s and 1990s,” says Rob Hegarty, global head of market structure at Thomson Reuters, the financial information provider.The catalyst for the change is a mandate from the G20 group of economies in 2009, keen to strengthen the global financial system in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Policymakers cited the opaque OTC market as a key factor exacerbating market instability. Sweeping legislation such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US and the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation, passing through European lawmakers, are designed to strengthen critical market infrastructure.Among the changes, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US regulator, has proposed that participants execute and clear OTC trades “as soon as technologically practicable”.The new rules have sparked a flurry of technology projects around the world as exchanges, banks and institutional investors build technology infrastructure capable of handling the changes. A tie-up between BM&F Bovespa and software makers Cinnober and Calypso Technologies in November was only the latest in a string of projects being undertaken by many of the world’s largest exchanges.But some argue that in one crucial respect, policymakers were pushing at an open door.At the same time banks and institutional investors have grown to realise that understanding their risk exposure during the trading day at any moment has become an imperative rather than a luxury.“As volatility alone can cause rapid intra-day deterioration of major counterparty credit quality, a move towards near-time or real-time clearing is inevitable anyway,” said Kevin McPartland, fixed income analyst at Tabb Group, in a report last year.It marks a radical departure for an industry that negotiated trades bilaterally between counterparties, usually investment banks. The effects could be profound.For a start, the technology will have to manage huge amounts of complex data to calculate both initial margin and variation margin as fast as possible. Valuing an OTC credit default swap is far more complex than valuing a standard interest rate swap. Unlike exchange-traded instruments, OTC derivatives were frequently never intended for clearing and processing.Furthermore market participants may have to hold more funds in reserve to meet any intra-day margin calls, while clearing houses may require more capital to protect themselves. Traders of OTC derivatives, such as brokers and buyside firms, have not historically had to put up margin for clearing. Tabb estimates, as a worst case scenario, that the industry may need to come up with $2tn in capital.“Due to the onerous membership and operational requirements tied to becoming a direct clearing member of a central counterparty, the vast majority of fund management firms will elect to clear their derivatives through general clearing members,” says Marianne Brown, chief executive of Omgeo, the post-trade services group.“The fees associated with using a clearing broker, along with the increased margin requirements from the central counterparties, will likely increase the overall cost of doing business for fund management firms.”The threat of increased costs in straitened times leads many to predict that market participants will look for ways to streamline operations that tie-up large amounts of collateral. Clearing cycles may be completed intra-day. Currently the system can take several days.If central counterparties lower margin and collateral requirements to gain market share, Mr Hegarty warns it could raise systemic risk. It will “reduce the ability for that central counterparty to absorb a counterparty failure,” he says.But while exchanges, banks and clearing houses try to get a better view of potential risks in the financial system, there has been a mixed response from end users – institutional investors. Larger firms have begun IT upgrades, but many smaller ones are waiting for further clarification over the final rules.“In the new clearing environment, it will become essential for fund management firms to have a near real-time consolidated view of their counterparty exposures across both their bilateral and centrally cleared portfolios,” says Ms Brown.
493;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-21T02:24:38Z;Collapse of MF Global raises question over futures model;A debate continues over new rules to better protect client funds;Since Washington crafted landmark laws designed to regulate the vast over-the-counter derivatives market, the big worry within the industry has been any move to push it towards a futures type model.In the wake of the global financial crisis, key players in the much smaller futures world wasted no opportunity to highlight the safety and transparency of their market versus the much larger, opaque and unregulated OTC arena.But the demise of MF Global in late October has resulted in customers trading futures facing up to $1.2bn in losses, through no fault of their own. The collapse of MF Global and its futures commission merchant or FCM has duly focused attention on its main regulators, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the CME Group, the vast Chicago futures exchange.While inquiries into MF Global continue, the OTC industry is watching whether rules finalised under the Dodd-Frank Act over the coming months offer more protection for client funds and veer from a futures type model to one where the unique characteristics of OTC trading are recognised.Late last month, there was some evidence that the CFTC is backing away from a prescriptive approach as it voted on real time reporting rules that seek to preserve the liquidity of the swaps market.“No doubt the CFTC is listening to the industry and the comment letters,” says an inter-dealer broker. “They are trying not to hurt liquidity.”He adds: “The centralised clearing and FCM model is not without its pitfalls and prior to MF Global it was held up as a panacea for OTC derivatives. But it didn’t function the way it was supposed to do.”One clear message in the wake of MF Global is that a proposed rule that offers stronger protection for client funds via FCMs than that of the futures model in the new world of cleared OTC derivatives is likely to pass.In futures trading, margin payments from clients are pooled into one gross omnibus account at an FCM and can be used to help offset a default by one or more clients at the clearing house. The CFTC has proposed a system for OTC derivatives called “legally segregated, operationally commingled” or LSOC.Under this approach, margin from non-defaulting clients is protected. This has angered the CME, smaller FCMs and clearing houses as it will raise costs.However, Richard Prager, head of global trading at BlackRock, says: “LSOC strikes the right balance.” And Ray Kahn, head of OTC clearing at Barclays Capital, says: “A proposal – LSOC – that provides a higher level of protection for client funds in OTC derivatives clearing is positive.”It means FCMs will require stronger capital and better safeguards at a time when the failure of MF Global has shocked investors and eroded their trust in the futures market.“FCMs will still play a meaningful role, however given recent risk management rules for clearing organisations, the winners will be defined by those that are best capitalised and that have the best risk processes in place,” says Mr Prager.Beyond FCMs and client funds, important rules have yet to be finalised and the industry remains wary of strict rules from the CFTC that could hurt liquidity in swaps. “Some of the most contentious rule proposals are those that will impact liquidity fragmentation the most,” says Kevin McPartland, senior analyst at Tabb Group.The big risk to OTC trading is the likely escalation in the costs of margin, compliance and even trading, factors that are unknown at this stage.Mr Kahn says: “The added cost of new regulatory requirements could make trading OTC derivatives expensive, which could have an impact on liquidity in the market.”The head of trading at a major dealer says regulators should: “Let the market decide, don’t prescribe. Giving people a choice in how they trade is the best approach.”He says swap traders look at how the US Treasury market trades – via a combination of electronic systems and the telephone for large orders – and wonder why OTC reform does not replicate that approach.“Either the Treasury market is broken or regulators are trying to reinvent the wheel.”
494;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-21T02:24:11Z;New rules are struggle for industry and regulators;Post-crisis reforms are provoking a backlash and causing confusion;More than two years into the process of dealing with a wave of regulations aimed at reshaping the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets, Craig Donohue, chief executive of CME Group, recently described how he felt.“I feel I am being waterboarded by regulation,” he said, in a reference to the tough interrogation practice used by the US military in the Iraq war that sparked such controversy.His remark will have resonance among many in the industry, which continues to face a wave of rules that are supposed to lay out how asset managers, banks, clearing houses and others are to comply with post-2008 crisis reforms such as the US Dodd-Frank act and its equivalent regulations in Europe.Indeed this month seven associations representing exchanges, clearing houses and derivatives dealers wrote to European Union commissioner Michel Barnier, the finance minister of Denmark – current holder of the rotating presidency of the EU – and to Sharon Bowles, chair of the European Parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee, complaining of “acute challenges” associated with the phase regulators now face in drafting detailed technical rules.In effect, more than two years into the process of implementing the G20 reforms that created Dodd-Frank, the derivatives industry is struggling to keep up with the detail. At the same time regulators – and in particular the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US watchdog charged with implementing vast chunks of Dodd-Frank – is also struggling with a huge workload and a budget under threat.According to Davis Polk, a US law firm, the CFTC has passed 21 rules but has missed the deadline for approving the same number of rules that have reached proposal stage. The agency has also missed the deadline for three rules that it has yet to propose.However, it notes that the CFTC has still done more than any other federal regulator on implementing Dodd-Frank.In Europe, there are concerns that new supervisory authorities, such as the European Securities and Markets Authority, do not have enough time to come up with detailed technical rules on clearing, short-selling and credit default swaps without jeopardising “high quality and credible regulation”.Some of the criticism can be attributed to a general backlash against the new regulations as dealers attempt to defend their existing business models. In the US they have been emboldened by a Republican-controlled House of Representatives and hopes that the US presidential election will distract from the implementation process.In spite of this, a clear trend is emerging: key players in the derivatives industry are moving to embrace the new market structures mandated by Dodd-Frank and, in Europe, the yet-to-be-finalised European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid).Key among them are that OTC derivatives that are “standardised” be traded on exchanges or new platforms to be established for OTC derivatives called “swap execution facilities” (SEFs), and that derivatives eligible for clearing should be processed through clearing houses or central counterparties (CCPs).Large asset managers are starting to use clearing for their OTC derivatives transactions, and banks that are to act as brokers between derivatives users – such as the buyside – and CCPs say they are signing up customers in anticipation of clearing.Dale Braithwait, global head of credit clearing at JPMorgan, says the adoption of clearing by large asset managers “has created a bit of a tipping point in the way other people are thinking about this”.Christopher Perkins, global head of derivatives clearing at Citi, agrees. “It’s got very real for us, it’s no longer ceremonial,” he says, adding that Citi expects the second quarter will be “key” in terms of customers awarding the banks clearing mandates.In the latest sign Robeco, a Dutch asset manager, this month said it had started clearing its derivatives through LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French clearer, saying it was “convinced that doing so will improve the mitigation of counterparty and systematic risk from bilateral collateral agreements”.One factor driving the trend is the realisation that capital requirements – both applied to banks and on the collateral that must be applied to non-clearable derivatives – are forcing asset managers and pension funds to think about clearing. The amount of capital that must be held against uncleared derivatives trades is set to go up under proposed new Basel rules on bank capital, enshrined in a legislative package known as CRD4.That said, considerable uncertainties remain. A big concern is how the myriad rules will be applied globally. Specifically there are worries over certain extraterritoriality provisions in Dodd-Frank and “third country provisions” in Emir.Banks, so-called buyside institutions, exchanges and clearing houses are concerned over requirements that financial services businesses in non-EU countries be recognised on the basis of their home country’s “equivalence” with EU regulations – as laid out in Emir and Mifid.Equally, it is unclear whether a non-EU bank would have to set up a branch in the EU if it wanted to become a member of a clearing house based in the region.There is also confusion over how financial institutions operating globally would comply with Dodd-Frank, Emir, Mifid and legislation in Asia.Davis Polk notes that although the CFTC’s proposed swap dealer registration rule had requested comment on the extraterritorial application of the swap entity registration requirements, the CFTC did not address this “critical issue” in its final rule recently. “This leaves many internationally active swap entities in a state of uncertainty regarding the implications of swap entity registration for their global operations,” Davis Polk says.In addition the CFTC has yet to finalise how SEFs will operate. Lee Olesky, chief executive of Tradeweb Markets, operator of electronic trading platforms for fixed income and derivatives, says: “End users need to be clear on which trading platforms they are able to trade swaps on, using which protocols, following the various implementation dates. At this stage, that is not the case.”Meanwhile efforts are underway to ensure that global regulators are co-ordinating their approaches. However, the industry remains sceptical.Rick McVey, chief executive of MarketAxess, a corporate and government bond trading platform that is, like Tradeweb, expected to register as an SEF, says: “We are still very interested in seeing consistency of rules between the US and Europe. But I don’t know if it’s feasible.”
495;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-21T02:24:11Z;Vision of buyside clearing fails to become reality;Many clients of the banks are still not ready for the ’big bang’ of central clearing;Even in the world of complex derivatives, it is worth remembering a hoary old business tenet: the customer comes first.Many arcane debates have raged around the core Dodd-Frank financial reform act principle that more derivatives trades should be centrally cleared, including whether smaller dealers should be allowed to participate in clearing.Yet it is easy to forget that dealers have already been centrally clearing trades among themselves for a few years.The same cannot be said for trades between banks and their clients, even as the final clearing rules near, with the beginning of the implementation phase expected later this year.Though in recent months CME Group and LCH.Clearnet have cleared a number of such trades, market participants say the landscape is still evolving, and many clients of the banks are still not ready for the “big bang”.Despite the law’s requirement of “fair and open access” to clearing, the initial vision of having asset managers, hedge funds and other institutions that trade risks related to commodity prices or interest rates with banks become direct clearing members has not come to fruition.Instead, buyside firms have chosen to operate through futures clearing merchants, or FCMs, as the law also allows. BlackRock’s recent trades cleared on LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear platform, for example, were via Goldman Sachs as FCM.The primary barrier, aside from the costs of new systems and the expense of contributing to clearing houses’ central funds, is that clearing houses typically ask that members step in to trades in the event of a default – a prospect now much more real after MF Global’s collapse. That requires the member to have a trading desk and agree to take that principal risk, which many institutions do not want to do.“If we were to take the current clearing house and regulatory requirements that exist today, for large asset managers that act as a fiduciary, direct membership doesn’t work,” says Supurna VedBrat, co-head of BlackRock’s market structure and electronic trading team.Clearing houses acknowledge this challenge. “We are talking to some on the buyside about whether they want to be members themselves,” says Michael Davie, chief executive of LCH’s SwapClear. “But I think that most will avail themselves of clearing services rather than provide them.”But that does not mean the buyside is leaving these choices up to dealers. As more standardised swaps begin to trade in electronic, transparent markets, with trades reported to a central marketplace, known as a swap execution facility, they are likely to rely far less on dealers.“Discussions among the buyside have been around how can we respond to regulation, and how can we derive business benefit,” says Ebbe Kjaersbo, chief business consultant at SimCorp, which provides back office services for fund managers.On cue, new firms are popping up to serve more agile fund managers. The custodian banks BNY Mellon and State Street, for example, have launched FCMs.“The traditional buyside/sellside dichotomy is breaking down,” says Charley Cooper, senior managing director at State Street Global Markets. “In the old days, you would clear with whom you were doing the trade with. Those things are now unbundling.”Clearing houses are also competing to have buyside clients direct their FCMs to send trades to one house or another with more streamlined processes for posting margin or expanded ranges of acceptable collateral.“It may be that when buyside clients clear through CME, it is a lot more capital efficient than another clearing house,” says Laurent Paulhac, managing director of OTC services at CME Group.Sanjay Kannambadi, chief executive at BNY Mellon Clearing, also cites concern about margin and collateral as an advantage that custodian banks may have over the incumbent dealers.“The main demand to start this business came from the client side,” he says. “These clients have assets with us already, and clearing is a natural extension, with efficiencies therein to help mobilise their collateral.”But there may be limits to how creative the buyside wants to be in chasing opportunities to take out costs and trade agressively.“I cannot emphasise how important it is that clients are comfortable that collateral is protected,” says Ms VedBrat of BlackRock. Or as Mr Paulhac puts it: “The buyside is not seeking to compete. Their aim is to reduce risk.”
496;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;ELX names new chief to continue CME battle;;ELX, the upstart Treasury futures exchange struggling to gain traction against its dominant rival, CME Group, has named a new chief in the wake of the resignation of its founding top executive.Neal Wolkoff, the chief executive who oversaw ELX’s founding in 2008, said he was resigning as of April 30. ELX was founded by a group of banks and trading firms as a competitor with the incumbent US futures exchange.“At this point, I am ready for new challenges and opportunities,” he said in a statement.A new chief executive, Richard Jaycobs, was also named on Friday. Mr Jaycobs was previously president of the Cantor Exchange, a web-based futures trading exchange that is still in development. It was founded by Cantor Fitzgerald, which provides the eSpeed platform that powers ELX.The moves come as CME’s dominance appears set to continue, with European regulators appearing likely to block the merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, which would have created a European counterpart to the CME by combining Eurex and Liffe.The Chicago Board of Trade, a unit of CME Group, trades 98 per cent of all US Treasury futures, according to Equity Research Desk. ELX’s share was 0.7 per cent in December, down 10 basis points from November.ELX’s founders, a group of large banks and proprietary trading firms, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Getco, have aimed to create a market for electronic interest rate futures, serving primarily high-speed traders.“I am excited about the challenge and opportunity to continue offering futures market participants a compelling fee structure, superior services and robust technology,” said Mr Jaycobs in a statement.Two years ago, ELX won an apparent victory, gaining regulatory approval of an “exchange of futures for”, which would allow traders to swap existing futures positions on the CME for contracts on the ELX. But CME has refused to allow such trades and, last June, the Commmodity Futures Trading Commission said it could not force CME to accept them.Banks have recently begun unveiling algorithms for futures markets that may make it easier for traders to target liquidity across markets. ELX said it set a record in the third quarter, with 15m total contracts traded.However, competing against the CME has proved extremely difficult. An earlier effort by Eurex US, co-owned by Deutsche Börse, failed to gain traction.A launch last year by NYSE Liffe US, part of NYSE Euronext, has picked up steam, though it is still quite small. Its share of Treasury futures in December was 1.1 per cent, a rise of 40bp from November, according to Equity Research Desk.
497;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;HKEx targets commodities trading;;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) has signalled its ambition to break into the commodities markets in a move that would pit it against heavyweight incumbents CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE).The move comes as there is increasing interest globally in the HKEx’s plans to expand beyond its core business of initial public offerings, equities and expansion into renminbi-related services.The exchange is the world’s largest by the market capitalisation of the exchange as a listed entity, ahead of CME Group and BM&FBovespa, the Brazilian bourse operator. It also has a strong balance sheet, potentially making it a player in global exchange consolidation.HKEx has consistently played down expectations that it may be preparing to go on the acquisition trail, or to make bold moves into new business lines.However Charles Li, HKEx chief executive, said in Hong Kong on Thursday that HKEx “had the opportunity to lead Hong Kong in to new asset classes”. Commodities was next on HKEx’s list.Mr Li said that China’s influence and relevance in commodities was larger than it had been and the country needed access to financial and commodity derivatives markets in renminbi and in the Asian time zone.He said moving into commodities was “an extension of [the] Hong Kong value proposition ‘China meets international’ to new asset classes”, but acknowledged that this was a “globally competitive sector”.On Friday CME and Mysteel, a Chinese company providing market data in ferrous metals, said they had agreed to develop risk management products for the ferrous industry based on Mysteel’s data services. The products would be listed by Nymex, owned by CME Group, and cleared through CME’s clearing house.Mr Li said: “Although commodities may prove to be the most difficult, the opportunity is also the greatest.”
498;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-17T21:30:08Z;KPMG defends efforts on MF Global claims;;Winding-up collapsed US brokerage MF Global has thrust the UK’s Financial Services Authority’s new rules under the spotlight but critics argue the new regime is not working, damaging London’s reputation.However, Richard Heis, joint special administrator of MF Global UK, has defended KPMG’s efforts saying: “The wider point is that London is an international trading centre dealing with 60 exchanges all over the world. It’s going to be a lot more complex to try to resolve it.”He also pointed to a $550m guarantee from CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, to US customers as a critical difference which allowed US trustees to pay out earlier.The biggest issue for KPMG, he says, is determining which clients have money in MF Global UK’s segregated funds. Those with non-segregated funds have been put into the unsecured creditors’ pool and, he says, the issue was complicated by many customers looking to switch the status of their accounts in the final few days.“It’s one thing for the company to have sent an email confirming it …but the cash needs to be segregated. Segregation only works if the banks acknowledge that those funds are held as segregated,” he says. “That is the conventional wisdom, although the point is currently awaiting the verdict of the Supreme Court in Lehman.” The categorisation of claims is the main issue, he adds.A pressure group established on Tuesday called MFGlobalUKClients, representing hundreds of customers of the UK arm, says the distinction is critical. “Under the new rules client monies are being used to pay for secured creditors,” it says.Clive Roberts, a fund manager at Alecto Financial, says he has millions of pounds of both his own and clients’ money tied up in accounts at MF Global – much of it in non-segregated accounts. “They are classifying non-segregated clients as creditors to the company, which is totally unacceptable,” he says. “If I put money into an account, I shouldn’t be a creditor in the same way as the landlord or the coffee supplier.”The main call on funds has come from James Giddens, the trustee of the US business and also MF Global UK’s largest creditor. It is claiming $744m in client balances. In a messy situation, KPMG wants $250m from the US estate. “The question is whether they’re claiming into the client money pool, the segregated funds, and it is our view that it is not a claim against the segregated pool, it is a claim against the unsecured estate,” says Mr Heis.Others have charged that KPMG has lacked experience in dealing with derivative products. Some positions were kept open and liquidated by exchanges and clearing houses, meaning the positions could not be marked-to-market at the point of MF Global’s collapse. Mr Heis acknowledges valuation issues may have to be settled legally.Additional reporting by Simon Mundy
499;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-15T22:30:49Z;D Börse and NYSE Euronext warn EU;;Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext have thrown down the gauntlet to the European Commission members who will decide on their faltering merger plans, warning that the EU would be acting against its own interest in better global regulation if it were to block the deal.In a letter to Jose Manuel Barroso, the Commission’s president, the chief executives and chairmen of the two companies cast their proposed tie-up in strongly pro-European terms, saying it would help global financial market reform as well as economic growth regionwide.Reto Francioni, chief executive of Deutsche Börse, and Duncan Niederauer, his counterpart at NYSE Euronext, said their exchanges had already proved “a bridgehead of integrity and transparency against a tidal wave of opacity and greed that permeates the less-regulated segments of financial markets”.To prohibit the merger would also prevent the formation of a European exchange industry heavyweight, the executives said.Their plea for the merger follows indications that Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner, has recommended that the deal be blocked because of concerns about a combined group’s market dominance in derivatives.A final decision is expected to be taken this month by Mr Almunia’s colleagues in the EU’s 27-strong “college of commissioners”, which is almost certain to accept the advice of competition officials. The companies’ letter to Mr Barroso, seen by the Financial Times, was also sent to each commissioner.In the letter Mr Niederauer and Mr Francioni said they had “gone as far as we can” in trying to address EU competition concerns. Officials’ demands that the group sell a derivatives business such as Liffe, the London-based exchange owned by NYSE Euronext “simply will not be accepted by our shareholders or our boards”, the executives warn.By uniting Liffe and Eurex, the Deutsche Börse subsidiary, the companies would handle more than 95 per cent of European trading in benchmark short-term interest rate and German government bond futures.Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext say competition would still exist because of the large over-the-counter derivatives market and because of strong global rivals such as CME, the world’s largest derivatives exchange.But the companies’ letter is more striking for its invocation of EU concerns about global regulatory standards. Mr Niederauer and Mr Francioni say their new company “would accelerate the integration of Europe’s capital markets”, and “serve as the vanguard” for the implementation of EU and G20 regulatory reforms.“Approving our combination would create a transparent and regulated transatlantic marketplace with a strong European core that would function as a global standard setter,” they write. “However, if this combination is prohibited …the global consolidation of exchanges might very well shift the balance towards countries favouring “light touch” regulation, which would severely endanger the European Commission’s agenda.”Mr Francioni and Mr Niederauer offered “personal firm commitment to continue to support the Commission in its endeavour to establish and [to] enforce internationally harmonised regulatory standards for the world’s financial markets”.If the merger were prohibited, they said, Europe would miss “once in a generation” efficiencies while it would also “prevent the formation of a European competitor on par with US and rising Asian counterparts in the increasingly fierce competition in global financial markets”.A decisive intervention by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is most likely to sway political opinion in Brussels in favour of clearing the deal, perhaps with some extra concessions. However, at this late stage of the process, such a turnaround is highly unlikely and would leave Mr Almunia’s credibility severely damaged.
500;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;LME chief rebuffs calls on trading fee rise;;The chief executive of the London Metal Exchange has rebuffed calls from some of the metals industry’s most senior figures to reconsider a sharp increase in trading fees.In an unusual bout of public dissent, three of the exchange’s 12 directors last week wrote to members attacking the increase in fees, which was agreed at a board meeting last month.The 135-year-old LME, the global centre for metals trading, which is currently owned by its members, is preparing for a possible takeover with preliminary bids due in mid-February. Critics argue that the fee increase – which will more than double the cost of some trades – will knock trading volumes and should have been delayed until after the sales process.However, Martin Abbott, LME chief executive, said on Thursday that the decision to increase fees would stand. “The decision was taken by the board in a normal and formal board process by a large majority. There is no provision for a revision of that decision.”The rise in fees will increase the LME’s profitability, giving both shareholders and potential bidders a clearer idea of its value. In a boost for the exchange, Mr Abbott announced that trading volumes rose 21.9 per cent to a record 146.6m lots in 2011, with a notional value of $15.4tn.“2011 was a superb year for the exchange, probably the best year in its history,” he said.Many of the LME’s members and shareholders are concerned that the change in fees will hurt their businesses just as the brokerage industry attempts to recover from the shock collapse of MF Global.The fee increase, which comes into effect in March, will vary for different types of trade. The overall cost of a trade involving non-members of the LME with unsegregated accounts, for example, would more than double from 32p to 75p a contract, according to the LME.Nonetheless, that remains lower than competing contracts, such as the copper futures contracts listed by CME Group of the US or the Shanghai Futures Exchange, according to Mr Abbott.The increase in fees equates to roughly 2p a tonne for a lot of copper, which is currently trading at $8,000 a tonne.“I don’t think that the new trading fee will have any impact on volumes,” Mr Abbott said. “Anyone whose business model is threatened for the sake of 2p per tonne might well want to review their own business model.”He said the increase was necessary to allow the LME to invest in clearing and infrastructure.The exchange already has a “very healthy number” of suitors after starting to send out information over Christmas, he said.Some shareholders argue that if it were acquired by another exchange which already owns a clearing house, such as CME Group, the Singapore Exchange or ICE, less investment would be needed. “We believe that it would be appropriate to set aside any decision to raise fees until such time as the membership has had an opportunity to vote on its future,” the three directors wrote.Mr Abbott also rejected suggestions that he had a personal interest in seeing the LME sold: “My long term financial interest is best suited by remaining chief executive of the LME.”Under a long-term incentive scheme, he stands to receive a large pay-out if the LME is sold for anything close to its mooted valuation of £1bn.
501;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-11T20:05:34Z;Boardroom rebels test mettle of LME’s ringmaster;;Unbecoming behaviour is a matter of degree at the London Metal Exchange, the 135-year-old trading venue in Leadenhall Street. An outcry dealer risks a reprimand if, when jumping up, he fails to keep a heel pressed against the trading ring’s red leather bench. Similarly, a push to increase fees by hard-headed chief executive Martin Abbott has triggered censure from three of the board’s 12 directors.The spat, embodied in an indignant letter from the trio, comes as the non-ferrous metals forum toys with selling itself for a rumoured price of more than £1bn. The 93 member businesses that own the exchange would share the proceeds. But they would also forfeit the right to set fees low and to restrict admittance.The LME’s anachronistic status as a members’ club has so far done nothing to restrict growth supercharged by the industrialisation of China, India and Brazil. But the exchange, which handles the bulk of international futures dealing in metals such as copper, aluminium and nickel, could now do with extra capital. Its systems are creaking and tougher regulation could increase the burden.Mr Abbott is also in the process of installing in-house clearing. But boardroom rebels question this cost. Likely acquirers, such as the Singapore Exchange, the CME Group and ICE, have their own clearing facilities. And while the proposed charge of 50p a lot looks modest, objectors say that the complexity of LME futures contracts, which expire daily rather than monthly, increases the frequency with which they need to trade.Mr Abbott is not for turning at present. He thus risks alienating members whose support he will need to sell the historic exchange advantageously.UKFI unspunReports of the death of UK Financial Investments, steward of the government’s stakes in banks, were exaggerated. That is the implication of a Governance Code-defying game of musical chairmanship in which chief executive Robin Budenberg takes on the role of board boss vacated by Sir David Cooksey.Critics question the usefulness of the body, given that depressed prices for shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds rule out privatisations soon. But this ignores the political utility of UKFI as a buffer between the banks and government. Without it, George Osborne would moreover have no one to ignore when he needs independent advice that smaller balance sheets and greater lending are mutually exclusive.Animosity towards UKFI is partly the result of the belief, inspired by mendacious spinning in Westminster, that it lost money on the sale of the retail arm of Northern Rock last year. The outcome is unknowable until the windup of the Geordie bank’s “bad” mortgage book in a decade or so. The last government propped Northern Rock up with £1.4bn in equity and £23bn in debt that is being repaid. Taxpayers will get a payback of between £750m and £1bn from the sale to Virgin Money. They stand to realise a further gain of £1bn a few years down the line from cheap loan buy-backs already executed by UKFI, assuming mortgage default rates are stable.Boutique, by GeorgeThe latest City venture to feature veteran merchant banker Lord George Magan, a boutique investment bank called Heritage Capital, has brave timing. Securities trading and takeovers are at a low ebb. However, Lord Magan has winning form. He set up the M&A boutique J.O. Hambro Magan just after a market slump in 1988. He sold it 10 years later, when, he says “the moon was high and the going was good”. NatWest bought the company for a rumoured £100m.Chairman Magan lends credibility to the aims of Heritage Capital’s chief executive, Joe Dryer, who recently participated in the buy-out of the 30-person firm from Banque Heritage, a Swiss private bank. He plans to grab some of the business and talent dislodged from the deal-doing divisions of universal banks as they contract. Now 66, Lord Magan cheerfully recalls “starting in the City at 18 as a snivelling articled clerk”.Littler ChefLittle Chef, a guilty pleasure for some business drivers, is closing 67 of its 161 restaurants.

502;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-11T19:27:55Z;Fairer future for exchanges;EU authorities right to block giant derivatives tie-up;A moment may have been reached with the decision of Europe’s competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, to block the proposed tie-up between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext.The two groups have failed to persuade Mr Almunia that Europe needs its own champion as a counterweight to the US derivatives giant, CME Group. In spite of their frantic lobbying, and the offering of escalating concessions to address the many competition concerns, the commissioner has stood firm. The battle may not be over. The full European Commission has to decide whether to accept Mr Almunia’s advice. But the likelihood of it clearing the deal in the face of his submission must be seen as slim.This seems the right result. While there is a case for creating a pan-European exchange, it was always clear that safeguards would be needed to make any deal palatable to users as well as providers.The concessions offered by DB and NYSE did not fit the bill, focusing on side-issues, such as cutting the combined group’s market share in equity derivatives, while skirting round its highly profitable core. Yet this was where the biggest problem lay. DB/NYSE would, have ended up with 95 per cent of trading in benchmark short-term interest-rate and German government bond futures.A case can be made that DB and NYSE do not compete in these contracts – so the deal would not have reduced market choice. It is in the nature of derivative markets for exchanges to monopolise certain products, reflecting investors’ preference for liquidity.But this belies the importance of potential as well as actual competition in restraining unreasonable pricing. A way to draw the sting might have been for DB/NYSE to to clear competing products from rival exchanges. Indeed this would have accelerated the fulfilment of an EU objective to open up derivatives clearing, thus reducing the cost for customers by cutting the aggregate amount of collateral placed against trades. But while the partners offered to clear some outside products, these did not include interest rate derivatives.The exchanges will argue that by blocking the deal, the authorities have left them to fight CME with one arm tied behind their back. The EU’s new regulatory framework will make it easier for the US group to compete in Europe, without any reciprocal requirement to open up its own turf. This is indeed a problem for policymakers to puzzle. But it should not be solved at the customers’ expense.
503;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-11T19:12:54Z;Q&A: Is Europe right to block NYSE-D Börse?;;Q. Why are these two exchanges trying to merge – aren’t exchanges big enough these days?A. Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext have argued that creating the world’s largest exchange for derivatives trading and company listings will give them “global scale” at a time when trading activity is increasingly global. Customers will save money through eliminating overlapping operations, they claim. But critics argue that all they are doing is getting bigger for the sake of getting bigger, at a time when exchanges face tough competition from banks and off-exchange markets.Q. So is size why the European Commission antitrust authorities are to block the deal?A. Yes and no. The combination of the two would involve merging the Börse’s Eurex derivatives exchange with Liffe, the former London International Financial Futures Exchange, the derivatives exchange operated out of the UK by NYSE Euronext. That would create a business with more than 95 per cent market share in the most widely used financial futures products in Europe. Brussels is less concerned about the dominant market share than the removal of competition it believes exists between Eurex and Liffe that would result. Watching in the wings is the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq OMX, which want to compete against both in futures. They argue that the merged group’s clearing house is a closed shop and regulators also need to force that open to facilitate competition.Q. Seems fair enough . . .A. Except that Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext argue that Eurex and Liffe don’t actually compete, since Liffe’s biggest product is euribor futures – at the short end of the interest rate yield curve – and Eurex’s are Bund, Bobl and Schatz German government bond futures at the long end. But their biggest beef with the commission is that it has limited its definition of the market to Europe. The exchanges insist the derivatives market is global and that the merged entity would still face stiff competition from the CME Group, the dominant US futures exchange – and that the deal should be approved in the interest of creating a “European champion” as a counterweight to the CME.Q. Who is right?That’s a tough one. Euribor and German bond futures contracts are mostly traded in the European time zone by European traders. But many of them may be US or Asia-based so it’s hard to define. More importantly, Liffe competes for customers against the CME, whose biggest product is eurodollar futures – a similar product to euribor at the short end of the interest rate curve but denominated in dollars. CME also recently launched a rival euribor contract out of the US, directly aimed at would-be Liffe customers. So there is clear evidence of global competition too.Q. Why has Brussels taken this stance?A. Probably because there is a general regulatory thrust emerging in Europe to force more competition into exchange-traded futures – a big move. Brussels is also pushing for such a change in new market regulations prompted in part by the Group of 20 commitments to clean up the global financial system. A big part of those reforms would require exchanges that own clearing houses to loosen their grip on futures markets – making it easier for the LSE and Nasdaq to offer rival products.Q. What happens next?A. Politics. The two exchanges are lobbying to convince European Union commissioners, national regulators and politicians that the market is global and the antitrust recommendation should be overruled. Expect lobbying to reach high gear at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The commissioners meet and decide on February 1. It may come down to a phone call to Brussels from Angela Merkel, German chancellor.
504;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-11T18:34:17Z;D Börse and NYSE stung by EU rejection;;A keen beekeeper, Duncan Niederauer was relieved recently to find that his hive had survived a particularly bitter winter in upstate New York.But when the chief executive of NYSE Euronext met his counterpart at Deutsche Börse, Reto Francioni, in New York on Wednesday, there was less good news from his day job.The two men’s grand plan to create the world’s largest exchange have been turned upside down after Europe’s antitrust authorities decided to block it.The deal, unveiled almost a year ago, is not dead. But the two men and their staff face an uphill task as they frantically lobby European Union politicians, national regulators and – crucially – EU commissioners that the antitrust decision should be overruled.Overriding the judgment of competition officials, particularly at this late stage, will be a rare feat. Historically, the EU competition commissioner and his staff are treated with respect, even deference, within the college of commissioners.While there are critics of the tough line taken by Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner, convincing someone to lead the charge in favour of the merger will be difficult, if not impossible.“Many people do not realise that this is the most fiercely independent unit within the Commission. If you start to lobby against DG Competition [the antitrust unit of Brussels], it can easily backfire,” says Karel Lannoo of the Centre for European Policy Studies.Yet the two exchange chief executives will hope to gain some traction by arguing that, in assessing whether combining the groups’ derivatives platforms – Eurex and Liffe – would reduce competition in exchange-traded derivatives, Brussels wrongly restricted its definition of the market to Europe.The groups argue that, even when combined, Eurex and Liffe would still face competition from CME Group, the largest US futures exchange operator, and also from fast-growing Asian exchanges.But the vision of a European champion in exchanges held no sway with competition officials, who are inclined to narrow the market definition as far as the evidence will permit.Undeterred, Mr Niederauer said in a staff video on Wednesday that there were “serious flaws” in the European Commission antitrust team’s arguments, pledging to “continue to press our case directly with various commissioners in the EU”.Eurex and Liffe do compete on equity options. But on the biggest products that each offers, interest rate and government bond futures, there is little overlap. Liffe’s flagship euribor interest rate contract is at the short end of the interest rate yield curve, while Eurex’s German bond futures operate at the long end.Moreover, users of derivatives acknowledge that there is a growing global element to the way they are traded.Deregulation is increasing competition among exchanges, leading many to seek mergers and acquisitions as a way of increasing scaleAnthony Belchambers, chief executive of the Futures and Options Association, which represents the biggest customers of the exchanges, says: “More and more regional or domestic contracts are being traded by an international client base.”Meanwhile, investors have started to question whether the deal still makes sense at all given that conditions in the eurozone – where the bulk of the merged exchange’s business would be based – have deteriorated since the deal was announced.“After a period of thinking this would make a lot of sense, that changed since the situation worsened in Europe,” says Georges Ugeux, chairman of Galileo Global Advisors, a boutique advisory firm.That may have given pause to either of the exchange chief executives as they assess the merits of pursuing the deal to the Brussels finish line. Yet the merger agreement carries a “break fee” where any party withdrawing has to pay the other €250m. Neither Mr Francioni nor Mr Niederauer are likely to want to be stung for that.
505;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;LME faces revolt over fee increase;;The chief executive of the London Metal Exchange faces a revolt from some of the most senior figures in the metals industry after he pushed through a sharp increase in trading fees last month.The rare public dispute at the 135-year-old LME, a clubby institution where disagreements and scandals are usually kept under wraps, highlights growing caution among the exchange’s member-shareholders about a possible sale, which could be facilitated by the fee increase.In a strongly worded letter to fellow members seen by the Financial Times, three of the LME’s 12 directors attacked the decision to raise fees and urged others to write to Sir Brian Bender, the chairman of the exchange, the centre for global metals trading.The fee increase was designed to maximise the LME’s profitability ahead of a potential takeover bid and also to allow it to invest in new technology, but has angered many banks and brokers who believe that trading volumes will fall.Under the decision announced in December, fees for many trades would more than double, according to the LME.The exchange is owned by its users, and therefore has traditionally sought to minimise costs to them rather than maximise profits. In September, however, it said it had received expressions of interest from more than 10 potential suitors, with first round bids due by the end of February.The three executives, who represent Category 1 members – the core members of the exchange authorised to trade on its open outcry ring – on the LME’s board, said that they disputed the decision to raise fees.“As elected Category 1 directors we are writing to advise you that we do not support the proposed decision to raise the fees,” wrote Michael Overlander, chief executive of Sucden Financial, James Land, managing director of Amalgamated Metal Trading, and Gavin Prentice, managing director of Marex Spectron.The LME’s board may be forced to reconsider the fee increase if the three dissenting directors are able to muster support from the membership.“There has been a fair amount of feedback,” one director said.Announcing the increase in trading fees last month, Martin Abbott, LME chief executive, said: “Shareholders will be asked to consider the value of the business at some point in 2012, and it is important that they are able to compare incoming bids with the true value of the business.”In their letter, the three directors argued that any move to increase fees should be postponed until after any decision on a sale. Some shareholders believe a fee increase is inevitable if the LME is to remain independent, but not if it is sold to a company that already owns a clearing house, such as the Singapore Exchange, CME Group or ICE.The head of a top-10 shareholder added there had been increased doubts over Mr Abbott as chief executive in the wake of the fee increase.“The membership is becoming less confident in Martin as the CEO,” he said.The LME said that fee increases were “a matter for the board and are discussed every year”.
506;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-10T23:33:15Z;Europe set to block DB-NYSE tie-up;;European competition officials have recommended blocking the tie-up between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, the German and US exchange operators, setting in motion what could be weeks of frantic lobbying to salvage the deal.Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner, has told the merger parties that he plans to prohibit the bid to create the world’s biggest exchange group by listings unless they are willing to sell one of the groups’ main derivatives businesses – a step executives refuse to take.The antitrust decision is a serious blow to the chances of the German and US groups being able to complete the deal, and highlights how competition concerns have helped scupper a year-long wave of attempted exchange consolidation.Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse chief executive, and Duncan Niederauer, the NYSE Euronext head, will discuss the future of the deal at a previously scheduled meeting on Wednesday, people familiar with their plans said. The exchanges do not plan to offer additional concessions, these people said.The NYSE said in statement it looked forward to “pressing the case for this compelling transaction” before the entire European Commission, which is scheduled to rule on the deal by February 9.Mr Almunia’s case team has drafted an official recommendation to disallow the deal because it would create a dominant player in European exchange-traded derivatives markets, stifling competition from potential new entrants, according to two people involved in the process.A combination of the German and US groups would unite their two European futures exchanges, Eurex and Liffe, handing the combined entity more than 95 per cent of trading in benchmark short-term interest rate and German government bond futures.Mr Almunia’s staff rejected arguments by Deutsche Börse and NYSE that the market for exchange-traded derivatives was global and the merged group would still face competition from CME Group in the US. They also refused to agree that off-exchange or over-the-counter derivatives competed against exchanges.The draft decision has been sent to other Brussels departments for their comments before being submitted to a committee of competition experts from European Union member states, who can offer non-binding advice on the judgment.There is still a slim possibility of the recommendation being overturned if the exchanges marshal enough political backing for the deal – particularly from Angela Merkel, the German chancellor – to sway opinion in Brussels.Investors sent NYSE shares up 4.6 per cent to $27.79 in New York as news of the decision by Brussels emerged, while Deutsche Börse’s shares closed up 4.9 per cent at €42.Deutsche Börse said the two groups had not yet received any decision from the European Commission regarding their requested merger. A spokesperson for Mr Almunia declined to comment.
507;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-10T21:52:42Z;Quick View: Bulking up – is it worth it any more?;Are we in a global marketplace or aren’t we?;"The biggest exchange merger ever attempted looks like it’s hitting the buffers.Europe’s antitrust authorities have blocked the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext deal, our sources tell us.They argue that the combination of the two groups’ derivatives exchanges Eurex and Liffe, would snuff out competition in European derivatives. They have suggested that the two groups divest a derivatives business – probably Liffe. But that would kill the rationale for the whole deal since derivatives is the most lucrative part of an exchange’s business.Brussels dug its heels in, in spite of two sets of concessions offered by the two groups designed to alleviate competition officials’ concerns.Those focused on the combined group allowing rivals access to its German clearing house – in other words, prising opening the “vertical silo” of an exchange owning a clearing house, this controlling the “food chain” from trading to post-trade.This is not over yet. Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext will now lobby at the political level hard to persuade the EU’s commissioners to wave the deal through nonetheless.And this is much more politicised than many other previous antitrust cases, given the sector involved – financial services – the eurozone crisis and the febrile atmosphere in European capitals over a possible financial transactions tax.Whatever the outcome, there are two key takeaways.First, it sends a strong signal that the days when exchanges could bulk up to get bigger may be over. Regulators have had enough, after a decade or more of mergers that have created giant exchanges with increasing grip on key markets like derivatives. They seem to want more competition, and less concentration.Second, Brussels antitrust staff decided that for the purposes of making its antitrust decision the focus is Europe, not the global market for exchange-traded derivatives.They ignored compelling arguments by the Börse and NYSE that the combined Eurex and Liffe would still compete on the global stage for customers with the likes of CME Group, the big US futures exchange.But by setting the market definition as Europe, Brussels has arguably shot Europe in the foot.Ignoring the presence of the CME, operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, is like saying that BMW doesn’t compete with Toyota and only battles Mercedes for the European luxury car driver. It makes no sense. Any carmaker will tell you they compete in a global market; the same goes for futures – all the more so since trading takes place 24/7 and respects no geographical boundaries.Moreover, if Brussels wants to ensure there is more competition in futures trading and clearing, blocking DB/NYSE on the grounds that it would stifle competition in Europe is an odd way to go about it.We will have to see what the actual recommendation says on this, but the way to ensure competition would be to break open the silo – something that doesn’t seem to have been the focus on the antitrust case team after all.As it is – and assuming DB/NYSE fail to win round enough EU commisisoners to overturn the antitrust decision – NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse stay as standalone businesses. The Börse silo remains intact and it is just as hard as ever for the London Stock Exchange to try and compete against Liffe and Eurex in futures contracts as it is today.All that’s left to force a market structure change are new European regulations known as “Mifid” and “Emir” – together making Europe’s equivalent of the Dodd-Frank act in the US. They propose to force clearing houses to open up to competitors. But they are a long way from being implemented.This whole business underscores the big lesson: exchange mergers just aren’t worth it."
508;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-10T09:09:31Z;NYSE’s Lukken set to head futures association;;Walter Lukken, chief executive of New York Portfolio Clearing, a US clearing house partly run by NYSE Euronext, was on Tuesday appointed next president of the US Futures Industry Association, many of whose members have been engulfed in the debacle surrounding collapsed futures broker MF Global, the FIA said.The FIA is the trade association for banks and brokers in exchange-traded futures markets, but last year expanded its role to include work on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives as the futures regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), scrambles to finalise rules on how to implement the Dodd-Frank act. That requires more transparent trading of OTC derivatives and that they be as far as possible cleared through clearing houses.Mr Lukken is also a former acting chairman of the CFTC under the former Bush administration.He will replace John Damgard, a Nixon-era Washington veteran who has represented the FIA since 1982.The FIA board convened on Monday and will continue meeting on Tuesday in New York, to discuss the collapse of MF Global as well as the FIA’s agenda for this year. It agreed Mr Lukken’s appointment late on Monday.Michael Dawley, chairman of the FIA and co-head of futures and derivatives clearing services at Goldman, Sachs, said: “Walt is a tremendously talented individual with extraordinary experience and industry knowledge, and we are very fortunate to have someone of his calibre to lead the FIA at this important moment in its history.”Mr Lukken is expected to start work on February 20.Mr Damgard, 70, was to have retired about a year ago but decided to continue for another year as the FIA grappled with an increased workload resulting from a wave of new rules being produced by the CFTC as it fleshes out how to apply the Dodd-Frank act.Mr Damgard, a Republican, is widely respected in Washington and has overseen the FIA at a time of unprecedented growth in exchange-traded futures.Mr Lukken, also a Republican, is seen by the industry as a relatively bipartisan figure with a detailed understanding of derivatives trading and clearing. He won praise while at the CFTC for his measured handling of the fallout from alleged “excessive speculation” in over-the-counter energy derivatives by hedge fund Amaranth, during which the CFTC came under fire at congressional hearings.A native of Indiana, Mr Lukken also spent five years as a senior staff member at the Senate agriculture committee when it was chaired by Indiana Republican Richard Lugar.Mr Lukken said: “John Damgard has provided tremendous leadership for nearly thirty years to these markets, and I hope to continue to offer a steady hand and confront the challenges that lie ahead.”The succession at the top of the FIA comes at a time when Republican pressure has been increasing in Congress to water down aspects of the Dodd-Frank act.NYPC is a joint venture derivatives clearing house owned equally by NYSE Euronext and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), and clears interest rate futures contracts. It is a key part of the two groups’ attempt, launched in late 2010, to compete against the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s dominant interest rate futures contracts.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

That would be a fast-track alternative to a proposal by the European Commission in September for an EU-wide tax, which is opposed by Britain.Those fears are greatest since the City of London is home to more exchanges and clearing houses than any other European capital.Until recently investor attention was focused on the ongoing merger and acquisition frenzy involving the London Stock Exchange’s exclusive talks with LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearer, and a likely bidding war between some of the world’s big exchanges for the London Metal Exchange.But plans being hatched to try and impose the transactions tax mean they may also have to pay attention to the possibly debilitating effects of a tax, if politicians manage to find a mechanism to apply it. Exchanges have expressed opposition, since it would discourage trading, thus reducing volumes and hence reducing trading fee revenues.Deutsche Börse has said it also “harbours the risk of market participants shifting trades to the least regulated markets in the world”.Brussels has proposed a 0.1 per cent tax on equity and bond transactions and 0.01 per cent on derivatives, which it claims would harvest €55bn. LCH.Clearnet and other clearers in London operated by CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange of the US were already anxious about a European Central Bank policy that clearing houses outside the eurozone and with a certain amount of euro-denominated business relocate to the eurozone.LCH.Clearnet acts as a clearer of euribor futures, one of the largest – and euro-denominated – derivatives contracts traded on Liffe, the futures arm of US-based NYSE Euronext.Any move to force parts of LCH.Clearnet’s business to the eurozone – whether to comply with the ECB policy or as part of measures to apply a eurozone transactions tax – would “distort the markets” at a time when clearing houses and market participants are trying to focus on implementing G20 reforms of the derivatives markets, according to Barney Reynolds, head of the financial regulatory group in the London offices of Shearman & Sterling, a US law firm. “The G20 agenda was to make the world’s markets safer by pushing more into clearing. Forcing changes to location and practices for tax purposes would distort the mar­kets and cut across the systemic risk agenda,” he says.Eurozone officials have yet to explain exactly how a eurozone tax might be levied. UK-based market infrastructures take some comfort from the idea that if a tax were applied using the residency of the entity making a trade, the move might actually benefit London by encouraging eurozone-based financial groups to find legal loopholes and move operations to London to escape the levy through complex legal structures.One suggestion is collecting it through post-trade business such as clearers and settlement systems, where the final swapping assets for cash takes place after a trade is done.Some also suggest that trade repositories being set up as part of the G20 reforms and which collect data on derivatives trades could also be used. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US-based settlement system, has been busy in recent months setting up operations in London.Some clearing houses and exchanges are analysing whether they might turn any tax to their advantage by collecting it and charging a fee. Deutsche Börse’s Clearstream settlement and custody system collects fees on behalf of the German government, while LCH.Clearnet collects trading fees for Liffe.But the revenues from such a service would not make up for the loss of revenues caused by lower trading volumes in the event of a transaction tax being levied – especially with analysts downgrading their volume forecasts for this year because of expectations of lower market volatility.Additional reporting by Alex Barker
512;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-09T15:28:58Z;LME’s steel plans tarnished by MF Global;;The collapse of MF Global has dealt a hefty blow to the London Metal Exchange’s aspirations to create a benchmark futures contract for the $500bn-a-year steel market.Trading volumes in the LME’s steel billet contract, which was launched in 2008, fell by more than half in November and December following MF Global’s bankruptcy at the end of October.The number of contracts outstanding, or “open interest” – an indication of traders’ commitment to the market – has dropped by 63 per cent since the summer to the lowest since January 2010.MF Global was one of the top brokers on the LME and a prominent dealer in the steel contract.Steel is the largest commodities market by value after oil but steel derivatives trading is still in its infancy. Commodities exchanges have been racing to launch derivatives contracts linked to the steel market, as well as related commodities such as iron ore, coking coal and steel scrap, as they seek to profit from a growing desire among steelmakers and users to hedge their costs.The setback for the LME steel contract comes at an awkward time for the 135-year-old exchange as it prepares to become the centre of a global bidding war, after announcing last year that it had received expressions of interest from more than 10 suitors.Several of the leading candidates to buy the LME, including the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and CME Group, have also launched derivatives contracts linked to the steel market, a factor that could make them more attractive to the LME’s shareholder-members. First round bids are due next month.Robert Montefusco, a broker at Sucden Financial, one of 12 dealers on the LME’s open outcry ring, said that the LME steel contract was “losing a bit of traction”, echoing a widely-held view in the industry.Steel users increasingly prefer to hedge their costs using contracts based on the price of iron ore, one of the main ingredients in steelmaking, rather than steel, he added.The SGX iron ore swap is the most liquid global ferrous metals contract, traders say, with open interest more than quintupling over the course of 2011 and volume also rising sharply. The CME’s steel contract, though much smaller, has also seen a pick-up in trading and the exchange is planning to launch other related contracts this year.MF Global’s collapse dealt a double blow to the LME steel contract, since at the time of its demise the brokerage was holding contracts for 17,810 tonnes of steel, about a third of the steel held in LME-registered warehouses, on behalf of Stemcor, a trader. In November the LME suspended the contracts, a move that traders say has dented confidence in the market.The LME said that it remained “well positioned to build on the early successes of the billet contract”.
513;CME;CME Group Inc;2012-01-08T21:34:14Z;US regulators eye new futures rules;;US financial regulators have raised the idea of extending investor safeguards proposed for certain derivatives to the futures markets as they probe missing customer funds at bankrupt broker MF Global.Investors in cleared swaps – a form of derivatives contract negotiated between two traders where the risk of one party defaulting is shifted to a clearing house – are set to receive stronger protection than futures traders in a vote by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Wednesday.But two commissioners on the five-member body are now questioning the fairness of that approach and are opening the debate as to whether the same rules should apply to both swaps and futures, a move likely to provoke a backlash from the industry.The issue has gained increase relevance after $1.2bn in funds of futures customers vanished in the wake of MF Global’s collapse in October.Jill Sommers, the CFTC commissioner leading the investigation into the MF Global’s missing funds, told the Financial Times she was concerned about having different rules for the two types of investor: “Last year at this time I was concerned about whatever we were doing for swaps bleeding into futures, and the costs that would be associated with that for futures”.Ms Sommers, a Republican, said her concerns had now shifted “180 degrees – that we’re doing something for swaps that we’re not doing for futures.” She added: “How can we justify adding protections for swap customers that we’re not going to add for futures customers?”Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner, told the FT: “We need to consider whether swaps and futures should be treated equally. The point is to protect customers as fully as possible.”The CFTC has been bombarded with comments from investors on the swaps protection rule. Big investors such as Fidelity Investments and Och-Ziff Capital Management argue the MF Global case shows that the collateral they post against swaps should not be pooled with other investors’ collateral, as it is in futures.The agency is expected to embrace a policy of “legal segregation,” in which clearing houses have limited access to customer accounts to cover the default of a broker or another customer. This would create stronger safeguards for elite traders of cleared swaps than for users of futures exchanges, leading to the commissioners’ worries.But the futures industry is wary of changes to the status quo. Some insiders say legal segregation would not have prevented the customer losses at MF Global.CME Group, the largest US futures exchange, said it opposed extending legal segregation to futures without more cost analysis, “because we are concerned that it will be costly, does not address all risks, and will not work well in an actual default situation”.Some asset managers, however, advocate going even further and are seeking full physical segregation of collateral in accounts held by third parties. The CFTC, while embracing the less stringent policy of legal segregation, is not expected to prohibit full physical segregation as an option, people familiar with the draft rule said.

Seagate Technology said it had dispatched 47m hard disk drives in the three months to January in a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected. Seagate climbed 11.6 per cent to $18.30, while rival manufacturer Western Digital rose 8.2 per cent to $33.49.Semiconductor manufacturers LSI Corp, up 12.9 per cent to $6.72, and Micron Technology, up 14.5 per cent to $7.21, rallied in anticipation of stronger demand for computer memory chips.Bank of America climbed 11.2 per cent to $6.18, topping $6 for the first time since November, on the back of its strongest one day gain since October on Thursday. Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed earnings estimates for BofA, citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits. Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.5 per cent to $7.10.It might also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform – SunTrust was up 11.6 per cent to $19.75 and Hudson City Bank, a New Jersey-based mortgage lender, rose 9.3 per cent to $6.83. But investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, lagged behind the pack.Goldman Sachs was up just 3.3 per cent to $93.42 while Jefferies climbed only 0.7 per cent to $13.85. Douglas Sipkin, of Ticonderoga Securities, slashed his quarterly earnings forecast for Goldman to 97 cents a share from $4.12 and tipped Morgan Stanley for a 59 cents a share loss, citing the weak trading environment.But Mr Sipkin said US investment banks could benefit from “widening bid- ask spreads, driven by the major retrenchment of European competitors”.CME Group, the largest US exchange by market capitalisation, fell 4 per cent to $234.00 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 4.6 per cent to $115.01 as JPMorgan analysts downgraded both exchanges to neutral, arguing that the companies’ estimates appeared optimistic and might have to be revised down.MasterCard fell 8 per cent to $342.92 as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its “buy” recommendation on the stock as well as Visa.Chesapeake Energy climbed 7.6 per cent to $23.98 after concluding a $2.3bn joint venture with French oil giant Total and EnerVest for shale gas and oil exploration in Ohio.Investor reaction was initially muted but the stock rallied late in the week, when the company said it had used JV revenues to reduce debt by $1.4bn to $10.3bn in the fourth quarter.Devon Energy was up 4.4 per cent to $64.75 after concluding its own $2.5bn shale joint venture with China’s Sinopec. But refiners sold off sharply after Tesoro said it could post a fourth-quarter loss of up to 80 cents a share because of collapsing margins. Tesoro fell 1.8 per cent to $22.95 followed by rivals Marathon Petroleum, off 4.9 per cent to $31.66, and Valero Energy, down 3.2 per cent to $20.37.Tesoro cited the narrowing of the Brent-WTI spread from $26 a barrel to $8 a barrel over the quarter, which cut margins at its mid-continent refineries, which account for 17 per cent of capacity and have benefited from access to cheaper WTI.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions were mixed. Gap fell 3 per cent to $18 after December sales came in 4 per cent lower than the previous year. Ross Stores, the discount clothing chain, rose 6.8 per cent to $50.74 on a 9 per cent increase in same-store sales that easily beat the consensus analyst forecast of 4.2 per cent.Barnes & Noble slumped 19.9 per cent to $11.61 after the company said it was considering a sale of its Nook e-reader business.Netflix climbed 22.3 per cent to $84.70 after the company said subscribers streamed 2bn hours of video on its website in the fourth quarter, although it did not provide data from previous quarters for comparison.Alcoa climbed 6 per cent to $9.17 over the week, before it kicks off fourth quarter reporting season on Monday.But the stock slipped 2 per cent on Friday after the aluminium producer said it was cutting global capacity by 12 per cent and idling smelters in response to falling aluminium prices. Several analysts are predicting a quarterly loss for the company on Monday.
515;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-18T19:36:29Z;KPMG defends role over MF Global;;The administrator for the UK arm of MF Global has defended its handling of the return of funds to customers amid frustration by some that they have not yet received assets frozen after the failure of the US futures broker.KPMG confirmed on Friday that it collected 82 per cent of client money totalling £594m, held by clearing houses, exchanges and brokers, and a further £201m of company monies.The UK arm, which made up a quarter of group revenues, has trailed the US in distributing frozen assets.The collapse of MF Global – the eighth-biggest corporate failure in US history – has damaged market confidence and triggered regulatory and US congressional investigations after $1.2bn of customer funds went missing from its accounts.Winding up the London-based operations is the first test of the Financial Services Authority’s new special administration regime (SAR), introduced after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Unlike ordinary corporate administrations, it is supposed to set specific objectives for the administrator, such as a faster return of assets to customers.“There’s general surprise that, after this new SAR regime, [disbursement] is still taking a long time,” said Barney Reynolds, partner at Shearman & Sterling. “There’s quite a lot of angst about the issue.”Trustees for its US parent are expected to oversee a third distribution to its 36,000 customers this week, taking the total funds returned past 70 per cent.KPMG has told customers it may return a portion of funds before the end of March.Richard Heis, joint special administrator of MF Global UK, told the Financial Times that the return of funds “will generate an interim dividend that we hope to pay as early as next month”.KPMG has received more than 800 claims forms, with a further 7,000 downloaded from its website.Mr Heis also pointed out that US pay-outs have been backstopped by a guarantee of $550m from CME Group, the biggest US futures exchange operator, to help customers recover their money. There is no similar guarantee for the UK unit.He also said the SAR had no additional tools for dealing with the return of client money. “[US trustees] are able to get approvals by the court to do what they want . . . in a very short time frame. It’s very different from the UK court system.”MF Global’s UK operations employed more than a quarter of the group’s total employees.About 300 staff have remained to help liquidate or transfer 1.6m open positions held by the broker for more than 10,000 customers.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant
516;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-16T17:29:15Z;MF Global under fire as CME levels accusations;;The furore over $1.2bn in missing customer funds at failed brokerage MF Global escalated this week after one of the company’s regulators told the US Congress that the broker used customer cash to cover its own liquidity needs as early as five days before the company’s bankruptcy.Terrence Duffy, executive chairman of CME Group, the futures broker’s auditor, told a Senate panel on Tuesday that Jon Corzine, MF Global’s former chief executive, “was aware” that the broker-dealer made use of customer funds in the days leading up to its October 31 bankruptcy.On Thursday, CME officials provided documents showing that two high-ranking MF Global executives told a CME auditor that about $700m in customer funds was moved to the broker-dealer side of the business to meet liquidity needs in a series of transactions possibly beginning as early as the Wednesday before MF Global’s Monday bankruptcy filing. The timeline is the most detailed accounting to date of what may have occurred during MF Global’s frantic final days that led to an estimated $1.2bn in customer funds to go missing.Mr Corzine has steadfastly denied that he directed or was aware of any wrongdoing involving the company’s alleged improper use of customer cash.Members of Congress peppered Mr Corzine and his fellow executives with questions, wondering aloud how the men could not have been aware that the firm may have been using customer money to cover margin calls from the company’s dwindling accounts.The CME’s accusations come as the private-sector regulator itself faces questions over its supervision of MF Global.
517;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-15T22:40:00Z;Corzine counters CME chief’s testimony;;Jon Corzine, the former chief executive of MF Global, has denied that he knew the broker-dealer lent customer funds to a European affiliate shortly before it went bankrupt.At a House financial services subcommittee hearing on Thursday, Terry Duffy, chief executive of CME Group, the exchange operator that oversaw MF Global’s customer accounts, repeated his claim that “Mr Corzine was aware of the loans being made from segregated accounts”.He attributed that to a CME auditor who heard the comment during a conference call involving senior MF Global employees. Mr Duffy first made the allegation that Mr Corzine knew about transfers of customer funds in an appearance before a Senate panel on TuesdayAddressing the House hearing on Thursday, Mr Corzine said he did not know the source of Mr Duffy’s allegation.“Let me be clear. While the last few days of MF Global were chaotic, I did not instruct anyone to lend customer funds to MF Global or any of its affiliates, nor was I told that anyone had done so,” he said.Pressed by Randy Neugebauer, the subcommittee’s chairman, he said: “I don’t know how to respond to something that someone said to somebody else to somebody else that is unidentified.”Mr Corzine suggested that Mr Duffy may have been referring to money transferred to JPMorgan Chase as MF Global scrambled to sell billions of dollars worth of securities. He said JPMorgan contacted him about overdrafts on MF Global accounts in London, which had to be resolved before the other transactions could be completed. Mr Corzine said he had asked MF Global staff in Chicago to resolve the overdrafts and that when JPMorgan had asked whether the transfer was legitimate, the Chicago staff had assured him it was.“The back office in Chicago explicitly confirmed to me that the funds were appropriately transferred,” he said.It was Mr Corzine’s third appearance before Congress following the broker’s collapse after a $6.3bn bet on European sovereign debt. Following a credit rating downgrade and a record quarterly loss, the firm became insolvent and filed for bankruptcy on October 31.About $1.2bn in customer funds, which were supposed to be kept in separate accounts from the firm’s own money, is now missing. Investigators have said they believe MF Global improperly transferred money out of customer accounts to cover the company’s liquidity needs.At Thursday’s hearing, lawmakers echoed their colleagues in frustration over the lack of answers provided by Mr Corzine and other MF Global executives.“Your lack of recollection is somewhat puzzling to a lot of us because you had to know that things were not going well and these positions were unravelling,” Mr Neugebauer said. “You’re the CEO of the company, you’re the chairman of the board. How is it that people acted out of your instructions to make these transfers?”Michael Capuano, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said he was most concerned over whether other companies had as aggressively leveraged positions as MF Global. The brokerage’s leverage ratio was as high as 30 to one.“Who else is doing this and how much is at stake?” he asked. “I’m less interested in one company than I am in the system and if there’s a systemic risk.”Separately, two CME directors have sued MF Global executives, including Mr Corzine, for allegedly breaking rules governing client funds.Charles Carey and Joseph Niciforo, as well as their trading firm, Henning-Carey, filed the class-action complaint in federal court in Chicago last week to recover some of the estimated $1.2bn that went missing from customer accounts.Mr Carey was chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade before its sale to CME in 2007. He and Mr Niciforo joined CME’s board that year and Mr Carey, a prominent figure in Chicago’s futures trading community, also served as vice-chairman throughout last year.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer
518;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-15T20:28:06Z;Tradition rules when it comes to sale of LME;;"The London Metal Exchange is a place of tradition. Turn up for trading with your top button undone, and you could be fined up to £500.Traders often complain about such peculiarities but when it comes to the question of selling the 134-year-old exchange, they are preparing to fight for them.Following a board meeting on Thursday, the LME is expected to send out a memorandum of information to potential bidders within the next week, officially kick-starting the sales process.The LME is owned by its 93 members – largely banks, brokerages, and physical metals traders.Crucially, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, the two largest shareholders on the LME with 20.4 per cent between them, both have large and profitable metals units. Any bid must receive support from holders of more than 75 per cent of the shares, putting the two US banks in a powerful position.After an early flurry of excitement following the announcement in September that more than 10 suitors had expressed interest in acquiring the exchange, shareholders have become more sanguine.In interviews with companies representing roughly half of the voting rights of the LME, a clear outline emerges of a common position on the potential sale: any bidder with plans to change the century-old trading style of the LME should think again – no matter how deep their pockets.“Our business model is driven by our clients’ needs and not by the underlying value of exchange shares,” says Mike Frawley, head of metals at Newedge, which holds a 2.8 per cent stake in the LME and is one of the 12 companies that trades on the exchange’s open outcry ring. “Consequently, LME members will be seeking assurances that market convention will not change.”Unlike most other commodities exchanges, which offer futures contracts for delivery once a month, the LME offers delivery every day. The resulting profusion of contracts makes trading LME metals fiendishly complicated: there are 191 live futures contracts for copper, more than twice the number for WTI crude oil.But many shareholders also believe this structure, together with the ability to take delivery of physical metal from the exchange’s global network of warehouses, underlies the popularity of the LME’s contracts, which are used as the pricing benchmark for 80 per cent of the global trade in non-ferrous metals.One critical issue will be warehousing. Both Goldman and JPMorgan have acquired warehousing companies in the past two years, meaning any buyer of the LME will need to offer assurances that the current warehousing system, which is overseen by the exchange, will not change dramatically.While shareholders have lost some of their enthusiasm for a sale, most still believe that their exchange will eventually be sold – just not to the highest bidder.In September, when interest first emerged, a price tag of £1bn was mooted; now, shareholders say, they would be happy to settle for a valuation closer to £750m.In the first public valuation since the prospect of a takeover was announced, JPMorgan bought MF Global’s stake last month in a deal valuing the exchange at about £530m.And although shareholders are resistant to change on some fronts, they are actively seeking it elsewhere. Many recognise, for example, that the LME is in need of hefty investment in clearing and trading infrastructure – something that, if it were to remain private, would probably be funded by raising fees.Shareholders are therefore likely to look favourably on bidders, such as SGX, ICE or CME Group, which have their own clearing houses. The LME currently outsources clearing activities to LCH.Clearnet, losing what many see as a lucrative income stream.Even the LME’s open outcry ring – the last in Europe – could find itself on the chopping block. Most shareholders argue it is the unique structure of the market, rather than the ring itself, that underpins its success.“It’s a bit of an anachronism to believe an exchange can survive without changing the model,” says one top-five shareholder. “The clock can’t go back to where it was: something has to change now.”Additional reporting by Anousha Sakoui"
519;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-14T19:14:10Z;Javelin and CME clearing handle swaps in seconds;;A group of swap market participants including CME Group, the US exchange operator, on Wednesday claimed to have set a new standard for real time reporting of cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trades, saying they had handled interest rate swaps in an average time of less than two seconds.Javelin Capital Markets, a swaps trading platform, and the CME’s clearing house, said $4.1bn in notional value of the contracts had been executed and cleared in this way.Executing and clearing OTC trades in “real-time” or “as soon as technologically practicable” is a central aim of proposed rules under the Dodd Frank Act, being implemented by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures regulator that will also oversee the OTC derivatives markets.Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, has repeatedly argued in favour of introducing more transparency into OTC markets for derivatives, often referred to as swaps in the US.“We [also] are looking to soon finalise real-time reporting rules, which will give the public critical information on transactions – similar to what has been working for decades in the securities and futures markets,” he said last month.Javelin and CME said the 21 trades were transacted across various maturities out to 10 years and the average trade size was $195m between dealers and investors on Javelin’s anonymous execution platform last week.Javelin’s platform is a central limit order book, where bids and offers are entered by various counterparties and trading takes place. Most current OTC derivatives trades are negotiated bilaterally between counterparties, with prices only visible to the parties.The Dodd-Frank act requires that most “standardised” OTC derivatives be traded on more formal trading platforms where prices are more widely visible, although the CFTC has yet to finalise exactly how such platforms will function.The average time that elapsed between trades being executed on Javelin and cleared at the CME was 1.932 seconds. The CME accepted 90 per cent of the trades in less than two seconds, with the fastest being 1.32 seconds using its current existing clearing technology.“Dealers, buyside firms, clearing firms and Javelin wanted to put a time stamp on what ‘technologically practicable’ meant,” said James Cawley, chief executive officer of Javelin. “This now means in under two seconds. A new industry standard has now been set.”Brad Small, head of rates trading at Ing said: “Counterparty and execution risk have now been dramatically reduced by combining central clearing with real time acceptance.”Some banks, however, have told regulators that the process of clearing trades with customers will take far longer than a matter of seconds and could take several hours and require substantial spending on new systems. In October, MarkitServ cleared credit derivative trades in minutes after they were transacted between dealers.Clearing swaps is growing quickly as Dodd-Frank rules in the US and other G20 reforms aim to push clearing of nearly all swaps through clearing houses. The main clearing houses vying for a slice of the market are CME, LCH.Clearnet and the IntercontinentalExchange.Last week, LCH.Clearnet, which clears the bulk of interest rate swaps between dealers, announced enhancements designed to speed up the clearing of swaps via futures commission merchants, or futures brokers, to which Dodd-Frank has assigned the role of intermediary between OTC swaps customers and clearing houses.CME said last week it had cleared $150bn in notional volumes of interest rate swap and credit default swap trades, including a record $61.9bn in November, between customers such as BlackRock and banks such as Goldman Sachs and RBS.
520;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-14T00:15:06Z;CME chief alleges Corzine aware of transfers;MF Global employee told auditor about shift of funds;Jon Corzine, the former chief executive of MF Global, “was aware” that the broker-dealer made use of customer funds during its desperate fight for survival, a US Senate hearing was told on Tuesday.Terry Duffy, chief executive of CME Group, the futures exchange operator that supervised MF Global’s handling of customer money, said a CME auditor heard an MF Global employee say during a conference call involving senior MF Global employees that “Mr Corzine was aware of the loans being made from segregated accounts”.A spokesman for Mr Corzine declined to comment. The former MF Global boss and previous New Jersey senator reiterated to the same Senate hearing that he did not intend to authorise the improper use of customer funds to plug a hole in MF Global’s liquidity in the days leading up to the bankruptcy.CME is under scrutiny for its role as a supervisor to MF Global’s customer accounts, from which up to $1.2bn is estimated to have gone missing in the run-up to the company’s bankruptcy on October 31. Mr Duffy said he believed the conference call, which occurred the same morning as the bankruptcy filing, discussed a $175m transfer from MF Global to a European affiliate.In his second appearance on Capitol Hill since the demise of MF Global, Mr Corzine said: “I never gave an instruction to misuse customer funds. I never intended anyone at MF Global to misuse customer funds.”Mr Corzine was joined at the hearing by Bradley Abelow, the brokerage’s chief operating officer and a former Goldman Sachs colleague, and Henri Steenkamp, the chief financial officer, who both denied any knowledge of what happened to the money or any decisions to transfer funds out of customer accounts. All three executives said they were not aware that any money was missing until just before MF Global filed for bankruptcy.Like their colleagues in the House of Representatives who grilled Mr Corzine at a hearing last week, many senators expressed frustration with Mr Corzine and his former colleagues over their lack of information.Debbie Stabenow, the committee chairwoman, asked each executive in turn: “Where’s the money?” When Mr Steenkamp replied that he did not know, she shot back: “Well, who does?”Mr Abelow told the panel: “I do not recall participating in conversations about using customer funds for anything other than their intended purpose.”“We’ve got this major problem and you guys were pretty high in the organisation and yet, when we try and dig and find out kind of what occurred, who did what, nobody can really remember or doesn’t really know,” said John Boozman, a Republican senator from Arkansas.The brokerage collapsed at the end of October after reporting an unexpected second-quarter loss and being downgraded by rating agencies, following its disclosure of a $6.3bn bet on European sovereign debt.Separately, in a court filing, James Giddens, the bankruptcy trustee of MF Global, said that “certain” actions of JPMorgan Chase, a lender to the collapsed company, “are likely to be the subject of investigation”.
521;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Quick View: DB-NYSE’s final throw of the dice?;Exchanges offer significant concessions to win EC antitrust approval;So, we have Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext’s last and final offer. Until the actual last and final offer.The two exchanges groups last night submitted improved “remedies” to Brussels in a bid to assuage European Commission antitrust officials that their planned business combination would not hurt competition in European derivatives markets.What’s clear is that DB/NYSE have more or less accepted that Brussels is not going to budge on its market definition, that the relevant geography for the purpose of its antitrust probe is Europe, and thus the competitive dynamic between Eurex and Liffe.DB/NYSE have argued in vain so far that competition is global and that both Liffe and Eurex compete with, and a combination of the two would compete with CME Group in the US.So, assuming the market definition is Europe, DB/NYSE have with their last and best offer gone much further than I think many might have expected, even if it is also true that their initial remedies were modest.First, they have decided to put the whole single equity derivatives business on the block – ie: Paris, Brussels, Lisbon and Amsterdam. Amsterdam is a huge options business, and has been ever since the days of the European Options Exchange, launched in 1978.What DB/NYSE is putting on the block is a more meaningful business. But it is a higher-cost platform than TOM, so one wonders what the upside for any buyer would be.Second, DB/NYSE have significantly lowered the barriers to entry in competing with “lookalike” stock index derivatives products, by raising the “correlation threshold” that it had applied in its earlier, miserly remedies.Previously anyone wanting to launch a rival stock index contract would be allowed access to Eurex Clearing but only if the new “innovative” product was not correlated to an existing Eurex or Liffe product greater than 85 per cent. That made offering lookalikes a non-starter.But that threshold has now been raised to 99 per cent. That changes the game a bit.There are a few other bells and whistles. Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext have also extended the period in which such access to the clearing house is allowed from eight years to “a potentially indefinite period of time”. And multilateral trading facilities will now be allowed to access Eurex Clearing. Previously it was only exchanges that were allowed.Yet they have not budged where it arguably really matters: short dated interest rate futures. They have not relaxed the correlation threshold for such contracts. This means it would be very hard for anyone wanting to compete in interest rate futures.That means DB/NYSE have been prepared to go a long way but not as far as to threaten the interest rate franchise that is at the core of the entire business proposition in merging the two groups - the key to this whole thing.If one assumes that interest rates around the world will once again rise over the next few years, that will light a fire under any exchange’s interest rate volumes.Add to that the prospect of over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps being more widely traded electronically thanks to Dodd-Frank, Mifid and Emir, and throw in the potential margin offsets between the exchange-traded and OTC products, and Eurex Clearing is potentially looking at a big upside.Whether these latest remedies are enough to push the deal over the finish line boils down to this: will Brussels feel that the two parties are still giving up the most where the barriers to entry are the lowest, or will antitrust officials feel they have done enough that amounts to an unprecedented market structure change that will preserve derivatives competition sufficiently in Europe?Then: will the politics of the eurozone, and the anti-UK dynamic that now pervades the air, be enough to convince politicians that now is not the time to block the creation of a European – eurozone – champion?DB/NYSE have taken out full page adverts in today’s European financial press, signed by 30 European academics and luminaries, trumpeting the proposed deal as “a turning point in the development of European financial markets”.This is DB/NYSE’s best shot, but whether it will be enough is still 50-50.
522;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-12T20:37:01Z;LSE gets measure of market in FTSE takeover;;Anyone who has watched stock market indices flashing on television or trading screens will know they are a gauge of sentiment used by fund managers as investing benchmarks.But to exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange, they are much more than that – if they can get their hands on them.Increasingly, they are. The LSE on Monday agreed to pay £450m ($701m) for the 50 per cent stake in FTSE International, compiler of the benchmark FTSE 100 index, that it did not already own.It bought the stake from Pearson, the education and information group that owns the Financial Times, joint owner of the business with the LSE since 1995.The move gives the LSE control of one of the most recognisable indices in the world, one of a family the exchange owns.It is a trend that has been gathering pace in the past two years as exchanges, battling erosion of their market share at the hands of smaller competitors and banks’ own trading platforms, seek to lock in other sources of revenue.This summer the LSE launched its first foray into financial futures – the bread and butter of any exchange that claims to be diversified beyond share trading – with a set of contracts including one based on the FTSE 100 index.Taking control of the FTSE business, which claims to manage more than 200,000 indices linked to more than $3tn in assets under management, allows the LSE to do more of that as its larger rivals have already made a head start.Some of that has been in anticipation of an increase in exchange-traded trading as post-2008 crisis regulations force more financial products from off-exchange or over-the-counter markets and on to formal trading systems to help make pricing more transparent.“For the LSE having control of this in their armoury is quite critical,” says Niki Beattie, chief executive of Market Structure Partners, a consultancy.Exchanges also believe institutional investors will want more exposure to emerging markets and a wide range of asset classes through index and benchmark products amid a shift from active to passive fund management.The LSE’s move follows a deal struck last month where the CME Group, the biggest US futures exchange operator, and publisher McGraw-Hill, united their index businesses in a joint venture that would bring together the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index in the same company.NYSE Euronext in June became sole exchange licensee for MSCI index products. In late 2009 Deutsche Börse and SIX Swiss Group, operator of the Swiss exchange, took control of the Euro Stoxx index after buying out Dow Jones’s share in a joint venture.Yet the LSE’s shares closed down 4.9 per cent at 780p, as investors appeared to balk at the price paid for the stake, even as analysts said it made strategic sense.The LSE believes that revenues from the global indices business are about $1.5bn, with the FTSE on a 13 per cent market share. FTSE’s revenues and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation have grown at a compound annual rate of 22 per cent in the past five years.Sixty per cent of its revenues come from subscription fees asset managers pay to use data. The rest comes from licensing the FTSE to asset managers to create tracker products and exchange traded funds, which have grown rapidly.The price tag implies a forward earnings multiple of 16 times ebitda, according to Barclays Capital. That is above the 11 times on which the MSCI trades on the New York Stock Exchange.Yet the LSE says one of the main revenue opportunities lies in derivatives, including indices on equity derivatives. It believes the top 20-25 equity derivatives index contracts have annual revenues of $25m-$150m. David Lester, FTSE chairman, says: “We land one of these kinds of products and the revenues start to look attractive.”But shareholder groups are nervous about the LSE consolidating ownership over the FTSE.One influential investor says: “Pearson did well to get £450m for its 50 per cent” but the consequences for FTSE may be less beneficial. “It is not particularly good news for the index.”He suggests that pension fund trustees may not want to rely on an index controlled by the LSE “with its commercial aspirations to encourage as many companies to come to London, without necessarily having enough regard to the quality of those entrants”.Liz Murrall, director, corporate governance and reporting at the Investment Management Association, says: “We have a concern that it may exacerbate certain of the conflicts of interest at the LSE. If they are not careful as to the quality of companies in the list it could have a detrimental effect on the quality of the UK listing regime.”Mark Makepeace, FTSE chief executive, says governance and the committees that decide on the index will remain separate from the board. That governance model “underpins the whole value of the business”.
523;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-12T20:26:32Z;Virtu acquires DMM of Cohen Capital;Company now NYSE Amex’s largest market maker;Virtu Financial has acquired a designated market maker (DMM) on the NYSE Amex trading floor, marking the continuing diversification push by high-speed trading shops.Although lesser known than rival Getco, which last week purchased the DMM business of Bank of America, Virtu has built a similar business, using high-frequency trading techniques to make markets rather than purely trade for its own book.On Monday, Virtu announced it had acquired the DMM business of Cohen Capital Group. Cohen was a market maker on NYSE Amex, the former American Stock Exchange, where many small companies and mutual funds are listed.Virtu will now oversee trading of 170 companies and 80 closed-end mutual funds, making it the largest market maker on NYSE Amex.It also acquired Cohen’s license to make markets on the main NYSE Big Board. Though Cohen was not currently a DMM for any NYSE-listed stocks, Virtu could apply for the role for new listings or win transfers from other DMMs.The role of specialist has changed dramatically in the past decade, with many firms exiting the business or consolidating as 1990s-era scandals led to rule changes and markets became fully electronic.But NYSE has kept a version of specialists, the DMMs, on both the main floor and NYSE Amex floor as a way to attract listed companies who want human traders overseeing their stocks.This handful of firms – which on the main NYSE floor now include only Getco, Goldman Sachs, Barclays Capital and Knight Capital – do not have the advantages of specialists, but can match the market’s best price in exchange for constantly quoting bids and asks. They also receive the highest rebates from NYSE.High-speed firms have come to dominate US and European trading, making up more than half of all trading volume, but have still struggled to cope with narrowing margins and uneven volumes over the past two years.Many have added scale and diversified into new businesses, such as client-facing algorithmic trading. Buying a DMM license also gives the trading firms direct contact with big corporations and fund management firms whose stocks they oversee.Along with Getco and Knight Capital, Virtu has backed stiffer obligations on market makers to keep trading during turbulent moments. Not all high-speed trading firms agree with this view, with many arguing that the costs of staying in the markets when prices are moving wildly are too great in exchange for too-few benefits.Earlier this year, Virtu merged with EWT/Madison Tyler, creating one of the five largest trading firms in the world. In addition to US equities, Virtu is market maker on the NYSE Liffe US futures market, and in markets run by the CME Group and others in Asia and Europe.Virtu is backed by Silver Lake, the private equity and venture capital group that has previously invested in trading groups such as Instinet and Nasdaq.“This acquisition is consistent with Virtu’s primary business objective of providing highly efficient, fully obligated, customised liquidity to investors across all markets,” said Vincent Viola, Virtu founder and chief executive. He is also a former chairman of Nymex.He added: “We look forward to working with our listed company partners and providing our unique liquidity to their valued investors.”
524;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;CME squares up to tougher scrutiny;;Washington lawmakers looking to repair derivatives markets after the MF Global debacle will have to listen to a formidable voice from Chicago: CME Group.The largest US futures exchange operator audited MF Global’s futures broker business before the discovery that as much as $1.2bn in clients’ funds went missing in the aftermath of its bankruptcy.The shortfall in MF Global’s customer funds and the possibility that traders may not get back all their collateral, has created something of a crisis of confidence in the futures markets. That has not only dented CME’s reputation, but has also depressed the exchange group’s trading volumes.Some lawmakers are asking whether the self-regulatory framework that let CME supervise MF Global and dozens of other futures commission merchants (FCMs) should be changed.“I’ve always been concerned about self-regulation,” says Michael Capuano, the top Democrat on the House financial services committee’s investigations unit. “Self-regulation has a role and a place, but if it’s not going to work again then I think we have a problem.”They can expect a muscular response from CME. The company spends millions of dollars on lobbyists and logs countless hours at meetings with regulators and walking the halls of Congress.“CME has one of the most effective government affairs operations in the nation’s Capitol. I’ve rarely seen them on the losing end of an issue,” says Robert Holifield, a former staff director on the Senate agriculture committee.CME has spent more than $8m on lobbyists since 2008, ranking each year within the top 20 biggest spenders in the securities industry, according to data compiled by the Centre for Responsive Politics, a non-partisan research group.It has also been a big donor to political campaigns, laying out about $2m to candidates, party committees and leadership political action committees in the last two election cycles, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics.This year, CME donated more than $75,000 to lawmakers who serve on the House agriculture committee and over $97,000 to members of the Senate agriculture committee. These committees oversee the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the government futures regulator, which in turn supervises CME’s role as a self-regulatory organisation.The Senate committee will hold a hearing on Tuesday on MF Global and Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, will testify.CME told the FT on Friday: “We look forward to working with the industry, regulators and Congress to explore potential improvements to increase security of customer funds held by FCMs and restore confidence in the futures industry. We plan to be very active participants in the process.”“In the case of MF Global, we did everything we could within our regulatory power, but MF Global broke exchange rules and government regulations designed to protect customer funds. Because the firm failed to comply with regulations, that does not mean the system failed,” the group said.The crisis comes as regulators have been finalising rules for over-the-counter swaps markets mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms. Futures, where trades are processed by a clearing house that serves as the buyer for every seller and seller to every buyer, have been adopted as a template.Mr Duffy told Congress in April: “The baseline model has performed this function admirably over the years, with no futures customers suffering a loss as a result of an FCM’s bankruptcy or default. There is no reason to believe it will not operate as well in the swaps market.”Now that belief has been thrown into question, and some Washington insiders say the process of writing swaps rules, delayed for months already, will take even longer.Blaming MF Global for breaking rules while under the supervision of the CME, cuts little ice with furious customers who are calling for changes in the oversight of futures brokers.“It’s like having your house burn down without any insurance,” says Dean Toftelin, a farmer from Luverne, Minnesota, who has more than $200,000 still frozen. “[CME] speaks as if the money in your segregated customer account is as good as having it at the bank. Apparently that isn’t the case, and that is going to affect their business long-term.”Additional reporting by Shahien Nasiripour, Tom Braithwaite and Michael Mackenzie
525;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-12T12:55:47Z;LSE pays £450m to take control of FTSE;;The London Stock Exchange has agreed to buy the remaining 50 per cent of the FTSE International index business that it does not already own from Pearson, the education and information group that owns the Financial Times, for £450m.The move – the LSE’s biggest acquisition since it bought Borsa Italiana in 2007 – gives it control of a stock market index compiler as rival exchanges have recently tightened their grip over such businesses.Exchanges with index businesses have been ramping up the launch of new products, as institutional investors seek new ways to gain exposure to emerging markets and as automated traders want to trade different asset classes, such as derivatives.The LSE’s move is also another sign that Xavier Rolet, chief executive, believes the exchange must own key assets, if it is to become sufficiently diversified to be able to compete with larger rivals such as Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, and CME Group. All three have index businesses.The LSE is already in exclusive talks with LCH.Clearnet about taking a controlling stake in the clearing house. Adding the FTSE business would allow Mr Rolet full control over the creation of new products based on the FTSE Index that would be traded on the LSE and cleared at LCH.Clearnet.Mark Makepeace, chief executive of FTSE International, said on Monday: “FTSE is one of the two leading providers of equity benchmarks and that gives us a very strong franchise to build derivatives and fixed income products.”He will remain as chief executive of the business once the deal is closed, expected in the first quarter of next year.Mr Rolet said: “This is a business we know well, and we expect that …our customers will benefit from greater choice, opportunity and innovation.” The deal would be “immediately earnings enhancing”, he added.The LSE will fund the purchase using £100m in cash and £350m in financing from “a small group of banks”, according to Doug Webb, LSE chief financial officer. It comes only days after Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, put the LSE on credit watch, citing concerns over the bourse’s exposure to unsecured credit risk to Italian banks.The deal follows Pearson’s sale of its stake in Interactive Data last year for $2bn. The publisher said it expected FTSE to make a total post-tax contribution to Pearson’s adjusted earnings of approximately £18m, or 2.2p a share, in 2011.The LSE and Pearson had been in talks about a deal for two months.The exchange said FTSE was “well placed to respond to exciting further growth opportunities and trends in the asset management industry. These include growth in demand for index-based products, value-added data and analytical tools, the shift to passive fund management, and the growth in demand for exposure to emerging markets, thematic and strategic indices”.It added that the FTSE business, which encompasses the flagship FTSE 100 index and covers 80 countries, including the FTSE China A50, notched up 22 per cent compound annual growth in revenues over the past five years.FTSE also had a growing presence in the US, “providing a platform for further expansion”.The LSE’s move comes after months of lobbying by the exchange to persuade antitrust regulators in Brussels that the planned merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext must include agreement that the Börse allow rivals to licence its Euro Stoxx index and spin products off it.The LSE was rebuffed by the Börse last year after the UK exchange asked for permission to licence the Euro Stoxx index as part of plans to launch new derivatives products on its fledgling derivatives platform, known as Turquoise.Asked whether the LSE would allow rival exchanges to licence the FTSE for products they may want to launch, Mr Rolet said the LSE would not block anyone. “It is a pro-competition structure, as it already is.”Investors are watching to see whether the European Commission believes that Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext have done enough to persuade its antitrust division that their planned combination would not reduce competition, particularly in exchange-traded derivatives.Opening up the index licence business was not offered as a concession by the two exchanges, although they have offered some concessions around access to the Börse’s German clearing house.Analysts said that the unexpected FTSE sale would give Pearson an acquisitions warchest of about £800m for 2012 and Dame Marjorie Scardino, chief executive, indicated she would be sticking to the group’s existing M&A policy.This has focused on digital-based businesses in high growth markets, although Pearson has been linked most recently with interest in the College of Law, a UK-based legal training business which has been valued at £100m to £200m.Dame Marjorie has also pursued a strategy of making acquisitions contribute to earnings within a year of completion.Analysts at UBS and Credit Suisse said that if future acquisitions used all of the available headroom, and based on its recent track record, Pearson could see an increase in earnings per share of between 3p and 6p by the end of 2012, even after taking into account the 2.2p per share contribution that FTSE is forecast to make to full-year 2011 earnings.Dame Marjorie said the long-term strategy of FTSE was no longer in line with Pearson’s own thinking, which sees the Financial Times Group as being based around news, analysis and intelligence rather than pure financial data.
526;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-09T23:06:29Z;MF Global probe reveals oversight blind spots;;As Jon Corzine apologised to lawmakers over the collapse of MF Global, the chief overseer of the firm’s futures broker sounded a different tone.Terry Duffy, chairman of the CME Group, vigorously defended his industry before the House agriculture committee, saying the fact that “a firm failed to comply with applicable rules” did not mean the system used to protect customer accounts had failed.This week’s congressional hearing on MF Global has intensified pressure on CME, the powerful Chicago futures exchange operator that has zealously guarded its role as designated self-regulatory organisation for MF Global and other US futures commission merchants (FCMs).The unexplained disappearance of client funds from MF Global has undermined investors’ faith that no one lost money due to broker default – a fact that Mr Duffy and others in the futures industry can no longer tout.The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the government regulator for US markets in futures, options on futures and now most over-the-counter derivatives.But the CFTC delegates the job of checking futures firms to CME, the former member-owned Chicago Mercantile Exchange that listed shares in 2002.“The self-regulatory organisations are the frontline auditors for FCMs,” Jill Sommers, the CFTC commissioner in charge of the agency’s MF Global investigation, told the committee. Ms Sommers is a former CME lobbyist.Keeping customer cash separate from house funds is a cardinal rule of the futures market. Regulators’ failure to spot a hole of as much as $1.2bn in MF Global’s customer accounts has prompted questions about CME’s role as a self-regulator.Scrutiny is especially strong because CME is a for-profit exchange operator whose revenues derive from trading volumes. MF Global was one of the top brokers by volume on CME’s exchanges.The CME “want fair and efficient markets. Their next goal has got to be profit. That’s not my goal. My goal is to protect consumers,” said Bart Chilton, another member of the CFTC.CME said: “No one has a higher interest in ensuring the integrity of the markets than CME Group.”Securities regulators began pressing MF Global in June to raise more capital against its positions linked to sovereign debt. On September 1, MF Global disclosed that Finra required the firm to raise capital.However, that red flag was not picked up aggressively by futures regulators. The CME did not arrive on site at MF Global until days before the bankruptcy filing on October 31.In testimony, Mr Duffy revealed that on the Thursday before the bankruptcy filing, two CME auditors made an unannounced visit to MF Global’s office in Chicago and reviewed daily reports on customer funds through the next day.The auditors “noted only immaterial discrepancies” in the customer funds reports that had been filed on Wednesday by the time they left on Friday, having verified 85-90 per cent of the funds with third parties.However, CME suggests MF Global transferred funds out of customer accounts on Thursday or Friday – and only informed the CME and CFTC of those transfers on Sunday.CME has acted fast to shore up futures markets since the MF Global collapse, offering a $550m guarantee to try to free remaining customer funds.Yet “the damage has already been done”, says John Roe, an introducing broker at BT Trading in Chicago, a firm that had all $15m or so of its client funds at MF Global.While legislators may examine the self-regulatory structure, it would be difficult to shift daily oversight responsibilities to the CFTC.“The futures world operates with a self-regulatory system of oversight, because the CFTC cannot afford and doesn’t have the resources to put a watchdog into every futures commission merchant,” Collin Peterson, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said at the hearing.
527;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-08T23:14:46Z;Illinois appeases exchanges with tax breaks;;Legislative leaders in Illinois have agreed a $100m-a-year tax-relief package for CME Group, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and Sears, after the three companies threatened to leave the state.The deal hatched in Springfield, Illinois’ capital, which still needs to be ratified by the state’s House of Representatives and Senate, reflects concern that the cash-strapped state could lose some of its biggest companies because of its relatively high business taxes.Illinois raised its corporate income tax rate from 7.3 per cent to 9.5 per cent this year, as the state aimed to tackle a $15bn budget deficit, unfunded pension liabilities of at least $80bn and more than $8bn of unpaid bills to educational institutions and social welfare providers.CME, the US’s biggest futures exchange, and Sears, the high-profile but struggling department store chain, have both made much of lucrative offers from other states to relocate. Sears had said it would leave by the end of the year if a deal was not done. CBOE, the country’s largest single options-trading venue, had taken more of a back seat role but had also warned it could move out of state over the issue.Before going into its winter recess, the Illinois House of Representatives overwhelmingly defeated a tax-relief package presented last month that bundled the breaks to the three companies with an increase in the earned income tax credit for low- and middle-income families and linked personal income tax exemptions to inflation.However, under pressure from the companies involved and with the backing of Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, the legislature has been called back into emergency session next week to consider a vote just on the tax breaks that will affect the three companies.Explore the budget woes facing US states in this interactive graphic“This package will allow businesses to plan on longer-term research and development and the ability to carry their losses forward in a tough economy,” said Tom Cross, leader of the Republican minority in the state’s House.Under the deal, Illinois’ business tax code would be revised for financial exchanges, a move that would affect the CME and CBOE. The plan envisages that ultimately only 27.5 per cent of their electronic trades will be taxable in the state, a move that it is estimated will cost Illinois $85m a year.Sears would receive tax credits worth $15m a year for 10 years, which it can use against withheld employee income taxes.
528;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Brazilian tax break boosts ultra fast traders;HFTs’ share of overall volumes in the BM&FBovespa capital market reached a record;The story of Brazil`s BM&FBovespa capital market has been one of two countervailing realities this year.While equity market capitalisation has fallen on the back of weak investor sentiment, trading volumes in equities and futures have risen, helped by a new category of investor – the ultra-fast or “high-frequency” trader. These traders use computer programmes to deal in fractions of a second.In the three months to September 30, the share of high frequency traders of overall volumes in the BM&FBovespa reached a record. Last week, Brazil`s finance minister Guido Mantega gave the HFTs an extra shot in the arm when he removed a punitive financial transactions tax, or IOF, on foreigners bringing short-term capital into the equities markets. With this 200-basis point fee gone, high frequency traders will be free to do what they do best: execute quickly and move in and out of Brazil as they wish.“We strongly feel that this regulatory change is going to be a tipping point for the trading landscape in Brazil,” says Mani Singh, head of non-dollar electronic sales with Citi in New York. “High frequency traders had to adjust their trading models to incorporate the IOF.”Among high growth country capital markets, BM&FBovespa has been one of the more aggressive in its efforts to attract high frequency traders in an attempt to generate new sources of liquidity and lift volumes.The exchange, one of the world’s largest by market capitalisation, has been cutting fees and offering specialist services such as co-location to its matching engine, where trades are conducted. Last November it unveiled price cuts of up to 70 per cent and progressive discounts based on trading volume bands.The market`s new high-speed trading platform, called Puma and developed with BM&FBovespa`s partner CME Group, has already begun trading for derivatives and will begin for equities next March and for fixed income later next year. The system has cut sharply the time it takes to process a trade, from more than 10 milliseconds to less than one, the exchange says.This push has started to produce results. While equity market capitalisation has fallen, with the quarterly average dipping to R$2,200bn ($1,225bn) in the three months to September 30 from R$2,300bn a year earlier amid weak investor sentiment, average daily trading volume in the cash and derivatives segments rose 11.7 per cent and 15.5 per cent respectively during the same period.One reason for the stronger performance has been high frequency trading. Although it only really got going in Brazil in the middle of 2009, it accounted for 10.3 per cent of volume in the Bovespa cash segment in the third quarter compared with only 4.3 per cent at the end of last year.In the BM&F derivatives segment, it reached a record of 7.8 per cent compared with 5 per cent at the end of 2010. Volumes transacted through co-location had also risen by a factor of 10 by the end of the third quarter compared with the end of last year. Although HFT still has some way to go in Brazil to reach developed market levels of more than 25 per cent, the growth has been impressive.“High frequency trading is still a very recent thing for Brazil and only really started after the exchange went public and set up the partnership with CME,” says Felipe Brandão, the head of Icap’s electronic platforms in Brazil. “But since then the exchange has done a lot to prepare the right environment.”Still, the growth has not come without a cost. The discounted fees for high frequency traders have squeezed margins in BM&FBovespa’s cash equities business, and IT costs have been burdensome.In addition, investing in Brazil comes with regulatory risk. If the Brazilian real begins appreciating against the dollar again, the government could reintroduce the IOF for equities, which was originally designed to stem short-term foreign exchange flows into Brazil.But traders believe the government`s removal of the IOF on equities and other instruments, such as depository receipts trading and convertible bonds, can only help. On December 2, the day after the government announced it was lifting the IOF, $525m flowed into Brazil. “Those who take part in high frequency trading here are mostly foreigners,” says Icap`s Mr Brandão.ft.com/tradingroom

530;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-08T00:59:22Z;Regulators diverge over MF Global collapse;Testimonies show varying accounts about failure;Regulators are expected to give diverging accounts about when they first became concerned over the state of MF Global, the broker-dealer that collapsed on October 31 with an estimated $1.2bn of customer money missing.Terry Duffy, chief executive of CME Group, the futures exchange operator that supervised MF Global’s handling of customer accounts, said the broker-dealer seemed to be in “full compliance” with obligations to ringfence customer money just a day before a $900m shortfall was uncovered.In prepared testimony submitted to the House of Representatives agriculture committee and obtained by the Financial Times, Mr Duffy gave a detailed account of his company’s efforts to audit MF Global in the days before it filed for bankruptcy. He said that “currently” between 13 and 19 per cent of MF Global’s $5.5bn customer funds appeared to be missing.Mr Duffy is due to testify to Congress on Thursday alongside Jon Corzine, former MF Global head, who was compelled by lawmakers to attend using congressional legal powers, and regulators including the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra).People close to the situation said Mr Corzine had not yet submitted testimony, though some said they expected he would speak at the hearing rather than “plead the fifth”, using the US constitution’s fifth amendment right to silence.“Wall Street can not just shrug this off because it affects the foundations of the very core of their business,” said Dennis Cardoza, a California Democrat who serves on the House agriculture committee. “If investors lose confidence, where will they turn to?” Neither Mr Cardoza nor his office provided Thursday’s testimony to the FT.Along with Mr Corzine and Mr Duffy, regulators face a grilling from lawmakers and customers from MF Global will also testify amid concern about the policing of futures markets.“We have believed for decades that risk to segregated customer funds held by members of the clearinghouse was virtually zero,” John Fletcher, general manager of Central Missouri Agri-Service, said in his prepared remarks. “Now, we know that was not the case.” His firm is missing $600,000 from its former account at MF Global, he said.Mr Duffy said that auditors from CME Group arrived unannounced at MF Global’s Chicago offices on October 27, as market concern about the fate of the broker-dealer mounted. He said they reviewed the daily segregation report, which showed that segregation of customer funds “was intact” and the next day’s report asserted that the firm “remained in full compliance” with segregation requirements.But he said the following day’s segregation report showed a $900m shortfall “caused by an ‘accounting error’. Our auditors, working with the CFTC, devoted the rest of the day and night Sunday to find the so-called accounting error. No such error was ever found.”Mr Duffy added that MF Global informed the CFTC and CME at 2am on October 31, the day it filed for bankruptcy, that the customer money had, in fact, been transferred out of segregation to firm accounts.While Mr Duffy said the CME’s unannounced visit came after MF Global “announced losses and suffered credit rating downgrades”, another regulator will say at the hearing that it was monitoring the firm closely for weeks before its collapse.William Brodsky, head of the CBOE, which has overseen MF Global’s securities accounts since 2003, said his examiners had “requested and received a variety of daily financial information” since August 26. He said his staff were on site from September 7. CBOE said it had conducted nine routine examinations and three financial investigations regarding “specific matters” and had taken disciplinary action against the firm five times.In its testimony, Finra said it had become concerned about MF Global’s exposure to sovereign debt after spotting a footnote in the company’s financial statements in May.
531;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-06T01:08:20Z;Competition for US OTC clearing heats up;;Competition for clearing over-the-counter trades by customers in the US is heating up, with CME Group posting new clearing volume records, while LCH.Clearnet moves to make its competing offering more attractive.Though the buyside clearing market is still just a sliver of the $150tn notional swaps market, which is primarily traded between big banks, it is growing quickly as Dodd-Frank rules in the US and other G20 reforms aim to push clearing of nearly all swaps through clearing houses. Groups including CME, LCH and the IntercontinentalExchange are vying for the nascent market.Concerns about bank counterparty risk stemming from the European crisis have also accelerated efforts by big asset management and pension firms to sidestep them and take trades directly to clearing houses themselves.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, using funds deposited by its members to help guarantee that a transaction is completed in case of a default.On Monday, CME announced it has now cleared $150bn in notional volumes of interest rate swap and credit default swap trades, including a record $61.9bn in November, between customers such as BlackRock and banks such as Goldman Sachs and RBS.Meanwhile, LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French group that dominates clearing of bank swap trades but is currently still in the testing phase of its US buyside offering, announced on Monday it would accept a wider range of collateral in its SwapClear US platform and announced new products.“We’re upbeat and optimistic about closing the short-term gap,” said Daniel Maguire, head of SwapClear US.It expanded eligible collateral to include currencies other than US dollars, including Japanese yen, euros and British pounds, as well as non-sovereign bonds and other government-guaranteed bonds, such as US agency mortgages.CME’s platform does not accept yen collateral at present. CME said recently it was ”working with several major banks on a specialised collateral programme that permits clearing firms to pledge collateral that CME does not accept directly”.SwapClear acknowledged that a shortage of quality collateral was a concern that its customers, which include asset managers, pension funds, hedge funds and regional banks that are not eligible to be clearinghouse members, had expressed.“By giving [customers] a broader spectrum of margin, it makes it easier to cover margin calls. But we are absolutely not competing on margin as such,” said Mr Maguire.“The key for us always in these debates is, if we can take this in, can we get out of it in a highly volatile environment?” he added.SwapClear will also now allow trade confirmations through Bloomberg, Tradeweb and MarkitSERV, a joint venture between Markit and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. It also said it would begin clearing variable notional swaps, which are commonly used by regional banks to hedge mortgage exposures.The cost of clearing and posting margin is a concern to investment firms, which are facing a potential sharp rise in the frequency of margin calls to trade in OTC markets.A study by Celent, the market research firm, said that “some buyside firms may reduce the number of OTC contracts they trade as they will be effectively priced out of the market”. They might switch to using more listed futures and exchange traded funds, the study said.
532;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-05T11:17:04Z;CME to allow renminbi as collateral;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, will allow international investors to use the Chinese currency as collateral for trading in all its futures products from January 2012.The move, announced on Monday, means investors holding renminbi deposits in Hong Kong or other financial centres outside mainland China can use the cash to bet on markets including metals, grains and energy.“It has symbolic significance that the best-known futures exchange in the west has put a stamp of legitimacy on the Chinese currency by accepting it as collateral,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, Hong Kong-based strategist at Crédit Agricole.However he added that CME’s move was unlikely to have any immediate market impact.The exchange said it would cap the amount of renminbi it accepts at $100m, a relatively small figure that reflects the fact that the offshore renminbi is only a few years old and is less liquid than most major currencies.While the renminbi can be used for financial transactions outside the Chinese mainland with few restrictions, Beijing retains substantial controls that prevent the currency from crossing China’s borders. However, Beijing has been slowly relaxing some of those controls as it promotes the renminbi as a global alternative to the US dollar.US-based CME already accepts a wide range of collateral for deposit into trading accounts, including cash from most of the world’s developed markets, as well as gold, asset-backed securities and agency bonds.The renminbi is not the first emerging market currency to be accepted as collateral: traders can also use the Mexican peso and the Turkish lira.Like other exchanges, CME said it was planning to expand further the range of currencies and assets it accepts as collateral.HSBC will serve as CME’s sole clearing custodian in Asia, the exchange said. Under the arrangement, HSBC Hong Kong will hold renminbi deposits from CME clients and allow the use of those deposits as collateral.According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, renminbi deposits in Hong Kong totalled Rmb618.5bn ($97bn) at the end of October, down 0.6 per cent from September but still triple the amount a year ago.CME, which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange, is one of hundreds of global companies seeking to take advantage of greater use of the renminbi outside China’s borders.So far this year, companies including Unilever and Caterpillar have issued the equivalent of $13.4bn in renminbi-denominated debt, known as “dim sum” bonds, though issuance has declined in recent months as investor appetite has cooled.“We’re very seriously growing our presence in Asia and one of the things we want to do is ensure that the products and services that we’re offering here have more of a local applicability,” said Jeremy Hughes, a CME spokesman. “We’re very aware that the vast majority of our products are still US dollar products.”CME already offers futures that track the value of the renminbi against the US dollar, however these are settled in dollars rather than the Chinese currency and have seen low trading volumes since their launch in 2006.
533;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-12-04T17:05:19Z;New rules aim to limit commodities speculation;The futures debacle has overshadowed the introduction of position limits;After months of warnings that excessive regulation would jeopardise commodity markets, the failure of regulation has emerged as a more immediate threat.The warnings related to new limits on commodity speculation, approved by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission in late October, are being considered in Europe.The actual threat came with the October 31 bankruptcy filing of MF Global, one of the world’s largest brokers in commodities.The filing left behind a hole in protected customer accounts that previously eluded regulators. As of late November, authorities were still searching for the missing money, estimated between $600m and $1.2bn.The shortfall left tens of thousands of investors with insufficient capital to back futures trades. MF Global brokered 38,000 commodity accounts, many held by individual investors and commodity trading advisers who bet on their behalf.“There is a crisis of confidence. The only way to solve it is to get the money back and move forward,” says Trace Schmeltz, a lawyer at Barnes & Thornburg representing commodity traders with money trapped at the bankrupt broker.The shortfall has tarnished the futures market, the main venue through which investors gain exposure to the ups and downs of commodity prices. Even when investors purchase exchange traded funds through stock brokers, these funds usually hold baskets of listed futures or swaps linked to futures.“The biggest threat is to the future. It’s that large investor who would have opened a futures account just a month ago, but now chooses not to because he is unsure what would happen to his funds should a bankruptcy occur at his broker of choice,” Attain Capital, a Chicago futures broker, says in an online essay. “How do we make sure that such an investor regains confidence in the industry, and chooses to go ahead with that investment?”CME Group, the largest US futures exchange operator, had primary responsibility for overseeing MF Global’s accounts. It has stumped up a $550m guarantee, plus $50m from a separate trust, to try to free up frozen customer funds to restore confidence to the marketplace.The MF Global debacle has temporarily shifted the focus away from new rules that will impose limits on investors’ holdings in individual commodity markets. Debated for years, the CFTC passed its position limits plan for 28 commodities delivered in the US.The rules are broader than existing position limits, which exist only in futures markets and for the most part only for futures contracts that are on the verge of physical delivery.Now the CFTC will set limits across all contract delivery dates, and apply the same limits to privately traded commodity swap markets that were previously unregulated.The rules engendered fierce debate when first floated, but many commodity investors either say they are generous enough not to affect business or will happen so long in the future that they are not worth worrying about today.John Hyland of US Commodity Funds, sponsors of ETFs tracking the prices of commodities, says limits are “high” for oil and gas, meaning its $1.1bn crude oil and $1.3bn gas funds are “pretty much off the hook”.However Pimco, whose $25bn CommodityRealReturn Strategy Fund invests in commodity derivatives, warned in a regulatory filing that new position limits “may impact that fund’s ability to invest in futures, options and swaps in a manner that meets its investment objective”.In Europe, regulators have advanced proposals to impose position limits. But they are opposed by the UK, where London is a trading centre for oil and metals.Some US regulators have been critical of position limits. Michael Dunn, a former CFTC commissioner, called them a “sideshow that has diverted resources from actions to prevent another financial crisis”, even as he voted to approve them.The first phase of the rules will be imposed on holdings of futures that are on the verge of delivery. Since most investors sell expiring contracts long before they reach this point, the spot limits will have little effect on them.Limits will be extended to all delivery months only after the CFTC has a year’s worth of data on the size of the entire over-the-counter swaps market. This means the rule will not be fully in place before the end of 2012.
534;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-30T16:30:48Z;Tech Beat: OTC clearing moves to real-time;;"Moves by global regulators to push more over-the-counter derivatives (OTC) through clearing is leading to a fundamental overhaul of the technology the industry uses.A stream of news in recent weeks has highlighted the issue. BM&F Bovespa, the Brazilian exchange operator which also operates four clearing houses, chose Cinnober, a Swedish trading technology group, and Calypso Technology, a US peer, to provide the technology for its new multi-asset class central counterparty to evaluate risk.Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, which aims to connect customers to its OTC clearing house by the middle of next year, has started up an upgrade to its platform with work expected to begin this month.Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchanges operator announced it had gone live in Europe with multi-asset class clearing for its Nordic clearing house.For most the first question has been: what do we need? As HKEx admitted: “The core processing of OTC derivatives is much more complex than on-exchange equity derivatives. The new platform not only has to be highly flexible but also needs to meet HKEx’s stringent reliability and resilience standards.”Then the question is: buy or build? Nasdaq OMX has used technology from Genium, its trading platform but other exchanges, lacking either the deep pockets or the experience in the OTC market, have bought expertise and systems from third party providers.Besides BM&FBovespa, Calypso supplies SGX and CME Group and is working with State Street and Wells Fargo. Cinnober expects other exchanges and banks to follow the Brazilian initiative.But one problem is that while the industry knows clearing and transaction volumes will grow, it is unclear by much. Kevin McPartland, an analyst at Tabb Group, the US capital markets consultancy, estimates transaction volumes could increase twentyfold, and market data volumes up to 3-4 times above the current levels.Earlier this year LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house, developed a system with Paris-based Murex capable of handling 25,000 interest rates swaps trades sides per hour and a total portfolio of 4m. It doubled SwapClear’s previous capacity at a stroke but has been designed to scale to 10m trade sides.“As volatility alone can cause rapid intraday deterioration of major counterparty credit quality, a move towards near-time or real-time clearing is inevitable anyway,” said Mr McPartland in a recent report. “OTC derivatives transactions that once took days to clear and settle will be finalised in minutes, if not seconds.”Within a clearing house, the technology can be roughly divided into systems that deal with trade capture, position management, margin calculation, risk management and settlement. It is likely that pressure will grow to compress all the procedures.As has often been pointed out, valuing a credit default swap is far more complex than valuing a standard interest rate swap. Unlike exchange-traded instruments, OTC derivatives were frequently never intended for clearing and processing.The technology will have to manage huge amounts of complex data to calculate both initial margin and variation margin as fast as possible. But that may have two related key sides effects; market parctipants may have to hold more funds in reserve to meet any intra-day margin calls, while clearing houses may require more capital to protect themselves.Traders of OTC derivatives, such as brokers and buy side firms, have not historically had to put up margin for clearing. A smart tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago allows market participants to estimate the amount of collateral they may need from clearing. Tabb estimates, as a worse case scenario, that the industry may need to come up with $2,000bn in capital.And as rules around bank capital begin to bite, market participants will look for operations that tie-up large amounts of capital. It’s probable that there will be a push to reduce clearing times to T+0, to free up capital to use as collateral. Currently the system can take several days.But the calculations are so complex that while a move to real-time clearing may be desirable, it may also be an unattainable goal. This brave new world assumes the system will work – and it’s not a foregone conclusion when you compare with the problems a sophisticated industry like equities trading can experience in stressed periods.Not all are convinced about the benefits of a move to real-time clearing. As clearing house chief executive privately put it: “There’s a general principle that faster is better than slower, but how fast does the CCP need to be? Do you need a CCP to constantly annoy you by grabbing collateral out of your account while you are building a position when you could be flat in an hour?”But Per Anders Häll-Bedman, acting chief executive of Cinnober, pointed out that the risk would therefore still remain in the market. “Clearing members are putting up significant amount of risk intraday. You still would like to know if one of your members is holding a large risk position intraday. Technology makes it possible.”"
535;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-27T16:33:09Z;Brussels backs off automated trades plan;;European regulators have backed off a proposal that automated traders must stay in the markets quoting prices at all times in a sign that Europe might soften aspects of its clampdown on “high-frequency” trading.The European Commission last month published proposals for a sweeping overhaul of the equities, bonds and derivatives markets in Europe, enshrined in a new version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), first enacted in 2007.The revised Mifid aims to inject greater transparency into markets by insisting that a lot of over-the-counter (OTC) market activity is shifted on to fully regulated trading platforms so that prices can be more easily seen by a wide range of market participants.It also aims to “deal with the potential threats for the orderly functioning of markets arising from algorithmic and high-frequency trading”, according to the Commission’s “Mifid II” proposals, unveiled last month.Regulators are concerned that algorithms that are not properly supervised could run amok, disrupting markets. That was highlighted on Friday when CME Group, the US exchange, fined US automated trading group Infinium Capital Management for “failing to diligently supervise its systems”.Regulators also want to find ways of ensuring that automated traders, which make up more than half of activity in US equity markets, stay in the markets, posting prices even at times of stress.The exit of many electronic market-makers amid last year’s “flash crash” in the US – when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged and rebounded in 20 minutes – prompted regulators to consider imposing market-making obligations on such traders.Mifid II stipulates that traders using algorithms ensure that quotes are posted “at competitive prices with the result of providing liquidity on a regular and ongoing basis to [trading venues] at all times, regardless of prevailing market conditions”.But it has been criticised for sweeping up groups such as pension funds that hire banks’ algorithms to get trades done according to specific investment strategies, which have nothing to do with market making.Valérie Ledure, senior policy officer of securities markets at the European Commission, told a conference in London: “We would be open to improving on this position. We are open to any improvement as to how this [requirement] could be phrased.”While the Commission’s Mifid II text is final, it now goes to the European Parliament and Council of Ministers for discussion, with both due to come up with their own versions of Mifid II in coming months.The Commission’s willingness to see revisions to its position signal it is possible that Brussels’ initial stance could be watered down in a compromise version that will emerge between all three versions by the summer of next year.
536;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-25T19:32:50Z;Infinium fined $850,000 for computer malfunctions;Errors highlight the concerns of automated trading;One of the biggest automated trading firms in the US has been slapped with $850,000 in total fines for computer malfunctions that led to it breaking trading rules at CME Group, the futures exchange operator.The penalties handed to Infinium Capital Management, a 10-year-old Chicago trading firm, are among the first fines of their kind and reflect the prevalence of the use of computer algorithms to drive trading in commodity derivatives markets.They also highlight the concerns of many critics of automated – including “high-frequency” – trading about whether trading firms are properly monitoring the reliability of their algorithms before they set them to work in markets.Bart Chilton, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator, and one of the most outspoken critics of what he calls “cheetah traders”, told the Financial Times that the Infinium case highlighted the problem.“These superfast trading systems, when they go feral, can do so in a hurry,” Mr Chilton said. “They are out there trying to scoop up micro-dollars in milliseconds. I do question the value they add to markets. And get this, they aren’t even required to be registered with the regulator. That needs to change.”Last year’s “flash crash”, in which markets plunged and recovered within 20 minutes, heightened worries that rogue automated trades – which make up about half of volume in US equity markets – can disrupt financial markets before humans are able to intervene and shut off the programmes.Automated trading is also under scrutiny in Europe, where the European Commission has proposed that firms engaging in algorithmic trading would also have to provide regulators with a description of their strategies.CME handed Infinium the $850,000 fine for a series of malfunctions in computer trading programmes.In one case, dating back to October 2009, CME accused the firm of “failing to diligently supervise its systems, employees or agents” and said that by “allowing a malfunctioning [automated trading system] to operate in a live trading environment, Infinium committed an act detrimental to the welfare of the exchange”.CME said Infinium had discovered a problem in its computer trading system and had verbally instructed its staff to disable the relevant aspects of its programmes.However, it said the firm did not ensure that they had done so. A few weeks later, the firm’s automated system erroneously bought Nasdaq futures contracts, following which Infinium contacted CME asking the exchange to invoke an erroneous trade rule and adjust the price at which some contracts had been bought.In another case, which occurred in February 2010, a computer malfunction led Infinium’s automated systems to enter 6,767 orders for crude oil futures on CME’s Nymex market. Within 24 seconds, the firm had bought 4,612 contracts before the rest of the order was cancelled.CME said an investigatory panel had found that Infinium had only “back-tested” the malfunctioning algorithm for one or two hours before putting it into the live markets, as opposed to the six-to-eight week time frame laid out in its usual testing protocol. It also noted that the algorithm bypassed the automatic shutdown systems by placing orders for single contracts rather than one large order.“The maximum shutdown units risk parameter was not triggered because the strategy, which was designed to trade an energy-based [exchange traded fund] against crude, had been incorrectly configured to trade crude against the energy-based ETF,” CME noted. “The maximum shutdown units risk parameters had been set to shut down the algorithm based on values for the ETF, not for crude.”CME said that in trying to place trades to offset the error, an Infinium employee had also used another trader’s identification to access the exchange’s trading system – another breach of its rules.Infinium had revealed the trading error and CME’s investigation last year. Chuck Whitman, founder and chief executive of Infinium, said at the time that the incident “was a result of human error in a software test group and the parties associated with this error are no longer with the firm”.According to the terms of the ruling, Infinium agreed to pay the fines without either admitting or denying having violated the exchange’s rules.The CME noted that Infinium had taken “significant steps” since February 2010 to enhance its quality assurance controls and risk protections, bringing it up to the standards recommended by the Futures Industry Association (FIA), the main industry body.Infinium said in an email to the Financial Times: “During the past two years, since these trades occurred, Infinium Capital Management has diligently worked to create some of the most robust systems in the industry. We have significantly enhanced our Quality Assurance processes as well as our electronic execution risk protocols. We have also been committed to help the industry establish standards through participation in the FIA-PTG initiatives as well as the Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) that has been created to advise the CFTC.“We understand the value that we provide to serve as a liquidity provider in the various markets in which we trade. We remain committed to facilitating orderly markets and establishing minimum industry standards so that similar errors are not brought to the marketplace by ourselves or other trading firms.”

the second quarter of this year.“The company has been buying its own stock high and is now selling it low. It’s not exactly a textbook strategy from a capital management perspective,” said Barton Crockett, an entertainment analyst at Lazard Capital.Elsewhere stocks fell on Tuesday, as a downward revision to US third-quarter growth figures put paid to hopes of a rally after Monday’s sell-off.The S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,188.04, stuck below 1,200, a level it breached for the first time in a month on Monday.With trading volumes light, Colin Cieszynski at CMC Markets warned the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday could drive further losses. “Getaway day traders may have closed out positions and be unwilling to take on new positions over an extended weekend,” he said.The Nasdaq Composite index was off just 0.1 per cent to 2,521.28, given ballast by Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, which was up 2 per cent to $376.51, after Jefferies said Apple had not cut orders to suppliers for iPads by as much as other research firms have suggested.The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent per cent to 11,508.97.Hewlett-Packard closed down 0.8 per cent at $26.65. The computer maker fell as low $25.25 in early trading as investors reacted with dismay to the company’s pessimistic outlook for 2012.A downward adjustment to fiscal 2012 guidance had been widely expected, but the scale took analysts by surprise: new chief executive Meg Whitman predicted full-year earnings per share of $4, well below the $4.56 median analyst prediction, with the company downbeat on both consumer and business demand.Jeffrey Fidacaro, a computer analyst at Susquehanna, said HP had at least frontloaded bad news.”We believe this could provide a conservative floor to prudently set up the stock for estimate increases from here,” he told clients.Strong earnings boosted Medtronic. Shares in the medical research group surged 4.5 per cent to $34.75, after profits for the quarter ended October 28 jumped 50 per cent compared with the same period in 2010.Declining soup sales knocked Campbell’s, which fell 5.3 per cent to $31.84, as quarterly profits fell 4 per cent year on year.Starwood Hotels and Resorts slipped 4.7 per cent to $45.39 after Nomura analyst Harry Curtis, lowered earnings estimates, citing the company’s strong exposure to Europe. Starwood derives as much as 12 per cent of total earnings from the continent, twice as much as rivals such as Marriott International.Nvidia continued to benefit from widespread reports that it will supply semiconductors for the next generation of Apple MacBooks. Shares rose 3.1 per cent to $15.08 putting the stock up 8.3 per cent for the week, and only 3 per cent off for the year.Fellow semiconductor stock Analog Devices fell 3 per cent $33.32, after the company revealed the extent of the fall in orders through the third quarter.Gilead Sciences bounced back somewhat from its 10 per cent fall on Monday, as investors got over the initial shock of the $11bn price tag it agreed to pay for Pharmasset.The stock traded 6.9 per cent higher at $38.76, as analysts weighed up the long-term potential of the acquisition. “We believe that this makes a lot of sense and will provide Gilead with a highly synergistic asset with a very long tail,” Yaron Werber at Citigroup wrote to clients.Groupon fell 14.9 per cent to $20.07, within touching distance of its $20 debut price, with options traders buying puts for the right to sell the stock for as little as $13.Gold miner Newmont Mining prospered in market volatility yet again, up
0.8 per cent to $65.79, with bearish investors possibly seeking exposure to gold.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent, but the big US banks avoided hefty losses.Jefferies, whose European exposures and funding model have come in for intense scrutiny, was down 1.4 per cent to $10.06.The IntercontinentalExchange was up 1.5 per cent to $115.91, as the derivatives exchange benefited from negative sentiment towards its larger rival the CME Group.The CME was partially responsible for regulating MF Global, the broker-dealer which filed for bankruptcy at the start of the month. CME shares were 0.4 per cent lower at $240.57."

It is not clear if Mr Corzine has agreed to appear before the panel. If he is subpoenaed to testify, he could invoke his constitutional right against self incrimination. His lawyer, Andrew Levander, could not immediately be reached. Gary Naftalis, Mr Abelow’s attorney, also could not be reached.The congressional hearing is the latest government effort to unravel what led to missing hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds at MF Global.That figure grew on Monday when the bankruptcy court-appointed trustee surprised traders by announcing the shortfall in customer accounts is now estimated to be $1.2bn or more, nearly double early estimates of $600m by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Washington futures watchdog.CME Group, the futures exchange operator responsible for overseeing MF Global, on Tuesday dismissed the bankruptcy trustee’s estimate that the hole in the collapsed broker-dealer’s customer accounts could be as much as $1.2bn.“While the final accounting of customer segregated assets and claims will occur in the bankruptcy process, CME Group is confident that recent reports of significantly larger customer segregated shortfalls are incorrect,” the company said. The exchange group refused to specify what figure it believed was missing, but indicated it is likely to be closer to the $600m figure mentioned by the CFTC.The missing funds have cast an uncomfortable spotlight on CME, prompting accusations that self-regulation within the financial industry does not work and shaking confidence in the security of customer funds.At a court hearing Tuesday in lower Manhattan, James Kobak, a lawyer for the trustee, said the estimated shortfall could go up but said he hoped it could also go down.The trustee also announced he would receive an additional $1.3bn in cash, foreign currencies and securities from Harris Bank, where MF Global had a Chicago account, a spokesman said. The customer cash held in the Harris account was frozen after MF Global filed for bankruptcy and will now flow back to the trustee to be distributed to customers. That brings the total amount of money on hand that can be returned to customers to about $5bn, the trustee’s spokesman said.CME also said on Tuesday it was offering an additional $300m financial guarantee – weeks after it originally offered $300m – to the trustee to increase the pay-out to customers from their frozen trading accounts from 60 per cent to 75 per cent.There is about $5.45bn in customer funds that MF Global was required to keep segregated from its own funds. A spokesman said the trustee will not know if that is the actual amount due to customers until claims are evaluated.The trustee was aware of the funds held at the Harris account but did not have it in his possession, he said, so it would not reduce the estimated customer shortfall. The spokesman said that was the last big pot of MF Global money they were aware of.To date the trustee has distributed $1.5bn in collateral and another $520m in cash to MF Global customers. Mr Kobak, the lawyer for the trustee, said next week he planned to seek the judge’s permission to make all customers whole by up to 60 per cent of their account’s value.
539;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-22T20:46:08Z;JPMorgan to buy MF Global’s LME stake;;JPMorgan Chase is to buy MF Global’s stake in the London Metal Exchange, making the US bank the largest shareholder in the historic institution as it prepares for a potential bidding war.The deal implies that the LME, the centre for global metals trading, is worth just over £530m ($828m) – the first public valuation of the exchange since it revealed in September that it would initiate a sales process after being approached by more than 10 suitors.JPMorgan will buy the 4.7 per cent LME stake for about £25m – or just over £40 a share – from KPMG, the administrator of MF Global’s UK arm, according to two people familiar with the situation. The last time LME shares changed hands, when Goldman Sachs bought the shareholding of Lehman Brothers’ European arm in July, they traded at a price of just 492½p.LME shareholders are hoping that bids will value the exchange in excess of £1bn, which if achieved would put JPMorgan in line for a healthy profit. One of the people familiar with the deal said there could be some “upside” for JPMorgan if the exchange was sold.However, some shareholders believe the weakening of the global economy since the LME’s first announcement may make an eventual sale less likely.“I think the mood has changed,” one top 10 shareholder said. “It has just taken a lot of fizz off it.”Ownership of the LME is restricted to its 90-odd members. JPMorgan will become the largest shareholder with a 10.9 per cent stake, giving the bank, one of the largest metals dealers after its purchase of Sempra from RBS last year, a greater influence over the outcome of the sales process.Other leading LME shareholders include Goldman Sachs, with 9.5 per cent, Metdist, a privately owned metals trader, with 9.4 per cent, and UBS, with 4.3 per cent.JPMorgan will also purchase 25,000 “B shares” in the LME, which confer trading rights but not ownership, for about £2m, the people said.The deal to buy the ordinary shares and B shares is likely to be announced within days, according to people familiar with the situation.The LME shares attracted “an awful lot of interest”, a person familiar with the sales process said, making them one the most coveted assets in the US brokerage’s bankruptcy.The LME is likely to open its books to inspection by potential buyers in the next few weeks. Likely bidders include CME Group, the US exchange, SGX, the Singapore exchange, and IntercontinentalExchange, a CME rival.The idea of a sale has divided the LME’s members, with some reluctant to give up control of the exchange while others are keen to profit from their shareholdings.JPMorgan, KPMG and the LME all declined to comment.
540;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-18T19:24:41Z;Bears dominate Wall Street despite positive data;Major indices finish week down sharply;US markets spent the week threatening to break free from their eurozone shackles, only to be thwarted as the threat of contagion reared its head again.Bullish investors pointed to a flurry of positive US economic data – new unemployment claims fell to their lowest since April, while retail sales accelerated in October – but bears remained transfixed by sovereign bond yields in Europe, which spiked during the week.A warning from Fitch Ratings an hour before markets closed on Wednesday on US banks’ exposures to eurozone sovereign debt settled the tussle decisively in favour of the bears. The S&P 500 tumbled 2 per cent in an hour, turning a modest gain into a heavy loss.”Europe has been driving the market for a long time, and it will be driving the market for a long time to come,” said Channing Smith, a fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.The financial sector of the S&P 500 ended the week off 5.6 per cent, yet again falling more than any other sector.The investment bank Jefferies plumbed new year lows of $9.50 on Thursday, as yields on its benchmark 2018 bond soared above ten per cent, amid fears of interbank lending strain. The bank has been trying to reassure investors that its eurozone exposures are manageable. Shares recovered somewhat but were still ended the week down 9.6 per cent to $10.16.Other investment banks, which investors target when the eurozone is in the news, also fell. Morgan Stanley was down 13.1 per cent to $14.21 and Goldman Sachs was off 9.6 per cent to $91.91.The bankruptcy of MF Global continued to cast a shadow over the CME Group, the futures exchange, partially responsible for regulating the broker.The CME fell another 5.6 per cent this week to $248.89, as regulators publicly floated responses to the MF Global collapse.“We still think CME’s futures business remains strong,” said Alex Kramm, exchanges analyst at UBS. “But investors have no way of knowing what the regulatory fallout from the MF Global bankruptcy will be, so it’s no surprise the shares are soft.”The S&P 500 was closed the week down 3.8 per cent, trading at 1,215.66, its worst week since an awful September.The Dow Jones was off 2.9 per cent to 11,796.23, given ballast by Boeing, which ended the week up 0.8 per cent to 67.46, after securing its largest ever civilian aircraft deal from Emirates.The Nasdaq Composite index was down 4 per cent to 2,572.5.Despite the positive October sales data, several high profile retailers sold off after posting disappointing quarterly results.Abercrombie & Fitch fell 16.7 per cent to $47.30, as a high profile bet on European growth failed to pay off. Quarterly earnings per share of 56 cents were a full 15 cents lower than expected, as sales at flagship European stores disappointed.Walmart, whose exposure to value seekers normally helps it outperform in a falling market, fell 3.3 per cent to $57.23. The discount retailer reported sales growth at its US operation for the first time in two years, but analysts were alarmed by the large spending on discounts and special offers required to drive those sales.Sears slumped 13.5 per cent to $64.27, as its quarterly losses widened by almost 50 per cent compared to the same period in 2010. The loss of $2.57 a share followed a poor performance at the department store chain’s Canadian subsidiary.Midwestern oil refiners took a hit on news that the flow in a key oil pipeline will be reversed, alleviating the glut of West Texas Intermediate crude oil at Cushing, Oklahoma.Refiners with access to the WTI crude have benefited from cheap oil, but the discount of WTI compared to Brent crude narrowed sharply on the news.HollyFrontier, which is almost completely dependent on WTI crude, fell 14.4 per cent to $24.38. Other refiners were affected. Shares in Tesoro fell 16 per cent to $23.69. Although WTI only accounts for 20 per cent of Tesoro’s output, Citigroup had expected that output to produce 60 per cent of 2012 earnings.Semiconductor stocks had a volatile week with the Philadelphia Sox index tumbling 5.2 per cent.NetApp slumped 17.6 per cent to $34.74 after lowering guidance for the current quarter. The data-storage products maker blamed “unexpected weakness” at nine large accounts, and some analysts gave management the benefit of the doubt.“In our view, NetApp’s woes seem to be macro and competitive in nature and not due to execution mis-steps,” JPMorgan analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote to clients.Applied Materials fell 11.8 per cent to $11.23, despite unveiling solid profits of 34 cents a share in the third quarter.Orders from solar panel manufacturers for the company’s semiconductor products tumbled almost 75 per cent quarter-on-quarter to just $86m, forcing the company to lower forecasts for the current quarter, as solar firms cut back on expansion.Micron Technology jumped 15.8 per cent to $16.20, after a jury dismissed claims it had colluded with Korean firm Hynix Semiconductor to fix the prices of computer memory chips.Additional reporting by Johanna Kassel and Jason Abbruzzese
541;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-18T18:31:33Z;Quick View: Are DB/NYSE’s remedies enough?;;"A slight opening of the kimono, no more revealing than that.That is how to understand the remedies offered by Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext on Thursday to the antitrust team at the European Commission – especially if you are a competitor.For weeks speculation had been rife over whether the German-US groups would bite the bullet and accede to demands (mostly from rivals and some banks) that the merged entity would allow “open access” to Eurex Clearing.They did allow open access, but only up to a point. Which is entirely the point.In their own words, they propose to “grant unprecedented third-party access to Eurex Clearing for derivatives product innovations taking advantage of the merged entities clearing services. The clearing services would be provided on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis and include cross margining.”This sounds good, and at least one analyst seized on this on Friday as evidence that the Börse and NYSE are addressing Commission concerns over the vertical silo.Not really.This open access concession only applies to future “innovative” products that rivals might dream up (and good luck with that one; innovation in futures is far harder than it was before the eurodollar and euribor contracts were invented).Existing products at NYSE Liffe (euribor) and at Eurex (Euro Stoxx index futures) would be ringfenced, protected.That means that the London Stock Exchange could quite happily create a futures contract on the probability that the Occupy London Stock Exchange protesters will return to the steps of St Paul’s Cathedral in 2012. It could be traded on Turquoise and cleared at Eurex Clearing.No big deal.What the LSE wants is the ability to launch “lookalike” Liffe and Eurex products and that they be cleared, complete with cross-margining with the existing Eurex and Liffe products, at Eurex Clearing.But that way lies the erosion of the silo and undermines the rationale of the merger, if you are DB/NYSE.As for the proposal to divest European single equity derivatives businesses, this certainly addresses the Commission’s stated concerns about business overlaps.NYSE Euronext would divest its pan-European single equity derivatives business, including Bclear, except the options businesses in its home markets, while Deutsche Börse would divest its respective business.Again, big deal. This business accounts for about 1 per cent of combined group sales, according to Berenberg Bank.As to why there were no remedies offered on the question of opening up index licensing, DB/NYSE insists on seeing this as intellectual property rights issue. In what you might call the “Coca-Cola formula” argument, they say no exchange should be forced to give up to rivals the IP embedded in their ownership of index businesses.To which the counter argument – and a good one – is of course that no exchange should be allowed index IP in perpetuity, just as no pharmaceuticals company is allowed an eternal product patent.Why, then, were the remedies so modest?First, this is not necessarily the parties’ last and final offer. What happens next is a series of “market tests” where the Commisison takes what DB/NYSE have proposed and runs it by not only competitors but also customers (who might take a slightly less negative view than rivals).Second, if full open access had been offered, this would have set a precedent ahead of Mifid/Mifir, where the issue of the silo is front and centre. Far better to offer a halfway house, then wait and see if the pro-competition provisions in Mifid/Mifir survive the lobbying and political process next year.In other words, Deutsche Börse and NYSE don’t want to preordain that outcome. Why?Not being willing to open up the silo – and destroy the rationale for the merger – DB/NYSE have at least handed the Commission a clear commitment to open it up to some degree. And it’s worth remembering that as modest as this may seem it is unprecedented; no silo has done even this much.And the parties, by focusing on offering open access to “innovative products” are at least playing to a key concern that the Commission is known to have, namely that a merger would prevent the ability of rivals to create and launch new products successfully.Ultimately – whether further remedies are offered after market tests or not – the calculation must be that this will give Joaquín Almunia, EU Competition Commissioner, enough to be able to demonstrate that he and his case team did force an unprecedented change in market structure and that the rest can be done through Mifid and Mifir.At least one analyst has interpreted these remedies as a big positive for the merger. One says it “may well concede just enough to secure competition approval”.I wouldn’t go that far.There are still two big antitrust problems. One is the antitrust case team’s view that derivatives markets are regional, not global, and that the OTC markets do not compete with exchanges – both issues on which DB/NYSE take the opposite view.I still fail to grasp how Brussels cannot see that the listed, exchange-traded derivatives markets are global.First, the move from floor to screen – which began in Frankfurt at Deutsche Terminbörse and spread to Chicago’s futures exchanges in the early 2000s – turned what were regional markets into global ones.John Lothian, a broker and veteran Chicago-based commentator on these markets and the exchanges in them, says: “Since markets moved from floors to screens it has unified them, so they [the exchanges] now compete globally. I have the air miles to prove it.”CME Group’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange and NYSE Liffe may offer interest rate futures denominated in the currencies of their respective jurisdictions, but it would be a mistake to then conclude that they operate in two distinct markets that don’t compete.To the contrary, these exchanges’ customer base is global. It’s about building a network – through technology and distribution – that encourages traders from wherever they may be in the world to trade those products in preference to the competition’s.CME wants a trader in Dublin to be trading more eurodollar futures on its own Globex platform, not more euribor futures on Liffe’s platform. Eurex wants a futures trading shop in Singapore to be trading more Euro Stoxx futures, not more of the CME’s S&P index futures.That’s why CME and Eurex both have offices in Singapore – to sell to these customers globally.CME has just moved into new office space in London as it expands its European business. It actually bases its global FX and metals businesses in the UK capital. In fact the only business left that it runs out of its home base in Chicago these days is agricultural products.Time is running out and although the Commission has until January 23 to decide, I suspect things will move to a conclusion before then.If Brussels still insists that these markets are European for the purpose of this antitrust case, then DB/NYSE will have to hope that politics kicks in and that Berlin will bring pressure to bear, using the argument – laid out in DB/NYSE’s Friday press release – that Europe needs to have a “regulated, stable and transparent European counterweight to established market centres in America and Asia”.Meanwhile there are other risks. There are worrying signs that the inability of the US and Europe to harmonise their interpretation and implementation of the G20 regulatory reforms could result in a “Balkanisation” of market structures along regional lines. You can see this in the emerging protectionism of Dodd-Frank extraterritoriality and “third country provisions” in Mifid/Mifir.One might question the wisdom of trying to create a transatlantic exchange behemoth on top of this, with all the attendant cross-jurisdictional complexities (to say nothing of the implementation challenge).Second, the eurozone crisis has changed the calculus too. The outlook for volumes is fairly grim, and we still have the prospect of a financial transaction tax in some form. Neither was even on the horizon when the DB/NYSE merger was unveiled in February.If I were to predict an outcome, I‘d say there is an even chance that this deal doesn’t get done, we revert to status quo ante, and we close a sorry chapter on a year of failed exchange mergers with the epitaph: these deals are just not possible any more."
542;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-18T16:14:49Z;Vultures circle MF Global’s stake in LME;;MF Global’s shares in the London Metal Exchange have emerged as one of the most coveted assets as the bankrupt brokerage is wound down.The broker’s UK arm, which was one of 12 dealers on the LME’s open outcry ring, held a 4.7 per cent stake in the historic exchange, making it the fourth-largest shareholder.It comes as the administrator winding down the London-based division of MF Global said it may give clients some funds before it settled all of the failed futures broker’s final positions.Shares in the LME, the centre for global metals trading, have attracted a wave of interest after the exchange revealed in September that it would initiate a sales process after being approached by more than 10 suitors.“A whole raft of people are interested” in MF Global’s LME stake, a person familiar with the situation said. JPMorgan, the third-largest LME shareholder and one of the leading banks in commodities, is among the parties to have expressed interest, the person added, “along with several other members of the LME”.If the US bank is successful, it would become the largest shareholder with 10.9 per cent. Other large LME shareholders include Goldman Sachs with 9.5 per cent, Metdist, a privately owned metals trader, with 9.4 per cent, and UBS, with 4.3 per cent.Ownership of the 130-year-old exchange is restricted to its 90-odd members. Any bidder of MF Global’s stake must therefore either be a member of the exchange or in the process of obtaining membership, according to the LME.Shares rarely come on the market. The most recent trade in LME shares was the sale of the shareholding of Lehman Brothers’ European arm, which was bought by Goldman Sachs in July at a price of 492½p.At that price, MF Global’s shares would be worth about £3m ($4.7m). However, LME shareholders are expecting bids for the exchange worth more than £1bn, giving MF Global’s stake a potential value of as much as £47m ($75m).“That MF Global is under administration is irrelevant, the LME stake is a very sellable, standalone asset,” said Richard Fleming, UK head of restructuring at KPMG, the administrator. “Whether we sell it next week or in several months’ time is irrelevant. We’ll only sell it at the right time and price.” Buyers are also lining up for MF Global’s metals trading team, Mr Fleming said: “The metals trading team has attracted interest as well.”Another large shareholder told the Financial Times he had received “a lot of calls” regarding his company’s LME shares. The LME is likely to open its books to inspection by potential buyers in the next few weeks. Likely bidders include CME Group, the US exchange, SGX, the Singapore exchange, and IntercontinentalExchange, a CME rival.The idea of a sale has divided the LME’s members, with some reluctant to give up control of the exchange while others are keen to profit from their shareholdings.The most aggressive acquirer of LME shares in the past two years has been Goldman Sachs, which has more than quadrupled its stake to become the largest shareholder. JPMorgan’s interest in acquiring MF Global’s LME shares was first reported by Sky News. JPMorgan declined to comment.Separately KPMG, administrator of the UK fund, said the return of client money would be dependent on establishing the size of claims against funds held in designated client money accounts and the non-segregated monies.“Final distributions to clients will not be made until all client risk positions have been liquidated or transferred and all claims against have been validated,” KPMG said. “However, we are likely to make interim distributions along the way.”KPMG expects to take several months to help liquidate or transfer open positions held by the broker for more than 10,000 customers
543;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:46:42+0000;Tie-up between index giants could help smaller players;The Dow Jones/S&P union creates a behemoth, but could boost competition;The tie-up unveiled this month between McGraw Hill and the CME Group will bring the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 together under one roof and change the landscape of the indexing business, according to some commentators.The parent companies announced the agreement on November 4 after what Harold McGraw, McGraw-Hill’s chief executive, said had been more than a year of discussions.McGraw-Hill, owner of Standard & Poor’s, will control 73 per cent of the joint venture, while CME, the biggest US futures exchange operator by revenues, which bought most of Dow Jones Indices last year, will own 24.4 per cent. Dow Jones will own the remaining 2.6 per cent.Critics of the deal have raised various concerns, including what the tangible benefits are – if any – for end investors and product providers.Sunand Menon, managing director, indices, at Thomson Reuters, a relatively recent entrant to the index provision business, says: “One of the reasons why we entered the index space was because our clients strongly voiced pricing concerns with existing ‘big brand’ index providers, and wanted a more economic and flexible alternative.“Since a tie-up like this likely amplifies clients’ already existing concerns surrounding the lack of commercial and service flexibility, the deal could be the proverbial ‘straw that breaks the camel’s back’,” he says.Alex Matturri, executive managing director at S&P Indices, who will lead the joint venture with CME, disputes the claims. When asked if the firm’s tie-up with CME may have any negative consequences for clients, he says: “Actually, it is the opposite.“While there are clearly cost synergies that will come out of this transaction, from the product side, we feel the deal is additive.“Customers will be better served by being able to license indices from both families from the same point of contact. From a customer standpoint, this will make things easier as there will be one source for all their indexing needs,” he says.He adds that as the combined business will be bigger it will have “more resources to devote to new product development and research”, allowing the firm to “launch new products faster”.On whether the deal would result in a price drop for clients, S&P Indices says: “Unfortunately, we don’t comment on the specific fee details of our licensing agreements.”However, it adds: “All our clients will directly benefit from the joint venture’s ability to deliver innovative, index-based investment solutions quickly across a wide-range of asset classes and regions.”Asked the same question, Scot Warren, CME’s managing director, equity products and index services, says: “We believe the joint venture will be able to develop new index products more rapidly to meet the growing demand of our global customers, continuing both companies’ strong track record of innovation in complementary products.”The new company, called S&P/Dow Jones Indices, will initially have annual revenues of more than $400m when the deal is expected to close in the first half of next year. Mr McGraw said that was expected to rise to $435m by the end of 2012.Competitor Baer Pettit, managing director and head of the MSCI index business, says of the deal: “The S&P/Dow Jones combination will make them a stronger player in the US domestic market. However, we find clients are taking an increasingly global view, which plays to our strengths.“Exchanges clearly want to maximise returns from their index businesses [and] we believe there remains a strong case for index providers being wholly independent.”The deal will also be beneficial for smaller index providers in the market, adds Mr Menon at Thomson Reuters.“We believe there is sufficient growth in the industry for a number of index providers to co-exist. Scale is certainly an important factor, however a consolidation of this size may actually drive index customers to seek diversification in order to avoid being overly dependent on one of the larger providers.”CME bought its 90 per cent stake in Dow Jones Indexes from News Corp last year for $613m, helping the media company recoup part of the cost of buying the publisher of the Wall Street Journal in 2007. The managing editor of the Wall Street Journal still chooses the Dow’s components.
544;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;UK staff cut as court frees MF Global cash;Some $520m to be distributed to customers with frozen accounts;MF Global’s UK arm is to axe more than half its workforce of about 725 as KPMG, its special administrator, winds down the overseas operations of the failed US-based futures broker.A further 300 London-based employees have been asked to stay on by KPMG for several months to help liquidate or transfer open positions held by the broker for more than 10,000 customers.The job cuts come as the trustee liquidating MF Global’s US brokerage business won a court order to distribute $520m of cash to customers whose accounts had been frozen.Last month’s bankruptcy filing left thousands of customers around the world unable to access cash they use to backstop futures trading positions. Resolving the issues has been complicated following the discovery of a $600m hole in the customer accounts of the US business.CME Group, the US exchange responsible for supervising MF Global’s futures brokerage, moved on Thursday to quash reports that it discovered the missing funds prior to the broker’s collapse on October 31 and failed to inform regulators immediately.Daniel Harris, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, suggested in a research note on Wednesday that the exchange group might not have communicated the missing funds to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Washington futures watchdog, as soon as it learnt of them. “CME has been under pressure owing to worries it may face liability over the timing of its communication with the CFTC following discovery of a shortfall in MF Global’s segregated client accounts,” Mr Harris wrote.CME hit back by insisting it had followed CFTC requirements and its own rules. “CME was advised in the early hours of Monday October 31 that there was an actual shortfall in the segregated funds account and was told the CFTC was advised concurrently,” the exchange group said. “Shortly thereafter, CME Group discussed the shortfall in a conference call with the CFTC and other regulators.”CME said it was “confident that it complied with all its obligations as a DSRO [designated self-regulatory organisation].”The UK business was one of MF’s largest overseas operations. Of the retained staff in London, about half are expected to remain until the end of January, with the rest staying until the end of April. The staff, taken from across the business, face reconciling client monies, client assets and claims processing for millions of trades on more than 70 exchanges. In some cases, administrators have been forced to revert to time-consuming manual accounting entries.Liquidators on both sides of the Atlantic have been working with clearing houses and exchanges to transfer MF Global’s customer positions.Some positions are understood to be so complex, KPMG has warned that some employees could be retained for months or even years.Last week, James Giddens, the trustee of the US brokerage, terminated more than 1,000 employees with immediate effect but then rehired 150-200 of its former employees to assist in the wind-down of the business and processing of bankruptcy claims.
545;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-17T10:08:37Z;Pipeline switch helps CME’s WTI woes;Oil benchmark jumps above $100 on Seaway reversal;You could practically hear cheers coming from the Nymex building in Manhattan on Wednesday.Two companies had just announced plans to reverse a pipeline in a move that will relieve stocks around Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures.West Texas Intermediate, as the futures contract is known, zoomed back above $100 a barrel and further left behind what had become a bizarre discount to other oils on the global market.The reversal of the Seaway pipeline, if it comes to pass, will have important consequences from Canada’s tar sands to Gulf of Mexico refineries to Washington, where regulators are reviewing the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that would partly parallel it.Later on Wednesday, Keystone builder TransCanada told analysts it may move ahead with a section of that line connecting Cushing with the Gulf.But among the parties with the most at stake is Nymex, or more properly its parent, Chicago’s CME Group.WTI is CME’s flagship energy futures contract and the company defends it as the standard by which to measure the global price of oil.That status has become dubious in the past year as WTI lagged behind other crude streams, including Brent traded on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange and Light Louisiana Sweet along the Gulf. Last month the Brent-WTI spread reached a jaw-dropping $28.Earlier this year refiner Valero bashed WTI as irrelevant, while Delta Air Lines largely dropped it as a way to hedge fuel costs. Last month the Dow Jones-UBS commodity index, which happens to be marketed by a CME Group subsidiary, said it will add Brent to its basket of futures for the first time.A key reason why WTI has lagged behind is a lack of pipelines that have prevented arbitrageurs from buying up high stocks of cheap crude around Cushing and sending them to the Gulf, closing the price gap in the process. So CME took the uncommon step of publicly congratulating the pipeline companies Enbridge and Enterprise Products Partners for their plans to reverse Seaway to run from instead of to Cushing.“We believe this new project will enhance the significance of our Nymex Light Sweet Crude Oil (WTI) benchmark,” the CME said.The pipeline reversal plan suggests that problems such as WTI’s severe discount are self-correcting. A $28-a-barrel discount is just too tempting for a trader, or a pipeline company, to pass up. As one oil derivatives dealer emailed me: “Finally the levee breaks.”Seaway’s own history illustrates the interplay of market forces and infrastructure. Built to move crude to Cushing, it converted to natural gas service in 1984 before being enlisted to carry crude again in 1996, according to a study CME commissioned last year. This is just the latest fix.
546;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-16T23:00:16Z;US crude jumps on pipeline reversal plan;;US crude oil futures sprang back above $100 a barrel on plans to reverse a key pipeline that would reconnect the supply of West Texas Intermediate to global markets.Enbridge, a Canadian pipeline company, said it would pay ConocoPhillips $1.15bn to buy a 50 per cent stake in the Seaway pipeline and, together with co-owner Enterprise Products Partners, would reverse it to run south from landlocked Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf of Mexico.The plan had important implications for energy markets. Elevated stocks in and around Cushing, the delivery point for West Texas Intermediate crude listed by CME Group, have caused the oil blend to trade at a severe discount to similar oil types, challenging its status as a benchmark.The plan unveiled Wednesday is the first attempt to reverse an existing pipeline to help drain Cushing’s 32m barrels in inventories.“The bottleneck is being resolved,” said Antoine Halff, economist at the Energy Information Administration in Washington. “This is going to cause inventories to rebalance and prices to realign between inland and coastal locations.”US crude for December delivery rose $3.22 to $102.59 a barrel, surpassing $100 for the first time since July. Brent, the benchmark linked to North Sea oilfields, fell 30 cents to $111.88. Last month the US benchmark briefly dipped to a $28-a-barrel discount to Brent.Andy Lipow, president of consultants Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said: “The spread could continue to narrow as any crude oil inventory overhang is moved down to the Gulf coast.”Betting on the spread has become a popular trade among hedge funds and trading houses, with some analysts arguing that the glut around Cushing could cause the spread to blow out to more than $40. Barges and trains already handle some of the surplus.The pipeline plans also hit shares of US refining companies that have enjoyed discounted oils linked to Cushing. CVR Energy fell 16.3 per cent, HollyFrontier was down 10 per cent and Western Refining dropped 13.5 per cent.“For Midwest refineries, it’s welcome back to reality,” said Michael Wittner, oil analyst at Société Générale.Enbridge and Enterprise said that the reversed line could carry 150,000 barrels a day by the second quarter of 2012. By early 2013, capacity would rise to 400,000 b/d.As the US state department extends a review of TransCanada’s Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada’s oil sands to Texas amid environmental concerns, the Seaway project could help deliver similar crude to Texas by a different route. Cushing’s stocks have soared with an influx from Canada, the US’s largest foreign crude supplier, and North Dakota.Enbridge and Enterprise had earlier proposed a new, 800,000 b/d pipeline from Cushing to Houston called Wrangler. That project will now be incorporated into Seaway, Enterprise said.“The Seaway Pipeline reversal provides an early opportunity to offer Gulf coast access to midcontinent producers and other crude oil shippers,” said Patrick Daniel, Enbridge chief executive. “A Seaway reversal will provide capacity to move secure, reliable supply to Texas Gulf coast refineries, offsetting supplies of imported crude”.
547;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-16T20:21:38Z;Fresh call to limit use of futures customer funds;;Washington regulators will next month resuscitate a proposal to limit how futures brokers use customer funds in the wake of the collapse of MF Global.The broker’s bankruptcy filing last month left behind a $600m shortfall in safeguarded customer accounts that has hampered transfers of trading positions and tarnished the US futures market.The debacle has revived calls for stronger broker oversight, including the customer funds proposal that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shelved in July after lobbying by MF Global and other brokers.Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, said the regulator would now take up the proposal at a meeting on December 5.“It’s next on the list,” he told reporters at a conference in Chicago, the centre of the US futures industry and home of CME Group, the biggest US futures exchange operator.US law requires futures brokerages to hold customer funds apart from house funds. Investigators are probing whether MF Global illegally commingled funds in the days before its bankruptcy on October 31.The CFTC has since 2000 allowed brokers to invest customer funds in a wide variety of assets, including corporate notes, foreign sovereign debt and money-market funds. In October 2010, the agency proposed to narrow the scope of investment options to eliminate “instruments that may pose an unacceptable level of risk”, including foreign sovereign debt and in-house repurchase agreements, or borrowing customer funds for a short period to buy securities.Mr Gensler, a Democrat, said such “widenings” had failed to serve the public interest. Although Mr Gensler, who has recused himself from the MF Global investigation, refused to be drawn on the specific failures in that case, he said: “I can’t be comfortable enough [that the current system serves] to protect customers.”Mr Gensler said he favours restricting the use of customer money to money-market funds, US Treasuries and sovereign debt. Investing excess customer collateral is a big source of revenue for futures brokers.Scott O’Malia, a Republican member of the commission, said separately that the agency “must reconsider” the proposal to limit investment of customer funds, though he added: “Somewhat prematurely, this proposal is being hailed as the solution to the MF Global problem.”About 17,000 MF Global customers with open accounts have been able to transfer positions and some of their futures collateral to other brokers. But traders who liquidated positions to cash before the bankruptcy have seen their accounts frozen.James Giddens, the MF Global bankruptcy trustee, is seeking court approval to transfer 60 per cent of this cash for more than 20,000 MF Global futures customers, totalling $520m. The trustee is holding some money back until the size of the shortfall is quantified.
548;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;MF Global trustee hunts missing funds;;The hunt for customer funds continued at MF Global, the failed futures broker.US authorities and the trustee overseeing the broker’s liquidation have been combing through what they described as a thicket of records and a convoluted cash trail to find about $600m in margin money missing since MF Global filed for bankruptcy on October 31.The shortfall meant 17,000 US futures accounts transferred from MF Global to other brokers arrived with insufficient margin money to back trading positions. Then CME Group, the exchange operator overseeing the transfer, froze what funds were transferred as it verified the accounts.MF Global customers who had liquidated their accounts as the brokerage teetered had no access to their cash as a bankruptcy court ordered only the transfer of funds backing open positions.IntercontinentalExchange, another futures exchange, asked a judge to free as much money as possible, warning that the court had “created an inadvertent preference in favour of those customers who did nothing in response to MF Global’s financial condition, and operated against those customers who acted quickly and responsibly to reduce their exposure to MF Global”.Accounts are also being transferred in other markets where MF Global had a presence, from the UK to Hong Kong.The failure of the futures broker claimed more victims on Friday as the trustee announced that MF Global’s 1,066 brokerage employees had been fired.The collapse of MF Global, one of the world’s largest commodity brokers, rocked the futures industry. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced it would review more than 120 other US futures brokers to ensure customer funds are safe.
549;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:46:42+0000;CME offers $300m to MF Global customers;Exchange in damage limitation as 900 jobs go at broker-dealer;CME Group, the biggest US futures exchange operator, scrambled to contain damage from the failure of broker-dealer MF Global by offering $300m to help customers recover their money.MF Global’s bankruptcy filing last week and the discovery of an almost $600m hole in its customer accounts left thousands unable to access cash they use to backstop futures trading positions. The shortfall threatens the integrity of futures markets and has spurred calls for stricter rules .The bankruptcy trustee wants to quantify the shortfall before releasing more funds to customers. Separately on Friday, the trustee said about 900 of MF Global’s staff in New York and Chicago would be terminated immediately as the company is wound down.CME offered a $250m guarantee – which it called “unprecedented” – to the trustee to speed distributions of frozen MF Global customer funds. The money would come from corporate funds at CME.CME Trust, established in 1969 to protect customers of a failed clearing member, also pledged its entire $50m fund to exchange customers who lose money in the bankruptcy.“It’s an indication of how reputationally damaging this is to the CME,” said Craig Pirrong, finance professor at the University of Houston. “They need to look like they are being proactive.”CME supervised MF Global’s handling of customer accounts. Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, said: “The failure of MF Global and the firm’s mishandling of customer segregated funds is absolutely uncharted territory for this industry, and this extreme measure will help to provide all former MF Global customers access to their account balances that had previously been frozen in the liquidation”.A spokesman for trustee James Giddens said: “We look forward to seeing the details of the CME proposal and hope it might help us as we develop an expedited claims process”.Mr Giddens was appointed by a US court to wind down the business. In a statement, the trustee said the entire 1,066-strong workforce of the US broker-dealer division was being made redundant but 150-200 were being rehired “to assist in the wind down of the business and processing of bankruptcy claims”.“We are saddened by the trustee’s actions today to terminate so many of our colleagues,” said a spokesman for the company. A person close to the situation said the redundancies would remove people who were helping customers and would make the investigation into the collapse more difficult.Staff were rounded up in “town hall meetings” to be told of the trustee’s decision, said a person close to MF Global. They will be paid until next week and receive health insurance until the end of November but will get no severance pay. The redundancies account for about a third of MF Global’s 2,800 staff. Many of the remaining employees are based in London.
550;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-10T21:44:55Z;CFTC reviews brokers after MF Global collapse;;A key regulator investigating missing customer funds at failed broker-dealer MF Global has begun reviewing other brokers as the shortfall shakes confidence in US futures markets.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, said it will review the approximately 120 futures brokers that clear trades for customers, as MF Global did, to ensure they obey rules to segregate customer deposits from house funds.The announcement brings heightened scrutiny of futures brokers. Existing rules require futures exchanges to oversee clearing brokers, including reviewing monthly financial reports. Exchange operator CME Group, MF Global’s supervisor, has said it completed an on-site review of MF Global in the week before its collapse.After MF Global filed for bankruptcy, lawyers disclosed a shortfall of about $600m in customer accounts, or 11 per cent of the $5.45bn it was supposed to hold. Authorities, including the CFTC, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Bureau of Investigation, are searching for the missing money.The shortfall meant that 17,000 futures accounts were only partially funded after they were transferred to 12 other futures brokers last week. CME, which is overseeing the transfers, froze these funds as it verified the accounts.IntercontinentalExchange, the US’s second-biggest futures-exchange operator, warned the bankruptcy trustee’s handling of former MF Global customers risks creating “moral hazard”, saying that traders with open positions were having their accounts transferred to new brokers ahead of those who had liquidated trades before the broker-dealer collapsed.“If this inequitable approach is left unaddressed by the court, it could establish an inappropriate standard for future bankruptcy events,” the exchange wrote in a letter to the bankruptcy court on Thursday. “This could potentially have grave systemic implications.”The CFTC also took the rare step of publicly confirming that its enforcement lawyers had opened an investigation into MF Global.Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, has recused himself from the probe to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest because he worked with former MF Global chief Jon Corzine when Mr Corzine headed Goldman Sachs in the 1990s.Jill Sommers has been named senior commissioner on matters related to the MF Global bankruptcy and shortfall. Ms Sommers, appointed in 2007, previously served as a lobbyist for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and CME, which is now under scrutiny for its oversight of MF Global customer accounts.“Segregation of customer funds is at the core of customer protection in the commodity futures and options markets and must be maintained at all times,” Ms Sommers said in a statement.Separately, Fitch Ratings projected on Thursday that holders of MF Global’s $2.2bn in senior unsecured debt, including bonds sold just this August, will get only 10 to 30 cents on the dollar back. Of the some $130.6m of preferred stock, either zero or just 10 cents on the dollar will be repaid, Fitch said.The rating agency based its analysis on MF Global’s most recent financial statements, which showed consolidated assets of about $41bn and liabilities of $39.7bn at September 30.
551;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
552;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:46:42+0000;ICE says MF trustee created ‘moral hazard’;;The trustee handling MF Global’s bankruptcy has created a new kind of “moral hazard” in financial markets, IntercontinentalExchange, the US’s second-biggest futures exchange operator has warned, inadvertently encouraging clients of failing broker-dealers to hold on to their trading positions and “wait and hope” rather than liquidating them to minimise risk.The exchange group urged the trustee on Thursday to immediately address the inequalities in how accounts held with the collapsed broker-dealer had been transferred to new brokers. ICE noted that traders with open positions were having their accounts transferred to new brokers ahead of those who had liquidated trades before the broker-dealer collapsed, and said the bankruptcy court should immediately release as much money as possible from the frozen accounts.ICE’s criticism raises the pressure on MF Global’s bankruptcy trustees to free up money, coming a day after the Futures Industry Association, the industry’s main body, called on the trustee to return customer funds promptly. “Futures customers cannot afford to have the funds they had deposited to support their positions held up while the claims process runs its course,” the FIA said.CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange operator, on Wednesday announced a further delay in validating the amount of customer funds transferred out of accounts formerly held with MF Global. Privately, CME is also thought to be putting pressure on the trustee to speed up the process of freeing customer money.The delays have caused frustration in the futures trading community, with some 15,000 traders unable to tap the money in their accounts. Moreover, a shortfall in customer funds at MF Global meant accounts were transferred with only 60 per cent of the margin required to back positions, meaning traders were immediately asked for extra margin deposits to maintain their trading positions.“Because the customers who already liquidated or transferred prior to the bulk transfers had no open positions to move, the effect of the bulk transfer order was to preclude these traders from accessing any of the cash lying idle in their accounts with MF Global,” ICE wrote in a letter to the court.“Thus, the bulk transfer order created an inadvertent preference in favour of those customers who did nothing in response to MF Global’s financial condition, and operated against those customers who acted quickly and responsibly to reduce their exposure to MF Global.”“If this inequitable approach is left unaddressed by the court, it could establish an inappropriate standard for future bankruptcy events,” ICE warned. “Such an inappropriate standard would create a moral hazard by encouraging customers not to immediately transfer their position or liquidate to minimise risk … but rather to ‘wait and hope’. This could potentially have grave systemic implications.”
553;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:46:42+0000;MF Global fallout revives regulatory calls;‘Cardinal safeguard’ separating funds breached;It is a mantra of the futures industry: no customer lost a dime because regulators failed.Now that statement needs an asterisk. Last week’s bankruptcy of MF Global, one of the world’s largest futures brokers, has left customers staring at a $600m hole in their accounts. The shortfall is an embarrassment for the futures market and the people who police it.“This has been a significant blemish on the industry’s reputation,” says Dan Roth, president of the National Futures Association, an industry-funded self-regulatory body for US futures markets.The debacle is reviving calls for tougher rules governing customer funds not only in futures markets, but in the privately negotiated swaps market used by the largest traders on Wall Street. It has also turned a spotlight on CME Group, the exchange in charge of auditing MF Global’s customer funds.Industry representatives acknowledge something went awry at MF Global when it failed to uphold what its own sales brochure called a “cardinal safeguard” of futures trading: keeping customer and house funds separate.Mr Roth calls account segregation “sacrosanct”, while the Futures Industry Association, the brokers’ lobbyist in Washington, says it is a “cornerstone” of the business. In June, John Damgard, the FIA president, proudly testified to Congress that no futures broker failed during the financial crisis and no customers lost money because of regulatory failures. MF Global is an association member.The cornerstone now looks shaky. Futures accounts that were transferred from MF Global to other brokers last week arrived without some of the margin collateral needed to back them, forcing some traders to find extra cash or sell positions. On Thursday, the trustee overseeing the liquidation of the broker said it will not know the extent of the shortfall until an around-the-clock investigation into “complex cash movements” is complete.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which formally announced an investigation into MF Global on Thursday, also said it was reviewing other futures clearing brokers to ensure segregated funds are being properly maintained.“I think there will be a concerted effort to really take a hard look at all the participants in the industry and make sure there aren’t other issues or organisations that were at risk or had potential to fail,” says Pete Anderson, president of INTL FCStone, a brokerage that took over some MF Global accounts.Mothballed rule proposals are getting fresh attention in Washington.One rule, which the CFTC unveiled a year ago, would limit the scope of investments futures brokers can make with customer money. Brokers are currently allowed, with certain restrictions, to invest segregated client cash in assets including foreign sovereign debt and corporate notes and pocket the return.The rule stalled in July after lobbying by futures executives including MF Global’s then-chief, Jon Corzine. MF Global and Newedge, another futures broker, warned in a letter that the proposal would “dramatically limit the ability of (brokers) to prudently invest customer funds and generate revenue”.Bart Chilton, a commissioner at the CFTC, now wants to revive the measure, which he has rechristened the “MF rule”.“If we forgot the devastation that little or no regulations had in 2008, this is a fresh slap-in-the-face reminder that more needs to be done, and quickly,” Mr Chilton says.Mr Chilton also wants to advance a rule proposed in June that would regulate customer funds in over-the-counter swaps, a market seven times larger than futures.At futures clearing houses, customer funds are pooled together, leaving one customer exposed to another’s default.As the CFTC pushes to get more swaps guaranteed by clearing houses, it has proposed a different policy that would protect customers from claims in the event a broker and one of its customers go bankrupt. This “ legal segregation” rule is backed by asset managers such as BlackRock.“MF Global highlights why that rule is so important,” says Mr Chilton, a Democrat.The MF Global shortfall came not from a customer’s collapse but the broker-dealer itself. Scott O’Malia, a Republican member of the CFTC, said he’s doubtful the rule would protect investors against the same scenario in swaps markets.“First of all we have to get the money back. Second of all, we have to restore customer property. Those are the top two priorities,” he says. “Then we have to take a close look at the proposed rules and their application vis a vis this crisis.”
554;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME delays validation of MF Global accounts;Move will add to frustrations among traders;CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange operator, announced a further delay in validating the amount of customer funds transferred out of accounts formerly held with MF Global, the broker-dealer that collapsed last week.MF Global was one of the biggest clearing members at CME’s exchanges before it filed for bankruptcy. The exchange group transferred the affected accounts to new clearing firms last week, but ordered the firms to freeze the funds until it verified the amount in each one.The delays have caused frustration among the futures-trading community, with thousands of traders unable to tap the money in their accounts. Moreover, a shortfall in customer funds at MF Global meant accounts were transferred with only 60 per cent of the margin required to back positions, meaning traders were immediately asked for extra margin deposits to maintain their trading positions.“Futures customers cannot afford to have the funds they had deposited to support their positions held up while the claims process runs its course,” the Futures Industry Association, the industry’s main body, said on Wednesday. The body called on the trustee to return customer funds promptly.“We understand and appreciate that there are many frustrations and unanswered questions,” Craig Donohue, chief executive, and Terry Duffy, executive chairman, wrote to traders this week, although they said CME was making “significant progress” in resolving the issues.In a letter to clearing member firms on Saturday, CME asked them to delay distributing any transferred customer funds until the exchange could verify the amounts were correct, a process it said it expected to complete on Tuesday.However, on Wednesday the CME said that “the validation of each account’s collateral balance is taking longer than originally anticipated” and said that although it would begin to verify accounts with futures-only positions on Wednesday morning, customers with options positions would have to wait until later in the week.CME said the delay reflected the complexities of dealing with seven different US clearing houses, as well as “the unique circumstances of the MF Global bulk transfer process”.The delays are not the only problem related to the transfer. In a letter to clearing firms on Sunday, CME also revealed that account information pertaining to clients of MF Global Canada was inadvertently included in the US customer data provided to CME Clearing by MF Global, a move not authorised by Canadian regulators nor the Trustee of MF Global Canada. The exchange group said the accounts would be immediately transferred back to MF Global Canada.
555;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-08T12:36:24Z;S&P venture eyes new indexing opportunities;S&P 500 and DJIA union aims to provide access to more products;S&P Indices is intensifying efforts to commercialise its indexing business following a deal struck last week between McGraw-Hill, S&P’s parent company, and CME Group, the exchange operator.The management of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, two of the best known stock market indices worldwide, will be brought together under one roof after McGraw-Hill and CME agreed to marry their indexing businesses in a joint venture.“We will build on each other’s strengths,” said Alex Matturri, executive managing director of S&P Indices, who will lead the joint venture which will form part of the new McGraw-Hill Markets company.“The deal will provide investors with access to more products, it will ensure more resources for our developers and it will allow us to bring new indices to the market more quickly.”Mr Matturri refused to be drawn on the synergies of the deal but there are expected to be significant costs savings as the data processing, index calculations and technology platforms are unified. There are also expected to be savings in distribution costs as there will be a single sales force to service both families of indices.S&P Indices will continue to offer Dow Jones branded indices, even where those overlap or compete with existing S&P products. So the new joint venture will run two sets of sharia-compliant indices as the Dow Jones branded products have gained traction in South-East Asia while S&P sharia indices are popular among investors in the Middle East.The two existing sets of commodity indices will also continue as the S&P GSCI commodity indices tend to be used by institutional investors while the Dow Jones-UBS commodity indices are popular among retail investors.Mr Matturri said S&P planned to expand its fixed income index range and it also wanted to explore partnership opportunities with other exchanges. He noted that S&P had used its Vix methodology to develop a volatility product in partnership with Hang Seng, the Asia index provider, for the Hong Kong stock market.“Five years ago, S&P was known primarily as an indexing business linked to the equity market but we have now expanded our capabilities in commodities, fixed income, real estate, economic indices and custom indices.”Developments in indexing, said Mr Matturri, now allowed investors multiple ways to access different asset classes. He noted that the original market cap weighted S&P 500 was now available as a risk control index, a low volatility index and via “style” groupings such as value and growth. These various permutations would become available across multiple indices as difference types of investors such as insurance companies, hedge funds or financial advisers all had different “tweaks” or preferences in their investment processes.Mr Matturri said S&P’s new joint venture wanted to achieve “balanced” revenues by making its indices available via multiple distribution channels including exchange traded funds, other exchanges and OTC partners.But although the ongoing proliferation of indices and related exchange traded funds is part of a natural evolution in financial markets, not all of these products will survive.“If it is a good product, then investors will come,” said Mr Matturri, pointing to the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF, known as SPLV, which has already gathered $585m in assets since its launch in May 2011.
556;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-08T10:57:15Z;OSE establishes Singapore base;;The Osaka Securities Exchange has established an office in Singapore as the Japanese bourse seeks to boost trading flows from the Asian financial centre.The move takes the battle for market share in Nikkei-225 index futures, the OSE’s flagship product, to the home base of SGX, the Singapore exchange, which also offers a Nikkei-225 index futures contract.The OSE has appointed Matthias Rietig, executive adviser to the OSE board, as its Singapore representative.Mr Rietig said about a quarter of OSE’s flows come from Singapore but the exchange was looking to increase that by having a presence in the city-state. He said the move was designed “to bring more flow to Japan and to cater to existing flow that is here”.“A lot of big Japanese-focused hedge funds are here and there’s also the flow of high-frequency traders coming to Singapore,” he told FT Trading Room. “To capture that volume it’s important for us to be on the ground. We want to ensure that we are among the first to connect.”Singapore’s low corporate tax rate has turned the city-state into a magnet for traders seeking to tap into Asian exchanges.High-frequency traders have flocked to Singapore in the past year not only to trade on SGX as it has upgraded its trading systems, but as a base from which to trade other regional markets.The OSE in July struck a deal with CME Group and will see Osaka listing a yen-denominated version of the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures contract, one of CME’s main derivatives products.Mr Rietig said OSE would be the first Asian exchange to launch a volatility index product when a Nikkei volatility contract is launched in February.
557;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Aftershocks of MF Global bankruptcy continue;;Aftershocks from the MF Global bankruptcy spread on Monday, reaching a level that prompted a leading broker to ask the US government to delay crop reports because of the upheaval.Many problems involved shifting accounts of former MF Global traders to other clearing firms. As these accounts appeared on the books of new brokers, owners were hit with demands for extra margin deposits to maintain positions. RJ O’Brien, the Chicago futures broker that took over some accounts, told new arrivals to wire more money or liquidate.“There are people blown out of positions there’s no reason to blow out of,” said Tres Knippa, a broker and commodity trading adviser on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor.Adding to the short-term cash crunch, exchange operator CME Group directed brokers to delay distribution of customers’ funds until late Tuesday as it verifies that each one receives the right amount.Any impact on futures prices has been minimal since MF Global filed for bankruptcy on October 31. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a commodities benchmark, on Monday rose a quarter of 1 per cent.However, RJ O’Brien warned of volatility ahead as it petitioned the US Department of Agriculture to postpone the release of two closely followed crop reports from Wednesday to next Monday. The broker said a delay would “mitigate the aftershocks of MFG’s bankruptcy to thousands of innocent market participants”.The USDA rebuffed its entreaty.Managers of the 12 clearing firms that took over 17,000 US accounts from the failed broker-dealer, which also include Rosenthal Collins, Dorman Trading and ADM Investor Services, a division of agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland, were scrambling to assess accounts transferred in bulk last week. MF Global was known for its retail customer base.A shortfall in customer funds at MF Global meant accounts were transferred with only 60 per cent of the margin required to back positions. CME and IntercontinentalExchange, the exchange and clearing house operators, eased the cost of margin calls by temporarily relaxing rules on deposits.Among the worst-hit traders were firms that invest client money in futures markets. These “managed futures” firms often apply one trading strategy to dozens of individual accounts. As account holders who had MF Global as a broker were forced out of the market, their losses influenced managed futures firms’ performance records.“The fallout has been pretty bad for money managers,” said Chad Butler, president of Clarke Capital Management, which oversees $150m in more than 200 managed futures accounts, 120 of them formerly with MF Global.US authorities and MF’s bankruptcy trustee are investigating the disappearance of some $600m in futures customer funds that disappeared in the days leading up to MF’s bankruptcy last week.“MF has gone a long way to destroy faith and trust in the good firms out there. The question on everyone’s mind is, how safe are they really?” Mr Butler said.
558;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-06T18:52:37Z;Rules eased to avert MF Global fallout;Move raises risk of widespread margin calls;US futures exchanges have moved to head off instability in financial markets following the collapse of broker-dealer MF Globalby relaxing rules on how much collateral speculators must hold.CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange have temporarily cut the amount of deposits they will require from speculators, including those whose positions were transferred in bulk from MF Global to new brokers late last week.The exchange and clearing house operators decided the changes as futures markets were set to reopen late on Sunday with thousands of new, underfunded accounts on the books of other brokers.While customer positions were successfully moved, 40 per cent of their margin, or the deposit needed to make a transaction, was held back at clearing houses as ordered by a US bankruptcy judge.This raised the risk of widespread margin calls, or demands for additional deposits, from brokers, which could lead to a sell-off in markets from stock index futures to oil.“This is a short term accommodation to maintain market integrity and provide temporary relief to customers whose accounts have been disrupted by this event,” CME said in a notice to clearing members over the weekend.ICE’s US soft commodity, foreign exchange and stock index exchange said it lowered the margin rate to “mute the impact of the transfer” and “support the integrity of exchange markets”.As of Sunday, 17,000 open accounts had been transferred to other brokers, the office of MF’s bankruptcy trustee said. These included 15,000 MF Global accounts CME said it moved last week.CME said it had also shifted $1.45bn in MF customer collateral held at its clearing house to other clearing firms. The money was about 60 per cent of the $2.5bn in customer funds on deposit at CME.The impromptu nature of the transfers was evident as CME informed MF Global’s Canadian customers that their accounts were mistakenly moved to new brokers without approval from Canada’s regulators or bankruptcy trustee. CME, which blamed the mix-up on records supplied by MF Global, sought to transfer these accounts back to MF Global Canada by early Monday.In all MF Global was required to hold $5.45bn in customer funds separate from its own funds, of which about $600m remains unaccounted for. Authorities are investigating the shortfall.Gary Gensler, Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, stepped back from the agency’s probe to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, according to Bart Chilton, a CFTC commissioner. Mr Gensler worked at Goldman Sachs when it was headed by Jon Corzine, MF’s chief executive until his resignation last week.For speculative traders, both CME and ICE reduced the amount of initial margin – the amount needed to open a position – to bring it in line with the maintenance margin needed to keep a position open. In US crude oil, for example, speculators’ initial margin was $8,100 per 1,000-barrel contract, but will now be the same as the prevailing $6,000 maintenance margin.“They recognise the problem and they are doing what they can to decrease the possibility of a forced liquidation in the market,” said Raymond Carbone, president of Paramount Options, an oil broker on the floor of CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange.Only a portion of the margin accounts was transferred because of the shortfall at MF Global. The trustee’s office said it had to hold back assets to “best satisfy customer claims and to maximise the estate for all stakeholders.”MF Global customer accounts that only held cash were not transferred and are frozen. The disposition of the money could be fought out in court, a process that could take years.“If you have all cash, you can’t move it out,” said Tim Butler, a lawyer for his brother, New York cotton trader Thomas Butler.
559;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:46:42+0000;Clearing worries dog NYSE merger;;When Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive flies into Brussels this week, he and his counterpart at Deutsche Börse, Reto Francioni, will be nearing the endgame in their attempts to combine their exchanges.They will be hoping that antitrust authorities will have been convinced by their argument that the merger, which involves bringing together the Börse’s Eurex futures exchange with the US group’s NYSE Liffe futures arm will – in Mr Niederauer’s words – “give Europe an important counterweight to the established markets, centres in the US with CME [Group, the US futures operator], in Asia with Hong Kong and in Latin America”.But the collapse of MF Global, the US-based futures broker, has exposed a potential new problem for the merger.There is growing unease among banks in London – big customers of Eurex and Liffe – over the way the Börse’s clearing arrangements will work once the merger is done.A key element of the deal is that futures trades done on London-based Liffe will no longer be cleared at LCH.Clearnet, the London clearer, but will be processed on Eurex Clearing, the Börse’s Frankfurt-based clearer that already clears futures trades on Eurex.Clearing is an essential process that takes place after a trade is done, ensuring that a deal is completed even if one side defaults.The good news is that traders using both Liffe and Eurex products would no longer have to connect to two clearing houses. Nor would they have to post collateral to back up their trades twice, to each clearer, but only once – and post less into the bargain, saving money.But the banks are worried about the reliance on Eurex Clearing since German insolvency law – unlike the UK’s – requires that in the event of a default of a member of a clearing house its positions, and those of its clients, must be liquidated.In the MF Global case, many counterparties to the stricken broker saw their positions held at Eurex Clearing liquidated in the market with no separation – or “segregation” of the firm’s and its clients’ monies.In the UK, there is the option of a customer of a clearing member shifting its positions to another clearing member, rather then being liquidated – a process known as portability.At the time of the last big default, of Lehman Brothers in 2008, Eurex Clearing did allow positions to be shifted in this way. But this did not happen with the MF Global wind-down. Eurex Clearing says that its rules were changed since Lehman requiring liquidation of positions in cases like this.Nonetheless, the development has served to exacerbate existing concerns among London-based banks about how clearing of Liffe contracts would work, post-merger.The Frankfurt clearer has moved to mitigate such concerns by introducing in recent months a new “client asset protection” service that allows portability and the segregation of client and a firm’s assets.But banks in London question how the service will mesh with German bankruptcy law. A recent paper by the International Organisation of Securities Organisations, the umbrella group for market watchdogs, says: “It is not certain whether German insolvency law fully supports the transfer of customer positions and collateral”.“A lot of the firms are very nervous about this because they have not seen any supporting legal opinions that explain how the process works under German law,” said one person familiar the banks’ thinking.Deutsche Börse said: “Eurex Clearing’s new client asset protection service is designed to meet the needs of non-clearing members for segregating positions and assets.“It ensures full legal protection under UK and German law and provides for operational segregation of client assets ensuring immediate portability by the clearinghouse.”
560;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-04T18:51:25Z;MF Global client funds turn up at JPMorgan;;Accounts containing $659m belonging to customers of MF Global have turned up at JPMorgan Chase, the failed broker-dealer’s custody bank, according to a person familiar with the matter.The disclosure raised hopes of explaining a shortfall in customer accounts that emerged after the broker-dealer filed for bankruptcy on Monday. The gap, $633m as of Tuesday, sparked investigations by federal authorities. On Friday, Jon Corzine, MF Global chief executive, resigned.JPMorgan disclosed the funds to MF Global in a statement dated Monday, the person said. The statement revealed a total of $2.2bn – including MF Global’s own funds – held at JPMorgan, which also was listed as the largest unsecured creditor to its holding company.JPMorgan said it keeps customer and house funds for MF Global, but declined to quantify them. “There’s no way for JPMorgan to know if this is the ‘missing money’,” a spokeswoman said.The trustee managing the liquidation of MF Global’s brokerage said it would try to identify the location and nature of MF Global accounts held at JPMorgan.The shortfall gave a second black eye to Mr Corzine, 64, after the former Goldman Sachs chief executive’s firm imploded due to concerns over a $6.3bn bet on European sovereign debt.“I feel great sadness for what has transpired at MF Global and the impact it has had on the firm’s clients, employees and many others,” he said in a statement. He joined the broker-dealer less than two years ago after losing a bid for re-election as New Jersey governor.Regulators and bankruptcy lawyers are widening their investigation into MF Global’s collapse. On Friday, the bankruptcy trustee won approval to subpoena records from the company and share them with authorities. “In this case, there have already been serious allegations of potential misconduct,” Martin Glenn, US bankruptcy judge, said.Mr Corzine, who has hired Andrew Levander, a white-collar defence lawyer, said he would help the company respond to regulatory inquiries and issues related to the disposition of firm assets. He would also forgo $12.1m in severance pay, MF Global said.The MF shortfall has rekindled efforts to pass a rule, proposed last year, that would limit the scope of brokers’ investments of customer funds. “I’m calling it the MF rule,” Bart Chilton, a member of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told the Financial Times. “I don’t think we should wait.”Rival futures brokers were, meanwhile, receiving thousands of former MF Global customer accounts. CME Group, the exchange operator overseeing the bulk of the transfers, said late on Friday that it expected to have moved 15,000 customer accounts and about $1.45bn of collateral to other clearing firms. Some collateral will be left behind, however, raising fears that traders will be forced to add margin or unwind positions when futures markets reopen next week.MF Global suffered a string of credit downgrades last week to “junk” after rating agencies decided the broker had taken on too much risk with European sovereign debt.“Corzine was getting back ‘in the game’ – a game he clearly loved. The liquidation of a company was not what he volunteered for,” said Brad Hintz, senior analyst at AllianceBernstein.
561;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;S&P commodities index to increase Brent weighting;;The S&P GSCI, the most widely tracked commodity index, will increase the weighting of Brent crude next year at the expense of rival West Texas Intermediate, a move that will force billions of dollars moving from one contract to the other.The change in weighting comes after the traditional price relationship between Brent and WTI, the world’s most important oil benchmarks, moved upside down.Brent has for years traded at a $1 to $2 a barrel discount to WTI.But since mid-2010, Brent has traded consistently at a premium to WTI due to a logistical bottleneck around Cushing, the Oklahoma town that serves as the delivery point for the WTI contract.The Brent-WTI premium reached an all-time high of $28.10 a barrel last month. On Friday, the price differential traded at $17.43 a barrel.The past week was paradigmatic of the different price trajectory. In late afternoon trading, ICE December Brent was up 1.1 per cent on the week to $111.18 a barrel while Nymex December WTI was up just 0.5 per cent on the week to $93.75.Oil prices rose in the last part of the week after the European Central Bank cut interest rates.The announcement by Standard & Poor’s comes only weeks after the Dow Jones-UBS commodity index, the second-most popular commodities basket, announced it would include Brent in its index for the first time in 2012.The shifts will have big implications for commodity markets.Brent, linked to crude from the North Sea, is the flagship futures contract on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, a unit of Atlanta-based InterContinental Exchange. WTI is the main oil contract at the New York Mercantile Exchange, owned by the CME Group.Michael McGlone, head of the S&P GSCI in New York, said he estimated that about $110bn tracked the commodity index at the end of October.S&P GSCI – formerly Goldman Sachs Commodities Index – said the weight of Brent crude will rise from January to 17.35 per cent from 15.9 per cent while the share of WTI will be cropped to 30.25 per cent, down from 32.59 per cent.It is the third year in a row that Brent weightings in the S&P GSCI index have increased.It could also increase the number of oustanding Brent contracts, giving a boost to ICE Futures in its fight for market shares with Nymex.Brent has benefited from the rupture in the traditional price relationship, with companies and speculators shifting their exposure in favour of the North Sea crude.In the most striking example, Delta Air Lines, one of the world’s largest carriers, shifted in March almost all its fuel hedges away from WTI and into Brent.
562;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-04T14:52:49Z;Dow Jones and S&P owners seal joint venture;;CME Group and McGraw-Hill have struck a deal to unite their index businesses in a joint venture that would bring together the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index in the same company.The parent companies announced the agreement on Friday after what Harold McGraw, McGraw-Hill chief executive, said had been more than a year of discussions. The transaction had been expected, after talks on a potential deal were reported in September.McGraw-Hill, owner of Standard & Poor’s, will control 73 per cent of the joint venture, while CME, the US’s biggest futures exchange operator by revenues that bought most of Dow Jones Indices last year, will own 24.4 per cent and Dow Jones the remaining 2.6 per cent.The combination of two of the world’s most closely followed financial indices in a single company will be a powerful player in the financial industry.The index industry has seen growth in recent years from the rise of emerging markets and increasing investor interest in commodities and other asset classes. Some $6,000bn in assets are estimated to be benchmarked against the indices.“Dow Jones is largely focused on investor opportunities and S&P Indices largely on institutional investor opportunities, so the complementary nature of putting all of this together is quite strong,” said Mr McGraw.The new company, called S&P/Dow Jones Indices, will initially have annual revenues of more than $400m when the deal is expected to close in the first half of next year. Mr McGraw said that was expected to rise to $435m by the end of 2012.The relationship between McGraw Hill and CME goes back to 1982, when CME launched S&P futures contracts. The exchange went on to develop the highly popular S&P 500 “E-mini” futures, now the world’s most liquid futures contract, with average nominal daily trading volumes of more than $150bn.CME bought a 90 per cent stake in Dow Jones Indexes from News Corp last year for $613m, helping the media company recoup part of the cost of buying the publisher of the Wall Street Journal in 2007. The managing editor of the Wall Street Journal still chooses the Dow’s components.After the deal closes, instead of paying S&P indices a fixed fee per trade, CME will pay a share of the profits that it makes on trading and clearing of equity-based futures, swaps and options on futures.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, said the exchange group was keen to expand its collaboration with Platts, the energy and commodities division of McGraw-Hill.The joint venture will be led by Alexander Matturri, currently executive managing director of S&P Indices. The new company will become part of the new McGraw-Hill Markets company, which springs from plans McGraw-Hill announced in September to split into two public companies.McGraw-Hill was advised by BofA Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. Barclays Capital advised CME Group.
563;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-04T00:05:17Z;Safeguards proved false by MF Global;;From Mr Ryan Carlson.Sir, The bankruptcy of MF Global has many surprising aspects but the lack of communication from industry leader CME Group, except to state the obvious (“CME Group says MF Global broke rules”, November 2), is one of the most troubling. The exchange was clearly unprepared to prevent this crisis and has also been unable to handle an orderly resolution thus far. Rather than inform legacy MF clients of developments, CME Group has done little except to distance itself from any fault or liability even though most of those affected are CME Group members who traded CME Group products through MF Global, a CME Group clearing firm with margin deposits that ultimately sat in the CME Group clearing house.The futures industry led by CME Group can discuss at length the financial safeguards that provide protection for its clients but ultimately these have been proved false by the MF Global bankruptcy. At the time of writing, funds and open positions have been frozen for the third day, leaving legacy MF clients unable to hedge and manage positions. Although CME Group may not legally be liable for these problems, it’s clear that the exchange’s leadership during this crisis is liable for what is a permanent smear on the futures industry.Ryan Carlson, Member, CME/CBOT, Chicago, IL, US
564;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-03T22:00:56Z;NYSE chief confident over D Börse merger;Niederauer says will abandon deal if key parts blocked;"Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, expressed confidence in the proposed tie-up with Deutsche Börse, dismissing some regulators’ concerns about vertical integration as “idealistic”. But he also said he would abandon the deal if authorities blocked a substantial portion of it.His remarks came in a response to a question about comments in drafts of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive review, an ongoing broad European reform of market regulation known as Mifid II, that the integration of trading and clearing operations in one group was concerning.“It is not unusual to see some rather idealistic view slip into the initial proposal,” Mr Niederauer said on a call with analysts. “I would remind everybody that this has been proposed by one area of the commission. It has not been vetted; it has not been reviewed.”One of the primary synergies of NYSE Euronext’s proposed €12bn ($16.6bn) merger with Deutsche Börse is the combination of the Eurex and Liffe futures markets in Europe, as well as extending Deutsche Börse’s settlement operations to NYSE’s markets.Mr Niederauer is travelling next week to Brussels to meet with antitrust authorities who are conducting an intensive review of the merger. He told analysts that the groups would not go through with the merger if authorities forced them to divest a key business.“I am more confident than ever of the compelling industrial logic of the merger,” Mr Neiderauer said. “That having been said, as in any deal, at some point the logic of the combination would not hold together if we are asked to give up too much. This is not where we are right now.”Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said: “That was unusual transparency on that point.”During the call, NYSE Euronext also presented its third-quarter earnings, which saw the group’s profits for the quarter top analysts’ forecasts, producing earnings of 71 cents per share, versus an expectation of 69 cents per share. Cash profits were $200m, a jump of 56 per cent from the same period last year.The shares were up 6.1 per cent on the day, to $27.08, now down just 9 per cent on the year. Shares in Deutsche Börse were higher by 3.1 per cent on Thursday, at €40.30.The beat was driven by a jump in revenues, up 20 per cent over last year to $1.25bn, amid surges of trading volumes in European stocks and US options in the third quarter, combined with cost cuts, said Mr Repetto.Its newer businesses struggled somewhat. NYSE Euronext said that its nascent US futures trading exchange, NYSE Liffe US, saw “a levelling of activity …due to a post-September role drop-off in open interest”, although it did achieve 7 per cent market share in eurodollar contracts, a market dominated by CME Group.The company also lowered its full-year forecast for the growth of its technology business, which targets banks and trading firms with services such as its data centres and “cloud” platforms, from about 15 per cent to 10 per cent. “As we get through the end of the year, not a lot of people are spending,” Mr Niederauer said."
565;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-03T17:43:50Z;OTC derivatives: Euro crisis gives clearing a boost;There is a sense in the industry that the change is a trend, not a blip, says Hal Weitzman;The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 was undoubtedly devastating for the global financial industry and had profound effects on the economy.For CME Group, the biggest futures exchange in the US, it also gave rise to an important opportunity.The fear of counterparty risk provoked by the bank’s collapse held out the promise that the over-the-counter derivatives market – the value of which dwarfs listed markets – might be pushed to clear through central counterparty clearing houses – such as CME’s – providing the group with significant new business.A G20 agreement in 2009 and the Dodd-Frank Act– US legislation passed last year that aims to overhaul financial regulation – both envisaged a legal mandate for as many OTC swaps as possible to be cleared.CME offers clearing facilities for credit default swaps (CDS), a type of financial product that became much more well known in the wake of the crisis.Yet the group has been beaten to the punch by the London-based clearing business of IntercontinentalExchange, which established dominance in CDS through its consortium arrangement with the biggest dealers.Instead, CME has focused most of its efforts on interest rate swaps (IRS), a huge market that is a natural fit with the Chicago exchange’s dominant position in US interest rate futures.The IRS pie is much bigger than CDS. Whereas the CDS market ended last year with a notional value of $30,000bn, according to the Bank for International Settlements, the IRS market is valued at $465,000bn, or more than three-quarters of the entire OTC market.However, uncertainty about the implications of Dodd-Frank have contributed to slower progress than might have been expected at CME.Also, after the Lehman collapse, with the passing of time, the urgency of risk reduction diminished – and the promise of large cleared volumes failed to materialise.But in recent months, volumes have shot up. CME cleared $5m in IRS contracts in May, $190m in June, $400m in July, $1.24bn in August and $35.47bn in September.Although the notional value of cleared volumes levelled out in October, it is still on course to be in the tens of billions of dollars.Cleared CDS volumes also went up from $10m in July to $6.46bn in September.To a large extent, these increases are in response to the eurozone crisis.Just as the Lehman collapse prompted a rush to reduce counterparty risk, the debt crisis in Europe has given OTC clearing a second wind.Kim Taylor, CME’s head of clearing, says: “In the past couple of months, we’ve seen a significant uptake in OTC clearing as traders respond to the eurozone debt crisis and review their counterparty risk profiles.”That is echoed by Daniel Maguire, head of Swapclear US – the OTC service of LCH.Clearnet, London’s main clearing house – which competes with CME. “The need for counterparty risk reduction is driving demand,” he says.At the same time, those in the industry say traders are also moving to clearing to be ready for when mandates will apply.Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told a futures conference in Chicago in October that a government mandate forcing the most standardised swaps to be cleared could come into effect by April, with the entire industry having to comply by the end of next year. Many are not waiting for those deadlines before acting.Ms Taylor says CME has more than 500 clients clearing OTC trades, with “many more” in the pipeline and a sharp increase in client testing. She also says CME has been forced to bring forward its product launch dates because of the strength of customer demand.Floyd Converse of LCH.Clearnet says his organisation is increasingly seeing asset managers – who will not be mandated to clear in the US until the end of 2012 – “jumping the queue” and beginning to clear swap trades.Chris Perkins, head of derivatives clearing at Citigroup Global Markets, says his bank is setting up 2,000 accounts for clearing.He adds that dealers are already offering their clients cross-product margining (the cash or securities posted as collateral) between swaps and futures, even though exchanges cannot yet do this, and regulators could ultimately decide not to allow the practice.The sense in the industry is that the move to clearing is a trend, not a blip.Volatility and uncertainty will eventually recede, but as Mr Converse notes, by then clearing will be mandated.Revenues from clearing swaps may be becoming an important part of CME’s business, but the exchange still hopes that the overhaul of financial regulation will also cause business to migrate from OTC to its traditional listed markets.A key factor may be the relative costs of clearing swaps and futures: margining costs for the former may be up to five times higher. William Cleary, a managing director at Bank of America Merrill Lynch says: “There’s a whole load of customers looking at the cost of trading OTC. We’ll see a big increase in the use of futures products.”Kevin Foley, a partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman, a law firm, agrees. “Not only will we see a shift from uncleared to cleared, but also from swaps to futures,” he predicts.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, sees this as a shift that will shape both OTC and listed markets.“As people look at the costs of doing swaps, they’re looking at alternatives [such as listed futures],” he says.“That is good for exchanges in both senses. The ‘Big Game’ may be the convergence that happens for market users.”
566;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-03T17:43:37Z;Energy: An example for regulators to study;The 2001 bankruptcy of Enron shocked market participants into finding safer ways to trade, says Gregory Meyer;US regulators pushing to send more derivatives deals to clearing houses would do well to study energy markets.Years before the Lehman Brothers collapse and the AIG bail-out, traders in over-the-counter natural gas and oil derivatives started clearing their swaps.The impetus was the 2001 bankruptcy of Enron, then dominant in US gas markets, and credit downgrades of other energy trading companies. The crisis shocked energy market participants and forced them to look for safer ways to hedge supplies.The New York Mercantile Exchange, now part of CME Group, and the fledgling IntercontinentalExchange began allowing bilateral trades to be transferred to clearing houses, which acted as the buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer, shifting credit risk away from individual counterparties. Traders had to post collateral to keep positions.At first, “the market looked at it and said, ‘I have all these triple A counterparties. Why would I want to incur the extra cost of clearing?’ ” says Chuck Vice, the ICE president.“The whole Enron situation changed that quite a bit. Everybody looked around and said: ‘If my highest-rated, largest counterparty can go bankrupt, pretty much anyone can go bankrupt’. The pendulum started to swing fairly quickly,” Mr Vice says.Technology made clearing easier, as some trading shifted from telephones to instant messages to screen-based platforms.At ICE, the share of over-the-counter energy trades that were cleared grew from 2 per cent in 2002 to more than 95 per cent today. Daily volumes handled by ClearPort, the clearing service that Nymex launched in May 2002, grew from 24,000 on average in 2003 to almost 450,000 so far this year. Volumes peaked at nearly 500,000 in 2009, after Lehman’s failure.ClearPort was “born out of necessity”, says Mike Prokop, managing director for energy and cross asset-class products at CME. ClearPort now also handles foreign exchange, interest-rate and other derivatives.The trend towards clearing has enabled new energy swap dealers to break into markets once dominated by Wall Street banks and large oil companies.Previously, a trader had to sign mountains of documents with each counterparty to certify it was able to strike deals under swaps rules. The process could take months and still left traders at risk of another’s default.“It’s been great for everyone except those whose business models required opacity, episodic liquidity and the ability to serve as a gatekeeper for investors,” says Michael Cosgrove, a managing director at GFI Group, an interdealer broker.One smaller dealer is Geneva Energy Markets, an 11-person operation based in New York and Dublin. Inside GEM’s modest office near Wall Street, computers make laser-gun noises each time a trade goes through. At times it sounds like a shoot-out in a science-fiction movie. The company is one of the most active traders of cleared oil swaps.“We only do cleared trades. We wouldn’t take Exxon’s credit if they asked us to,” says Mark Vonderheide, GEM managing partner.“It’s not a matter of suggesting someone’s not credit-worthy. Why bother to add that to your list of things to think about?”He says other market participants initially resisted clearing, but volumes took off after 2007.“Trading counterparties realised it cost them real money if they weren’t willing to clear their oil swap trades, because the cleared-only bids or offers were regularly the best in the market.”Mr Vonderheide, a former senior trader at banks and Vitol, the oil trading house, says that now most of the oil swaps market is cleared. “It’s certainly a model for how a very active, volatile and large market can organise itself to do a massive percentage cleared,” he says.Not every trader wants to clear its positions. Posting margin collateral can be a drain on companies’ cash. The US Dodd-Frank Act on financial regulation will not require commercial “end-users”, such as gas drillers or oil refiners, to clear their derivatives trades.Under the reforms, standardised swaps deals between big financial traders must be cleared. Regulators are still writing rules to implement the legislation.Some say that while energy is an appealing example for other markets, it will not translate neatly to other derivatives, such as credit default swaps.“In the energy business, the market perceived a need for [clearing]. It grew organically, without anybody telling them to do it,” says Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the University of Houston.
567;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-02T23:56:16Z;MF Global’s fall puts spotlight on CME Group;;The case of the missing customer funds at MF Global is putting a spotlight on the failed broker’s de facto supervisor, CME Group.CME, the largest US futures exchange operator, is also the designated self-regulatory organisation for more than 50 futures brokers, including MF Global. As such, CME had direct responsibility for making sure MF Global’s books were square.MF Global filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, sending its customers scrambling to extract cash from accounts and move positions to other brokers.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, said this week that MF Global was “not in compliance with CFTC and CME customer segregation requirement”, suggesting the company may have failed to follow a key commandment of futures broking: to segregate customer accounts from house accounts.Federal authorities, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are investigating.On Wednesday, CME clarified that it had audited MF Global’s segregated customer funds last week and found them in compliance. However, it added: “It now appears that the firm made subsequent transfers of customer segregated funds in a manner that may have been designed to avoid detection insofar as MF Global did not disclose or report such transfers to the CFTC or CME until early morning on Monday October 31 2011.”MF Global refused to comment on CME’s statement.CME’s dual role puts it in a delicate position. MF Global, according to its website, was the top broker by volume at CME’s metals and energy exchanges in New York and in the top three at its Chicago exchanges. CME’s main source of revenue is clearing and transaction fees.Brokers themselves have questioned letting exchan-ges be overseers. “Given their strong market knowledge and proximity to the trading markets, they provide the best forum for addressing many of the futures markets’ oversight functions,” the Futures Industry Association said in a 2004 letter to the CFTC. “However . . . we are concerned about potential conflicts of interest.”The hole in MF’s accounts was discovered as regulators and abortive buyer Interactive Brokers scoured its books over the past week. Since at least last Thursday, MF Global told regulators that all the money was accounted for.It was only after the bankruptcy filing that MF Global’s general counsel communicated in writing to the regulators that there were insufficient funds in the segregated accounts, according to people familiar with the matter.The MF Global case raises the question of whether CME was vigilant enough in warning that the broker-dealer might collapse. As is normal practice, when MF’s customer segregated funds at CME fell below acceptable levels, the company was given time to top up those accounts.“This certainly suggests there’s some kind of deficiency in their oversight,” says the head of a Chicago proprietary trading firm.Experts say the sudden nature of MF Global’s demise meant a quickly shifting financial picture for regulators.“My guess is this happened so fast, they lost track of it,” says Michael Greenberger, a former senior CFTC official and law professor at the University of Maryland.The segregation of customer funds has been enshrined in federal law since the 1930s. Designated self-regulatory organisations such as CME must enforce minimum financial and reporting requirements for members such as MF Global. Futures brokers are required to calculate by noon each day that they are in compliance with customer funds custody requirements.Still, “no outside regulator looks at seg funds on a day-to-day basis”, says a senior executive at another US futures brokerage.MF’s collapse also highlights weaknesses at the CFTC, which regulates CME. Collin Peterson, who helps oversee the CFTC as the top Democrat on the House agriculture committee, says he will call for a probe into how the agency supervised the broker. rule that would mandate segregated accounts for swaps customers.Additional reporting by Shahien Nasiripour and Kara Scannell in New York
568;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-02T23:26:56Z;MF Global accused over fund transfers;;CME Group, the US exchange operator and supervisor of MF Global’s futures brokerage business, has accused the failed broker-dealer of moving customer funds “in a manner that may have been designed to avoid detection”.MF Global left a $633m shortfall in what are supposed to be protected customer funds, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Wednesday. The disclosure came as lawyers for MF Global’s bankruptcy trustee raced to arrange the transfer of thousands of commodities accounts before the law requires their liquidation.MF Global, led by Jon Corzine, ex-Goldman Sachs chief executive and former New Jersey governor, filed for bankruptcy on Monday. A potential buyer called off talks after discovering the account discrepancy, which is now being probed by regulators. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also looking at the matter, according to people familiar with the situation. The company declined to comment.Martin Glenn, bankruptcy judge, approved a plan to transfer wholesale at least 50,000 customer accounts linked to CME to other US futures brokers. James Kobak, a lawyer for the bankruptcy trustee, said that without the plan, accounts would “need to be liquidated in a matter of hours or days”.Vincent Lazar, a CME attorney, said: “We’re working night and day …to attempt to find a home for these accounts.”It was still unclear why the money was unaccounted for. The CFTC, in a court filing, revealed MF Global’s general counsel Laurie Ferber emailed the regulator at 7.18pm Monday – hours after the bankruptcy filing – to say that it had “discovered a significant shortfall in its segregated funds account”.CME, whose oversight of MF Global has been questioned, said it appeared that any transfer of customer funds occurred after an on-site review last week when “the results of our review indicated that MF Global was in compliance with its segregation requirements”.It added that it “now appears that the firm made subsequent transfers of customer segregated funds in a manner that may have been designed to avoid detection” and they were not disclosed by MF Global to CME until Monday when it filed for bankruptcy.MF Global clients have expressed anger that they have no clarity on the state of their funds two days after the firm collapsed. One London-based futures trader said he had learnt that his positions had been liquidated on Tuesday yet a statement sent on Wednesday by KPMG, special administrator to the company’s UK arm, showed them as still active.“Our role as special administrators does not involve giving advice to MF Global UK’s customers,” said Richard Fleming, UK head of restructuring at KPMG. “The system was frozen on our appointment and it is then the right of the exchanges to close out all their positions if they want to.”Additional reporting by Philip Stafford and Megan Murphy in London
569;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:23:53+0000;ICE says MF Global did not break its rules;Customer accounts were fully funded;MF Global’s collateral accounts at IntercontinentalExchange, the US’s second biggest futures exchange by revenues, were in full compliance with rules relating to the management of customer segregated funds at the time of its bankruptcy filing, the exchange group said on Wednesday.The assurance came a day after CME Group – the US’s main futures exchange operator that acted as self-regulatory body to the collapsed broker-dealer as well as hosting its trades – said MF Global had broken rules relating to customer segregated funds.US rules require customer funds to be kept separate from a futures broker’s own funds. MF Global’s action in the days leading up to its bankruptcy filing on Monday – the eighth biggest corporate collapse in US history and the largest of any financial firm since Lehman Brothers in 2008 – are now under investigation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the FBI, according to people familiar with the situation.But Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said ICE had not encountered the same issues as CME. “ICE has always been in receipt of the full amount of margin money required for the positions in our clearing houses,” he said. In terms of segregated accounts “they did not violate any of our rules”.Mr Sprecher contrasted the position of ICE with CME, where MF Global was the top broker by volume on the energy and metals markets. He said MF had represented a “low, single-digit number” in terms of the percentage of activity at ICE’s clearing houses.He also sought to distinguish ICE’s experience in the fallout of the collapse with that of CME. “ICE is in a very strong position,” he said.“We believe we have ample collateral to assist in the orderly movement of customers to new member firms or the termination and liquidation of their positions.”After the bankruptcy filing, ICE sold off MF Global’s non-cash collateral and seconded traders to hedge the broker’s portfolio and to liquidate accounts, he said. Mr Sprecher made his remarks as ICE announced quarterly profits ahead of expectations.Net income in the three months to the end of September was $133m or $1.80 per share, up from $96m or $1.29 per share in the same period last year.Excluding extraordinary items, earnings per share were $1.87, above analysts’ average forecasts. ICE shares were trading 0.7 per cent higher by mid-morning in New York at $124.09.
570;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-02T22:21:19Z;MasterCard surges after rise in card spending;Wall Street sees wider bounce;Shares in MasterCard surged on Wednesday after the credit and debit card company said spending on its cards was up 18.1 per cent in the quarter to the end of September, compared with the same period last year. Shares rose 7 per cent to $357.66.“The MasterCard results show no signs of a macro slowdown, even in Europe,” said Glenn Greene at Oppenheimer Securities.The spending surge did not appear to be driven by higher consumer borrowing: spending on US credit cards was up 7 per cent year on year, whereas debit cards were up 23 per cent.Wall Street saw a wider bounce, with the S&P 500 up 1.6 per cent to 1,237.90. The benchmark index had pared early gains as Fed president Ben Bernanke said inflation would stay below its 2 per cent target through 2014, but the index moved higher again in the afternoon.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was up 2.8 per cent, as much as any other sector, in a clear sign of a Europe-driven rally. Bank of America rose 5 per cent to $6.72 and Morgan Stanley 3.3 per cent to $16.76.But insurer Genworth Financial saw the biggest bounce, up 5.7 per cent to $6.17. Genworth has been one of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500 in recent months, with investors wary of its vulnerability to the eurozone.Bank stocks had plunged on Tuesday after the Greek prime minister’s call for a referendum on his country’s eurozone bail-out, but on Wednesday some investors found reasons to be cheerful about the latest twist in Europe’s saga.“Because politicians can change their minds once in power, a referendum could bring more clarity on the issue and force more decisive resolutions than we have seen through the negotiation process,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.5 per cent to 11,836.04 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.3 per cent to 2,639.98.Wireless network providers surged after the House of Representatives voted on Monday to bar new state and local taxes on wireless services. The bill was passed on Tuesday. MetroPCS, a national wireless provider, was up 11.9 per cent to $8.57, while Clearwire was up 10.3 per cent to $2.04.Infrastructure contractor Quanta Services was up 11.6 per cent to $22.14 after it said one of its units would be part of a venture that would build Transcanada’s Keystone XL Pipeline.EOG Resources jumped 11.8 per cent to $96.04 as it raised its output of lucrative liquid gas and oil. Liquids production was up 49 per cent compared with the same quarter last year. EOG was spun off from Enron a decade ago as a domestic natural gas driller, but the company has turned to crude oil as natural-gas prices have slumped.Pioneer Natural Resources, which has also struggled to navigate falling natural gas prices, leapt 12.6 per cent to $91.16. The company has suffered significant hedging losses in recent quarters, but this quarter it booked profits of about $200m by marking derivative contracts to market prices.Time Warner was off 0.8 per cent to $33.57, as investors appeared to put a more than 50 per cent year-on-year jump in third-quarter profits down to the box office success of its last Harry Potter film.Fibre optic manufacturer JDS Uniphase rose 8.5 per cent to $12.46 as earnings, excluding some items, of 18 cents per share, easily beat expectations because of high sales of laser products.BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion fell 2 per cent to $18.91 to close below its book value for the first time in nine years. That means RIM’s market capitalisation is now lower than the market value of its property, patents and other assets.Intercontinental­Exchange fell 0.5 per cent to $122.62. Shares had increased as much as 5 per cent after quarterly results showed a 38 per cent surge in income, driven by strong trading volume in its oil futures contracts.CME Group, the largest US exchange group by market capitalisation, bounced back 7.5 per cent to $259.39. The stock had sold heavily on Tuesday, after Craig Donohue, chief executive, said the derivatives broker-dealer MF Global had broken CME’s rules on segregating customer and broker accounts.Medical technology company Becton Dickinson fell 4.6 per cent to $72.60, as income for the quarter ended September 30 fell to $300m and the company’s full-year earnings forecast disappointed analysts.
571;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-02T15:20:33Z;NYSE says EU has ‘no issues’ with D Börse arm;;NYSE Euronext has told staff that Brussels has “no issues” with many areas of its proposed deal with Deutsche Börse, including the latter’s Clearstream settlement business, although the exchanges face a another meeting with EU competition authorities on November 8.The comments are likely to allay speculation that one of the two exchanges could be forced to divest some parts of their businesses in order to secure regulatory approval for their merger, which would create one of the world’s largest exchanges operators.The bourses had two days of hearings in Brussels into the deal last week as they looked to persuade regulators conducting an in-depth probe into the €12bn ($16.6bn) deal. Authorities are deciding whether to allow a combination which would create a near-monopoly in trading and clearing of exchange-traded derivatives in Europe. A verdict is due by Christmas.“There are no issues with regard to our equities, listings, market data, technology or settlement/depository businesses, and there is even some agreement with regard to our derivatives business,” Duncan Niederauer, chief executive, told employees in an email. Excerpts were filed to US authorities on November 1.Mr Niederauer has long ruled out a potential sale of a derivatives business as potential remedy to satisfy competition authorities but market participants have speculated other operations, such as Clearstream, the custody and settlement arm of Deutsche Börse, could be sacrificed. Clearstream is the part of the business that calculates and manages the amount of collateral that market participants have to post as a guarantee of a trade.However Mr Niederauer added: “We will head back to Brussels the week of November 7 to assess where we stand …and discuss any remaining issues with the Commission.”NYSE and Deutsche Börse argued at the hearing that the exchange-traded derivatives markets are global and that the combined group would face competition from rivals such as CME Group of the US. Rival European stock exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange, Nasdaq OMX and Chi-X Europe have voiced concerns over the combination, as has Icap, the interdealer broker.Mr Niederauer described NYSE’s tactics in the two-day hearing as playing “offense” on the first day “while rebutting the Commission’s findings”. The second day, he said, “required more nimbleness, as the ‘dissentors’, primarily in the form of competitors with obvious motivations, were given the opportunity to express themselves”.
572;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-02T13:36:05Z;Quick View: Time to go Brazilian?;;The revelation by CME Group that MF Global had broken the exchange and US regulators’ rules on ensuring that house and client collateral funds are kept separate is of course shocking.But it is also a reminder that in the world of exchange-traded futures, systems and practices that have grown up in the almost 40 years since the invention of financial futures in Chicago have not been stress-tested sufficiently to avoid stuff like this happening.It is illegal in the US not to ensure that the collateral behind a firm’s trade is held in a separate account at a clearing house from the collateral behind that firm’s client’s trade. But where were the safeguards, regulatory or otherwise, to ensure that this didn’t happen?Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, said that MF Global had failed to meet both CME and rules from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) requiring such segregation of collateral.What is allowed is the holding of clients’ trades and the firm’s trades in one “omnibus” account. There’s a good reason for that: it allows for the netting of positions and more efficient collateral management.But the collateral itself – the money that gets tied up in the event of a default by a clearing member of their client (or both) – is the key part. There must be segregation between house and client collateral.We don’t yet know the facts.It has been speculated to me that what may have happened is that MF Global may have used client collateral to cover margin calls in the very recent past.Ultimately this has to do with how the market structure has been built, as well as regulatory oversight – or lack of it.In Brazil – a much smaller market – they have had a lot of experience on this front. If there is one thing that currency and other crises have taught Brazilian regulators, it is “safety first” with market structures.There, not only are omnibus accounts not allowed, but collateral must be posted in the name of the entity that is posting it, with an “identifier” so that regulators can immediately see who has what.The accounts that are allowed are held at the clearing house and the clearing house then places the money overnight with the central bank. By contrast, in the US, CME would place such monies with banks.Moreover Brazil’s post-trade arrangements allow for far more certainty and transparency than in US and European markets, as Tony Freeman of Omgeo writes here.In the UK, there is no legal requirement to segregate client and house collateral. The system relies instead on firms adhering to “best practice”. The Financial Services Authority says it’s on top of this, and in June last year slapped its biggest ever fine for violation of the rules, on JPMorgan.But is this enough?The recent UBS rogue trader scandal, where a trader apparently was able to take advantage of dysfunctional and outdated trade confirmation and settlement processes, shows that bad stuff can and will happen as a direct result of market structures either not being fit for purpose and/or practices around them not having been tested properly and monitored by regulators.The Brazilian case does have one downside: lack of omnibus accounts means firms can’t take advantage of any collateral efficiencies, meaning that Brazil is a bit more expensive to trade than other markets.But in the interest of safety, would this not be the better system even with this trade-off?Consider the comment from John Lothian, in his latest newsletter, where he bemoans the chaos that has ensued as a result of the MF Global collapse:“It is clear that there are lessons to be learned by the industry, regulators and customers. When the smoke clears, we shall explore those lessons. It is clear to me though that a firm’s disaster recovery plan should include a plan for this kind of disaster. Firms and clients were forced to improvise how to operate in a log-jammed environment of the biggest retail futures broker having their electronic access to exchanges cut off. This plunged the operations of the firm and its clients into an early 1980s mode, but without all of the phone clerks to be able to handle the order flow.”At least the clearing houses appear to be doing their job properly, from what we know so far.But it is time for CFTC officials and other US regulators to head down to São Paulo to take a look, I’d say.

574;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-02T01:53:39Z;Australia grain and wool futures resume trading;;Australia’s agricultural commodities market resumed trading on Wednesday morning, a day after ASX, the exchange operator, shut it down in the wake of the collapse of MF Global.The exchange had said it took the decision on Tuesday to close the grain and wool markets “until further notice” given the large amount of outstanding contracts held by the US broker, highlighting the impact the bankruptcy of MF Global has had on futures markets.MF Global has an outsize market share in Australian commodities markets. The company said on its website that its customers accounted for “over” 80 per cent of the turnover in the country’s wool contracts.The indefinite shutdown in Australia went far beyond the measures taken on Monday by other leading commodities exchanges, including the CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and the London Metal Exchange, which only suspended the broker.Nonetheless, trading volumes across commodity markets have been thin and trading nervous as investors attempt to extricate themselves from positions held with MF Global.The company was one of the largest global commodity brokers, with the leading position by volumes on Nymex and Comex, where energy and metals futures are traded, according its website. It was also one of 12 companies authorised to trade on the London Metal Exchange ring.Its bankruptcy is likely to be a boon for other commodity brokers, such as INTL FCStone, RJ O’Brien and Marex Spectron, as well as in-house brokerages at banks such as JPMorgan, UBS, Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas. “The trickle of accounts wanting to open up late last week has turned into a torrent,” an executive at a rival brokerage said.Australia is the world’s largest wool exporter and the country’s wool futures are one of the most important global benchmarks for the fibre industry.The ASX said in a notice to its members on Tuesday that it had decided to suspend the agricultural markets for grain and wool “given the significant percentage of open interest held by [MF Global], in order to maintain a fair, orderly and transparent market.”“They [MF Global] were quite happy to make markets. You remove them from the market then the market now has to look for another liquidity provider. I think that will happen but we’ll really need to give it a bit of time,” said Jonathan Barratt, head of Australia’s Commodity Broking Services.ASX did not answer calls seeking comment.Additional reporting by Sarah Mishkin in Hong Kong
575;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;CME Group says MF Global broke rules;;MF Global broke rules on keeping customer money separate from its own trading accounts, according to the CME Group, which acted as self-regulatory body to the collapsed broker-dealer as well as hosting its trades.According to people familiar with the situation on Tuesday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was investigating MF Global’s accounting – after regulators discovered an alleged shortfall in client funds of several hundred million dollars – and the Federal Bureau of Investigation was looking into the matter.MF Global declined to comment. But a lawyer for MF Global told a New York court on Tuesday that “to the best knowledge of management, there is no shortfall”. Kenneth Ziman told the bankruptcy court that most of MF Global’s US assets were held at its brokerage unit.Regulators have not ruled out the possibility that all the clients’ funds will ultimately be accounted for as the firm’s positions are unwound but believe MF Global has, at the least, broken rules on segregating funds.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, said MF Global had failed to meet both CME rules on segregated accounts and those of the CFTC. “While we’re unable to determine the precise scope of the firm’s violation at this time, we are investigating the circumstances of the firm’s failure,” he said.US rules require customer funds to be held separately from a futures broker’s own funds. As a self-regulatory organisation, CME is obliged to monitor its member firms and ensure they meet legal requirements.“The CME Group is the SRO for MF Global. They’re the ones that go out and audit them and monitor their activities,” said the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory group.The NFA, also based in Chicago, oversees smaller futures brokers that are not exchange clearing members. As the fallout from the bankruptcy continued to be felt, the NFA said the association is “monitoring some firms for cash shortfalls because of MF”, declining to name them.A US manager of a fund of commodity hedge funds said traders’ positions were “trapped at MF”. Futures positions were being transferred to other brokers, but not cash, the manager said.Jerry Markham, a law professor and derivatives specialist at Florida International University, said that customer segregation is required for both futures and securities, but securities accounts are also insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.“These things are so complex and fast-moving, it’s going to be difficult for regulators to identify problems before it is too late,” Mr Markham said.Separately, Jon Corzine, MF Global chief executive, is expected to leave his position as operating partner at JC Flowers, the private equity firm, after the MF Global failure, according to a person familiar with the situation. JC Flowers has lost $48m in the MF Global collapse, this person said.
576;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-01T18:47:41Z;MF Global’s fall from ‘junk’ to bankrupt;;The job of unravelling MF Global’s books now goes to bankruptcy court and an unwieldy collection of regulators – and possibly law enforcement officials – some of whom have their own questions to answer about their scrutiny of the failed broker-dealer.It became clear last week that the company had no independent future after credit rating agencies cut it to “junk” on fears over its bets on European sovereign debt. But it was a mysterious mismatch in MF Global’s books, with allegedly hundreds of millions of dollars missing from client accounts, that scuppered a last-ditch sale to its rival Interactive Brokers Group and is now the focus of regulatory attention.The CME Group, on whose Comex metal and Nymex energy exchanges MF Global was the top broker by volume, said it had discovered MF Global was in “violation” of its rules on segregating accounts. “They were ‘under-segged’,” said another person familiar with the work of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission in examining the books.Daniel Waldman, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter and former CFTC general counsel, said: “The segregation system is extremely important for the protection of customers, the whole notion being that house and customers funds are not commingled. If you’re dipping into customer funds to cover proprietary losses, that is a huge no-no.“There’s a pretty strict legal requirement,” he added. “There are audits and there are reviews, But if somebody takes a big loss in Europe and is willing to dip into an account he shouldn’t be dipping into, unless you’ve got a policeman on the beat all the time it’s going to be hard to catch this kind of misfeasance.”MF Global did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday but other people close to the situation said they expected the shortfall might ultimately prove much smaller than it initially appeared.A widespread concern among futures traders in Chicago is over how much of customers’ funds held in MF Global’s segregated clearing account at the CME they will be able to reclaim.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, suggested on Tuesday that customers would ultimately be responsible and suggested they may have to bear any shortfalls. “Customers have the risk of other customer losses in the customer segregated pool and there’s always the risk as well that customer funds are not properly protected,” he said.As of August 31, MF Global was required to keep $7.3bn in segregated accounts on behalf of customers, according to the CFTC.The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which protects customer money in a brokerage failure, will advance funds to customers whose funds are tied up in the failed brokerage, said Stephen Harbeck, SIPC’s chief executive.James Giddens, the court-appointed trustee, is likely to hire forensic accountants to comb through MF Global’s books to determine why it failed, and how customers’ funds went missing, if that ends up being the case, Mr Harbeck said.The SEC told the SIPC that customer funds from the company’s commodities business were missing, he said, adding that no customer cash or securities from MF Global’s securities business were missing.Apart from whether the CME and CFTC should have detected violations of the rules before the company began to fail, questions are also being asked of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which appointed MF Global as a primary dealer, licensing it to sell government securities.“The critical question in regard to MF Global has not been asked. How is it that the Fed allowed a primary dealer to operate with 40-to-one leverage in this day and age?” said Steve Blitz, senior economist at ITG Investment Research in New York.The New York Fed is not the regulator for broker-dealers such as MF Global - it merely requires its primary dealer counterparties to have a minimum level of capital. But that raises the question of who is monitoring the systemic risk from companies such as MF.As well as clients, creditors to MF Global are left waiting for the case to work its way through bankruptcy court, including bondholders who bought bonds as recently as August. Then MF Global sold $325m of five-year bonds, which have since traded to about 40 cents on the dollar.“It is fairly unusual that you have a default happen that quickly, particularly on an issue where they haven’t even paid a coupon yet,” said Lon Erickson, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.Reporting by Tom Braithwaite, Gregory Meyer, Kara Scannell, Shahien Nasiripour, Nicole Bullock and Dan McCrum in New York, Hal Weitzman in Chicago and Robin Harding in Washington
577;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-01T14:38:50Z;Wall Street tumbles in wake of Europe woes;Gains of the last week wiped out;Shares in the CME Group tumbled 8.6 per cent to $251.88 on Tuesday, as the biggest US exchange business by market capitalisation was caught up in the collapse of broker-dealer MF Global. CME chief executive Craig Donohue admitted MF Global, one of the biggest players in CME’s derivatives markets, had failed to segregate customer money from its own trading account, as required by CME rules.The regulatory lapse overshadowed better than expected third quarter results. Reveues of $874m were almost 20 per cent higher than the same quarter in 2010, while analysts welcomed the company’s commitment to keep a tight rein on costs.“Futures exchanges have been the poster child for the industry because they of their stability after Lehman Brothers and at other times of stress, so when investors hear about funds being misplaced, that leaves a big question mark,” said Alex Kramm, US exchanges analyst at UBS.The S&P 500 fell 2.8 per cent to 1,218.28, its worst day in a month, with heavy selling leading to sharp downward moves in the first and last fifteen minutes of trading.US investors reacted with dismay to the Greek prime minister’s call for a referendum on his country’s bail-out package. “There is a sense we’re being held hostage by the Greek government,” Phil Orlando, chief investment strategist at Federated Investors complained.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 4.7 per cent as yields on Italian bonds soared to euro-era highs. Big bank stocks were led down by Morgan Stanley, down 8 per cent to $16.23, while Citigroup fell 7.7 per cent to $29.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.5 per cent to 11,657.96 and the Nasdaq composite index fell 2.9 per cent to 2,606.96. Of the three main indices only the Dow remained in positive territory for the year.Quarterly results from Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceutical company by revenues, told of robust global demand in the quarter ended September 30. Înternational revenues grew by 15 per cent year-on-year, while US sales declined by 3 per cent.Pfizer was up 0.4 per cent to $19.63. the only stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to record gain.The material and industrial sectors of the S&P 500 had fallen as much as 4.5 per cent, as a survery of purchasing managers suggested Chinese manufacturing was slowing.But bot sectors rallied as company fundamentals replaced global growth worries as the main driver of stocks by the end of the day.Pay-as-you-go U.S. wireless carrier MetroPCS Communications fell 9.9 per cent to $7.66, after subscriber growth fell for the second consecutive quarter, leaving the company with income of $69m in the quarter ended September 30, a fall of10 per cent from the same quarter in 2010.New Jersey-based lender Hudson City Bancorp , down 9.3 per cent to 5.67, and oil field services company Baker Hughes, off 8.4 per cent to $53.11, were also both punished for missed earnings estimates.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare stood out on Tuesday after confounding analyst expectations of a third quarter loss, posting earnings of 4 cents a share. Tenet shares rose 0.9 per cent to $4.77.The Vix index of expected 30 day volatility in the S&P 500 rose 18.6 per cent to close above 35. That followed two weeks of sustained falls up to the end of last week, which had seen the Vix drop beneath 25 for the first time since early August.“Its a little crazy out there this morning,” said Randy Warren, portfolio manager at Warren Financial Service. “We kept our Vix options as insurance against a downside, which I’m very happy about right now because they’re going to be popping. But did I expect a day like this? No.”Citigroup analysts published an upbeat note on luxury retailers, urging clients to buy Apple, Estee Lauder, and Saks, all stocks which Citi analysts expect to benefit from an “hourglass effect,” concentrating consumer spending at discount and luxury stores.“The high-end consumer continues to improve,” wrote Deborah Weinswig, Citi’s principal US retail analyst, arguing that rising pre-tax profits at high-paying employers would sustain spending growth by wealthy Americans.
578;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-01T12:44:11Z;CME says MF Global broke collateral rules;;CME Group, the biggest US futures exchange operator and key regulator of MF Global, the broker-dealer that filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, said the company had failed to comply with rules on collateral in segregated customer accounts.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, said the exchange group had discovered that the firm – run by Jon Corzine, an ex-chief executive of Goldman Sachs and a former New Jersey senator and governor – had contravened both its own rules on customer fund segregation and those of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.“CME has determined that MF Global is not in compliance with CFTC and CME customer segregation requirements,” Mr Donohue said. “While we’re unable to determine the precise scope of the firm’s violation at this time, we are investigating the circumstances of the firm’s failure.”Mr Donohue’s remarks will cast a spotlight on CME’s oversight capabilities, as authorities attempt to piece together the factors behind the demise of MF Global.US rules require customer funds to be held separately from a futures broker’s own funds. As a designated self-regulatory organisation, CME is obliged to monitor its member firms and ensure they fulfill their legal requirements.If CME discovers a member is not complying, it gives the firm time to come into compliance before taking stronger action – such as suspending MF Global’s trading privileges, which the exchange group did on Monday morning.“We do provide audit and capital supervision for our clearing member firms and pursuant to our designated self-regulatory responsibilities we do have access to detailed customer account-level information,” Mr Donohue said.A widespread concern among futures traders in Chicago is over how much of customers’ funds held in MF Global’s segregated clearing account at the CME they will be able to reclaim.Mr Donohue suggested on Tuesday that customers would ultimately be responsible for losses and suggested they may have to bear any shortfalls. “Customers have the risk of other customer losses in the customer segregated pool and there’s always the risk as well that customer funds are not properly protected,” he said.As of August 31, MF Global was required to keep $7.3bn in segregated accounts on behalf of customers, according to the CFTC.The Securities and Exchange Commission and the CFTC said on Monday night after the collapse of the group that MF Global had reported “possible deficiencies in customer futures segregated accounts held at the firm” that apparently scuppered a last-minute attempt to sell itself to Interactive Brokers.Several hundred million dollars appeared to be missing from MF Global’s books, according to people familiar with the matter, although it is unclear whether that related to poor record-keeping or something more serious.Mr Donohue said CME was working with the CFTC and would co-operate with the bankruptcy court.Asked if CME was now reviewing all other clearing member accounts, a CME spokeswoman told the FT: “As a designated self-regulatory organisation, we regularly monitor for compliance of all rules.”Mr Donohue made the remarks as CME reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. CME made a net income in the third quarter of $316m or $4.74 per share, up from $244m or $3.66 per share in the same period last year and ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about $4.64 per share.Revenues were $874m, up from $733m last year and just ahead of Wall Street expectations of about $872m. The biggest driver of the revenue increase was clearing and transaction fees, which increased to $733m from $599m last year as hedging and use of over-the-counter clearing soared on the back of the European sovereign debt crisis.CME shares were trading down 7.6 per cent at $254.66 by midday in New York.
579;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-11-01T10:00:47Z;MF Global’s demise felt by commodities exchanges;Bankruptcy heralds shift of power in brokerage industry;"The most dramatic effect of MF Global’s bankruptcy is being felt on the other side of the world from the company’s New York offices. Sheep farmers in Australia woke up on Tuesday morning to discover their wool futures market had closed down. MF Global accounted for 80 per cent of trading.The story for larger markets such as oil, corn or copper markets is less extreme. But at futures exchanges around the world, one of the largest commodity brokers will not turn up for business today. When the London Metal Exchange opens its ring for the first trading session at 11.40am this morning, one fewer broker will take his seat on the red leather.MF Global was, of course, more than just a commodities broker, but its size and scale in the relatively small world of commodities broking means its bankruptcy could reshape the industry.Particularly in US futures markets, MF Global was a force to be reckoned with. By volumes traded, it was the leading broker on Nymex and Comex, where energy and metals futures are traded. MF Global was also the second-largest trader on CME and the third-largest on the CBOT, the marketplace for the most important global grains contracts, according to data published on the company’s own website.Even outside the US, it was the number three dealer on ICE Futures Europe, where Brent crude and Gasoil are traded, number 4 on Euronext Liffe, and number one on the Sydney Futures Exchange, the commodities arm of ASX which shut down on Tuesday.The LME doesn’t publish data on trading volumes by individual brokers, but MF Global was one of only 12 companies authorised to trade on the ring, and, according to competitors, consistently one of the leaders in terms of volume.The immediate concern now that MF Global has succumbed to bankruptcy will be to disentangle the company’s proprietary positions from those of its customers and to return their money. Trading volumes across commodities, which were thin on Monday, should pick up as investors succeed in moving their accounts to other brokers and start trading again.In that way, the bankruptcy of MF Global appears, so far, to be following the pattern of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The collapse had a significant, but short-term impact on commodities trading, slowing business for days as customers moved accounts elsewhere.Perhaps more significant once the dust has settled will be the impact on the brokerage industry.The loss of MF Global will leave an even greater share of futures trading in the hands of bank-owned brokers, such as JPMorgan, UBS, Goldman Sachs, and BNP Paribas.The shift of power could be even more dramatic as it comes at the same time as another leading commodity broker, Newedge, is facing a period of uncertainty while its owners, Société Générale and Crédit Agricole, contemplate a sale.The loss of one of their most aggressive competitors will also benefit the few large commodities brokers who are independent of banks, such as INTL FCStone, RJ O’Brien, OTC Global, Marex Spectron, GFI and PVM. One of these groups could certainly be in the running to kick start their expansion plans by buying part of MF Global out of bankruptcy; but even if they do not, they are likely to gain from its demise.MF Global’s approach to brokerage was to win market share by competing aggressively on brokerage fees, competitors say. As such, its bankruptcy should mean higher fees – as well as higher market share – for other brokers.Moreover, its relatively orderly collapse appears to have highlighted the benefits of central clearing, and so could accelerate a move towards exchange-traded contracts that began with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and is being pushed by regulators.Ultimately, the end of MF Global may be a boon for both commodities brokers and exchanges.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer and Javier Blas"
580;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-31T23:35:23Z;Brussels probe puts silos under scrutiny;;"This week, Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, two of the world’s largest exchanges, will be hoping that after lengthy talks in Brussels they have persuaded European antitrust regulators to approve their plan to merge.Two days of hearings at the European Commission ended last week, marking a key milestone since the German-US operators in February unveiled a plan to combine to create the world’s largest bourse.At stake is not merely the creation of the world’s largest company listings platform – at first glance the most obvious result of the merger.The Commission’s antitrust division has misgivings about the combination of the Börse’s Eurex futures arm with NYSE Euronext’s Liffe platform, which would have more than 95 per cent of trading in European futures contracts, a popular type of exchange-trade derivative instrument.Yet what makes this case unusual is that the same issue of competition in derivatives is enshrined in sweeping pan-European reform of the equities and derivatives markets that is happening at the same time – known as “Mifid II”.Both developments have resulted in a fierce battle over the future of a business model in the exchange world that has remained unchanged for decades: the “vertical silo”.That refers to a structure where an exchange owns its own clearing house in one integrated business. It allows an exchange to lock in clearing revenue that otherwise would go to an external provider.It also gives the exchange a powerful strategic weapon, since ownership of a clearing house makes it hard – if not impossible – for rival exchanges to offer trading in the same derivatives offered by the silo.Deutsche Börse operates as such a structure and its relatively high valuation in comparison with other exchange groups has long been underpinned by it; the same applies to CME Group, the US futures operator.Yet the silo is coming under threat in Europe that could have repercussions across the global exchange business.As part of its probe, Brussels has focused on whether the merged entity should have to open up access to its Frankfurt-based clearing house to rivals, to ensure greater competition in exchange-traded, or listed, derivatives.A new version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, known as Mifid II, and unveiled earlier in October as part of Europe’s commitment to meeting G20 financial market reforms, challenges the silo by insisting that clearing houses allow “open access” to competitors’ exchanges.A related European proposal called “Mifir” would require that exchanges that own stock index businesses allow rival exchanges to license those indices so they can spin rival products off them. The Börse owns the Euro Stoxx index.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, says that the proposals are “a game-changing attempt to open up European futures competition”.Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, both of which have ambitions to grow in derivatives, have lobbied in favour of Mifid. So have interdealer brokers such as Icap, which want as much choice in derivatives clearing as possible.Daniel Garrod, analyst at Barclays Capital, says that under Mifid and Mifir, “Deutsche Börse’s silo clearing model and control over indices faces the greatest threats [in the sector]”.The German and US groups argue that now is not the time to be considering disrupting a model in exchange-traded derivatives that could lead to fragmented derivatives markets, pointing to the unintended consequences of what some see as excessive fragmentation in the equities markets that has resulted since the original Mifod was enacted in 2007.Reto Francioni, the Börse’s chief executive, says: “We are convinced that the combination of our exchange groups will enhance transparency and strengthen regulators’ roles in Europe and the US …helping make markets less vulnerable to crisis situations.”The Börse and NYSE have also sought to persuade antitrust officials not to limit the definition of the derivatives market to Europe, arguing that the merged group would face stiff competition from the CME and that the derivatives markets are global, not regional.There would be a danger in Europe unilaterally forcing competition in listed derivatives, they argue, since this would leave the silo intact in the US, leaving Europe exposed without a champion in derivatives trading.And Börse officials point out that even the LSE is moving closer to a vertical model, with its attempt to take a controlling stake in London-based clearer LCH.Clearnet, even as the UK bourse makes the case against the existing silo structure.Some suggest that if Europe did force a change to the market structure to force more competition in listed derivatives, the US might end up following even though the US antitrust authorities in 2007 approved the takeover by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange of the Chicago Board of Trade. That created a near-monopoly in US futures trading, similar in scale to what would result from a combination of Eurex and Liffe in Europe.John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, which represents banks and brokers in the futures markets, said: “I think if the Europeans go down that road there will be political pressure in the US to do the same, and it will be the exchanges’ responsibility to defend their vertical silo.”The FIA’s members have been behind repeated and ultimately failed attempts to take on the CME and CBOT by launching rival platforms, most recently by backing ELX, a small futures exchange that competes with the CME in eurodollar futures.Craig Donohue, chief executive of CME Group, said in an interview at the exchange group’s Global Financial Leadership Conference in Florida last week there was no appetite for change to the market structure for derivatives in the US. “We are continuing to see more and more exchanges moving to vertical silo models because they are more efficient. I think there’s ample evidence of that.”On Monday, the creation of a silo in Canadian markets moved a step closer after the board of TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal exchanges, accepted an offer from the Maple consortium of banks and pension funds to create an integrated exchange and clearing group.Mr Donohue added that in the Dodd-Frank act - which contains similar provisions on over-the-counter-derivatives reform to Mifid, Mifir and related proposals called the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation - the US Congress “made a conscious and clear decision to retain the existing structure for listed derivatives”.Mifid has yet to be finalised by the European Parliament and could yet be changed by lobbying. But as the German-US groups await the outcome of the antitrust probe, the future of the silo has never been more uncertain.Much will depend on whether Europe feels it can risk going it alone with a significant change to the structure for the futures markets. Niki Beattie, managing director of Market Structure Partners, a consultancy, believes Europe will make that move. “The Europeans are saying, in terms of market structure, we can lead the way on this”."
581;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-27T15:56:30Z;NYSE and Deutsche Börse tie-up appeal;;NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse on Thursday appealed to antitrust authorities in Brussels to reconsider their initial assessment of the exchange operators’ plan to create the world’s largest bourse, arguing that the deal should be assessed in a global, not merely a narrow European context.The development came at the start of two days of hearings in Brussels into the deal, which is the only cross-border exchanges deal remaining after a number of tie-ups evaporated due to antitrust and nationalist concerns.At stake is whether Brussels will decide that the combination, creating a near-monopoly in exchange-traded derivatives in Europe, would stifle user choice and concentrate too much market power in the hands of one player.Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext are waging an increasingly urgent campaign to counter European Commission concerns about the deal, in particular signs that the Commission team working on the case have limited their assessment of the deal to its effects on competition in the European markets.Speaking to the Financial Times, Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, said the European Commission’s argument was “thorough”.However, he added: “I think we are trying to point out the incompleteness to some of their arguments and to try to explain that the markets have evolved dramatically in the last five or 10 years and a narrow definition of markets or products or competition is, in our minds, not appropriate.”NYSE and the Börse argued at the hearing that the exchange-traded derivatives markets are global and that the combined group would face competition from rivals such as CME Group of the US.Narrowing their assessment of the deal to Europe would fail to take account of that at a time when Europe’s markets face threats from emerging Asian players too, the exchange groups argued.Brussels produced a detailed assessment of the deal in a “statement of objections” issued to the parties three weeks ago. In it, officials appeared to have settled on a relatively narrow definition of the derivatives markets, people familiar with the document say.That would focus on whether a combination of the Börse’s Eurex futures exchange with Liffe, NYSE Euronext’s futures platform, would lead to a loss of competition in key futures contracts, if antitrust officials agree that, currently, Eurex and Liffe compete with each other.The London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq OMX, which are keen to compete against Eurex and Liffe, argue that they do compete.The German and US operators also argued at the hearing that the Commission should include the large over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets, and not restrict the scope of the probe to existing exchange-traded markets.Any assessment of the likely success or failure of the deal to pass antitrust muster increasingly revolves around these two issues.Both groups are steadfastly refusing in public to entertain the idea of making concessions to try and win regulatory clearance. If the parties want to avoid the deadline for a final decision on the deal being pushed into next year their last opportunity to propose so-called “remedies” is the end of next week.Mr Niederauer said: “We will not front-run the regulatory process.” His comments came as his group and Deutsche Börse unveiled a surprise joint share repurchase plan.NYSE Euronext said it would repurchase up to $100m in common stock, while Deutsche Börse said it would buy back about €100m. Both groups said the moves had been planned for some time and were in line with broader, previously-announced schemes.However Christopher Harris, analyst at Wells Fargo, said it was a “somewhat surprising development”.The intense lobbying around the DB/NYSE deal has become politically charged since sweeping reforms of European market structures, unveiled by Brussels this month in a new version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, would increase competition in the exchange-trade derivatives markets by requiring that operators such as Deutsche Börse open up their clearing systems to rivals.NYSE and the Börse said they had agreed to co-ordinate their respective share buy-backs “to preserve the ownership percentages of 40 per cent and 60 per cent to be held by former NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse shareholders, respectively, in the combined company following the pending business combination”.The proposed business combination is worth €12.4bn based on Wednesday’s closing prices.“At current trading levels, we do not feel that the underlying strength of our franchise, strong free cash flow generation and the compelling nature of our upcoming merger with Deutsche Börse are properly reflected in our share price,” said Michael Geltzeiler, NYSE’s chief financial officer.“Given our focus on shareholder value, we are recommencing a limited stock buy-back program, on top of the already attractive stream of dividends that we expect to pay out to investors in conjunction with our merger.”Mr Niederauer said: “The key message we are trying to get across today is that there are benefits to all our stakeholders from the merger, whether it is our transacting clients, or the local investment banks or the issuing community or the regulators or the shareholders.“Sometimes we tend to forget the shareholders and we shouldn't forget the shareholders.”Mr Niederauer also argued that unlike other industries, the exchange business was “a lot closer to the economic growth engine than most industries”.“And what I mean by that is if we get the merger right and there is more liquidity in the secondary market and a pan-European market is able to do a capital formation job, and we deliver the efficiencies that we are promising …that puts more capital into the system, which should have direct knock-on effects for access to that capital for people who have jobs to create, and the shared responsibility of rebuilding our economies.“The only way that is going to happen is if that capital finds its way to the job creators – small, medium and large. You might not believe that in a merger of two companies in another industry. You can and should believe that in a merger of two companies in our industry because of what we do every day,” Mr Niederauer added.
582;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:58:35+0000;DB-NYSE Euronext set for EU grilling;;Nine months ago Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, two of the world’s largest exchange groups, unveiled a plan to combine their businesses that was shot through with eye-catching superlatives.It would create the world’s largest listings platform and the largest European derivatives operation.But on Thursday, the combined group’s very size – in particular the near-monopoly it would have in trading of European derivatives – will put the German and US operators on the defensive as European antitrust authorities grill them on the deal. Competition issues rarely come up in the sphere of derivatives in exchange mergers. But, four months into a probe of the deal, Brussels appears to be taking a hard line.It is shaping up to be one of hardest fought regulatory battles the city has seen in years, played out against the backdrop of a wrenching financial crisis where few participants dare upset Germany, the home of Deutsche Börse.In particular the European Commission’s antitrust division has misgivings about the combination of the Börse’s Eurex futures arm with NYSE Euronext’s Liffe platform, which would have over 95 per cent of trading in European futures contracts.What makes this case unusual is that the same issue of competition in derivatives is enshrined in sweeping pan-European reform of the equities and derivatives markets that is happening at the same time. Last week Brussels unveiled a new version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid). This would inject competition into exchange-traded derivatives by taking aim at the “vertical silo” structure where an exchange owns a clearing house – used to finalise trades. It would require silos to open up their clearing houses to accept contracts traded on rival exchanges.Deutsche Börse operates its own clearing house and contracts traded on Eurex and Liffe would all go through it.Niki Beattie, managing director of Market Structure Partners, a consultancy, says Mifid represents “an enormous paradigm shift for Europe”. Competition officials have struggled over market definition, a key assumption underlying competition decisions. In a “statement of objection” sent to the parties, they lean towards a fairly narrow view that restricts it to Europe. This would pose a significant hurdle, since controlling 90 per cent of a market is never easy to explain to competition regulators. This places ever more importance on the exchanges’ contention that the tie-up offers a better degree of financial stability than the fragmented derivatives markets that would result from more competition. But a key thrust of the German-US groups’ case will be to frame the issue in terms of the threat posed to Europe if Brussels does press ahead with that definition, and with breaking up the silo. The silo remains unchallenged in the US, where CME Group, operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a huge rival to the Börse and NYSE Euronext, enjoys a 98 per cent market share in futures trading.Other big financial centres are also home to exchange silos, notably Brazil and China, which have global ambitions for their exchanges. The question is whether European officials feel they can risk striking out on their own, while other jurisdictions leave the silo intact.But until the two-day hearing is over, no one is ready to predict whether the Börse-NYSE deal will pass its antitrust test. “If anyone tells you this is settled, it is because they don’t know what is going on,” said one senior figure. “It is on the edge.”
583;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-21T18:09:11Z;Commodities curbs could hurt legitimate risk hedging;Caps on speculators will inconvenience the wrong people;Someone once said the sign of a good compromise is that nobody is quite happy with the outcome.He obviously never read the Dodd-Frank Act. Come to think of it, at 2,300 pages, it is safe to say that no member of Congress has either. With law firm Davis Polk calculating that it gave a mandate for federal agencies to write 243 rules, conduct 67 studies and issue 22 periodic reports, perhaps the only people who might be pleased with it are lawyers and lobbyists who charge by the hour for helping to interpret and craft its provisions.One of the most contentious, Section 737, finally took off this week after idling on the runway for more than a year despite furious pressure and repeated missed deadlines for a vote. Among other rules, it set complicated position limits on 28 different commodity futures and swaps in US markets as a tool to control speculation.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission passed it by a 3-2 vote, along party lines, with commissioner Michael Dunn, the deciding vote, wondering out loud whether the rule is a “cure for a disease that does not exist”.Not much of an endorsement, and no wonder. Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, undoubtedly one of the brightest and most accomplished men ever to head a federal regulatory agency (he made partner at Goldman Sachs at the tender age of 30), has had to display extraordinary intellectual flexibility to push for a deal.The key support for position limits stems from the idea, discredited in many academic studies, that high prices for oil and other commodities were a result of nefarious speculators rather than supply and demand.Mr Gensler, who was once associated with rabidly free market derivative policies (he helped craft the exemptions some blame for the AIG and Enron fiascos), had to gain support during his contentious nomination process from senators who suggest that hedge funds are as culpable for high pump prices as, say, flawed energy policies or oil sheikhs.Now that he has delivered the rules, though, Mr Gensler’s task is far from over. For one, while his agency has a solid grasp on futures traded on US exchanges, it has a fuzzy one of the far larger, multitrillion-dollar swaps market. Indeed, it has not yet been able to define what is and is not a swap in some cases because many derivatives are tailor-made for clients.Then there is the issue of exchanges or contracts that are outside US jurisdiction. Though European regulators have expressed many of the same concerns and their politicians have been, if anything, more vitriolic about the alleged evils of speculation, it is asking too much for such a complicated set of rules to be harmonised, or even voluntarily adopted, everywhere.At best, it will get complicated. At worst, the new rules will hurt liquidity and, in that way and others, make legitimate hedging more expensive. They may also sap business from now-dominant US exchanges such as CME Group and divert it abroad, with little or no additional protection for American consumers.It is in any case doubtful that speculators are quaking in their boots as a result of Section 737. The greatest inconvenience will be felt by the most milquetoast of players – those who facilitate long-only commodity index bets for the likes of pension funds seeking diversification. Those products may become more expensive and less desirable.Smaller, nimbler and more active players such as hedge funds – the sort of speculator that proponents of the rules imagine cackling greedily as they push up the price of breakfast cereal (though somehow never down, as if that were not profitable) – probably will not care.But at least they may be less stealthy as a group. Because over-the-counter swaps have grown to dwarf exchange-traded futures, observers have had a partial or even misleading picture of speculative activity in any given commodity.Greater market transparency may be the one unequivocally positive development from the new rules. The lawyers, of course, will be pleased whatever the result.spencer.jakab@ft.com
584;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;McGraw-Hill trims full-year forecast;Revenue fell 2.5 per cent to $1.91bn in the third quarter;McGraw-Hill has trimmed its 2011 earnings forecast, after “significant headwinds” in its education and Standard & Poor’s ratings units in the third quarter offset growth in S&P Indices and information brands such as Platts.The media conglomerate said it was making progress on the plan it announced in September to split into two public companies, McGraw-Hill Markets and McGraw-Hill Education, saying it expected to cut costs by at least $100m in the process.It narrowed its forecast for diluted full-year earnings per share to $2.81-$2.86, compared to $2.68 last year. Analysts had expected $2.89 this year after the company said three months ago that earnings would come in at the upper end of a $2.79-$2.89 range.“We are still on track for another year of growth in 2011, but we remain cautious over the balance of the year,” said Terry McGraw, chairman and chief executive, who told analysts on a conference call that the group was watching European markets and Europe’s sovereign debt crisis “very carefully”.Revenue fell 2.5 per cent to $1.91bn in the third quarter and the disposal of its broadcast stations contributed to a 4 per cent fall in net income to $374m. Net income from continuing operations was down 2.1 per cent to $367m. Diluted earnings per share slipped from $1.23 to $1.21 in a period when McGraw-Hill spent $355m buying back stock, up from $300m a quarter earlier.The Standard & Poor’s credit rating agency suffered from market volatility and a steep fall-off in new issues. S&P revenues fell 1.8 per cent to $410m aided by growth in international and non-transaction revenues, but its transaction revenues fell 19.5 per cent as global debt issuance dropped 37.7 per cent.Market volatility helped the index business behind the S&P 500, which reported 30 per cent revenue growth thanks to soaring volume for exchange-traded derivatives contracts. S&P Indices is in talks about a joint venture with CME, the majority owner of Dow Jones Indexes, according to people familiar with the situation, but Mr McGraw declined to comment.McGraw-Hill Education, which competes with Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, reported an 11.1 decline in revenue to $937m, as its elementary and high school division suffered a 21.4 per cent sales decline, driven by lower adoptions of instructional materials by US states suffering from tight budgets, and by a new funding system in Texas.The third quarter is typically the biggest for school instructional materials, and McGraw-Hill had said that some sales had been pushed back from the second quarter, but Mr McGraw said the period proved to be weaker than expected. The total 2011 “adoption” market was likely to be down 17 per cent from 2010, it said.Shares in McGraw-Hill dipped 0.4 per cent to $42.91 by market close.
585;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-16T15:32:14Z;From bar to floor to boardroom;;Meeting Terry Duffy is like meeting an old friend.The executive chairman of CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, is quintessentially Chicago, from his accent to his bonhomie and colourful repartee to his backslapping, bone-crushing handshake. He is a “guy who knows a guy”, able to get things done through his connections and relationships with the right people.It was such a connection that first drew him to derivatives trading. Mr Duffy grew up in blue-collar south-west Chicago, but it was not until he left home to go to Wisconsin for university that he first came across the flashy young traders from the pits of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.In the late 1970s, he was studying at the University of Wisconsin by day and working nights at a bar in Lake Geneva, a resort town popular with wealthy Chicagoans. Futures traders were often in the bar flaunting their wealth. “I knew there were some guys who were traders and they seemed awfully young to have such nice things, but I didn’t have a concept of how they got it,” he recalls.He struck up a friendship with Vincent Schreiber, a trader who, although he was only 10 years the bartender’s senior, had already made enough money to retire. Mr Schreiber noticed that Mr Duffy could remember every customer’s name, drink and running tab. He asked if the bartender had ever considered trading futures, but the conversation went no further.One day after closing up the bar, the two went in search of a nightcap. As they approached a large, Frank Lloyd Wright-designed lakeside mansion, Mr Duffy asked whose house they were going to. Mr Schreiber replied that it was his. The young student was incredulous until he saw photos on the walls of the trader posing with political leaders, including Ronald Reagan (still governor of California at the time).Mr Duffy was impressed at the wealth and the powerful connections, enough to accompany his friend to Chicago to see the exchange. Mr Schreiber became his mentor, sponsoring him, introducing him to the right people, even guaranteeing a $100,000 loss that Mr Duffy suffered a few weeks into his career as a futures broker.“He was the greatest guy in the world,” he says of Mr Schreiber, “but he never gave me a dollar. He gave me something more valuable – his reputation. Back in the day, it didn’t matter what you had, you weren’t going to be a part of the organisation. But Vince walked in with me and said: ‘My reputation is on Terry Duffy,’ and that meant the world to me.”Terry’s a great guy, but I wouldn’t want to get on the wrong side of himMr Duffy recounts the story with obvious affection for his late friend and concedes that his tale belongs to a time when someone could start as a runner on the exchange floor and end up as chairman. Such a route would be unthinkable now, with the open-outcry system of the traditional trading pits having been largely replaced in the past 15 years by electronic trading, and the CME having become a public company shortly after Mr Duffy was elected to lead the board.“It was completely different then. My story couldn’t happen now in that way,” he says. “But you still find people who have different skills and a feel for the market and find their way with respect and discipline. The problem with the UBSs and the Barings of the world is a lack of respect, discipline and controls.”His background as a pit trader makes him unusual among CME’s senior management. “We make 78 per cent of our revenues from trading,” he says. “I did that. I know how that works. That gives me such an advantage in this organisation. I don’t care if it’s open outcry or on a screen. A trader is a trader is a trader.”Talking about his days in the trading pits, he says: “Your word was your honour – you had to make sure you honoured trades. Sometimes when trading was busy, you weren’t even sure who you’d traded with. It was easy to say: ‘I sold you 20’ after the market had gone down precipitously. I would never do things like that because I would never expect people to do that to me.”This betrays another side to Mr Duffy. Behind the congeniality, one sometimes gets a sense of slight menace lurking behind his words. “Terry’s a great guy, but I wouldn’t want to get on the wrong side of him,” says a former colleague.The sort of social codes to which Mr Duffy refers – honour, reputation, respect – have largely dissipated as electronic transactions have eclipsed floor trading, turning what was a tight-knit financial community into a diaspora dispersed across the world.Trading has become more anonymous, making some of Mr Duffy’s former peers nostalgic. He is not. “Am I nostalgic for those days? Not at all,” he says. “I feel nostalgic about each and every day round here. I’m the most blessed guy in this organisation. I’ve learnt the business from the mailroom up to the chairman’s office – I did it all.”● Born: August 15, 1958● Education: 1978-80 Attended the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater but left before graduating to become a trader● Career: 1981 Becomes member of Chicago Mercantile Exchange● 1995 Elected to CME board● 1998 Becomes vice-chairman● 2002 Becomes chairman, and drives through IPO over objections of some board members● 2007 CME buys Chicago Board of Trade, its historic rival● 2008 CME buys New York Mercantile Exchange● Family Married with twin eight-year-old boys● Interests Golf, ice hockey, politicsAsked what his job entails, he is vague. “My duties change by the minute. I will sweep floors, I will go to Washington, DC and talk to the president. Whatever you need in between, I’m happy to do.”So when was the last time he swept a floor? He smiles. “I’ll do whatever it takes. I use that as an example.”One of his key duties is to head CME’s efforts on trying to shape financial regulation. Mr Duffy is in Washington frequently as regulators flesh out the rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act, aimed at overhauling oversight of the financial industry in the wake of the crisis.It is a forum that plays to Mr Duffy’s strengths. He is a friend to all. Although a Republican, he is friendly with Hillary Clinton and Rahm Emanuel, the Democrat mayor of Chicago and former White House chief staff for Barack Obama. He recently made the Chicago news for hosting a party for John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, attended by Michael Madigan, the Democratic speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives – which caused some local Democrats to criticise the speaker.Mr Duffy – who has flirted in the past with running for public office – laments such partisanship. “I have friends on both sides of the aisle. I’m not an extremist, and I think I’m the normal person,” he says.Yet he feels a duty to participate in politics rather than complain from afar. “If you’re not prepared to be involved in the process, shut up.”In terms of his own management style, Mr Duffy is clear. “I like things done. I’m a hands-on person. I’m not a delegator,” he says. “I’m a guy that’s involved in things.”Mr Duffy has had much to be involved in. Since he became chairman, the CME became the US’s first financial exchange to go public, then embarked on two mega-acquisitions – first, of its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, then of the New York Mercantile Exchange.So what does he do to relax? “I haven’t completely relaxed in years,” he says.But isn’t he exhausted? “Yes, I am exhausted,” he admits, and for one unsmiling moment, he appears as just another person rather than a powerful leader of a financial behemoth. Then the corporate banter returns: “But I have commitments to the company, to myself, to my family, to the people who work here.”After the tape is switched off, Mr Duffy has a second very human moment. “You’re not going to make me look stupid, right?” he says, wagging his finger. It’s half-joke, half-threat, and 100 per cent Chicago.
586;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-12T19:12:56Z;Quick View: Futures industry’s Groundhog Day;Oddly repetitive discourse within the industry;Many participants at the Futures Industry Association’s annual Expo in Chicago this week had a strong sense of déjà vu. Not only were the issues essentially identical to those of last year and the year before, but little progress seemed to have been made.“I feel like I’m in Groundhog Day,” Garry Jones, head of NYSE Liffe, told the Financial Times, referring to the film in which the protagonist lives the same day over and over.To be sure, Dodd-Frank – the post-crisis legislation aimed at overhauling regulation of the US financial industry – was passed by Congress last year. While that codified the broad contours of reform – that over-the-counter swaps should be cleared and traded more openly – the industry is still awaiting the details.That has led to an oddly repetitive discourse within the industry. The views of key figures on the main issues are well known and, while the sector remains in a state of limbo, positions are only becoming more entrenched.The result is that Expo had something of a “going through the motions” feel to it. “I was pretty bored with my own panel,” one speaker confided.Perhaps the most interesting thing to happen was that the event was targeted by the Chicago equivalent of the “Occupy Wall Street” protests.On Monday night, thousands of protesters from the Stand Up Chicago coalition converged on the Art Institute, where CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, was hosting the opening reception. The coalition has added to its demands a call for a financial transactions tax, targeting CME and the Chicago Board Options Exchange.There was some consternation in the Stand Up Chicago crowd when a group of futures partygoers was spotted laughing at the demonstrators, but the heavy police presence ensured there was no funny business.A few days earlier, tensions and eyebrows had been raised when some wags in an office at the Chicago Board of Trade building put signs at the windows spelling out “We are the 1%”, a reference to the protesters’ insistence that they represent 99 per cent of Americans.The atmosphere at the Expo was very understanding, however, of the protesters’ anger – perhaps because the financial types themselves are frustrated at the slow pace of reform.In an uncharacteristic moment of exasperation, Craig Donohue, CME’s chief executive, complained on one panel that some of the debates were the equivalent of arguing about how to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic.If the futures crowd is starting to fall out of love with the sound of its own voice, next year’s Expo promises more fodder for discussion. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission expects to introduce a mandate for clearing over-the-counter derivatives by April. In anticipation, traders are increasingly clearing OTC trades and clearing houses are battle-testing their systems.A host of other rules and legal definitions are also due to be completed within the next year. That will prompt discussions on exemptions and loopholes.Once the US starts to sort out its own financial rules, it will also at some point have to face the thorny question of extraterritoriality – trying to govern a global market in which counterparties will often fall under other jurisdictions.One thing is clear: this is going to be a very long conversation and it is only at the very beginning.

With all these attempts at [industry] consolidation we’ve had no shortage of investment bankers knocking on our door with ideas that they think are great.”His comments, made at the World Federation of Exchanges’ annual meeting, confirm that while HKEx has looked at the LME, it is not seen as among the most likely of bidders, which people familiar with the matter say are CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and SGX, the Singapore exchange.While HKEx has recently started overhauling its business, including building a data centre to attract automated traders and has announced plans for clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, it has signalled little appetite for foreign deals or large acquisitions. It is more concentrated on building its China-related business.Mr Arculli said: “We’ve always said that partnerships or alliances are things that we can look at without having to go through a full merger,” Mr Arculli said in an interview with FT Trading Room.He was speaking ahead of an announcement by HKEx and five other exchanges - BM&FBovespa, the National Stock Exchange of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange - that they had forged an alliance to cross-list each other’s stock index futures.Mr Arculli said that for HKEx to “divert itself” from its focus on China would be “downright silly”.He also cast doubt on the rationale for big exchange mergers, referring to the difficulties experienced in big mergers in other industries. “You had the merger of Daimler and Chrysler, where the common theme was steering wheels and so on. But if they can’t culturally get together, how the bloody hell do you get exchanges with different cultures and languages to combine effectively?”

Mr Spahr lowered 2012 and 2013 earnings estimates for Franklin Resources by 12 per cent “to reflect much lower average AUM than expected”.Franklin Resources fell 2.9 per cent to $96.85. Legg Mason fell 1.3 per cent to $26.80. BlackRock fell 1.4 per cent to $153.06 and Federated Investors fell 2.4 per cent to $17.72. But some analysts said Franklin Resources’ woes might not be mirrored at other firms.“Asset declines at Franklin were mainly down to the performance of the Templeton Global Bond Fund, mainly invested in international bonds, which have been hit by emerging market currency weakness,” said Jeff Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “There’s really not much read-across to domestic fixed income funds,” he added.The broad S&P 500 eked out a 0.1 per cent rise to close at 1,195.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 11,416.3 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.7 per cent to 2,583.03.But after hours, Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, marked the start of the quarterly earnings season by missing forecasts for the first time in four quarters. Alcoa reported earnings per share of 14 cents excluding restructuring costs, compared with analyst expectations of 22 cents. The stock was down in after-hours trading.Insurers were among the biggest beneficiaries of another Europe-fuelled rally. Genworth Financial, which sells a consumer debt insurance product in Europe, was up 3.1 per cent to $5.62. Fears that Europe’s financial crisis could herald a spike in unemployment, and lead to pay-outs on the policy, have weighed on Genworth’s stock price.Lincoln National rose 1.9 per cent to $16.34, and MetLife was up 0.6 per cent to $30.58, as the insurance sector rallied on hopes that European equity assets may recover in value.Derivative exchanges sold off, with CME Group down 3.4 per cent to $257 and IntercontinentalExchange off 2.3 per cent to $123.10, though analysts struggled to explain the moves.The New York Stock Exchange was up 2.3 per cent to $26.46, tracking its potential merger partner, German exchange Deutsche Börse, which rose 1.4 per cent while German markets were open.Fashion group Nordstrom was down 2.8 per cent to $49.26, after a filing showed executives had sold shares last week.Video streaming service Netflix continued its downward momentum, falling 2.7 per cent to $108.66. On Monday the company reversed a previous decision to hive off its DVD delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster, but did not row back on a 60 per cent price rise for the joint DVD and streaming service.Fertiliser maker Mosaic Company rose 4.3 per cent to $55.77 after Credit Suisse increased its estimates for fertiliser prices, citing strong demand for grain.Reits fell, with Equity Residential down 3.1 per cent to $52.91 and AvalonBay Communities falling 2.2 per cent to $118.50.Store chain 99 Cents Only Stores rose 4.4 per cent to $21.39 after agreeing to a $1.6bn cash takeover by alternative asset manager Ares Management and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The deal values the group at $22 a share.Citigroup was up 5.1 per cent to $27.84, outperforming peers. Bank of America was up 1.4 per cent to $6.37 and Morgan Stanley was up 0.7 per cent to $15.39.Solar panel maker First Solar fell 6.5 per cent to $55.91 after a sharp fall in the spot price of polysilicon.Sprint rose 7.2 per cent to $2.38 after FBR Capital’s David Dixon made the stock his “top pick”, saying the group could meet its capital needs by issuing debt.
589;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Brent crude added to Dow Jones-UBS index;Shift will have big implications for commodity investors;Brent crude oil futures are poised to attract billions of dollars more from investors after a leading index added the benchmark to its basket of commodities.More than 5.3 per cent of the Dow Jones-UBS commodity index will as of January track Brent, increasing the number of contracts followed by the basket by one to 20.As of June, $80.2bn in investor money tracked the index, making it the second most widely followed after the S&P GSCI.The shift will have big implications for commodity markets. Brent, linked to crude from the North Sea, is the flagship futures contract on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.Buying associated with the reallocation may increase open interest, which now stands at 900m barrels equivalent.Brent’s debut in the index, known as the Dow Jones-AIG upon its launch in 1998, will also reduce the weighting for West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, which now sells at a discount due to logistical issues around its Oklahoma delivery point.WTI’s target weight will fall from 14.7 per cent this year to 9.7 per cent in 2012.The index supervisory committee, which approved the change, cited Brent’s economic significance as a global benchmark, the liquidity of the futures contract and production levels of the crude stream.The committee wants “commodities that reflect a broadly diversified basket,” said Jamie Farmer, director of global business development and communications at Dow Jones Indexes, which markets the index.UBS, the investment bank, acquired the index from AIG in 2009. Dow Jones Indexes is 90 per cent owned by futures exchange operator CME Group, whose leading energy contract is WTI traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.News Corp has a 10 per cent stake in Dow Jones Indexes.“By giving it 65 per cent of the crude oil component, Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index has reffirmed that Nymex WTI is the benchmark of choice,” CME said.ICE parent IntercontinentalExchange said the addition “confirms Brent’s status as a leading global benchmark for crude oil pricing and its increasing adoption by commercial and financial market participants”.Brent settled Tuesday at $110.73 a barrel, almost $25 more than WTI.
590;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-11T21:50:09Z;CFTC rule could force traders to OTC markets;Futures industry figures attack ‘85-15 rule’;Derivatives contracts that currently go though central clearing houses could be pushed into less-regulated over-the-counter (OTC) markets because of proposed rules for overhauling US financial regulation, futures industry leaders have warned.The so-called “85-15” rule proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would require all listed derivatives to have at least 85 per cent of their markets traded via a central limit order book and no more than 15 per cent by block trades. Markets that do not meet the rule would have to be delisted.The proposal – one of the rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act – is aimed at encouraging markets to become more exchange-traded, but critics argue it will have the perverse effect of forcing trading away from listed markets into OTC venues, where trading will be more expensive because margin costs will be higher.Scott O’Malia, a CFTC commissioner who opposes the rule, told the FT the 85 per cent figure was arbitrary, and showed how the agency was proposing to intervene unnecessarily into markets that were functioning in an orderly way and removing risk from the system.Mr O’Malia said there were 628 contracts listed to be cleared on Clearport, the clearing house owned by CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, which did not meet the 85-15 requirement. Such contracts are traded OTC but are turned into futures contracts in the clearing process.“These are the endangered species of the futures world,” he said on the sidelines of the Futures Industry Association Expo in Chicago.“Clearing OTC contracts was a great solution post-Enron, and now we’re saying: ‘you can be a swap’,” Mr O’Malia said. “The result is not only that trading will be more expensive, but that they might not clear them at all.”Anthony Belchambers, head of the Futures and Options Association, the European industry body, suggested on a FIA panel that the proposal could stifle innovation, since the OTC markets were “often the birthplace” of listed futures products.Edward Rosen, partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton, said the rule could inadvertently turn futures traders into swap dealers, but argued that it could also put pressure on financial exchanges to develop new futures products that replicate swap contracts.Mr O’Malia said the rule is still in the deliberation phase, with no conclusion expected soon.
591;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-11T15:30:15Z;US may start OTC derivatives clearing by April;;Derivatives traders could be forced to start clearing over-the-counter (OTC) swaps by April – months earlier than many industry participants expected – the US’s top futures regulator said.Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told the Futures Industry Association’s annual conference in Chicago that if central clearing houses filed submissions by the end of the year “a clearing mandate may take effect towards the beginning of the second quarter of next year”.The plan raises the prospect of complicating the regulatory picture further, since financial rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act could start to take effect before the regulatory regime is completed.Mr Gensler dismissed concerns about implementing laws before all the rules were written, although he conceded there would “inevitably be some bumps along the way”.He added that “market participants would have an additional three, six or nine months to come into compliance with the clearing mandate, depending on the swap’s counterparties”.Nevertheless, the timing surprised some in the industry. “This is an accelerated timetable. There was a sense in the market that it would be three months later than that,” Kimberly Taylor, head of clearing at CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, told the FT.Ms Taylor said CME had already submitted to the CFTC a draft list of swaps it wanted to clear.Clearing OTC derivatives – widely blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis – is seen as a central part of regulators’ efforts to reduce risk from the financial system.“While the crisis had many causes, it is evident that swaps played a central role,” Mr Gensler said. “Swaps added leverage to the financial system with more risk being backed by less capital.“They contributed, particularly through credit default swaps, to the bubble in the housing market. They contributed to a system where large financial institutions were thought to be not only too big to fail, but too interconnected to fail. Swaps – developed to help manage and lower risk for end-users – also concentrated and heightened risk in the financial system and to the public.”He said the European crisis was a reminder that action needed to be taken on central clearing.Ms Taylor noted that traders had already started to move their OTC trading into clearing houses such as CME’s, and said Mr Gensler’s announcement could reflect that the market was already moving.The CFTC chief also said that rule-writing deadlines could be further delayed at a meeting next week. “We may consider staff recommendations providing further exemptive relief . . . from certain provisions of Dodd-Frank’s Title VII requirements,” he said.
592;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-11T09:15:09Z;Quick View: UK wakes up to Europe threat;Cameron comments indicate change in British attitudes;"“The French wouldn’t have us trying to move their aerospace industry to Poland, so I’m not having them trying to move our financial services industry to Frankfurt - forget it.”With these punchy words- in an interview with the FT - British prime minister David Cameron has signalled that, finally, the UK has woken up to what is going on in the eurozone when it comes to the City of London and efforts coming out of the eurozone to undermine its role as Europe’s financial centre.Whether it is the battle over the scope of Emir, the question of listed derivatives competition and the “vertical silo” in the Deutsche Börse/NYSE Euronext merger, the UK has been sleepwalking through the past year or so, apparently oblivious to, or powerless to act on, the coming threats that these issues pose.Paris has made no secret of its intention to use the aftermath of the 2008 crisis to build itself up as a hub for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearing, dating back to 2009 when the Banque de France produced a report calling for French banks to rally round and create a credit default swap clearing capability so as to ensure that London did not get all the business.The Deutsche Börse/NYSE Euronext deal will clearly bolster Frankfurt, with the prospect that the important function of clearing its futures and options contracts moving to Eurex Clearing there.Perhaps the City never really believed that these posed threats. The City accounts for the vast bulk of trading activity and employment in Europe. How would that really change?But one wonders if London has underestimated the depth of resentment , post-2008, at the role of “Anglo-Saxon” financial wizardry in helping to create the problems that led to the crisis (conveniently forgetting, it has to be said, the enthusiasm of German banks for a lot of the structured products that were subsequently vilified).Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, has said that the big data centre that his company built in Basildon is unlikely to be closed (as some fear) in favour of building up such infrastructure in Paris. He said at a recent briefing at the FT that the merger was probably “neutral” for London.Reto Francioni, his counterpart at the Börse, has been clear that the combined DB/NYSE would not de-emphasise London since - for example - most of Eurex’s derivatives customers are based there.None of this is a ringing endorsement of London; the City is not really a net beneficiary, it seems, even as it isn’t a great loser.Xavier Rolet, London Stock Exchange chief executive, has said that there is a threat to London, and it’s been under-appreciated.At the same time it’s not been sufficiently appreciated that London has paid a price for championing an open, mercantilist approach to financial services that has helped it become such a globally powerful financial centre.It has welcomed banks from all over the world and it is home to the largest OTC derivatives market - bigger than New York’s.Yet some of its key market infrastructures have fallen into the hands of large overseas manager-owners. The International Petroleum Exchange was acquired by a big US exchange, IntercontinentalExchange, and Liffe, the futures exchange, went to Paris-based Euronext - now part of NYSE Euronext, a US-based operator.It would be wrong to argue that British market structures should all stay under British control or ownership (whatever that actually means). We live in a world of globalised shareholding and governance that is transnational.Yet at a time when the whole landscape of financial services is undergoing a radical overhaul, and as political and economic self-interest among EU member states strains a long-held status quo, there is much to play for when it comes to London - and thinking more coherently about the City’s market structures is key to that.It’s not about crude flag-waving, but something more subtle. London’s ability to continue to be Europe’s financial capital will depend on its ability to understand that you have no market without market structures. And you need to think about how they are knitted together in a coherent ecosystem.As critical as industry observers were - including me - of Maple’s attempt to create a more coherent market ecosystem in Canada through its bid for TMX, the group was recognising this reality.Effectively, London now needs to re-aggregate its market structures. This is presumably why the LSE is attempting to take control of LCH.Clearnet, London’s main clearing house. I would be surprised if Mr Rolet was not also looking at the London Metal Exchange for the same reason - ICE and the rival US operator CME Group are top of the list as likely buyers - although it is hard to see how the LSE could afford both deals.Still, it does seem that with Downing Street apparently now weighing in, there is a chance that others in London may wake up."
593;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Quick View: The Deutsche Börse-NYSE conundrum;Will Europe break down barriers in listed derivatives?;In New York, Frankfurt and Brussels, a document running to about 130 pages is sitting on the desks of – respectively – NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Börse and the European Commission.It is the EU competition authorities’ “statement of objections” on the proposed combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext.It is no exaggeration to say it is the most significant document in the world of exchanges to have come out since the US Department of Justice staff wrote a letter to the US Treasury in 2008 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade.Everyone wants to get their hands on it. It will decide whether Europe really is going to break down barriers to competition in listed derivatives – a taboo subject in the US. There, the product of the CME-CBOT combo, CME Group, dominates futures trading with a 98 per cent market share.The German-US deal would, similarly, combine the Börse’s Eurex futures exchange with NYSE Liffe, the US group’s futures platform. That would give Eurex-Liffe a similar market share in benchmark euro-denominated futures contracts to the Chicago group’s in dollar-denominated contracts.Will Brussels decide that this is too much and that – finally – it is time to inject competition in listed derivatives?The London Stock Exchange has seized on the issue – and the debate over “open access” to clearing in the “Emir” legislation being debated in Brussels – to insist that it is time. Hardly surprising, it in June launched its first foray into futures, offering FTSE 100 futures that the LSE hopes is the start to a broader assault on NYSE Liffe and Eurex.Feelings are running so high at the LSE that one of its executives last week took to bashing Deutsche Börse through the kind of cheap national stereotyping at which the British can often seem to excel.The executive warned an audience at an industry dinner – attended by Eurex representatives – that it was time to address the issue of competition in listed derivatives, and through the DB/NYSE merger review, “before Deutsche Börse get to put their beach towels on the NYSE deckchairs”.Back in Brussels, the considerations will be more grounded in reality.In competition law, you have to define geographic and product scope.DB-NYSE have argued all along that the listed derivatives market is global, and that they would face competition not only from the CME but others.Opponents of the merger – the LSE and Nasdaq OMX – point out that Eurex and Liffe compete on single stock options and argue that this competition would be lost if the two were combined.Yet the US Justice Department took the view that the listed derivatives business was global when it waved through CME-CBOT.Whether there is a “distinct” European derivatives market or not, it is certainly wrong to suggest that Eurex and CME don’t compete. Each may offer futures in different currencies, but they are economically equivalent and each exchange would love traders to trade more of their products than the opposition’s – period.In 2009, there was palpable glee at NYSE Liffe’s London office when figures from the Futures Industry Association showed that for the first time trading volume in euribor futures had overtaken the equivalent dollar-based contract – eurodollar futures – in Chicago.Furthermore NYSE Liffe is competing head-on with the CME in eurodollar futures in the US. Still not convinced? The CME launched a euribor futures contract to the NYSE Liffe product – its flagship contract – out of Chicago.That is hardly a description of a market defined by region. And, by the way, one of the biggest traders of the CME’s flagship eurodollar contract is an outfit in Prague.We don’t know what Brussels really thinks about this, except that Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said last month he was concerned that the DB-NYSE combo would be a “very large player that would monopolise the derivatives market”.We also need to be mindful that when the Börse and what was then Euronext-Liffe discussed a merger in 2005, Mr Almunia’s predecessor allegedly held a secret meeting with the parties and told them that the Eurex-Liffe combination was a non-starter for that reason. That does suggest that, at the time at least, Brussels saw Europe as one single derivatives market.Then there is the DB-NYSE argument on products – that the merged entity would still face competition from the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market.Correct me if I’m wrong but was it not German lobbying that argued the scope of Emir (which enshrines competition in OTC derivatives and the clearing of them) should not be extended beyond OTC derivatives to listed products on the grounds – inter alia – that the two are very different products?And yet the same people have been trying to convince Mr Almunia’s department that OTC derivatives very much do compete with listed derivatives, implying that they are actually pretty similar. Some inconsistency there, surely.I think the argument that OTC would provide competition to a DB-NYSE combo only works when you talk about a future market structure where – post-Emir and Dodd-Frank implementation – former OTC derivatives contracts are trading on “swap execution facilities” and their European equivalents – and are thus effectively “exchange-traded”.If the statement of objections is written in such a way that remedies are inevitable from DB/NYSE – and assuming we are not talking about an outright divestiture of NYSE Liffe (a deal-breaker, for sure) – then we bump up against the problem of “structural” versus “behavioural” remedies dealt with my colleagues on Lex here.Ultimately, though, the whole debate about DB-NYSE and listed derivatives has still been very Europe-centric.If Brussels goes as far as what the LSE is demanding (“a requirement to provide margin offset and fungibility in post-trade services”, according to its submission to Brussels), then you have the prospect of breaking down the silo and trying to extend competition in listed derivatives this way for the first time.It would then be up to exchanges like the LSE to prove that there are successful, high-volume derivatives contracts based on underlyings still to be invented – a challenging proposition, even if you accept that the FTSE index is certainly a reasonable start.But more importantly this would leave the silo intact in the US, putting Europe at a competitive disadvantage to the US in exchange-traded futures. It has been shocking how little this aspect has been part of the conversation in Europe. It is a reality that needs to be addressed.Ultimately, as I’ve written before, this may end up being a political decision after all. Might José Manuel Barroso, EC president, get a call from German chancellor Angela Merkel one day asking Brussels to just clear the DB/NYSE deal? (Set against that: would Ms Merkel do so, knowing there is probably some angst about job losses in Frankfurt under DB/NYSE? Recall that in the group’s SEC filing some months back, they said most of the savings would be found at both group’s European operations.)But that’s effectively what happened with CME-CBOT, after all. It was ultimately a political decision.As to what the US Justice department staff actually thought about CME-CBOT, it does not make comfortable reading for the DB-NYSE camp if Brussels is thinking along the same lines. I’ll leave you with a key excerpt from that letter to the Treasury:“Based on its extensive experience investigating competitive conditions in various financial markets, including financial futures, options, and equities, the Department believes that certain regulatory policies governing financial futures may have inhibited competition among financial futures exchanges, potentially discouraging innovation and perpetuating high prices for exchange services.More specifically, the Department believes that the control exercised by futures exchanges over clearing services – including (a) where positions in a futures contract are held (”open interest”), and. (b) whether positions may be treated as fungible or offset with positions held in contracts traded on other exchanges (”margin offsets”) - has made it difficult for exchanges to enter and compete in the trading of financial futures contracts. If greater head-to-head competition for the exchange of futures contracts could develop, we would expect it to result in greater innovation in exchange systems, lower trading fees, reduced tick size, and tighter spreads, leading to increased trading volume.”
594;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-07T16:32:54Z;Short contracts: Weeklys drive options volumes growth;A record year is in prospect but there are some concerns;When Tom Sosnoff first approached the Chicago Board Options Exchange in 2005 with the idea for weekly options, he had in mind what he thought was a terrific marketing gimmick.“I wanted to call them ‘quickies’,” recalls Mr Sosnoff, who came up with the idea while running Thinkorswim, the online options brokerage he co-founded in 1999. “I thought it would be good for business, but they thought it had too many sexual overtones.”While he concedes the CBOE may have been right to reject his naming idea, contracts with a weekly duration are the raciest thing to have happened to the options industry in several years.US regulators gave the CBOE permission to launch weeklys on stock indices in 2005, but the contracts only took off last year, when the pilot programme was extended to weekly options on individual shares and exchange traded funds.At the same time, the stock tickers used to identify options were being overhauled, making it easier to link a weekly option with the more traditional monthly or quarterly expirations on the same underlying name.The result has been an explosion in trading. Weekly options volumes had been growing steadily, reaching about 3 per cent of overall SPX (S&P 500 options) volumes by early 2010, but in the past year they have become the fastest-growing options product, now accounting for about one-10th of all options volumes in the US.In some single stocks, such as Apple, weeklys now make up two-fifths of all options volume.Indeed, the expansion of trading in weeklys has been a significant driver of overall options volumes, helping to put the industry on course for a record year, with 3.1bn options contracts changing hands so far, up 22 per cent on last year.“Without weeklys, we wouldn’t have had any growth at all this year,” says Boris Ilyevsky, managing director of the International Securities Exchange, the US’s third-biggest options-trading venue, owned by Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse. “In fact, we would have had a decline.”Weeklys are also proving a big hit in futures. CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, now lists weekly options on futures on stock indices and interest rates, as well as agricultural products such as maize, soya beans, wheat and cattle.In the world of equity options, weeklys have proved particularly popular with retail customers. In particular, they have found favour with active, more sophisticated investors, whose strategies – such as earning premiums by selling covered calls on shares or ETFs that they intend to hold for the longer term – are an ideal fit with the accelerated “time decay” the contracts offer.“Every week, you now have the ability to trade as if it was expiration week, and there’s a lot of clients that have expiration week strategies,” notes Paul Stephens, the CBOE’s director of institutional and international marketing.Many such traders have been able to profit from the growth of weeklys, by collecting more in premiums from selling calls every week rather than once a month. For traders on the buying end, weekly options offer a lower-cost, more flexible alternative to longer-dated contracts.Because of the increase they have brought in volumes, the growth in weekly options has also been welcomed by options exchanges and brokers.However, in spite of the signs that weekly options have brought new business, they have also cannibalised some volume from longer-dated traditional options markets.Weeklys have also fragmented liquidity further – reinforcing a concern voiced by exchanges when the contracts were introduced. They have also added considerably to electronic bid-and-offer messages that market participants have to support with ever more processing power.Nevertheless, the march of weeklys seems unstoppable. The programme may well be expanded from its current regime, which allows each of the US’s nine options trading platforms to list 15 weekly options of its own, as well as those listed by competitors.That begs the question of whether options contract durations could shrink further. Last year, the CBOE sought regulators’ permission to list daily options, but the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to rule. If the equity options industry introduced dailys, it would be following the futures markets: CME offers daily options on futures on crude oil, natural gas and gold.The idea of dailys disturbs some observers, who argue they would lead to pure “directional betting” not founded on the fundamentals of the underlying asset. “If we go to dailys and hourlys and micro-events, eventually someone will get hurt – not because there’s anything technically wrong, but people would get uncomfortable as it would feel and look more like gambling,” says Mr Ilyevsky.Mr Sosnoff, who now runs Tastytrade, an online financial network, is dismissive: “It’s ridi­culous. If it’s true, then all trading is gambling. Dailys are inevitable.”
595;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-06T12:13:26Z;LCH.Clearnet to accept gold as collateral;;Clearing houses are moving to beef up their financial ballast amid market volatility by allowing more gold to be used as collateral to back transactions processed through them by traders.The move is a sign that volatility in the markets and regulatory pressure for higher collateral in over-the-counter derivatives markets are prompting clearing houses and their customers to reassess the value of relying largely on cash and government bonds as collateral.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, using assets such as cash and government bonds as security, or collateral, posted at the clearing house by its members to help bail out a defaulting member or their customer.Gold, which investors perceive as an increasingly “safe haven” asset, has only recently been considered worthy of use as collateral by clearing houses.LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French clearing house, on Thursday became the latest clearer to allow gold as collateral. It said the service was available to customers that had signed up to clear OTC gold bullion and gold contracts on the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange.“Globally, gold has seen rapid growth in investment and regulators are looking for more OTC derivatives to be cleared,” LCH.Clearnet said.It added that the initiative “is supported” by the World Gold Council, the gold mining industry lobby group which recently suggested the metal could be included in banks’ “Tier 1” capital reserves – the buffer of safe assets meant to protect banks from losses on their investmentsDavid Farrar, director of commodities at LCH.Clearnet, said the move had been under consideration for some time and was largely the result of demand from customers using the London Metal Exchange, whose trades are cleared at LCH.Clearnet.“Banks now want to use gold alongside cash so they can optimise returns and they typically have large holdings of gold. The background is increasing margin liability that has to be put up to us because of volatility in the markets,” he said.LCH.Clearnet’s move follows that on Monday by CME Group, the US-based operator of futures exchanges and clearing houses, to increase the amount of gold accepted at its US-based clearing house.CME, which first accepted gold as collateral in October 2009, raised the amount that can be posted by a member to $500m, from $200m. It said this was “in response to customer demand” and was done “in conjunction with regular review of market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage”.The financial world is scrambling to find “safe” assets as nations deal with sovereign debt issues and seek to devalue their currencies. Some large banks now offer “collateral transformation services” promising to turn less-liquid assets, such as corporate bonds, into cash that can be used by their clients as security at clearing houses.New rules such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US and the upcoming European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) are driving increasing use of clearing for OTC markets, which in turn is putting pressure on market participants to put up more collateral than before.JPMorgan began accepting gold to satisfy collateral requirements in so-called repo transactions, meaning banks could use it as security when lending to each other under JPM’s framework.IntercontinentalExchange, a CME rival, started accepting gold at its London-based clearer, ICE Clear Europe, in November last year. It is used to back trades in energy and credit default swaps. ICE does not yet accept gold at its US clearing houses.ICE Clear Europe last year also introduced a “triparty collateral management arrangement” with Euroclear Bank, the international central securities depository, through which European government bonds may be used as collateral to fulfil initial margin requirements.Both the addition of gold collateral and the availability of collateral via Euroclear Bank were intended to “enhance the stability and flexibility of the clearing house, particularly during periods of intensive economic stress, while providing alternatives to customers,” ICE said at the time.
596;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-04T17:56:18Z;Time for a Dow revamp in face of sharper S&P;The benchmark has grown less and less relevant for serious investors;A deal between McGraw-Hill and CME Group to bring together the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index would be a bit like making an ageing matinee idol and a gifted but less well-known rival share the same dressing room. It would be a great moment to reflect on the fading talents of the former and the significant strengths of the latter.At the moment, the Dow is part of Dow Jones Indexes, 90 per cent of which belongs to CME, owner of the Chicago derivatives exchange, and 10 per cent to Dow Jones, the News Corp subsidiary. The S&P 500 is the US flagship of Standard & Poor’s Indices, part of McGraw-Hill.What does the Dow have going for it? It must be the highest profile stock market benchmark in the world – granted a daily airing by media worldwide.In the turbulent five trading days beginning September 19, for example, the Dow commanded roughly twice as many headlines as the S&P 500 (“Worst Week Since 2008 Batters Dow” and so on). When people write sensationalist books predicting outsized equity market returns, it’s the Dow that takes top billing (Dow 36,000, Dow 100,000). Nobody ever embroidered an S&P 500 closing price on to a baseball cap – as the New York Stock Exchange did with souvenirs to commemorate “Dow 10,000” in March 1999.Second, its composition is stable. The last change was more than two years ago, when Travelers replaced Citigroup, and Cisco replaced General Motors. Dow Jones Indexes boasts it was “the only major index to trace the bear market of the early 21st century from beginning to end with the same set of component stocks”. Those 30 stocks are highly liquid, which makes the average quick to calculate.Finally, it is old. Very old. It was conjured up by Charles Dow in 1896, based on a basket of railroads, steel companies and textile mills and (again, according to its own website), “it serves today the same purpose for which it was created – to provide a clear, straightforward view of the stock market and, by extension, the US economy”.Except it doesn’t. Over the past 15 years, as indices have grown more sophisticated and the technology to monitor markets more advanced, the Dow has grown less and less relevant for serious investors. The final selection of components remains a subjective process carried out by a committee that includes the managing editor of the Wall Street Journal. (Full disclosure – I still help FT colleagues select components for the 76-year-old FT 30 index, though we make few claims for its relevance as an investable benchmark. FTSE, a joint venture between the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, is a competitor of Dow Jones Indexes and S&P Indices.)Anomalies can persist for years. By the time the Dow selection committee got around to ejecting GM – part of the average for eight decades – and Citi, the carmaker had slipped into bankruptcy protection and the crisis-hit bank was part-government-owned.Both had long since ceased to have any real bearing on the level of the Dow because the absolute value of the companies’ share prices had dropped so low. This, in the end, is the most damning flaw in the Dow’s make-up.As its full name makes clear, it is an average not an index. Its components are weighted according to share price, rather than market value. This is a severe handicap compared with not only the S&P 500, but most of the newer indices in Dow Jones Indexes’ own stable.The Dow is too narrow and too prone to perverse movements. When volatile individual components with high share prices but lower market capitalisation sink, they can drag stocks of larger value in their wake. No wonder that more professional money follows other indices. S&P brags that over $4,830bn – including index assets of $1,100bn – is benchmarked against the S&P 500 (first published 1957). Dow Jones Indexes does not comment on how much money tracks the Dow, but it lists just 50 or so investment products based on the average.I like the Dow for its history. I think the very strength of its brand and the fact that its part-owner, News Corp, will continue to have an interest in promoting it, mean it will survive.Over time, the average’s divergence from the S&P 500 looks trivial. In any case, if someone were reckless enough to retire it – shuffling it off the stage with a lifetime achievement award for services to popular investing – a rival outfit would simply recalculate the average, rename it and go on publishing it elsewhere.If the McGraw-Hill/CME deal goes ahead, the old diva is more likely to end up sitting alongside the sharper, more versatile and, frankly, better turned out S&P 500. But the contrast will be stark: it should prompt the new owners to do some hard thinking about how to help the Dow stay relevant over the next 115 years.andrew.hill@ft.com
597;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-03T17:00:45Z;Quick View: Travel sickness over Emir road map;;Ahead of Tuesday’s Ecofin meeting, there are some nervous people in the world of clearing and derivatives.Finance ministers are set to agree a “general road map in regards to a directive on over-the-counter derivatives”, as the Polish presidency of the European Union puts it.The final shape of Emir – the European Market Infrastructure Regulation – could be agreed at the meeting. But it’s by no means certain.There is a huge issue at stake: whether the future shape of Europe’s derivatives and clearing market structures will carry on as they have been for years, with structural barriers to fully fledged competition, or whether that can now change.Specifically, whether the dominance of certain exchanged-owned clearing structures – Deutsche Börse, mostly – will be challenged by writing new rules of the road that break open such market structures by allowing open access to clearing.Obviously this strikes at the heart of the “vertical silo”, such as the one operated by the Börse (and to a lesser extend the smaller one in Spain at Bolsa y Mercados Espanoles).Britain has been at the forefront of arguing that now is the time to break down ossified market structures that, it says, impede competition. HM Treasury has been batting for Britain on this.Privately Deutsche Börse – and the other big silo, CME Group in the US – argue that silos offer traders efficiencies, that rivals are free to compete if they have viable products, and that criticisms of their models are sour grapes on the part of rivals.UK chancellor George Osborne is flying in to Luxembourg on Tuesday – breaking from the Conservative party’s annual conference – to make the UK case.But Britain has been fighting a losing battle. German lobbying in Brussels has been incredibly successful in keeping any changes to the existing clearing market structure off the table.First, it defeated an attempt to widen the scope of Emir beyond OTC derivatives to listed derivatives. Any widening of the scope would have threatened the Börse silo, of course, which enjoys a high earnings multiple precisely because it operates an integrated trading clearing – and settlement – business.And in recent weeks German lobbying, I am told, was behind the removal from the latest draft of Emir of Article 8a. This said that a venue trading OTC derivatives “shall provide trade feeds on a non-discriminatory and transparent basis to any CCP [central counterparty clearer] that has been authorised to clear OTC derivative contracts traded on that venue of execution upon request by the CCP”.Article 8, which mandates that a CCP accepts clearing OTC derivatives contracts on a non-discriminatory and transparent basis regardless of the venue of execution, remains in the text.All this is highly sensitive since the silo and access to clearing it is smack in the sweet spot of the Brussels’ antitrust probe in to the proposed Deutsche Börse/NYSE Euronext merger.The UK position has been bolstered by a letter to the EC, reported in the FT on Monday, from not only banks but, significantly, asset managers.They argue that the provisions of Article 8 need fleshed out with clear safeguards. As Angela Knight chairman of the British Bankers Association – and a signatory to the letter – explained it to me there is “a lack of enforceable safeguards for open and fair access” in clearing.To be clear: the issue is not the vertical silo per se. Even the Investment Management Association says it has no problem with silos. It is the issue of access to them, and a desire to ensure there is sufficient competition in clearing.The EC competition commission is expected soon – possibly this week – to come up with its “statement of objections” on the DB/NYSE. Every expectation is that this will address the access issue – that is whether the merged entity should be required to allow open access to its clearing.Concurrently we also have an attempt to bring about open competition in clearing of listed, or exchange-traded derivatives, in the Markets if Financial Instruments Regulation, a curious hybrid of Emir and Mifid.What’s striking is that this debate is absent from the US. Yet there are risks in Europe going ahead with no equivalent moves in the US.
598;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;London Metal Exchange;Buyer will have to find improbably large synergies to justify £1bn price tag;"Its members have likened the London Metal Exchange to a golf club, but those certainly don’t carry price tags of about £1bn ($1.6bn). Since the LME announced last month that it would consider offers, more than 10 groups have expressed interest. The golf club analogy is accurate in that the LME is run by its members, for its members. But there the comparison ends; there are plenty of places to spoil a good walk, but only one centre of the metals trading world.It is this scarcity that is producing the £1bn price suggested by LME members. That represents a multiple of more than 100 times 2010 earnings, or about 60 times the £17.3m that UBS analysts expect the exchange to earn in 2012. Three of its rumoured suitors – CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and SGX, the Singapore exchange – trade at multiples to estimated 2012 earnings of 13, 16 and 20 times respectively. Whichever wins the LME’s hand is going to have to find improbably large synergies. There are some, such as adding the LME’s business to an existing in-house clearer, should the winner own one. The most obvious way to squeeze value, however, will be through raising trading fees. On that point, bidders will have to tread carefully: LME members are its users and are sensitive to higher costs. There are also worries about the commodities supercycle. The industry seems content to consider the recent sharp sell-offs as a correction rather than the end of a decade-long bull-run, but trading volumes are vulnerable to a weakening of the market mood.Expectations are that the LME will eventually be sold at some price guaranteed to make its members happy. The problem for the winner, however, will be explaining to its shareholders just how much of the price tag was simply down to the value of not letting a rival grab this one-off prize.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
599;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;LME Week focuses on demand uncertainty and deal making;The upbeat tone of last year’s annual gathering is missing;"LME Week, the annual get-together of the mining and metals industry, started in London on Sunday. Until Thursday, the debate among the 3,000 or so executives, traders and bankers will resonate beyond the metals industry, offering insight not only about the health of the broader commodities sector but also about the global economy.If the first two events of the 2011 LME Week are representative of the rest of the week, the conversation will centre around the outlook for demand, the potential for merger and acquisitions after the collapse in valuations, the sale of the LME and warehousing.•Demand: Ask two mining executives about demand and you will get three answers. That is the level of uncertainty in the sector. Nonetheless, almost everyone agrees that consumption growth has slowed, particularly in Europe and, to a lesser extent, in the US. Some customers have asked miners to delay shipments. Others have cancelled cargoes. Top customers in China continue to buy copper and other metals in large quantities; but smaller and medium-sized enterprises and traders are not buying as much.In general, customers are running down inventories, in part to take advantage of falling prices, as they know they will be able to re-stock at lower costs, and in part because they are worried about the economy or have little visibility about next quarter’s volumes. The key question is whether China, which accounts for about 40 per cent of global base metals consumption, will continue buying at its current pace or if it will slowdown.Overall, executives, traders and bankers believe that China and the rest of the world – and the metals and mining industry – is not heading for a repetition of the 2008 crisis, but the upbeat tone of last year’s LME Week is missing.•M&A: Mining share prices are at the level of mid-2009 when the sector was starting to recover from the global financial crisis, after a 20-30 per cent drop over the last year. For many industry executives, the low valuations provide screaming opportunities for mergers and acquisitions. And some are putting their money to work.Rio Tinto, the London-listed miner, and Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp have offered A$1.5bn to buy out minority investors in Australia’s Coal & Allied Industries. And Glencore, the commodities trader, is trying to buy Optimum, South Africa’s fourth largest thermal coal exporter. KGHM, the Polish miner, plans to spend about $3bn in M&A over the next two years, with the company’s executives saying that the current drop in valuations offer a great buying opportunity.At one of the first dinners of LME Week, an executive complained that bankers were pitching M&A ideas non-stop. Yet, there are deep worries. The memory of 2008-09 is recent and the so-called “90 per cent Club” – those companies which lost that much equity value from the peak of 2008 to the trough of 2009 – was full of miners.•LME sale: The idea of a sale has divided the London Metal Exchange’s 94 members, with some reluctant to give up control of the exchange amid worries about a hefty increase in fees, while others are keen to profit from their shareholdings.Nonetheless, there is a growing consensus that, sooner or later, the LME will change hands.Likely bidders include CME Group, the US exchange; SGX, the Singapore exchange; and IntercontinentalExchange, according to people familiar with the situation. Bidders should expect a hefty price tag. A week ago, when the LME revealed that it had received several approaches, members talked about a valuation of about $1.6bn. Now, some members are talking – or maybe they are joking – about valuations as high as $2bn. The higher the valuation the more money Goldman Sachs, the biggest LME shareholder, would make. The Wall Street bank is also the talk of the industry, having bought a significant chunk of LME shares over the last two years – more recently a month ago.•Warehousing: The LME’s long-awaited decision to to change its warehousing rules has not satisfied its critics, which are numerous and vociferous during this LME Week. The exchange told warehouses they should double the rate they deliver metal, but consumers say that is not enough. The consumers, along with several traders, banks and metal producers, argue that long queues to take delivery of aluminium, used in the manufacture of everything from drinks cans to cars and aircraft, have driven up the cost of metal in the physical market.The debate is focused on Detroit, where some 200,000 tonnes of aluminium are waiting to be delivered from warehouses owned by Goldman Sachs.Martin Abbott, the LME’s chief executive, is likely to raise the question in a traditional speech at the LME’s annual dinner on Tuesday. He could get a frosty reception from some of the world’s biggest consumers of metals."
600;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-02T21:58:11Z;Europe warned on reform of derivatives;;The biggest users of derivatives, including banks and asset managers, have warned the European Commission that imminent reform of derivatives markets risks “embedding lack of choice” and call for the business of clearing to be opened up to competition.The call, in a letter to Michel Barnier, EU commissioner for the internal market, marks a ratcheting up of efforts to challenge the status quo in the clearing of derivatives, in particular exchange ownership of clearing houses in an integrated “vertical silo”.“We consider that choice and efficiency in clearing services in the EU may diminish dramatically if the current trend towards concentration in the provision of clearing (and trading) services continues,” said the letter, signed by the British Bankers Association, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, all of which represent banks.It was also signed by the Investment Management Association, which represents UK pension fund and asset managers, the European Fund and Asset Management Association, the Association of Corporate Treasurers and its European sister association.Exchanges that operate silos – which include Deutsche Börse, CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange in the US - have come under fire from rivals that do not – such as the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq OMX – claiming such structures impede the ability of others to compete.Deutsche Börse and CME argue that ownership of clearing allows savings for traders and that rivals are free to compete if they can come up with viable products.Clearing has been a source of friction over the years between exchanges that own their own clearers and the banks that are big customers of them.But it is coming to a head as a wave of EU financial regulations are set to create new market structures for over-the-counter derivatives, with clearing of them a key requirement of wider G20 reforms.Clearing is a key feature of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) which requires that many OTC derivatives be cleared to help safeguard the system against the effect of a big default.It is also central to a probe by Brussels antitrust authorities into the proposed combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse. That would not only combine the group’s respective futures platforms, Liffe and Eurex, but would also strengthen the Börse’s clearing house, Eurex Clearing, as it would act as clearer for the combined platforms.The LSE, Nasdaq and many banks argue that access to clearing houses should be made easier and that silos should accept for clearing contracts from any trading venue. They also say this should apply to existing exchange-traded derivatives, not merely to OTC derivatives that are set to be cleared as part of the Emir reforms and its equivalent in the US, the Dodd-Frank act.“Specifically we believe that Emir contains insufficient safeguards in this respect. A fundamental shortcoming in the text is that such safeguards as exist are not applied across all financial instruments but only to a limited set of OTC derivatives,” the associations said.“Such open access requirements should ensure that a clearing house must accept instruments for clearing regardless of the venue on which they are traded, and that a venue must provide data feeds and other assistance to any clearing house that wants to clear the instrument in question.“We are concerned that the forthcoming European Markets and Infrastructure Regulation does not take proper account of the likely concentration of clearing provision. It may thus inadvertently, through legislation, embed lack of choice in European financial markets.”
601;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-10-02T20:37:30Z;Goldman set to be LME sale winner;;Goldman Sachs has more than quadrupled its stake in the London Metal Exchange in the past two years, making the US investment bank the biggest potential winner from the proposed sale of the 130-year-old exchange.The LME, the centre for global metals trading, said last week it had been approached by more than 10 suitors over a sale that shareholders hope will value it at more than £1bn ($1.6bn). That would give the shares a value of about £77.50 each, 15 times the last traded price, putting Goldman and other shareholders in line for a large windfall.Ownership of the 130-year-old exchange, which houses the last open outcry trading pit in Europe, is restricted to its 94 members and shares rarely come on the market. The most recent trade in LME shares was the sale of the shareholding of Lehman Brothers’ European arm, which Goldman bought in July, according to people familiar with the situation. Since August 2009 it has raised its stake from 300,000 shares to 1.23m.The buying spree has made the bank the LME’s largest shareholder with a stake of 9.5 per cent, potentially worth as much as £95m ($150m).The prospective sale of the LME will be a central topic at the main annual gathering of the metals industry, LME week, which begins on Monday in London.The idea of a sale has divided the LME’s members, with some reluctant to give up control of the exchange while others are keen to profit from their shareholdings. Likely bidders include CME Group, the US exchange, SGX, the Singapore exchange, and IntercontinentalExchange, a CME rival, according to people familiar with the situation.Goldman, which has the leading commodities business by revenues among investment banks, is an active participant in the metals market. having the leading commodities business among investment banks by revenues The head of its metals trading business, Stephen Branton-Speak, is a member of the LME’s board.A person close to Goldman said its LME shareholding was managed separately from its trading operations. Goldman declined to comment on whether it was advising any party in the potential sale, although bankers believe it would be unlikely to do so given its large stake in the exchange. The LME is being advised by Moelis.In addition to the Lehman Brothers stake, Goldman has bought shares from Investec Bank UK and Phibro Futures & Metals, according to the LME’s filings with Companies House.The US bank is not the only LME member whose shrewd acquisitions have put it in line for a potentially large windfall.The second-largest shareholder with a 9.4 per cent stake is the family of Raj Bagri, the former chairman of the LME, through its ownership of metals brokerage Metdist. The company most recently bought shares in September 2009, but the majority of its 9.4 per cent stake was acquired soon after the demutualisation of the exchange in 2000. Other top shareholders include JPMorgan, MF Global and UBS.
602;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-30T20:16:20Z;Rolet goes through a change of fortune;;This week marked a turnround in the fortunes of Xavier Rolet, the French chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, and a new chapter in London's position as a global financial centre.Three months after the failure of his attempt to merge the LSE with TMX Group, operator of Canada’s exchanges, Mr Rolet had good news from the board of LCH.Clearnet, London’s biggest clearing house.It approved the LSE making a €20-a-share offer for 51 per cent of LCH.Clearnet to the clearer’s 98 shareholders – mostly banks that are users of the institution. Mr Rolet beat a rival bid from Markit, a derivatives post-trade company run by Canadian Lance Uggla.Now Mr Rolet, 51, finds himself with much more to handle than just trying to clinch the deal. He and the LSE have become embroiled in a bigger chess game involving the consolidation of all three of London’s main market infrastructures: the LSE, LCH.Clearnet and the London Metal Exchange.This week the LME, the largest metals market in the world, said it had received more than 10 expressions of interest from many of the biggest exchanges, thought to include CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange, two US futures exchanges, and SGX, the Singapore bourse.Icap, the interdealer broker run by leading City figure Michael Spencer, has said it is interested. Others expected to run the slide rule over the 164-year-old exchange – where traders still shout orders from red leather benches in a “ring” – are TMX Group and ASX, the Australian exchange.The LME has been “top of everyone’s M&A list for about five years”, says one industry insider.The whirlwind of developments around the Square Mile is a sign that the epicentre of exchange mergers, which had sputtered recently amid nationalist and antitrust hurdles, has been restarted around London.That hands Mr Rolet a starring role in the process, along with his counterpart at the LME, Martin Abbott – a former publisher of Metal Bulletin magazine – and Ian Axe, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet.At stake is a redefinition of London’s market structures at a time when trading flows are shifting to Asia and a raft of new EU regulations is emerging. The new rules will require London to build up its exchange and clearing business. A merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext looms, too. That would create the world’s largest exchange group with four times the revenues of the LSE. In recent years London has lost the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) to US ownership – it was bought by ICE – and Liffe, the futures exchange, to NYSE Euronext, robbing the LSE of the chance to own a London-based futures exchange.Lynton Jones, chairman of Bourse Consult and the last chief executive of the IPE, says the City’s loss of control over the two UK exchanges was “a failure to see that these market structures are global”. He adds: “I think Xavier sees that, but the problem is it’s a little bit late so he has a fight on his hands.”The urgency to think global may explain why the LSE has enlisted the help of SGX, the Singapore exchange, as a minority partner in its bid for LCH.Clearnet, says one person familiar with the matter. There are also reports that Mr Rolet has discussed teaming up with SGX counterpart Magnus Böcker on a bid for the LME. The LSE declined to comment. Mr Rolet, recently recovered from pneumonia, will need all the energy he can muster to play the chess to his advantage.
603;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-29T23:35:26Z;Talks on Dow and S&P index link-up;McGraw-Hill and CME in discussions;Talks are taking place that could see the Dow Jones Industrial Average come under the same umbrella as the S&P 500 index, uniting two of the world’s most-watched market measures in a joint venture, according to three people familiar with the discussions.Spokespeople for McGraw-Hill, owner of Standard & Poor’s, and CME, the Chicago derivatives exchange owner which bought 90 per cent of Dow Jones Indexes in 2010, declined to comment. Dow Jones, the News Corp subsidiary that owns 10 per cent of Dow Jones Indexes, and Dow Jones Indexes itself also declined to comment.People familiar with the discussions, first reported by News Corp’s Wall Street Journal, cautioned that they had been going on for about a year and could change or fall apart.However, they added that the plan under discussion would see McGraw-Hill own almost 75 per cent of the joint venture, which would be housed in McGraw-Hill Markets, the financial services company that is to be formed when the media conglomerate spins off its education business next year. CME would have almost 25 per cent of the joint venture, with Dow Jones retaining a small stake.The combination of two such prominent indices could attract the attention of regulators, although one person briefed on the negotiations said that the parties did not expect this to be a hurdle, as the S&P 500 is seen as a more institutional product than the Dow, which is more closely followed by retail investors.In February 2010, News Corp sold 90 per cent of Dow Jones Indexes to CME for $613m, helping to recoup part of the cost of buying the publisher of the Wall Street Journal in 2007. The managing editor of the Wall Street Journal still chooses the Dow’s components.Beyond its flagship US index, created in 1896 by Charles Dow, Dow Jones Indexes publishes about 130,000 other indices.As well as the S&P 500, S&P Indices cover more than 10,000 securities in more than 80 countries, and puts out the Case-Shiller Home Price Index, the main indicator for US housing markets.The index industry, which has been known for producing steady, annuity-like revenues, has seen growth in recent years from the rise of emerging markets and growing investor interest in commodities and other asset classes as alternatives to equities and bonds. Some investors have also chosen to track indices passively rather than pay bigger fees to active portfolio managers.At the time of the 2010 Dow Jones auction, investment bankers had expected interest from rivals such as MSCI or Morningstar or potential new entrants such as Thomson Reuters or Bloomberg. It was not clear on Thursday whether another company could look to break up the talks between CME and McGraw-Hill.CME said the Dow Jones Indexes acquisition would help it diversify its revenues, although they accounted for just 2 per cent of group sales last year.
604;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-29T01:59:22Z;LME has already seen a ‘raft of interest’;Martin Abbott says metal exchange approached by more than 10 suitors;"The London Metal Exchange has been approached by more than 10 suitors and expects to open its books for inspection in early December, Martin Abbott, chief executive of the exchange, told the Financial Times.The LME, which hosts the futures contracts used as global industry benchmarks for base metals from copper to nickel, is seen as the last great prize in a wave of consolidation as exchanges seek to capitalise on booming interest in commodities.In his first public comments since announcing the possible takeover last week, Mr Abbott said there had been a “raft of interest” in the exchange. Asked how many expressions of interest the exchange had received, he said: “We’re into double figures.”Likely bidders include CME Group, the US exchange, SGX, the Singapore exchange and IntercontinentalExchange, a CME rival, according to people familiar with the matter. LME shareholders are hoping for a valuation of £1bn or more.The approaches come ahead of the largest annual gathering of the metals industry, LME week, starting this weekend. The LME’s flagship copper contract has hit a series of daily volume records in the past week as the price of the metal has tumbled after soaring to record highs earlier this year. Total LME volumes have risen 18 per cent so far this year.The prospect of a takeover promises to deliver a windfall to the exchange’s 71 member-shareholders. The family of Raj Kumar Bagri, a former LME chairman, which owns metals trader Metdist, holds a 9.4 per cent stake that could be worth as much as £100m. Goldman Sachs is the largest shareholder with 9.5 per cent.Mr Abbott, who was publisher of Metal Bulletin, a metals magazine, stands to profit thanks to a scheme that has awarded him options that would convert into LME shares in the event of a takeover.He suggested that money alone would not be enough to win control of the exchange, which was founded in 1877 and is the last “open outcry” exchange in Europe.“I actually think anyone trying to buy this exchange has a bit of a mountain to climb to persuade shareholders that there is good reason to sell the shares,” he said.“Obviously money talks, but my guess is it will take more than just money …It will be a combination, I think, of money and undertakings around the future model of the business. Don’t forget that what we’ve got here at the LME is reasonably tightly held ownership by corporates, not individuals.”The intense interest in the LME reflects its scarcity value as one of the few exchanges with a large franchise in commodity derivatives, which are generating more profits for exchanges than any other.The LME is also at the heart of intense manoeuvring among London’s market infrastructures. On Wednesday LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house for the LME, said it had entered exclusive talks with the London Stock Exchange about a possible acquisition by the UK bourse. The LME is a roughly 8 per cent shareholder in LCH.Clearnet and Mr Abbott sits on its board. He declined to comment on the deal.Mr Abbott said the LME expected to open up its books for potential bidders to perform due diligence in early December.He declined to comment on the identities of potential bidders or a likely valuation.Mr Abbott said a sale was not a foregone conclusion. “There is actually no need to sell the LME,” Mr Abbott said. “We’re really on top of our game; we’ve never been stronger.”"
605;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Dodd Frank: CFTC’s imposition limits;The rationale for legislation mandating position limits is highly questionable;Will this 737 ever take off? America’s financial sector has been waiting for rules covering contentious Section 737 of the Dodd Frank legislation mandating position limits on 28 commodities to land on its desk. The fact that rulings have been delayed once again points to numerous problems.For one, extending limits from listed futures to swaps is far easier said than done. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is not yet able to collect data on the multi-trillion dollar market for over-the-counter swaps or even define them reliably. Then there is the ever-shifting fine print of who gets commercial exemptions as a bona fide hedger. Do Goldman Sachs’s positions for customers get the same treatment as airline United Continental? “Class limits” and aggregation are yet more pitfalls. If rules on offsetting positions are too strict then financial innovation and liquidity could suffer. And if foreign jurisdictions do not follow then traders could look abroad, harming US exchanges such as CME.Perhaps the most important question of all, though, is are the rules even necessary? The CFTC commissioner seen as the pivotal vote said they might be a “cure for a disease that does not exist” and some think his replacement, an Obama administration appointee whose confirmation is pending, may have to break the impasse.The rationale for the rules – the belief that limiting the number of contracts will curb those nefarious speculators who drive prices up (though somehow never down, as if that were not equally profitable) – is highly questionable. But the topic has become politicised. Believers are lambasting CFTC for the delay while vested interests lobby furiously to soften key provisions. No wonder the rules are stuck at the gate. Those expected on board want to avoid unexpected turbulence.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Although revenue only increased moderately, a higher return on capital allowed the company to boost profitability.Semi stocks have suffered all summer, as data showed companies carrying large inventories, and declining sales of end products, such as personal computers.Citigroup analyst Jim Suva wrote in a client note that “competitors will struggle to match [Jabil’s] results.”and investors appeared to agree with the Philadelphia semiconductor index closing down 2.9 per cent.The wider Wall Street rally evaporated, as hopes of a European deal on sovereign debt again hit a snag, with the European Commission reportedly wading into the argument about whether private banks should take a bigger hit on Greek bonds.The S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent to 1,151.06, shedding half of its gains from Monday and Tuesday’s rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6 per cent to 11,010.90, and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 2.2 per cent to 2,491.58.Management consultancy Accenture reported earnings per share of 71 cents for the quarter ended August 31, 2 cents higher than expected, despite falling revenue from its financial and European arms.Shares were up 0.3 per cent to $55.83.But David Koning, analyst at Robert W Baird, warned the recent appreciation in the dollar meant the company could incur foreign exchange losses in 2012.“Further appreciation [of the dollar] could negatively impact revenue and earnings per share,” he added.Materials and energy stocks were hammered on renewed fears for global growth.Amazon shares were up 2.4 per cent to $229.50, after the company unveiled a tablet to compete with Apple’s Ipad.Coal miners Alpha Natural Resources, down 11 per cent to $18.92, and Peabody Energy, off 8 per cent to $35.73, were particularly hard hit.John Bridges, JP Morgan’s coal analyst, said US coal miners faced a dual challenge of a falling metallurgical coal price, and a return to production in Australia, after flooding earlier this year.“When the floods knocked out Aussie production, the Appalachian miners were able to squeeze more of their coal into the higher priced met market. Now they may try and sell this material into the thermal market, and the gap between the two prices is huge,” he said.Cliffs Natural Resources,was off 8.4 per cent to $55.66 after the company announced it would take a $30m hit to earnings, after deciding to idle production at a biomass production facility in Michigan, which has also been put up for sale.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar was down 10.4 per cent to $64.75. Most First Solar revenue comes from Europe, where the weak financial sector is making it difficult for the company to raise finance for new projects.Chesapeake Energy fell 1.4 per cent to $27.27, even after the company reported successful exploratory drilling in its Utica shale field in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The field could yield oil and ethylene, which fetch higher prices than natural gas.All five exchange stocks in the S&P 500 fell after José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, declared his support for a financial transaction tax in Europe, which could hit on-exchange trading.The New York Stock Exchange fell furthest, down 6.3 per cent to $24.01. According to UBS analyst Alex Kramm, the NYSE is the most exposed to Europe of the US exchanges. The planned merger with Germany’s Deutsche Börse, which fell 4.6 per cent on the news, also weighed on NYSE.The CME Group, fell 3 per cent to $254.32, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange also fell 3 per cent to $26.35, although the US derivatives exchanges are not significantly exposed to Europe.Nasdaq OMX, whose Nordic cash and derivatives business represents 6 to 7 per cent of revenue, was down 4.3 per cent to $23.99. Mr Kramm said a 30 per cent hit to revenue from the Nordic business would reduce his guidance for Nasdaq’s 2012 earnings per share from $2.83 to $2.58.Intercontinental Exchange fell 2.1 per cent to $121.42. Its European businesses are based in London, which may escape a transaction tax.Family Dollar was off 1.6 per cent to $53.31, despite reporting earnings per share of 66 cents on sales of $2.1bn for the quarter ended August 31, a record for the company.Good results were already priced into the stock, which is one of a handful in the S&P 500 whose share price has risen since market volatility began on July 25.
607;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-27T15:36:26Z;Rolet aims to land knock-out blow;;It was like waiting for the white smoke in a papal election. But the board of LCH.Clearnet has decided to approve the London Stock Exchange’s offer for the clearer over a lower proposal from Markit, the post-trade and data company.The LSE’s offer of up to €21 a share for a 51 per cent stake values the clearer at about €1bn (£870m), and is significantly higher than Markit’s offer of €12 a share, plus an earn-out, for the whole company. It now goes to LCH.Clearnet’s 98 shareholders for approval – but this is not a done deal.At least two questions arise.First, why is Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, proposing to pay so much?The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation was offering €739m when it went after LCH.Clearnet in 2008, while the “Lily” consortium of banks, including Icap, the inter-dealer broker, offered €11 a share a year later, valuing the clearer at about €830m at the time.Not only is LCH.Clearnet hard to value, being a not-entirely-integrated product of the 2003 merger of the London Clearing House and Clearnet SA, but its financial results have hardly inspired in the past two years. Profit before tax in the 2010 financial year was €32.3m, compared with €163.5m, after net revenue fell 21 per cent to €355.6m.Tariff reductions took their toll in cash equities clearing as the clearer engaged in a price war on clearing fees against smaller rivals like EMCF and Euro CCP. Pressure on fees remains, as “interoperability” – the ability to choose equities clearer – came into play this summer.LCH.Clearnet also has been losing customers – notably ICE and Liffe, the futures exchanges – although it has tried to make up the shortfall by winning some new business, notably in Asia. And its RepoClear repo clearing business does make decent money.Second, how would Mr Rolet handle SwapClear, LCH.Clearnet’s interest rates swaps clearing service and the banks heavily involved in it? The largest of those banks are leading shareholders in LCH.Clearnet and members of the OTCDerivNet corporate governance committee that “runs” SwapClear.Moreover, the LSE has no track record in SwapClear’s business of clearing over-the-counter interest rate swaps.In answer to the first question, Mr Rolet needs to deliver a knock-out blow to secure LCH.Clearnet. And judging by the fact that – as I undertstand it – only 3 of the 15 banks on the LCH.Clearnet board voted for Markit, the banks were looking a gift horse in the mouth.Fortunately, Mr Rolet can afford it. The LSE’s net debt (of £370m) to ebitda ratio in March was one times. Daniel Garrod, a Barclays Capital analyst, says LSE management has indicated it could leverage up towards two times earnings, suggesting firepower of £650m-£700m.There are also possible synergies – building on an ongoing restructuring under Ian Axe, LCH.Clearnet chief executive. Progress has been made in integrating the clearer’s IT systems, which are spread between Paris and London, but more could be done. Overheads could be shrunk, for example.On the revenue side, the LSE could bring new products (especially derivatives) to the table. Having its own clearer would help get those products to market fast – just as CME Group and Eurex, the Deutsche Börse futures unit, have shown in the past.Arguably the bigger opportunity is on the treasury management side. Clearing houses make most of their money from lending out the margin collateral that members and customers deposit with them (last year, the value of collateral held on behalf of clearing members at LCH.Clearnet was up 15 per cent up at €510bn). The LSE has done well recently improving the treasury side of its only existing clearing business, Borsa Italiana’s Cassa clearing house.As for the banks, they will naturally be concerned to ensure that clearing fees are not ramped up. But Mr Rolet used to sit on their side of the table when he was at Lehman Brothers, and knows that he cannot do any deal without assuaging such concerns.The solution might be to create a governance structure where the banks have enough skin in the game to act as a check on pricing and other powers. Mr Rolet has already had success with this model at Turquoise, the former 100 per cent bank-owned equities trading platforms that the LSE now controls (the banks retain 49 per cent). Turquoise has done well, proving that the “re-mutualisation” of the relationship between exchanges and banks can work.But there is one complication: the London Metal Exchange, which along with NYSE Euronext has 17 per cent of the shares in LCH.Clearnet.Martin Abbott, the LME’s chief executive who is a board member of LCH.Clearnet, has spiced things up in London. First, he has said that the LME is looking at building its own clearing house, a move that would see it cutting ties with LCH.Clearnet, which clears its metals contracts. Second, he revealed that the LME is itself in play.Were LME to sell itself to another exchange – ICE, say – then that would immediately affect LCH.Clearnet’s valuation. But, if the LSE is really serious about building an integrated exchange and clearing house, even that may not be problematic. It just depends on how determined Mr Rolet is to get hold of a clearer. The answer seems to be: very.
608;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-26T20:58:27Z;Casino stocks hit by fears of Asian slowdown;;Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands slid to their fifth consecutive sessions of losses, and Melco Crown Entertainment its fourth in five, as investors fretted that a potential slowdown in the Chinese economy might effect their casino operations in Macau.“There seems to be an awful lot of concern that a slowdown in the Asian economies will reduce the funding that’s available for the corporate junket business, which is really the engine of these businesses’ growth in Macau,” said David Katz, an analyst at Jefferies.Wynn depended on its Macau operation for about a third of revenue, LVS for more than 40 per cent, and Melco for almost its entire business, Mr Katz said. All three operators are now down more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday, significantly underperforming the broad S&P 500.On Monday Wynn was down 1.4 per cent to $136.78, off more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday. LVS fell 1.6 per cent to $43.69, down 11.2 per cent over the five days. Melco fell 3.3 per cent to $9.85 and is off almost 17 per cent since Tuesday.But most analysts said company data did not suggest a slowdown was imminent. Carlo Santarelli, gaming analyst at Deutsche Banks said, “I’m not seeing anything fundamental out of Macau to make me believe there is anything changing in the VIP. I think the share price moves are more reflective of general macro fears in the equity markets.”Elsewhere, the S&P 500 bounced a healthy 2.3 per cent to 1,162.95, to snap a five day slump, driven by a strong rally in bank stocks.Financials in the S&P 500 rose 4.4 per cent, significantly more than any other sector. Citigroup jumped 7 per cent to $26.72 and JPMorgan was also up 7 per cent to $31.65. Bank of America also outperformed the sector, up 4.6 per cent to $6.60, as crisis meetings involving European and American officials once again raised hopes of a solution to the eurozone crisis, which has battered bank stocks.Gains for big banks pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 2.5 per cent to 11,043.86, but the Nasdaq Composite index, which has a lower weighting of financials, and whose bank stocks tend to be small domestic lenders, lagged behind, up only 1.4 per cent to 2,516.69.Consol Energy was the best performer in the S&P 500, gaining 9 per cent to $37.17, after announcing the $193m sale of royalties on a Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to Antero Corporation.Berkshire Hathaway shares rose 8.1 per cent to $108,449, after Warren Buffett’s company announced it would use some of its $48bn cash hoard to repurchase shares. The buy-back programme allows for unlimited purchases as long as the stock is trading at a premium of less than 10 per cent of book value, and the company’s cash pile remains above $20bn.Netflix was up 2.2 per cent to $132.22, despite reports of a deal with DreamWorks Animation to stream the studio’s content. Netflix’s share price has fallen by more than 50 per cent in recent weeks after it broke off negotiations to renew a content contract with the Stars cable network, and a move to separate its streaming and DVD delivery business lost it up to 1m subscribers.Expedia, the online travel company, jumped 4.7 per cent to $28.44 after Piper Jaffray analysts upgraded the stock to “buy”, arguing international bookings could account for 50 per cent of revenue by 2013.Clorox Company, the cleaning products manufacturer, was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, down 4.3 per cent to $66.44, after investor Carl Icahn withdrew his nominees to the board of directors, citing shareholder resistance to his attempted buy-out of the company. Clorox had been up almost 10 per cent for the year before Monday on expectations of a takeover.With the S&P 500 down 17 per cent from its April 29 peak at the start of the day, most analysts notes on Monday were discussing the probability of a bear market and how to position for it.Adam Parker, Morgan Stanley’s US equity strategist, said the high correlation among sectors in the S&P 500 leaves few obvious defensive plays. Less than a quarter of healthcare stocks and only half of consumer staple stocks have a correlation to the index of less than 0.9. The 80 per cent of utility stocks, which are exhibiting low correlation to the S&P 500, may be the best bet for investors expecting the market to enter bear territory.But, Mr Parker warned “low beta stocks have seen a recent increase in trading volume relative to high beta stocks”, which has driven up prices, so investors would have to pay a price to buy into defensive stocks.Two less intuitive candidates for defensive plays are exchanges and brokers. Exchanges have seen trading volumes spike during recent market volatility, which has increased revenue. Several analysts have recommended buying into the sector, and Nasdaq OMX, CME Group and Intercontinental­Exchange have all outperformed the S&P 500 since July 25.On the day, Nasdaq OMX was 0.3 per cent higher at $24.47, CME Group had gained 0.7 per cent to $259.83 and Intercontinental­Exchange had risen 0.4 per cent to $122.58.But Alex Kramm at UBS, who has “buy” ratings on all three names, said: “We still think there’s value in exchanges as a defensive play within financials.”The New York Stock Exchange is down 29 per cent since July 25, almost twice the fall in the S&P 500, although it has largely moved in tandem with potential merger partner Deutsche Börse, so has suffered from falls in European markets.Despite NYSE’s underperformance, “I’d hesitate to pick it as a favourite given uncertainty around the merger”, said Mr Kramm.Brokers have also benefited from a sharp rise in trading volumes. In a note last week Brad Hintz at Bernstein Research said Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and LPL Investment Holding, all of which have significantly underperformed their indices, had “relative near-term opportunities” from elevated trading volume.But on Monday he revised down earnings per share estimates for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, arguing that the impact of depressed IPO and M&A activity on investment bank earnings would outbalance any sharp rise in revenue from their brokerage businesses. He predicted Goldman Sachs would deliver a 20 cent loss per share in the third quarter.
609;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-26T10:51:42Z;Hallowed gold haven succumbs to sell-off;;When Christoph Eibl, a commodities hedge fund manager, stood up last week at the gold industry’s annual conference in Montreal and predicted that the precious metal would be “annihilated”, his audience was unreceptive.“This reminds me of 1999-2000,” said Mr Eibl of Tiberius Group, referring to the bubble in tech stocks. “It might go higher, but definitely it will be annihilated at some stage.”While the assembled traders, investors and bankers conceded the possibility of a short-term correction in gold after a surge of almost 30 per cent in less than three months, they were confident in their bullish consensus – that the yellow metal would rise to fresh records above $2,000 a troy ounce in the coming year.That confidence has been shaken. Gold, touted as the ultimate haven asset, was supposed to rise in a crisis. Yet in the past four days, its behaviour has mirrored that of the riskiest of assets.Since Wednesday, amid intensifying fears about the eurozone debt crisis, the precious metal has tumbled as much as $270 an ounce to touch a low of $1,534.49 on Monday. After hitting a record high of $1,920 just three weeks ago, it has dropped 20 per cent.Why has it fallen so sharply? One explanation is the dollar’s rally since the announcement by the Federal Reserve last week of “ Operation Twist”, which will reshape its bond portfolio. Another is that investors have been forced to sell gold to meet losses elsewhere. Finally, CME Group, which runs Comex, the New York exchange where gold futures are traded, said on Friday night it would raise by 21.5 per cent the margin requirement – or capital that needs to be set aside in order to trade – for gold.But none of those factors offers a satisfactory explanation of the collapse in the gold price – its sharpest drop over four days since 1983 – for fearful investors who had bought it as insurance against exactly the sort of market turmoil that is playing out.The price swings have been so violent that some analysts suggest chastened investors may steer clear of gold for the foreseeable future. “What might have started as forced margin call selling to cover losses elsewhere now has the potential to become a game-changer for precious metals,” says Edel Tully, precious metals strategist at UBS.Nonetheless, most investors continue to defy Mr Eibl’s gloomy outlook for gold, and remain bullish about the metal. After all, they argue, if anything has changed about the global macroeconomic situation in the past week, it is that it has worsened.“There isn’t a single macro, geopolitical or any other event that has occurred in the last three days to give evidence of a reversal in the gold rally,” says James Steel, precious metals strategist at HSBC in New York.Traders point out that this is not the first time gold has fallen at the peak of a crisis. At the height of the financial crisis in 2008, gold struggled for direction. From March 17, the day after the Bear Stearns collapse, to a low in mid-October, the bullion fell more than 30 per cent. In the next year, it surged 50 per cent.Likewise, when the Dubai World default triggered a wave of selling across global financial markets in November 2009, gold dropped 12 per cent in the subsequent 10 weeks, only to rally to fresh records.“In these circumstances the call from worried investors does not tend to be ‘Get me out of everything except for gold, oh and that other one’,” says Jonathan Spall, head of precious metals sales at Barclays Capital in London. “It is simply ‘sell’.”Indeed, there were signs on Monday that some traders were attempting to pick a bottom. By mid-afternoon in London, bullion had rallied more than 5 per cent from its low of the day to trade at $1,612.Investors in gold through exchange-traded funds, which now hold more gold than most central banks, have also stuck with the metal. The holdings of the largest, the SPDR Gold Shares, remained flat at 1,252 tonnes throughout the whole of last week.Crucially for traders who watch technical models, the yellow metal managed on Monday to stay above $1,525, its 200-day moving average, a level that has not been breached since January 2009. A fall below that level could indicate a sustained drop in prices, traders say.However, it is not the fall in gold prices that has most unnerved traders and investors, but their volatility. The large daily swings in prices, combined with a jump in the cost of options – a measure of the market’s expectations of future volatility – are concerning to investors, such as pension funds or central banks, which prize stability in their investments.“One of the things that could destroy gold’s safe haven appeal is excessive volatility,” says Mr Spall.Until volatility falls, or there is a fresh development in the macroeconomic picture such as another round of quantitative easing, many investors will be trading gold from the sidelines.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer
610;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-25T23:19:34Z;LCH poised to choose between rival bids;SGX interested in  joining one offer;The battle for control of LCH.Clearnet, London’s biggest clearing house, is expected to move closer to resolution today as the clearer’s board meets to decide between rival bids from the London Stock Exchange and Markit, a financial data and derivatives post-trade company.The development comes as the UK clearer has attracted interest from other parties interested in teaming up with the existing two bidders.SGX, the Singapore exchange, was interested in joining one of the bids, two people familiar with the matter said. NYSE Euronext had teamed up with Markit initially but withdrew recently and has been replaced by Nasdaq OMX, which in June expressed interest in a minority stake. SGX was not immediately available for comment.The bids come as London’s key market infrastructures have been thrown into flux as Brussels regulators finalise sweeping reform of derivatives and equities markets. It also comes as exchanges have been swept up in a wave of consolidation.Both developments have turned clearing houses into prized assets, with LCH.Clearnet – the largest clearer left that is not owned by an exchange – as a key target. It has 98 shareholders, mostly market participants such as banks but also exchanges including NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, guaranteeing that a transaction is completed if one side defaults. A push by G20 regulators to force more OTC, or off-exchange, derivatives through clearing is set to benefit clearers such as LCH.Clearnet.The LSE has tabled a €21 a share bid for 51 per cent of LCH.Clearnet, valuing it at €1bn (£873m). Markit has offered €15 a share for the whole company.The UK bourse wants LCH.Clearnet to acquire its own UK-based clearing business, which it lacks at a time when exchange ownership of clearing houses has been a growing trend.The trend has been reinforced by the prospect of a combined Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, which would dwarf the LSE.However, banks were nervous about the power of such combinations to raise clearing fees and the LSE’s bid included a cap on fees at LCH.Clearnet for a period, a third person said.For Markit, the attraction of LCH.Clearnet lies in its Swapclear interest rate swaps clearing service, which it runs in conjunction with the largest banks dealing in OTC derivatives. Such banks were also shareholders in Markit, making the businesses a good fit, according to analysts.LCH.Clearnet is also clearer for the London Metal Exchange, which on Friday said it had received expressions of interest from unnamed bidders.A fourth person said that bidders included CME Group, SGX and ICE.
611;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;LME is target of £1bn consolidation;;The London Metal Exchange on Friday became the latest exchange to be swept up in consolidation when it said it had “received several expressions of interest with regard to potential strategic transactions”.Likely bidders for the 130-year-old exchange, which is the world’s biggest metals market by volume, are CME Group, the US exchange, SGX, the Singapore exchange and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), a CME rival, a person familiar with the matter said.The exchange could be worth more than £1bn, members believe. The illiquid ordinary shares of the exchange last traded at £4.952, according to JPMorgan Cazenove, its broker, implying a valuation of about £65m.”All three potential bidders offer trading in metals on a smaller scale than the LME. Any purchase of LME would give the buyer by far the dominant metals trading business in the world at a time when China is emerging as a serious rival in key metals such as copper, traded on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.CME trades precious, ferrous and base metal derivatives at Comex, part of the former New York Mercantile Exchange, which CME bought in 2009. Its biggest contract is gold futures. CME declined to comment.The LME accounts for 80 per cent of traded volume in global metal futures transactions. LME prices are used as benchmarks by miners and consumers. The LME offers futures and options contracts for aluminium, copper, tin, nickel, zinc, lead, aluminium alloy, steel billet as well as minor metals – cobalt and molybdenum.While the exchange generated just £12.5m in pre-tax profits last year, shareholders believe it could produce significantly higher earnings by raising fees to levels comparable with other exchanges. The LME charges about 25 cents in fees per trade, compared to CME’s fees of about $1, traders said.To succeed, any bidder would have to negotiate a price with the LME’s 92 members, many of whom also own shares. The largest shareholders are Goldman Sachs, Metdist, the privately owned metals trader, JPMorgan, MF Global and UBS, which between them hold a third of the company.The exchange is one of the few left not to have demutualised and listed on a stock exchange. It also retains one of the world’s last remaining trading pits – known as “rings” at the LME – where traders shout orders to each other.“Until now, probably people have always thought that it may never happen,” said an executive at one shareholding company. However, a valuation above £1bn “may start to get people interested”, he added.The LME said its board, which is being advised by Moelis, an M&A advisory firm, would begin a formal process “which may or may not lead to an acceptable offer for the company being received”.It said: “The interest shown in the LME, where total trading volumes are currently at record levels, reflects the importance of the exchange in global commodities markets.”Martin Abbott, chief executive of the LME, said: “The LME’s future as the world’s leading metal exchange is more secure today than at any point in its history.”Average daily volume is 18 per cent higher so far this year than the average daily volume for the whole of last year.Last year, the LME saw record trading volumes of 120m lots, the equivalent of 2.8bn tonnes of metal.The LME in May said it was considering building its own clearing house and this month hired its first head of post-trade business.
612;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-20T23:14:20Z;Nasdaq sued over swaps trade pricing;;Nasdaq’s effort at expanding into the business of clearing interest rate swaps has run into resistance, with one of its customers filing a lawsuit, accusing it of inaccurate pricing.Jefferies, an investment bank, filed suit against the International Derivatives Clearing Group, a majority-owned subsidiary of Nasdaq OMX, alleging fraudulent inducement, breach of contract and other misconduct.The dispute arises from $180m in swap trades Jefferies made with DRW Trading Group. Jefferies said that to clear the trades, IDGC converted them into what it claimed were “economically equivalent” futures positions. Jefferies alleges that in doing so, IDGC failed accurately to price the swaps.Nasdaq said: “IDCG and its clearing house acted in full accordance with its rules, the relevant contract specifications and the agreements that Jefferies signed.”Nasdaq added that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, IDGC’s regulator, has stated in writing to Jefferies that there were ”no grounds” to conclude that IDCG violated its rules or contract specifications. “Therefore, the suit is without merit, and we will vigorously defend against it,” the exchange group said.The CFTC confirmed that it had written to Jefferies.The clearing of over-the-counter derivatives has become a focus of regulators since the financial crisis. The business is dominated by LCH.Clearnet, with the CME Group and others trying to gain share.IDCG has been trying to clear interest rate swaps since December 2008 after it was granted a Derivatives Clearing Organisation designation from the CFTC. IDCG, however, only secured a handful of members for its clearing house, such as MF Global, BNY Mellon and Newedge.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, said: “While the lawsuit may not ultimately prove successful, we believe facts revealed in the lawsuit cast IDCG’s future success into serious doubt.”IDCG has set itself apart with its clearing process by seeking to take OTC interest rate swaps and turn them into economically equivalent listed futures.Last March, two DRW employees and a Columbia University professor co-wrote a paper that said IDCG’s valuation method for swap futures causes “substantial deviations in valuation with respect to a non-cleared interest rate swap”.“If market participants don’t trust the product, they simply will stay away,” said Mr O’Shaughnessy. “IDCG has always been a long shot from our perspective.”Don Wilson, chief executive officer at DRW, said: “We’re not named in the suit because we didn’t do anything wrong and we entered into a settlement agreement with them.”Jefferies said: “The complaint speaks for itself.”Additional Reporting by Tom Braithwaite
613;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Clearing: Policymakers get down to the detail;Jeremy Grant reports on worries about changes to the rules for central counterparties;Two years on from the start of a huge overhaul of financial market infrastructure, it has become a central tenet for policymakers that one way to make the financial system safer is through greater use of clearing, especially in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.That change is enshrined in the Dodd-Frank Act on financial regulation in the US.It is also the thrust of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) rules being finalised in the European Union.Dodd-Frank, for example, mandates that all clearing-eligible derivatives be processed through clearers, or central counterparties (CCPs) to help reduce risk.The seller of a security sells to the CCP. The CCP sells to the buyer at the same time – if one party defaults the CCP can absorb the loss. It uses margin or collateral provided by the defaulting member to enable it to do this and can call on pooled resources.This sounds relatively simple, but complications have started to arise as regulators come up with the fine print on how it should work and market participants grapple with how to adjust.There are concerns that, if CCPs are to take on new risks – which is what clearing much more of the $600,000bn in notional outstanding value of OTC derivatives would entail – the risks they are taking on should be adequately managed.As Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the University of Houston, says, this is because CCPs are “important interconnectors in the financial system and thus likely to be systemically important financial institutions”.That, experts argue, means there should be adequate oversight and on a worldwide basis, since the derivatives markets they will handle are global.No cross-border system for CCP oversight exists, although this is being worked on.At the same time, the drive for more central clearing is already pitting the world’s biggest CCPs – those operated by CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange of the US, Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing and LCH.Clearnet, the UK clearer – against each other.The concern is that increased competition could lead to laxer financial thresholds and standards in the name of attracting customers to CCPs. And that this could lead to increased risk.For these reasons, debate is raging over the ownership model and governance structure for CCPs.The Bank of England notes that, from a risk perspective, “not-for-profit, user-owned CCPs provide strong incentives for effective risk management”. Whereas for-profit companies are less able to do that, it says.Yet Mr Pirrong points out that most CCPs were originally created by exchanges to serve their members’ interests, and were not “designed as macro-prudential institutions”.Others are worried about the level of new risks moving into CCPs.Manmohan Singh, a senior economist at the International Monetary Fund, says the OTC derivatives markets are under-collateralised by $2,000bn, meaning that banks using them may have to post more collateral than they had thought.There are also questions about who should be allowed to be members of a CCP.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator that is writing rules to implement Dodd-Frank, is grappling with whether to open CCP membership to a relatively wide group of financial institutions – to help spread risk – or to restrict it to the largest that would be strong enough financially to handle big defaults.Banks that will act as intermediaries between users of derivatives – such as asset managers and companies – and the CCPs themselves are also worried about the relationships emerging between CCPs, banks and their customers.A key aspect is “guaranteed portability”, an agreement between clearing members – banks, for example – to take on client portfolios cleared via another member, should one default.While not required in law, this facility is increasingly being asked of some banks by their clients. Yet banks are uneasy, as this could expose them to what they claim would be unmeasurable risk.JPMorgan says clearing members that sign these agreements “commit to unknown additional risk, unknown funding requirements to the clearing house, and an unknown impact on their capital measures, right at the point of extreme market stress” – such as a default.Dale Braithwait, global head of credit clearing at the bank, says: “We believe that guaranteed portability is pro-cyclical and potentially dangerous if widely adopted …The problem is where to draw the line, since this is the ultimate ‘wrong-way risk’.”
614;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-15T09:06:39Z;Deutsche Börse-NYSE deal to save extra $1bn;;Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, the exchange operators planning to create the world’s largest bourse, have significantly raised their estimate of savings by banks from the deal, saying customers would save about $1bn more than previously estimated.The disclosure, in an interview with the Financial Times, comes as the merger undergoes intense scrutiny by European antitrust authorities.Shareholders of the exchanges have already approved the deal, which would create a group with $5.4bn in revenues to rival CME Group and become the largest company listings venue.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, said customers collectively would not have to post about $4bn in money as “margin” in the clearing process through the combination of the exchanges’ two European derivatives platforms – Eurex and NYSE Liffe. The groups had estimated that customers would be able to post $3bn less than they do now.Banks would no longer have to tie up money at the platforms’ two clearing houses because only one, the Börse’s Eurex Clearing, would be used for the combined derivatives platforms. Margin is the money that clearing houses require customers to deposit with them and is used in case traders need to be bailed out if they default.Mr Niederauer said: “The number we talked about before in terms of capital efficiency that we said was $3bn – back of the envelope – we’ve been spending more time with our customers and we think $4bn is a more comfortable number.“That’s not cost savings for the customers. What we are saying is they are going to have to post $4bn less in margin than they do today and with Basel III [bank capital requirements] and other capital constraints coming we think that’s a pretty important thing.”He said customers would also make further cost savings of $75m-$100m by not having to connect to both derivatives exchanges’ clearing houses. “Having done the work with the two integration teams it looks like $75m-$100m that clients will save by having lower network costs, lower infrastructure costs, fewer data centres globally to connect to,” Mr Niederauer said.That comes on top of previously announced, merger-related synergies of €400m ($550m), a figure that itself was raised from the €300m figure outlined in February, when the combination was unveiled.Mr Niederauer and Reto Francioni, the Börse’s chief executive, dismissed concerns that the combination – which would see its global derivatives business run out of Frankfurt – would damage London’s position as a financial centre. More than 60 per cent of Eurex customers are in London.Mr Francioni said: “Why should we move from here? We are service providers who are where the customers are. And we’d better be there. That’s my answer to London.”
615;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-14T15:50:27Z;Britain to sue ECB over threat to City;UK claims new clearing rules put London at risk;Britain is to sue the European Central Bank for setting rules that allegedly handicap the City of London and would force one of the world’s largest clearing houses to decamp operations to the euro area.The unprecedented legal action underlines the depth of ministerial concern over the ECB policy, which comes as the UK engages in a turf war with France and Germany over Europe’s financial markets infrastructure.An ECB policy paper, released in the summer, requires clearing houses to be based in the eurozone if they handle more than 5 per cent of the market in a euro-denominated financial product.Britain will ask the courts to strike down the rule on the grounds that it restricts the free movement of capital and infringes on the right to establish cross-border businesses across a multicurrency European Union.The policy, if enforced by the ECB, would undermine London’s financial market infrastructure since it would require that clearing houses shift many of their operations to the eurozone – most likely Frankfurt or Paris.A Treasury spokesperson said: “This decision contravenes European law and fundamental single market principles by preventing the clearing of some financial products outside the Euro area. That is why we have begun proceedings against the European Central Bank through the European Court of Justice.”British diplomats have long feared that Paris was leading attempts to rig market regulations in a bid to shift the centre of gravity for financial services from the City to the continent.The UK fought off French attempts in recent months to insert into an EU directive a requirement for clearing houses to have access to central bank liquidity – a measure effectively confining most euro-denominated clearing to the eurozone.The lawsuit is expected to be filed imminently at the European Court of Justice. It is the first case brought against the ECB by Britain.London is home to LCH.Clearnet, which processes most share trading that takes place on the London Stock Exchange and operates an over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearing service, making it one of the largest clearing houses in the world. The clearer also operates a clearing house in Paris, called Clearnet SA.Clearing houses have assumed heightened importance to maintaining the stability of the financial system due to G20 regulations designed to clean up after the 2008 financial crisis.The ECB argues that, in the interests of financial stability, it is necessary to locate financial market infrastructure in the eurozone so that crises are not handled by multiple central banks with conflicting interests.“As a matter of principle, infrastructures that settle euro-denominated payment transactions should settle these transactions in central bank money and be legally incorporated in the euro area,” its policy states.The ECB’s policy would immediately hit LCH.Clearnet, since it has a large portfolio of euro-denominated business split between clearing of European government bonds and repos, and euro-denominated over the counter interest rate swaps.The ECB declined to comment on Wednesday.Michael McKee, partner at DLA Piper, a law firm, said: “There would certainly appear to be a prima facie arguable case that any attempt to require a clearing house, located in the EU but outside of the eurozone, to relocate inside the eurozone breaches EU Treaty free movement requirements.”Two US exchange groups, CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange, recently set up clearing houses in London to serve as their beachhead in Europe as they take advantage of post-2008 crisis regulations pushing more clearing of derivatives – instruments in which London acts as Europe’s main hub. However their euro denominated business is minimal at this stage.The ECB policy also said: “Given its mandate to promote the ‘smooth operation for payment systems’, the Eurosystem has major concerns with regard to the development of major euro area financial market infrastructures that are located outside of the euro area”.In 2009 a confidential memo by the Banque de France was leaked, in which the bank called for the establishment of a Paris-based clearing house for credit default swaps, a type of derivative instrument, to prevent the business being dominated by London.
616;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-13T22:28:13Z;Athens exchange ‘not ready’ to consolidate;;Hellenic Exchanges, operator of the Athens stock exchange, is “not ready” to take part in industry consolidation that looks set to create large “networks” in the exchange business, according to its chief executive.Socrates Lazaridis, who is also chairman of the Athens bourse, said the exchange was weighing the benefits of keeping its own trading technology against the effect that becoming part of a large exchange group would have on that.“The discussion is about the technological infrastructure that we have and the availability of flexibility in case we will substitute our infrastructure. Flexibility is a very important issue,” Mr Lazaridis told FT Trading Room.His comments reflect the soul-searching that many smaller exchanges have been going through in the wake of the proposed Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext combination, which threatens to dwarf many regional exchanges.At the same time the two exchanges’ biggest rival, CME Group, the US exchange operator, has been forging distribution deals with smaller exchanges around the world as a way of expanding the network of customers that can use its products – seen by some as a more cost-effective way to expand than engaging in expensive mergers and acquisitions.Mr Lazaridis said: “I don’t think that the timing is perfect for consolidation in this region. First we will see the creation of the main networks like the US, Europe and Asia and then the wave will come to our region. The timing is not yet for our region here. It’s too early.”The Athens exchange uses an upgraded version of technology originally provided to it by a unit of the Chicago stock exchange. Mr Lazaridis said one example of the flexibility the exchange had by retaining its own technology was its ability to roll out emissions trading in June, only two months after being asked to by the Greek government.“There are two issues,” Mr Lazaridis said. “One is we are evaluating substituting our systems where the primary criterion is flexibility. The second point is that the only reason to discount the primary criterion of flexibility is to become a member of an intercontinental network.”In a separate video interview, Mr Lazaridis also addressed the recent short selling ban slapped on the Greek market by the country’s securities regulator last month.
617;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-12T21:55:04Z;ICE to name US commodity futures chief;;IntercontinentalExchange plans to name a new chief of its US commodity futures exchange as president Thomas Farley assumes new responsibilities at the company.Ben Jackson, named chief operating officer of the ICE Futures US exchange in July, is set to add the title of president later in the year, a person familiar with the company’s plans said.ICE Futures US is the leading American trading venue for soft commodities, such as sugar, cotton and coffee. The bourse also hosts equity index and currency futures. Mr Farley has headed the exchange since ICE bought the former New York Board of Trade in 2007.As president, Mr Farley led the exchange’s rapid move into electronic trading, overseeing the end of open-outcry futures in 2008 and parrying critics of high-frequency strategies.He is expected to remain at ICE, whose other businesses include a London-based energy exchange and platforms for trading and clearing over-the-counter derivatives.Both Messrs Farley and Jackson joined ICE from Sungard, a trading technology company, where each separately led the Kiodex commodities unit. In 2009, Sungard bought ICE Risk, a position-keeping system for the commodity markets, from ICE.In the eight months until the end of August, average daily trading volume at ICE Futures US rose 1.7 per cent from the same period a year ago. In August, index futures and options volumes surged 70.1 per cent on the year, while agricultural commodities volumes were roughly unchanged.Commodity options trading continues on the ICE’s New York floor, rented in a building owned by ICE competitor CME Group. The lease expires in June 2013.
618;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME takes aim at ‘parasitic’ derivatives;;"The head of the largest US futures exchange has labelled derivatives that track the price of traditional commodity futures “parasitic”, stoking tension over proposed US curbs on speculators.Craig Donohue, chief executive of Chicago-based CME Group, said that pending US rules limiting commodity speculation would prompt banks and hedge funds to abandon futures that require physical delivery and pour money into contracts that settle in cash.The reason for this, he said, was that the US commodity regulator had proposed allowing traders to hold five times more cash-settled contracts than traditional futures contracts.“What you’re doing is you’re encouraging people to leave the physical delivery, price discovery contract and move to what I would call a parasitic, second-order derivative,” Mr Donohue told the Financial Times. CME’s exchanges list leading physical commodity futures, including West Texas Intermediate crude oil, natural gas, corn and soyabeans.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is in the next month set to vote on its proposal to cap speculation in 28 commodities. Congress required the new rule as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms passed last year.Position limits have been among the most controversial of the dozens of new derivatives rules advanced by the CFTC, drawing more than 13,000 public comments.The different treatment for cash-settled and physically-settled products has pitted older exchanges such as CME and the Kansas City Board of Trade against the newer IntercontinentalExchange, which hosts cash-settled products that track CME’s benchmark US natural gas and crude oil futures. ICE and CME have lobbied CFTC officials heavily on the issue.“In the end you’re dealing with an incentive for regulatory arbitrage,” Mr Donohue said. “People will go to the area that they have the most headroom.”A form of the new limit regime has been in place on both CME and ICE natural gas markets since February 2010. CME also has some cash-settled futures, though they are not as heavily traded as futures linked to actual delivery points such as Cushing, Oklahoma, for crude.“Position limits and large trader reporting have already been implemented ahead of financial reform, and they are working; today, natural gas prices remain near historic lows and price volatility is low. The CFTC’s establishment of these limits has been effective and policy should not be changed to suit the commercial needs of an exchange at the expense of the market,” Atlanta-based ICE said.The CFTC would allow traders to hold cash-settled commodity positions up to the limits as long as they did not also own more than a quarter of the deliverable supply for the underlying commodity. The text of the proposed rule said that higher limits would help to ensure “market liquidity and efficient price discovery.”"
619;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-07T09:34:42Z;Rebound for Nymex open-outcry;Floor volumes surge in August;About three months ago I wrote about how the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange was increasingly looking like a 20th century relic as crude oil options trading followed futures on to electronic screens.Well, events in August have proved me wrong – for a month, at least.As macroeconomic fears gripped all markets, the men and women on the Nymex floor saw oil options business slosh back in their direction. The number of crude oil options traded on the Nymex floor rose 21 per cent on year to 1.4m contracts, marking the first annual increase since May 2010.The rebound for open-outcry trading came amid a broader surge of volume for futures and options, which tend to be most useful (and most dangerous) at times of great turbulence. In West Texas Intermediate crude oil, both electronic and cleared over-the-counter options volumes also jumped last month – at faster rates than floor volumes, in fact.CME Group reported record daily volumes across all its exchanges. ICE Futures Europe, the London-based energy bourse run by IntercontinentalExchange, also reported record volumes in August.Still, the flow back to the Nymex pits supports floor brokers’ claim that when times get tough and everyone from banks to oil refiners needs to update options positions, only a room full of shouting people can match buyers and sellers quickly.Traders and dealers say that electronic screens are fine for trading very liquid markets such as oil for imminent delivery, but do not offer enough depth for trading delivery dates further into the future.Voice brokers are skilled at arranging bespoke deals among banks, oil companies and hedge funds, but face technology constraints through the use of phones and instant messages, says Raymond Carbone of Paramount Options, a Nymex floor broker.“I can trade with 10 guys in five seconds. You can’t do that in the OTC oil market,” Mr Carbone says.
620;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
621;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-05T18:49:53Z;Liberalisation push on ‘listed’ derivatives;;European regulators are pushing for the removal of barriers to competition in derivatives traded on exchanges and for greater transparency in bond trading as part of sweeping reforms to market structures in the region.The move underlines the determination of Brussels to use post-2008 financial crisis reforms to break down what regulators believe are barriers that have prevented competition in exchange-traded or “listed” derivatives.It also marks a break with the way exchange-traded derivatives are regulated in the US, where there are plans to open up off-exchange derivatives to competition under the Dodd-Frank act – leaving exchange-traded derivatives largely intact. .There are plans in Washington to open up off-exchange derivatives to competition under the Dodd-Frank act but exchange-traded derivatives would be left largely untouched by any regulatory change.The world’s most widely traded listed derivatives – interest rate and government bond futures – trade in the US on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade, and in Europe on Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse.The Chicago exchanges, operated by CME Group, account for more than 97 per cent of futures trading while Eurex enjoys a similar near-monopoly.That is because both exchange operators use clearing houses, to which derivatives traded on their systems are sent for clearing in a so-called “vertical silo”. That makes it hard for competitors to offer rival products.US regulations focus on liberalising the off-exchange, or over-the-counter (OTC), derivatives, leaving CME’s dominance largely intact.Brussels has circulated a new regulation – an extension of its overhaul of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ( Mifid) – that would require clearing houses in Europe to accept for clearing instruments “on a non-discriminatory and transparent basis, regardless of the trading venue on which the transaction is executed”.The regulation comes on top of a new version of Mifid, which emerged last week and separately calls for a similar opening up of access to clearing houses.“It’s a groundbreaking proposal that could change the whole landscape,” said one Brussels-based industry expert.An EU regulation is a fast-track measure that is immediately binding and gives member states no freedom to interpret the rules once they have been agreed by finance ministers and the European parliament.While it has the potential to introduce new rules sooner and more uniformly across Europe than a directive, the draft regulation would face the same political barriers as any other legislation working through the Brussels system.It is likely to face stiff opposition from various alliances of member states and MEPs, who broadly support the integrated exchange model. Transparency measures for trading bonds and structured products in the regulation are also likely to be challenged by member states.The issue of access to clearing houses has become one of the most sensitive amid a welter of reforms to market structures, with heightened focus on clearing houses’ possible role in reducing the impact of future financial crises.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, ensuring that the deal goes ahead even of one side defaults.Ownership of, and access to, clearing services is one focus of an in-depth probe by European antitrust authorities as they assess a proposed combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, the US exchange operator.
622;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Gold miners will soon feel the bullion effect;Main advantage of gold shares is their leverage;The gold price had a large fall recently, partly as a result of the CME, the US’s biggest futures exchange, increasing margin requirements by 27 per cent. After a parabolic rise, a setback was inevitable, but my view is unchanged – gold is still in a powerful bull market.Gold has a special place in the human psyche. Unlike fiat currencies, which have always failed, gold has endured as a protection of wealth for more than 6,000 years.The arguments for buying have never been stronger. Gold is increasingly accepted as a currency and haven. Unlike other currencies, gold has no debt. Central banks have switched from being net sellers to large buyers. During the first half of this year they purchased more gold than in the whole of 2010. Also, gold mining companies have drastically reduced their hedging programmes.Exchange traded funds and very low interest rates are other helpful factors, making it much easier and less costly for private investors to own gold. For years, the Chinese government has been encouraging its population to buy gold as part of their personal savings programmes. In 2010 China imported five times as much gold as in 2009.As the world’s reserve currency, the dollar should be the bedrock of the international monetary system. Unfortunately its collapse is inevitable. US national debt has risen to $14,000bn and the unfunded liabilities of social security and Medicare combined are now more than $100,000bn. How can this be financed without further devaluation?Fiscal policy throughout the world is very uncertain – always good for gold. The sovereign debt crisis especially in Europe hangs over the market. With QE1 and QE2 a lot more money has already been printed and pumped into the global economy. More may be on the way.Although demand is growing fast, the supply from mines is flat. Most of the world’s easy high-grade ore has already been mined. Gold is not in a bubble – it represents under 1 per cent of global financial assets. Remarkably few people own gold coins. The total market capitalisation of all of the world’s gold stocks is only a little more than the capitalisation of ExxonMobil and Apple combined.The Junior Gold Fund, in which I have a substantial interest, started its life in September 2009 when gold was breaking through $1,000 an ounce. At its high Junior Gold had risen by 84 per cent whereas gold was up only 53 per cent. Today the position is reversed with gold up 85 per cent against a rise of 61 per cent by Junior Gold.The disconnect between the rising gold price and falling gold shares continues to surprise me. I do not buy the argument that gold shares are just shares and stock markets are falling at the moment. The recent rise in the gold price will produce a massive boost to gold mining profits. When it is ready the market will recognise this.The main advantage of gold shares versus gold is their leverage. Take the example of Spanish Mountain Gold, in which I own almost 10 per cent. This Canadian listed mining company has growing resources of 4m ounces in British Columbia, one of the world’s safest and most favourable mining jurisdictions.A recent preliminary economic assessment indicated that the planned mine would be very profitable at a gold price of $1,100 per ounce and that, in the first five years, cash flow before tax and capital expenditure should average about C$120m per annum. Because of past losses and favourable tax incentives, there should be no taxes payable in cash during the first few years.At a gold price of $1,800 the figures would be remarkably better. With estimated production in the first five years averaging 213,800 ounces per annum, the additional potential cash flow before tax would be an extra C$150m per annum. This would result in pre-production capital expenditure estimated at C$382m being repaid very quickly, leaving the company debt-free with estimated cash flow before tax of C$270m per annum against a present market capitalisation of C$110m.This kind of leverage is the main attraction of gold mining shares compared with gold bullion. There is always the possibility of a takeover at a substantial premium and many gold mining companies have additional exploration potential. For example, Spanish Mountain has gold anomalies that could add to resources and an exciting copper anomaly with a geochemical signature 3km long and 0.5km wide.Compare gold mining stocks today with quoted companies dependent on increased consumer spending. Gold mining companies are benefiting from the tailwind of the gold price that is massively increasing their revenue and future cash flow. In contrast, companies that rely on consumer spending are likely to run into a very strong headwind.

623;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-09-02T16:15:26Z;LSE/LCH.Clearnet;Secret to exchange’s continued viability lies on its doorstep;"The London Stock Exchange has had its head turned for more than a decade by the lure of international alliances. Now it may be discovering that the secret to its continued viability lies on its doorstep, in the shape of the old London Clearing House. LSE is in talks with LCH.Clearnet; an offer could value the target at €1bn. A deal looks both do-able and sensible. What took the exchange so long to realise it?LSE is hampered by its lack of scale in clearing. That has allowed rivals such as Deutsche Börse and CME Group to dictate the shape and size of the exchanges industry. After the failed merger with the Toronto stock exchange, Xavier Rolet, LSE’s chief executive, needs to demonstrate that the exchange is back on the front foot. Clearing is where the action is, and LCH.Clearnet has a potential jewel in SwapClear, the clearing service for over-the-counter interest rate swaps, which is poised to benefit from regulatory reform that will see more trading switch to electronic platforms.Valuing LCH.Clearnet is tricky. A €1bn price tag looks high; it earned only €19m in net profit in 2010, and its earnings are very volatile. It is owned by about 100 financial institutions, so getting a unanimous sale agreement could be tough given the potential for conflicting agendas. UK post-trade services group Markit has already made an approach to LCH.Clearnet that values it at only half what the talk around the LSE move does.There is a risk that the exchange will overpay, especially if others join to create a bidding war. That helps to explain the 3 per cent drop in LSE’s share price on Friday.The LSE’s balance sheet is strong, however. Barclays Capital suggests that it could afford to pay up to £700m, or twice projected 2011 earnings: more than enough to acquire control. To secure a transaction with strategic benefits for the London markets, that may be a price worth paying."
624;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-31T20:22:10Z;Quick View: CME’s Goldilocks moments;;The financial crisis may have been more of a disaster movie than a fairytale, but CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, is looking increasingly like Goldilocks.The issue is the speed of rule-making for the derivatives industry – the thorny problem of fleshing out the bones of last year’s Dodd-Frank Act to overhaul US financial regulation.At times, CME has felt the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures watchdog with the responsibility of writing the rules, has been going too fast, at other times too slow – reminiscent of Goldilocks’ complaints about the three bears’ porridge being the wrong temperature, chairs being the wrong firmness and beds the wrong size.Back in December, for example, Terry Duffy, CME chairman, was complaining that things were proceeding too rapidly.“We have big staffs, but we are getting inundated and have started getting behind on trying to keep up with this stuff,” he told the Financial Times at the time. “We have to thoughtfully go through all these proposals and write comment letters. We’re going through it all very thoroughly. The problem is there’s one after another.”By the time of the CME’s shareholder meeting, Mr Duffy was striking a different tone, saying rule-making delays were holding back the industry, prompting investors to take a “wait and see” approach to trading.CME seemed finally to have decided that the rule-writing was indeed going too slow when Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, complained during the company’s second-quarter earnings conference call in July about “the ongoing and delayed nature of the rule-making process for implementing Dodd-Frank”.But Goldilocks struck again this week, with Mr Donohue deciding in a strongly worded letter to the CFTC that the process was legally dubious and everyone needed more time to reassess the impact of the proposed rule changes.Some observers in the financial world are finding it hard to keep up. “Which is it? Do they want the CFTC to speed things up or slow them down?” an industry insider e-mailed me in exasperation.Writing rules that do not provoke the industry’s ire was always going to be a tricky task. Like the three bears, the CFTC has been stuck in the woods doing, well, whatever it is that bears do in the woods. From the CME’s side, it’s a company’s prerogative to change its mind.The difference with the fairytale is that in the CME’s view, there only seem to be two bears – too fast and too slow – since at no time has the agency been proceeding at just at the right speed.At its heart, this is less about process than results. It isn’t the speed of rulemaking that upsets the CME but the proposed rules themselves. The exchange, a self-regulating organisation, doesn’t like the idea of falling more under the remit of an agency in Washington that was once seen as a cheerleader for its cause but is now emerging as something of a foe.However it resolves itself, like the Goldilocks tale itself, this struggle seems likely to finish without a happy ending.
625;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-31T20:22:10Z;CME chief attacks CFTC over reforms;;The head of CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, has launched a fierce public attack on Washington regulators, saying the way new financial rules have been written is legally unsound and calling for their implementation to be delayed.In a letter to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, accused the agency of failing to conduct an adequate cost-benefit analysis of its proposed rules stemming from last year’s Dodd-Frank Act, which overhauled financial regulation.“The cost-benefit analyses included in the commission’s proposed rulemakings under Dodd-Frank take an uninformative, almost boilerplate, form and fail to acknowledge many of the economic costs of the proposed rules,” Mr Donohue wrote.He noted that both Jill Sommers, a CFTC commissioner, and the commission’s own inspector-general had criticised the agency for having an insufficiently robust approach to analysing the effects of the new rules.“Courts have recently overturned rulemakings of other agencies on the basis that the agencies’ failure to properly perform the required cost-benefit or similar analysis rendered the rulemakings arbitrary and capricious,” the CME chief wrote.“Unless the commission performs a more robust cost-benefit analysis, many of the rules proposed by the commission under Dodd-Frank are vulnerable to such a challenge.”The letter marks a change in tone for the CME chief, who just last month complained in a conference call about “the ongoing and delayed nature of the rule-making process for implementing Dodd-Frank”.That followed comments from Terry Duffy, CME chairman, who said that uncertainty over the new rules was deterring investors from trading in the futures markets.The Chicago exchange group cannot decide if financial rules are being written too fast or too slow“This sounds like the clearest indication yet that the CME will sue the CFTC over one or more Dodd-Frank rules that they don’t like,” an industry insider told the Financial Times.Mr Donohue also accused the CFTC of in effect overturning the futures industry’s tradition of principles-based self-regulation towards a more rules-based system like that governing the securities industry, a development he said could force traders to abandon the US.“The commission’s proposed inflexible, rules-based regime threatens to stifle growth and innovation and drive market participants (and jobs) overseas,” he wrote.Mr Donohue singled out a rule that would force exchanges to limit large block trades to 15 per cent of their overall trading volumes, a proposal that he said would drive up margin costs and taxes and stifle innovation.He also reiterated his opposition to proposals to impose position limits on trading in physical commodities, which he said would make US markets uncompetitive.Although the CFTC has missed several deadlines for rule-making, the CME chief said it should redo its cost-benefit analysis and open the results for further public comment, in effect delaying the process further.A CFTC spokesman noted that Mr Donohue’s letter was submitted as a comment on the rule-making process and would be “considered along with all the other comments we receive”.
626;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-28T22:10:46Z;Irene downgraded to post-tropical storm;;Hurricane Irene left at least 18 people dead and more than 4m businesses and homes without power as it rampaged up the east coast of the US, but New York was speared the worst as the storm weakened.By late Sunday night Irene was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone as it neared the US-Canada border and Wall Street was set to open as normal on Monday with public transport in and around New York City expected to reopen gradually from around 6am local time.Barack Obama warned earlier on Sunday that flooding could worsen and that recovery efforts would take weeks.The US president declared a federal state of emergency in several states, which means federal funds will cover much of the cost of disaster clean-up. “The federal government is going to participate in the funding. That will be a significant benefit to us,” said Andrew Cuomo, New York governor.The storm left at least 18 people dead and more than 4m homes and business without power, according to the Associated Press. US media reported widespread flooding in upstate New York and southern Vermont as Irene churned north. Canada issued warnings for its maritime provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.The financial district in low-lying southern Manhattan had been braced for a full frontal assault by the storm. Residents in some areas in the New York metropolitan region were forced to evacuate, but the flash flooding and widespread damage that many had feared did not materialise.“The good news is the worst is over and we will soon move to restore and return mode,” said Michael Bloomberg, New York’s mayor. “The dangers of additional flooding have been eliminated and the existing flooding should start to go down”.There were no confirmed deaths or injuries in the city but it was too early to know the full extent of the damage, he said.The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market buildings were largely unaffected, officials said and, following discussions with city officials, power authorities and regulators, they announced plans to open for trading as usual. CME Group and BATS also said they will be operating normally.Several Wall Street firms said they planned to open. Credit Suisse said it had contingency plans in place to bus essential employees into the city if the transit system was not operating. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley said they would open as normal.American Express said that while its building in Battery Park did not experience any damage, due to repairs to the mass transit systems and clean-up work, the credit card company’s headquarters would be closed on Monday. Business would continue as normal, a spokeswoman said, saying employees would work remotely where they could.How quickly New York will return to normal will depend on how soon transit authorities can get the trains running. Sections of some commuter lines were underwater on Sunday. Bus service was restored on some lines by early Sunday evening and the PATH trains to New Jersey were expected to reopen in time for the Monday morning commute.The Port Authority said all New York area airports remained closed on Sunday. The city’s ports and container terminals were due to open at 8am on Monday.Mr Bloomberg is expected to face criticism for the decision to shut the subway service, with some saying it was an overreaction following the city’s slow response to a blizzard last winter.Mr Bloomberg said on Sunday that the decision was made because “we were unwilling to risk the life of a single New Yorker. The bottom line is that we would make the same decisions again without hesitation”.Jay Walder, chief executive of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, said inspections were under way to assess damage to the city’s extensive subway system. “We can only do that as quickly as we can do it safely,” he said. “It’s clear that we have widespread impacts of the storm” from flooding, downed trees and power outages.Irene’s centre moved over New York City at 9am local time, according to the National Hurricane Center, but following a fall in wind speed it was downgraded from a category one hurricane to a tropical storm. In New Jersey, where Irene came ashore earlier, Chris Christie, the state’s governor, said he expected the cost of repairing damage to be “in the billions of dollars, if not in the tens of billions of dollars”.By late Sunday the eerily quiet streets of New York were coming back to life.The roughly 370,000 city residents who were ordered to leave their homes in low-lying areas were told they could return.At Hunter College on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, which was housing a mixture of homeless people and people evacuated from their homes, Miriam Kessler, a social worker at Resort Nursing Home, said: “We had to evacuate our entire nursing home. There are about 250 people [spread] between Hunter College and John Jay College. Some are in hospital. It’s been difficult to keep track of people and their medications but we are getting there”.In Manhattan’s Times Square, two Italian tourists, Enrico Agostinelli and Antonella Tancredi, were filming the quiet streets of the normally bustling intersection on a video recorder.Mr Agostinelli said the shutdown of mass transit and warnings to stay indoors were an overreaction. “This problem is not a reality … it’s a show” for television. “It is a wonderful country. You can’t stop everything for this problem”.At a makeshift shelter at Brooklyn Tech high school, Tate John waited to be taken back to his home in Seagate near Coney Island.“I don’t know why I bothered coming, I’ve called and there’s no damage in our area. There were 30 of us or so, all senior citizens,” he said. “None of the young folk paid attention to the evacuation orders. It was just Mayor Bloomberg making a fuss, because of what happened with the snow at Christmas”.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson in London and Ajay Makan in New York
627;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-28T13:00:05Z;India’s NSE keeps its focus on core growth;;As exchange operators around the world chase tie-ups with rivals, the head of India’s largest exchange by volumes has steadfastly ignored the consolidation chatter and focused on core growth and strategic alliances.Ravi Narain remains quietly confident that the National Stock Exchange of India is on the right track.It is a strategy that looks increasingly wise as deals such as the London Stock Exchange’s merger with the TMX have fallen apart over the past few months in the face of stiff regulatory scrutiny.“The jury is still out on mega mergers,” says Mr Narain. “Even where they have occurred, the cost synergies have not been that great …As we saw recently, both in the case of the proposed merger of Singapore and Australian exchanges and Canada’s TMX and LSE, national interest was seen as an important factor,” he says.Foreign investors, including Goldman Sachs, General Atlantic, Softbank Asian Infrastructure Fund and Temasek, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, have invested in NSE over the past few years but as India restricts the maximum shareholding that a single entity can hold in exchange, analysts say a foreign tie-up with any of the Indian exchanges would be unlikely.Mr Narain says the NSE strongly believes that “rushing into one particular mega merger would exclude [the NSE] from many other interesting possibilities”.Instead NSE has sought to broaden its appeal by focusing on product alliances with overseas exchanges.NSE has product co-operation agreements with the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that Mr Narain says allows diversification plays for Indian investors and give foreign investors access to India through Nifty futures trading on CME and SGX.An agreement with the LSE is also in the pipeline.On Monday, NSE will launch derivative contracts on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial. The exchange also plans to launch a platform for small and medium-sized companies and secure approval for a new India VIX product soon.Constant attention on product and technology innovation has helped NSE maintain its position as India’s biggest exchange operator, a position it quickly assumed after setting up in the early 1990s. Domestic competitors have long sought to challenge NSE’s position, given the potential returns – only about 2 per cent of India’s 1.2bn population participate in the financial markets.But the BSE, the NSE’s nearest rival in equity markets, still has some way to go to catch up. According to the World Federation of Exchanges, the BSE has more than 5,000 companies listed compared with about 1,600 on NSE. However, for the year to June, the value of shares traded on NSE platforms in dollar terms was about four times bigger than at the BSE.Two years ago the BSE appointed Madhu Kannan, an Indian national who previously worked at New York Stock Exchange and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, as its chief executive. Under his leadership, the 136-year old BSE has implemented a series of structural, personnel and technological changes designed to revive a tired brand.The BSE has lowered the cost to trade, struck an alliance agreement with Osaka Securities Exchange and a licensing deal with the International Securities Exchange, the US options exchange owned by Deutsche Börse. It also recently secured approval for an SME platform.But Ankur Rudra, an IT and exchanges analyst at Ambit Capital in Mumbai, says that “it would be difficult for any of the big players to take away the big leadership that NSE has in volume terms. “The Bombay Stock Exchange could try to capitalise on its Sensex brand,” he says. “But the battle lines are really being drawn in the commodity and currency segments, which are still nascent.”In the past decade newer entrants to India have sought to find gaps in those markets. The Multi Commodity Exchange, backed by entrepreneur Jignesh Shah’s Financial Technologies group, is now India’s largest commodities bourse by volumes. A consortium of financial institutions that includes the BSE, last year launched the United Stock Exchange of India, becoming the latest competitor in the currency trading space.But efforts by MCX-SX, also backed by Financial Technologies, to go head to head with NSE in currency derivatives have proven more contentious. MCX-SX issued a complaint in 2009 over NSE’s practices in the currency segment that prompted a probe by India’s competition commission.In June, the competition watchdog levelled a $12m fine on NSE for allegedly engaging in unfair market practices in the currency derivatives market and abusing its current dominant position. MCX-SX is expected to claim for compensation. The NSE, which has contested the allegations, declined to comment.The case, however, highlights how competitive gaining a slice of India’s markets has become as exchange operators bet on strong economic growth.
628;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Gold drops $160 an ounce in two days;;Gold suffered its largest two-day absolute fall in more than three decades, dropping $160 per ounce between Tuesday and Wednesday in a move that spotlighted the dangers of an asset viewed as a haven.Investors risked further sharp moves as the leading US metals exchange announced it will demand larger good-faith deposits to own gold futures starting after Thursday’s close.Spot gold prices fell to a session low of $1,750.55 per troy ounce, down $160.91 from the all-time high of $1,911.46 a troy ounce set in late trading on Monday. The previous largest two-day absolute drop was set in January 1980.In percentage terms, bullion has fallen by 8.4 per cent over the past two days, one of the 10 largest corrections since the early 1980s, according to Reuters data.Phil Streible, broker and senior market strategist at MF Global, said: “Investors are exiting positions at the moment because it is no longer a responsible market to trade under the premise you are seeing it as safe.”Gold was affected by a rising equity market and concerns that a speech by Ben Bernanke, president of the US Federal Reserve, at a gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole on Friday may not push investors towards bullion.Analysts said the correction started in Asia, as investors in the Shanghai Gold Exchange sold the precious metals after two rises in margin, or the deposit needed to own futures, this month.Late on Wednesday, CME Group, the operator of New York’s Comex exchange, said it will increase gold margin requirements by 27 per cent. This followed a 22 per cent increase two weeks ago.The increase raised the prospect that some gold traders using borrowed money would have to bail out.But investors and analysts said it was too early to call the top of the decade-long bull market in gold, noting that previous corrections had proved short-lived.“If you look at the long-term price, there have been similar corrections and it has continued going up,” Matthew Turner, precious metals strategist at Mitsubishi, said. He acknowledged that last week’s rally, when gold rose 6 per cent, was “excessive”.In spite of the correction, investors noted that gold remains the second best-performing commodity so far this year, up 24.6 per cent since January. Silver is the best-performing commodity, up nearly 30 per cent since the beginning of the year.In real terms, adjusted for inflation, gold prices are still a long way from their high of about $2,500 an ounce set in 1980 after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.The gold market experienced a surge in demand last week, which lifted the assets of the world’s largest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, to a record of nearly $77bn. The surge catapulted SPDR Gold Shares to the top of the world ETF league, above a peer that replicates the S&P 500.However, flows on Tuesday into the S&P 500 fund and out of the gold fund restored the stock fund’s top ranking. The gold ETF lost $1.5bn on assets, while the S&P 500 fund gained $489m. The stock fund was again the biggest, with $79.6bn in assets, versus the gold fund’s $75.9bn.The precious metals market experienced a surge in demand during the worst of the global financial crisis, between January and April 2009, when stock markets hit their crisis lows, and again between April and July 2010, when Greece had to be rescued.
629;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-16T18:55:42Z;CME and ICE at odds over cash contract rules;Exchange operators squaring off over new rules;The rivalry between CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange has spilled into the regulatory arena, with the exchange operators squaring off over new rules for commodities trading.At issue are position limits, the controversial caps on speculation in 28 commodities that are set to grow broader under rules proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.The rules would prevent speculators from amassing futures contracts totalling more than 25 per cent of the deliverable supply of a commodity in the days leading up to expiry. But speculators could hold five times as many contracts if they settle only in cash, and do not result in delivery.The distinction has special relevance to the US natural gas market, where CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange and ICE are battling for trading volume and a form of the limit regime has been in place since February 2010.Nymex is home to both physically-settled gas futures for delivery in Louisiana as well as cash-settled natural gas futures whose prices are linked to the physical contract. US gas traded on ICE is only cash-settled.CME, in a letter dated Monday, opposed the more generous limits for cash-settled contracts, saying they increase the threat of price manipulation and were unfair.“The commission also fails to explain why cash-settled contracts that are designed to be linked to the price discovery of a physically delivered contract should have a material, government-imposed, built-in advantage to attract liquidity through a disparate, five times higher speculative position limit,” wrote CME general counsel Kathleen Cronin.“Favouring some markets to the detriment of others – particularly where those markets settle against and price off of the adversely impacted physical delivery market – is not a legitimate use of position limits nor is it an appropriate action for a regulatory agency. Based on the record, the only obvious motivation for conditional limits is favouritism of the cash-settled market for all physical commodities.”ICE, in a letter last week, said its rival’s “request that the conditional limit be decreased or eliminated is a change in the status quo that is not supported by the broader marketplace.”Both Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE chief executive, and Terry Duffy and Craig Donohue, respectively CME chairman and chief executive, have met with CFTC staff and chairman Gary Gensler this month to discuss position limits, records show.Mr Gensler has said he hopes to present a final rule on position limits next month. The issue has divided the five-member commission.
630;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-16T18:47:40Z;NYSE intensifies futures battle with CME;;NYSE Euronext has stepped up its battle with CME Group for the interest-rate futures market, luring three new clearing members to its five-month-old venture that aims to break the Chicago group’s near-monopoly on the market.NYSE said on Tuesday that ABN Amro Clearing Chicago, Citigroup Global Markets and Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith were becoming clearing members of New York Portfolio Clearing, its clearing house for Treasury futures. The new additions bring the total number of clearing members to 13, including companies such as Barclays Capital, Getco and UBS.In collaboration with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade services group that clears cash equities, NYPC offers “one-pot margining”, enabling dealers to post margin for both kinds of products in a “single pot”, thereby allowing traders hedging their cash positions with futures to save on margin costs.NYPC aims to attract business by offering greater capital efficiency, rather than simply undercutting CME on price, as previous efforts have attempted.Walt Lukken, NYPC chief executive, said the addition of the three new members “represents further market validation of the importance of the ‘one-pot’ capital efficiencies that NYPC offers, particularly in today’s market and regulatory environment”.However, most of NYPC’s business has not been in US Treasury futures but in eurodollar futures, where the venture has built up more than 800,000 contracts in total open interest – some 7 per cent of the open interest market share.Outside of eurodollars, NYPC is seeing trading volumes grow, but from a very low base. Its biggest US Treasury futures volumes have been in 10-year Treasury futures, where it saw average daily volumes of 12,200 contracts in July, with 15,400 contracts traded on average every day so far in August.By contrast, some 1.3m 10-year Treasury futures contracts changed hands daily at CME Group in July, while daily trading volumes are running at about 1.76m so far in August.Most observers see NYPC as more of a longer-term threat to CME’s dominance of the market. However, in practice it will probably have no more than one year to prove its worth.Tom Callahan, head of NYSE’s US futures business, has said the venture cannot be judged until at least the end of the year. Standard and Poor’s, which deemed NYPC “a credible threat” to CME’s position and issued a negative outlook for the exchange group as a result, said the gravity of its challenge would emerge within one year of its launch.
631;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-11T18:06:34Z;Gold pulls back from $1,800 record high;;Gold dropped from record highs above $1,800 a troy ounce on Thursday as short-term traders pulled out of the market amid a rally in equities.The fall was amplified by an announcement late on Wednesday from CME Group, which owns the Comex exchange in New York, that it would raise margin requirements – or the amount of cash investors must set aside in order to hold futures positions – for gold futures trading by 22 per cent at the end of Thursday.For traders the move was a reminder of May’s wild swings in the silver market, when a series of margin hikes helped trigger a 25 per cent collapse in the value of the so-called “devil’s metal” in a week.Gold dropped from a nominal record of $1,813.79 in early Asian trading to $1,763 by early afternoon in New York. The move from $1,700 to $1,800 – in just three days – was the most rapid ascent from one milestone to the next since gold spiked from $700 to $850 in two days in 1980.That meant the market was ripe for a short-term sell-off, strategists said. But they added that, in contrast to the precipitous plunge in the silver price in May, gold’s fundamentals appeared more solid.The current drivers of the gold price, are “entirely different, and significantly more substantive, than the search for a quick buck which caused the last leg of silver’s rally at the start of the second quarter,” argued Edel Tully, precious metals strategist at UBS. “Any pullback will be welcomed by investors who have been waiting for a better buying opportunity,” she added.Traders said there was little sign of a large move to buy the dip on Thursday, with some long-term investors hoping for a deeper correction.“The recovery in equities appears to be reducing safe haven flow in gold,” said James Steel, precious metals strategist at HSBC in New York. “I sense there’s a bit of battle fatigue in the market as well.”Some investors have been betting that the more industrial precious metals, such as silver and platinum, will recover relative to gold having underperformed the yellow metal since the start of August. The gold price rose this week above the platinum price for the first time since 2008.Nonetheless, the lack of resolution of the issues plaguing currency and debt markets meant gold’s bull run was unlikely to be over, analysts said.Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York, noted that gold had rallied in Swiss franc terms for the first time in weeks on Thursday after a sharp correction in the franc driven by talk of intervention by the Swiss National Bank.“There is some suggestion here that SNB’s search for solutions to Swiss franc strength is finally undermining the one fiat currency able to hold up against gold,” Mr Ruskin said.
632;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-11T16:30:45Z;Volatility boosts revenue at exchanges;;Exchanges are reaping a revenue bonanza as volatility drives trading in equities and derivatives to record levels, but some analysts are already warning of lean times ahead.“Exchanges, market makers and brokers are having very busy days right now,” said Niamh Alexander, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in a note. “But we’re not expecting this to be the ‘new normal’ and history has shown that periods of extraordinary activity are often followed by a long calm after the storm.”Exchanges have been among the few winners amid the market turmoil since they earn a fee every time a trade is done.Trading activity has been at unprecedented levels, with Bloomberg processing 43.7bn “ticks” – that is, a change in a security’s bid and offer prices – on Wednesday.That was a 33 per cent increase on the previous peak level of March. It compares with 27.5bn ticks amid the “flash crash” of last year in the US.CME Group, operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade, has seen a 93 per cent rise in average daily volume across all its products – unprecedented for August, normally one of the quietest months.The Johannesburg Stock Exchange traded 230,797 trades on Wednesday, 12 per cent higher than the previous record in June last year.Sandler O’Neill analyst Rich Repetto noted that volumes at US options exchanges were especially strong, up 81.6 per cent this month so far. He said there was likely to be “upside” to his firm’s estimate for third quarter earnings per share at the Chicago Board Options Exchange of 39 cents.Yet Ms Alexander warned of a “pullback in risk taking and market participation” and that the risk of no volume growth was already priced into the sector.“Implied [earnings] multiples to current 2012 estimates are 20-30 per cent below three year median multiples, suggesting these stocks are already priced for volume to stagnate,” she said, citing Nasdaq OMX, IntercontinentalExchange and NYSE Euronext.Daniel Fannon, analyst at broker Jefferies, said: “With the latest move in the markets, the earnings outlook for the [exchanges and brokers] group has changed materially.”Volumes had already started to slow to “a very sluggish pace” in July, according to Barclays Capital, which lowered its volume forecasts across the board during the last earnings round that month, given the weak volume environment.In one sign of investor concern over CME Group, the Chicago-based operator’s shares fell 10 per cent in early trade on Thursday, twice as much as the average falls in the share prices of other big exchanges that day.That was seen as a sign of worry over future levels of activity in the eurodollar, short-term interest rate futures contracts that are the CME’s flagship products, contributing about a quarter of group revenues.Such contracts – especially near-term dated maturities – are traded actively when interest rates are moving or when markets expect the interest rate cycle to change. The US Federal Reserve this week said that it was likely to keep short term interest rates steady until 2013.However Howard Chen, Credit Suisse analyst, argued that while the CME is “highly leveraged” to interest rate futures products its business was increasingly diverse, with other products including energy derivatives, providing 22 per cent of revenues, and equity indices, commodities, foreign exchange and metals making up the rest.Mr Repetto said: “While we expect the extended ceiling on short term interest rates will continue to negatively impact eurodollar volumes, it’s too early to tell how longer term interest rate and commodity futures will be impacted.”Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays, argued that exchanges could yet ride out any volume weakness because some of them have an increasingly diverse source of revenue. NYSE Euronext has reduced its share of revenue from transactions to 47 per cent of group revenue in the second quarter, from 52 per cent for the same quarter a year earlier.Nasdaq OMX’s share of US equity trading fell to 22 per cent in the second quarter, from 22.8 per cent in the same period last year, pulling down the amount that Nasdaq earned from charging fees each time a trade is done. But it more than made up for that by growing its options market shares and revenues, and through earnings from a relatively new business area called “market services”.Mr Freeman said: “The [exchanges] group has historically been highly levered to higher volume environments, considering the high variability in exchange margins based on volumes. However, more recently we have seen the exchanges broaden their revenue base, earning an increasing portion of revenues from non-transaction oriented areas.”The question still dogging investors, however, will be whether recent extreme volatility continues and what effect that will have on exchange and broker volumes.Mr Repetto of Sandler O’Neill said there were differences with the last two spikes in volatility: the immediate 2008 financial crisis, and last year’s “flash crash” in US markets.“While both previous volatility spikes were related to macro-economic shocks, the credit crisis of late 2008 had a profound effect on the global economy, regulatory environment, and leverage/capital in the global financial system.“The flash crash was also triggered by a faltering global economy but contained a technical component, which was triggered by a liquidity void that shook the credibility of the markets. And while it is much easier to look backward at the causes of volatility spikes, still we leave it to investors to decide whether the downgrade of the US debt by S&P is reflective of the credit crisis, or more technically driven, like the flash crash, or somewhere in between,” Mr Repetto said.
633;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Trading volumes hit record levels;;Trading in equities and derivatives has hit record levels this week as investors traded frantically in response to a tumult of factors such as the US Federal Reserve’s decision to stick with near-zero interest rates until 2013, fears over the US’s credit rating and the eurozone debt crisis.Trading in currencies and gold, seen by many investors as a “safe haven” alternative to dollars, have spiked as central banks in the US, Europe and Japan have intervened to attempt to pump liquidity into currency, equity and sovereign debt markets.“A lot of the selling is being driven by uncertainty,” said John Schlitz, head US market technician at Instinet. “It’s panic versus greed, and panic generates higher volume than greed.CME Group, the world’s largest futures market, reported an all-time volume record on Tuesday, beating the last peak of activity hit during the “flash crash” last year in the US, when markets gyrated wildly.On the CME, there were 25.7m contracts traded across all asset classes, with individual market records being hit in gold and Australian dollars.“With all this volatility and uncertainty, people might be nervous about making big, long-term bets on stocks. The leverage built in to derivatives contracts allows investors to benefit from smaller, shorter-term trades,” said Justin Schack, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities.Equity markets are also seeing levels of trading not witnessed since the height of the financial crisis. Tuesday’s US equity market volume of 16.9bn shares was the fifth highest on record, surpassed only by trading in the fall of 2008 and around the May 6 “flash crash”.“It hasn’t been the huge spikes that we’ve seen in other situations, like on May 6. It’s been much more orderly but heightened activity throughout the day,” said Joe Mecane, executive vice-president at NYSE Euronext.The value of share trades done on the London Stock Exchange more than doubled on Tuesday to £10.8bn, from £5.3bn on August 2.On Wednesday morning at the market open, the New York Stock Exchange saw an all-time message traffic record of 121,257 messages per second in one 30-second period, which includes orders placed, cancelled, executed and routed.The US options markets, where the CBOE Volatility Index, or the “Vix”, trades, also set a daily record for the third session in a row, with 41.5m contracts traded on Monday. That compares to a peak of 27.7m contracts during September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed.Nicole Sherrod, managing director at online retail brokerage TD Ameritrade – which reported a record 900,000 trades on Monday – said that retail traders were particularly concerned with the US debt downgrade. They have also been unusually active in options trading, with covered calls seeing spikes in activity. Such contracts allow traders to generate income from long-term holdings.“Near-zero rates are forcing people to find alternative ways to generate income,” she said.Institutional traders have swarmed back into the equities market after mostly sitting on the sidelines during the past two years. Trading volumes at Liquidnet, a marketplace for blocks of shares available only to large funds, spiked last week to its highest since September 2008, a jump of 50 per cent versus last year.“The only way to make money in this market is to be highly selective based on fundamentals, and that’s institutional trading,” said Joe Mazzella, global head of trading at Knight Capital Group.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant in London
634;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-10T15:04:26Z;BM&FBovespa high-frequency trading rises;;BM&FBovespa highlighted the growth of high-frequency trading as the Brazilian exchange’s moves to attract the new breed of automated traders helped offset declines in revenues amid flat markets.The exchange also announced it would implement a new fee structure in the coming quarter that would lower its share of the charges levied to investors for trading.The exchange, one of the world’s largest by market capitalisation, has been investing heavily to attract high-frequency and other automated traders by cutting fees and offering specialist services such as co-location to its matching engine, where trades are conducted, in an effort to raise volumes.Last November it unveiled price cuts of up to 70 per cent and progressive discounts based on trading volume bands.The moves helped the exchange report an 11 per cent increase in high-frequency flow in the second quarter to June 30, with high-speed traders increasingly active in both its cash equities and derivatives businesses.However the growth came at a cost. The discounted fees for HFT customers squeezed margins in its cash equities business, and combined with increasing IT costs, meant total group income before taxes fell 3.4 per cent year-on-year to R$393.8m ($247.7m).Total operating revenues on the exchange for the period fell 1.5 per cent to R$521.3m ($327.9m) as flat global markets meant lower trading volumes on its Bovespa cash equities business.Turnover from trading and settlement on Bovespa fell 7.2 per cent to R$240.6m ($151.4m) as average daily turnover fell 7.1 per cent while margins, affected by the HFT discounts, fell to 5.9 basis points from 6.1 basis points. However, HFT volume in the subsidiary rose to 7.4 per cent of the overall volume traded in the period, with an average daily volume of R$899m.Like many exchanges, the group saw weak second quarter trading in its cash equities business offset by gains in derivatives trading. Revenues from BM&F, its derivatives subsidiary, rose 3.8 per cent to R191.1m ($120.2m), driven by a 5.8 per cent jump in average daily turnover for derivatives contracts.“Our core BM&F business grew in a very challenging market and high-frequency trading in equities is enjoying positive momentum, providing clear evidence that we have a robust and diversified business model,” said Edemir Pinto, BM&FBovespa chief executive.However group operating expenses rose 16 per cent to R$166.8m ($104.9m) year-on-year as it hired in IT and business development to cope with ambitious projects to transform the exchange into the region’s prime hub for trading.The group will launch the first part of new multi-asset class electronic trading platform, developed jointly with CME Group, the US exchanges operator, in the third quarter.It is also developing a multi-asset clearing house that will combine its four existing clearing houses, equities, derivatives, forex and bonds. The move will allow collateral to cover risk exposure in post-trade transactions.The new BM&FBovespa fee structure would eliminate cross subsidies in fee rates across the trading and post-trade businesses. BM&FBovespa said the structure would have no effect on the cost-per-trade for market participants and end customers but cut the exchange’s share of the overall cost-by-trade to 30 per cent from around 70 per cent.“The fee structure will provide improved comparability with the standards of other international exchanges without impacting [our] margins or bottom line,” BM&FBovespa said.
635;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-09T21:26:08Z;US rebounds after Fed statement;;US stocks on Tuesday enjoyed their best day since 2009 after the Federal Reserve’s announcement, paring much of the extremely steep drop on Monday.Financials led gains, with Bank of America coming back from a 20 per cent drop on Monday to gain 16.7 per cent to $7.60. The sector as a whole was stronger by 6 per cent, its best day since May 2009, versus a nearly 10 per cent decline on Monday, its worst one-day fall since December 2008.Banks stepped in to soothe concerns that their balance sheets would be challenged by the economic slowdown and falling interest rates. Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, on Monday said that it was “concerned” that banks’ falling revenues could challenge their credit ratings, though it said it was not directly related to the agency’s downgrade of the US’s sovereign credit.Bruce Thompson, Bank of America’s chief financial officer, told analysts at Nomura on Tuesday that the company did not see a need to raise capital. Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr wrote that the “sell-off in Bank of America seems overdone”.Vikram Pandit, chief executive of Citigroup, told his executives on Tuesday that conditions presently were “fundamentally different” than in 2008, citing Citi’s efforts to raise capital and maintain liquidity. The shares added 14 per cent to $31.82.Analysts at FBR Capital Markets upgraded Wells Fargo, arguing that traders will “flock to quality names that can best weather the adverse effect of a flattening yield curve”. The shares rose 8.1 per cent to $24.78.“Risks of global financial contagion appear overdone,” said Mike Ryan, chief investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management. “US banks may struggle to find strong new revenue streams in the future, but we do not foresee an asset quality crisis.”Goldman Sachs lagged behind gains, rising 4.3 per cent to $122.73, after it reported that it saw poor trading results in the second quarter. It had 15 losing days out of 63 trading days, with gains of $100m on fewer than 5 days.S&P also downgraded clearing houses and insurers. Genworth Financial, the mortgage insurer, bounced back from a 17 per cent drop on Monday. The shares were up 14.4 per cent to $6.44.CME Group, the US futures market and clearing house, added 7.5 per cent to $266.05, versus an 8 per cent decline on Monday.The S&P 500 index wobbled but ended up gaining sharply in the wake of the Fed’s announcement of a hold on loose monetary policy until 2013. The index added 4.7 per cent to 1,172.53, its biggest one-day jump since March 2009, when the market was emerging from its post-crisis bottom.Large-cap stocks, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, underperformed in the upswing, a mirror of how they had previously been seeing less sharp losses than the broad index as investors rotated into defensive names. The Dow was up 4 per cent by the close to 11,239.77The Nasdaq Composite index, hit hard by a steep sell-off in small-cap stocks, had the sharpest gain, up 5.3 per cent to 2,482.52.The market’s breadth was unusually positive, with volumes of shares gaining outpacing volumes of shares falling by 2.2bn to 65m on the New York Stock Exchange.Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, said that in order for technical traders to confirm the move as a rally, rather than simply an interruption of a slide, the market would have to see advancers outpace decliners by at least 10-to-1 on Wednesday as well.“You expect the market to have rallies from time to time, but it is too risky to call a bottom,” Mr Bittles said.Consumer staples groups lagged behind gains, adding just 1.4 per cent. They suffered as investors shifted into more cyclical groups, and after analysts at Citigroup lowered their estimates for second-half same-store-sales growth at a group of large retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot.Their shares underperformed, but were still up 3.9 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively, boosted by Redbook reporting that US same-store sales rose 4.8 per cent in the week ending August 6.“Recent stock market volatility, elevated unemployment, increasing levels of inflation, waning consumer sentiment and a weak housing market will weigh on retail sales,” said Citi.Cablevision, the television and media group, fell 12.8 per cent to $17.02 after missing second-quarter profit forecasts, reporting income of 24 cents versus forecasts of 40 cents. It said it lost an unexpectedly large number of video customers.MEMC Electronic Materials, the semiconductor maker, led all gains in the S&P 500, adding 19 per cent to $5.93. It had hit a nine-year low on Monday.
636;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;CME recruits two banking executives;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, has poached two senior banking executives as part of a shake-up of two of its largest business units.The announcements come amid increasing competition from rivals for derivatives business. Interest rate products, such as eurodollar contracts, account for nearly a quarter of total group revenues and are the single largest part of its business, while equities derivatives account for 15 per cent of CME turnover.The appointment of Michael Kilgallen from Citigroup as managing director of CME’s equity products division fills a post open since the promotion of Scot Warren to managing director of the group’s equity index products and services last year.Mr Kilgallen, 39, will be responsible for developing the group’s equity index derivatives, which include indices such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. He was previously head of global prime finance for Citigroup’s equities business and has also worked at Goldman Sachs. He will be based in New York and will report to Mr Warren.CME also said Sean Tully would join from WestLB as head of CME’s interest rates division. He will replace Robin Ross, who is resigning to “pursue other interests”. Ms Ross, who has been head of the interest rates division since 2005, will leave at the end of the year. CME declined to comment further on Ms Ross’s forthcoming departure.Mr Tully, 47, will be responsible for developing the company’s global interest rate business. He will be based in New York and will report to Derek Sammann, managing director, foreign exchange and interest rate products.An American, Mr Tully was managing director, global head of credit and fixed income trading, at WestLB in London. He also traded interest rate derivatives at Citibank and Greenwich Capital.The group’s interest rates products unit, which has more than 95 per cent of the US interest rate market, is facing renewed competition from NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext, a rival US exchange operator. It is attempting to lure traders by offering greater capital efficiencies, especially in clearing, than its rival.Nevertheless, the earnings reported by the Chicago-based CME have been among the best of the exchanges in recent weeks. Second-quarter results showed an 8 per cent rise in net income on a 3 per cent increase in turnover, boosted by a strong performance in the trading of interest rates, metals and agricultural commodities derivatives.
637;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-08T09:16:46Z;S&P downgrades DTCC and Chicago options clearer;;Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency at the centre of a storm of debate over its downgrade of the US, on Monday cut its ratings for the big securities clearing houses that underpin most stock, option and bond trading in the US.The move reflected the slightly heightened “macro volatility” that they are exposed to through the equity and bond markets, and through their clearing members, S&P said.Clearing houses acts as buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer, ensuring deals are completed even if a party defaults. They typically hold billions of dollars worth of US Treasurys as collateral, as well as cash, which are provided by market participants and help make good trades in a default.S&P said its had lowered to AA+, from AAA, its rating for The Depository Trust Co (DTC), National Securities Clearing Corp (NSCC) and Fixed Income Clearing Corp (FICC) - all part of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which acts as clearer for all share trading on exchanges in the US - as well as on the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), the Chicago-based clearer for all nine US options exchanges.S&P said the move was “not the result of any company-specific event”.Nik Khakee, analyst at S&P, said: “We have not changed our view of the fundamental soundness of their depository or clearing operations. Rather, the downgrades incorporate potential incremental shifts in the macroeconomic environment and the long-term stability of the US capital markets as a consequence of the decline in the creditworthiness of the federal government.”“It’s the macro volatility that they are exposed to through the equity and bond market and through their clearing members. They operate in a more risky environment and as a result they are themselves exposed to that - this is an incremental change,” Mr Khakee told FT Trading Room.DTCC said in response to the latest S&P move: “This adjustment to AA+ is not in any way a reflection on DTCC’s clearing and overall operations or a result of any company-specific event. This action by S&P followed the lowering of its long-term sovereign credit rating on the US and is simply due to that change.“In its announcement, S&P reaffirmed the short-term counterparty credit rating for DTC, NSCC and FICC at A-1+,” the DTCC said.Wayne Luthringshausen, OCC chief executive, said: “This rating change will have no negative impact on OCC’s operations or our ability to meet our obligations to OCC’s clearing members.”DTCC, OCC and CME Group, operator of the largest US futures exchange and associated clearing houses, said they had no plans to make any adjustments to their valuations of US Treasury bonds as collateral posted to them by market participants in spite of the US sovereign downgrade.The move will re-assure market participants since US Treasurys, as well as cash, make up the bulk of holdings at clearing houses in the US. Cash and Treasurys are the most common type of collateral posted by market participants at clearing houses to help guarantee their trades in case of default.Clearing houses are becoming increasingly important to the financial system as reforms in the wake of the 2008 default of Lehman Brothers push swaths of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives into clearing houses for processing. That will require much more collateral to be posted to them.The amount of collateral tied up at the clearing house run by CME Group, which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, was $100bn as of March.CME said: “CME Clearing has evaluated the market situation surrounding the US downgrade and has determined that there is no current need for changes to our collateral haircuts or policies for accepting U.S. Treasuries as margin collateral. We will continue to monitor the liquidity environment and advise market participants if the environment changes.”The OCC said it had “no current plans to adjust its current valuations or haircuts on Treasury securities used as collateral” in light of the S&P move.“OCC will continue to monitor the situation, as it has done over the past few weeks, and will determine appropriate action, if necessary, should there be any disruption in the Treasury market,” the Chicago-based clearer said on Sunday.It added: “OCC has a long record of solid risk management that has helped ensure the security and stability of the markets it serves, and is confident this record will continue through the current situation.”The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) said of its Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) subsidiary, which clears government bonds: “FICC has no current plans to make any changes in our applicable valuations of securities (or haircuts) required for collateral for its Government Securities Division clearing fund and its Mortgage-Backed Securities Division participants fund at this time.“We continue to monitor market developments and volatility in the coming days to assess if we will need to make any changes in our processes. FICC will operate under its normal schedule for input and reporting during the week of August 8.“DTCC is confident in its ability to protect the capital markets and our members throughout a wide variety of market scenarios including this current situation”.LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearer, has a much smaller holding of US Treasurys since most of its business is sterling or euro denominated, as well as other currencies. It holds mostly cash and European government bonds as collateral.
638;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-07T18:10:34Z;Quick View: What next for DB-NYSE probe?;Brussels is going where no antitrust authority has gone before;"No surprises.That’s how most people reacted to last week’s decision by the European Commission’s competition authorities to move its probe of the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext merger to a deeper, second phase.It had been widely flagged that Brussels was concerned about how the combination of Eurex and Liffe would create a dominant player in European derivatives. Also that there would be issues with the consolidation of the “vertical silo” and perhaps with the index business as well.And so it proved. The Commission said its investigation “pointed to significant concerns with respect to derivatives”. It is concerned about the removal of “an important competitor” – meaning the removal of what it sees as a competitive dynamic between Eurex and Liffe.It also is worried about the possible “absence of access to the merged company’s enlarged post-trade clearing facilities” – that is, the creation of a closed vertical silo – by rival derivatives platforms, which would find it hard to enter certain derivatives markets.So what next? Two things stand out.First, the decision thrusts back on to the agenda the issue of competition in listed derivatives and access to clearing just as they had been fading into the background in the last round of deliberations over Emir (the European Market Infrastructure Regulation).The UK (cheered on by the London Stock Exchange and LCH.Clearnet) had been fighting an increasingly rearguard action in favour of extending Emir to listed, not just over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.That effort sputtered when it became clear that German lobbying had ensured there was little appetite in the European Parliament for such a move, which would have instantly opened up the debate over “fungibility” of listed derivatives in Europe.The death knell came in a stinging letter sent to Timothy Geithner, US Treasury secretary, by German MEP Werner Langen. In it, he made clear in no uncertain terms that the scope of Emir should be limited to OTC derivatives.With the presidency of the EU then handed over from Hungary to Poland, the issue of competition in derivatives, the vertical silo and access look set to get even less traction.That said – and this is the second thing – Brussels is going where no antitrust authority has gone before on exchanges and market structures. These guys really are taking the issue apart, looking at it with an intensely critical eye – and saying so publicly. This is new.The closest parallel is the direction taken by the US Department of Justice in 2008 when staff wrote a now infamous letter to the US Treasury department on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade.While the deal had been approved the department a few months before, many still see that as a politically driven decision aimed at preserving the US silo in futures trading. At the time challenging the silo was seen by some as handing Deutsche Börse a victory.Justice department staff communicated what they really felt about the competition issues thrown up by the CME-CBOT combination in that letter. The issues they addressed are remarkably similar to what Europe’s antitrust authorities now have before them.The US staff pulled no punches. They called for nothing less than a review of exchange control of clearing houses in financial futures and made a strong pitch for opening up competition in listed derivatives.Here is what the letter said: “The Department believes that current rules and practices related to clearing futures contracts may be unnecessarily inhibiting competition among futures exchanges in the development and trading of financial futures contracts, to the detriment of the economy and consumers.”It urged a new policy that would “foster exchange competition by, inter alia, ending exchange control of clearing” – that is, nothing less than an end to the vertical silo.So, as Brussels scrutinises the DB-NYSE deal, there is a precedent in the US for challenging the silo. The question is whether Europe will go that far.Let’s take a look at a couple of things. If there is a problem in some market participants’ eyes with a combined Eurex and Liffe having a 94 per cent market share in European derivatives, they can expect little traction with Brussels on that front. Dominant market share is not the issue.Brussels is, however, interested in whether a DB/NYSE deal forecloses competition through lack of access – ie, whether it prevents others from coming in and offering competitive products. Taking a purely European view, it seems to think there is a problem.I’m not convinced that a combination of Eurex and Liffe removes a competitor from the scene. Eurex dominates in trading of futures at the long end of the yield curve, while Liffe dominates at the short end. They don’t really compete with each other. Plus, whatever you make of the LSE’s plucky futures play with Turquoise, it is competing, against Liffe.Where Eurex and Liffe would compete, either as a duopoly or as a new near-monopoly when merged, would be globally, against CME Group. This is surely how Brussels should be looking at it. And European antitrust probes have tended to take the global view; see Microsoft.If that is the case then, just as politics won the day in the CME-CBOT decision, will politics, in the end, also swing the decision on DB-NYSE?Can Europe really afford to break down existing market structures in trading and clearing of derivatives – that is, breaking down the silo and instilling competition as we have in cash equities – at a time when there is no sign that the US is doing the same? Remember that the debate around competition in listed derivatives in Europe is almost totally absent in the US.That way lies an unlevel playing field between the two blocs, with Europe the likely loser. The CME’s European clearing beachhead is already in place in London, where the CME has a staff of 160, compared with only 20 as recently as 2009.And in any case, market participants are not unanimous in their distaste of the silo. The idea that users hate silos is nonsense. You can see this is the comment letters sent to Brussels on DB/NYSE from the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, and the European Principal Traders Association, which represents the high-frequency guys. AFME says it is “broadly supportive” of the merger, “subject to a number of competition issues arising from it”.And – here’s the fun bit – the big banks are further divided between those which moan about the market power of a combined DB-NYSE and those which are … advisers on the deal. Curiously, the latter lot are keeping their counsel.With Emir continuing to take a back seat under the Polish presidency for the next five months, and as the eurozone crisis threatens to fill eurocrats’ inboxes, Brussels has a careful line to tread.I’m not saying remedies won’t be required to get the DB/NYSE deal through. Most people expect something around the index business, and access on clearing, certainly on the cash equities side and possibly something - but what exactly? - on the derivatives side.But I don’t see a wholesale tilt at the vertical silo either. With the US justice department’s letter still a pivotal document in the evolution of market structures in exchange-traded futures, Brussels faces a real dilemma."
639;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-04T17:41:48Z;D Börse and NYSE Euronext tie-up faces probe;;Plans to create the world’s largest exchanges group by combining Deutsche Börse with NYSE Euronext are to be submitted to an in-depth probe after European antitrust authorities raised “significant concerns” over its dominance in derivatives trading.The move came after Brussels launched an initial investigation in June into the planned $10bn tie-up, which would create a transatlantic group larger than the CME Group, ICE or Nasdaq OMX in the US, as well as the London Stock Exchange.It also marks the first time that exchange ownership of the crucial post-trade business of clearing in a so-called “vertical silo” has come under antitrust scrutiny in Europe.Deutsche Börse owns its own futures exchange – Eurex – and clearing house, a position that would be strengthened with the addition of NYSE Euronext’s Liffe futures exchange, based in London.Banks, which are among both exchanges’ biggest customers, have expressed concern about what they say is the increased market power in derivatives trading and clearing. Derivatives generate significantly more profits for exchanges than share trading.A combined Eurex and Liffe would give the group a combined share of almost 95 per cent of exchange-traded derivatives.The commission said: “At this stage, [we are] mainly concerned that due to the removal of an important competitor, the merger would have a negative impact on innovation in derivatives products and technology solutions.“Moreover, the possibilities for fee competition may be reduced due to increased difficulties for competitors to enter the market. Customers who could be affected by this include pension funds, mutual funds and retail banks, as well as professional brokers and investment banks.”Brussels said its investigation had revealed concerns that without access to the merged company’s enlarged clearing facilities – “ie: in the presence of a closed ‘vertical silo’” – entry by rival derivatives platforms would be made more difficult in a market already characterised by high barriers to entry.It also singled out concerns over equities trading and settlement, and index licensing. That refers to the ownership by exchanges of companies that compile stock indices, such as Deutsche Börse’s ownership of the Stoxx index company.Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said: “The Commission needs to make sure that markets which are at the heart of the financial sector remain competitive and efficiently deliver to users.”Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext argue that their derivatives combination would face significant competition from over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets, including when such instruments are shifted on to formal trading systems, as required under the Dodd-Frank act and similar reforms working their way through Europe.“[We] remain confident that [our] planned combination will be approved,” they said. It would “bring together two complementary derivatives businesses, giving them the scale and depth to compete effectively in a global industry with many powerful participants – exchanges, OTC platforms, banks and clearers – and to keep pace with increased competition driven by technology and regulatory changes”.Both exchanges have won overwhelming shareholder support for the deal, with Deutsche Börse saying this week it had received 95 per cent acceptance rate from its shareholders.Brussels has 90 working days to complete its probe.
640;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-04T01:05:26Z;Canada’s TMX buys Atrium Network;;TMX Group has snapped up Atrium Network, a European group that connects trading platforms to institutions, in a move that pushes the operator of Canada’s largest stock exchanges into the growing battle to create virtual hubs for global trading.The deal has come as Maple Acquisition, the consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds bidding for TMX, extended the deadline for its C$3.8bn offer to the end of September as it seeks local regulatory approval.TMX’s move comes as the fragmentation of trading across multiple trading venues and the growing use of high-speed and automated trading and data analysis is reshaping trading in western markets.As the cost and complexity of trading infrastructure rises, some companies, such as Sungard, Fidessa, and BT Radianz, are looking to run the swath of technology that sits between the firewalls of the exchanges, the banks and institutional investors, such as large hedge funds and high-frequency traders.This includes the telecommunications network and data feed handlers as well as services such as co-location hosting and performance monitoring systems. A greater number of investors deepens the liquidity of a platform and in effect it becomes an electronic marketplace that mimics a traditional open-outcry trading floor.Atrium, which has its headquarters in Luxembourg but most of its staff in London, has built a high-speed network that connects investors with other key market infrastructure, such as exchanges, clearing houses, settlement depositories and technology suppliers. It connects 24 trading venues – including NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX, CME Group and Chi-X Europe – and 300 sources of data in more than 11 countries.TMX said the terms of the deal were “not material”. Eric Sinclair, president of TMX Datalinx’s information services division, told FT Trading Room that the acquisition “gets Canadian data out there on a global basis faster”.Atrium was founded in 2006 by Emmanuel Carjat and Emmanuel Pellé, two former employees of BT Radianz. “We’ve been doing this for nearly five years. Now we’re looking for a much stronger balance sheet to help us to grow further,” said Mr Carjat, chief executive.Stock exchanges are increasingly looking at new services, such as co-location services and pre-trade risk analysis, to generate further revenues. While NYSE Euronext reported a 16 per cent decline in second-quarter earnings, that was balanced by a 14 per cent rise in infrastructure revenues and data centre fees.As it delivered its earnings last week, Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, said: “It’s the first quarter we’re saying: ‘You can’t really think of the equity business as really being just the match.’”“It’s about building communities on as big a basis as you can,” said Steve Grob, director of strategy at Fidessa, a trading technology company. “TMX’s move is in sync with current thinking. It’s about creating electronic trading hubs.”
641;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-08-03T18:49:14Z;ICE posts record results for second quarter;;IntercontinentalExchange, the US exchanges operator, reported record second-quarter earnings after strong demand for over-the-counter derivatives and commodity futures trading.Revenues at the Atlanta-based ICE rose 10 per cent year on year to $325m in the three months to June. Net income rose 19 per cent to $121m compared with a year ago. Diluted earnings per share rose 21 per cent to $1.64.The results outstripped an 8 per cent profit increase earlier this week from its principal rival CME Group, the world’s largest futures market. They also underlined how exchanges focused on trading of over-the-counter and energy derivatives have outpaced the earnings of rivals focused on equities.NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, the two largest US equity exchanges, found trading tough in cash equities and derivatives trading, particularly in Europe, but their performances were boosted by non-trading revenues, such as listing fees and providing IT services to other exchanges.ICE said its earnings had been driven primarily by record trading volume in ICE’s Brent crude and gasoil futures and options contracts, as well as solid OTC energy volumes.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive, said the WTI crude contract, owned by rival CME, was no longer the world’s benchmark for oil prices. “While WTI remains an important US oil benchmark to us, it no longer reflects global prices,” he said.The period also saw ICE pull out of a joint $11bn bid with Nasdaq OMX for NYSE Euronext, which would have given ICE a strong position in the European derivatives market. The failed bid contributed to a 14 per cent increase in operating expenses in the period.However, shares in ICE fell $3.09 to $116 in New York after it lowered guidance for revenues from clearing credit default swaps. The group made $30m from CDS clearing in the first half but forecast it would make $65m to $67m for the year, down from its previous estimate of about $70m to $73m.The group added it was preparing to set up platforms to comply with incoming regulatory changes in the Dodd-Frank Act, even though some rules will not be finalised until the end of the year. Authorities in Washington and Brussels are looking to move more over-the-counter derivatives trading, such as swaps, through electronic trading platforms and clearing houses.“Despite delays, we’re moving ahead on key provisions to bring needed certainty to the markets,” Mr Sprecher said.
642;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
643;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-07-28T18:01:29Z;Five questions for the Fed and Treasury;Neither institution has explained what it will do if there is no deal;"This week, a cacophonous hubbub is overwhelming America’s airwaves. For with the debt ceiling deadline approaching, almost every pundit and politician worth their salt has been expressing views on what could – or should – happen next.There is, however, one notable exception: the mighty Federal Reserve and Treasury. In recent weeks, senior officials at both institutions have warned in general terms about the risks of failing to raise the debt ceiling. They have also tried to reassure investors that this risk is small.But what neither institution has yet done is clearly explain to the financial community what it will do if there is no debt ceiling deal by August 2, or US Treasury bonds are downgraded. And while this reticence is understandable (after all, nobody yet wants to admit this might happen), it is fuelling the sense of anxiety. “They are not saying anything, even in private,” the head of one of the most powerful Wall Street groups confessed this week, who like others, feels “in the dark.”So what exactly do bankers and investors want to know in the coming days? The most obvious question, which is worrying bankers, politicians and voters alike, is which payments might be prioritised after August 2, when the US Treasury allegedly will need to cut some payments, if no debt ceiling deal is reached. But, in addition to that, there are a host of more technical questions hanging over the markets, which the Treasury and Fed would do well to address. These include, in no particular order:● What might the US government do to support the US money market funds if American debt is downgraded, or suffers a technical default? These funds currently hold a large volume of Treasuries, and if Treasury bonds tumble in value – or go into technical default – this could erode the net asset value of these funds. This, in turn, could potentially spark a run on these funds of the type that started to occur in 2008, particularly since these funds (unlike bank deposits) are not protected. But since this might have systemic implications, it is uncertain whether the government will – or will not – act.● Will the US authorities step into the markets and act as the dealer or financier of last resort, if parts of the market freeze up? Right now, it seems unlikely that Treasury bonds would become illiquid after any downgrade; after all, this is the deepest bond market in the world. But a downgrade of US debt could, ironically, force some asset managers to sell more risky instruments (such as triple B bonds) to maintain average ratings benchmarks in their portfolios. That might create bottlenecks. There is also a risk the so-called repurchase (or repo) market might freeze. That would almost certainly prompt the government to step in (by accepting bonds as collateral and making loans); how this might work, though, is uncertain.● What will regulators do about capital standards if some banks’ balance sheets balloon? In recent weeks, signs have already emerged of a flight of money towards supposedly “safe” banks in Europe and the US; if this accelerates, it could mess up some banks’ attempts to tidy up their balance sheets. Bankers guess that regulators will be lenient; but – again – this is unclear.● How will regulators and risk managers respond if the “risk-free” status of US debt starts to crumble? Treasuries are currently zero risk weighted for bank capital adequacy purposes. Bank supervisors are unlikely to change this. However, some banks are reviewing collateral policies. On Thursday the Chicago Mercantile Exchange raised collateral haircuts for clearing Treasuries.● What rules will apply for paying interest, accrued interest and principal on Treasury bonds, if a technical default occurs? On a normal day, asset managers and custodian banks make huge numbers of payments to investors, linked to the treasury market; but many institutions are uncertain what to do if a technical default occurs.Now the good news, if you like, is that these questions are (thankfully) still abstract; a deal may yet be brokered, and downgrade avoided.Better still, the Treasury and Fed know that they need to produce answers soon. But, if nothing else, these questions reveal two crucial points: firstly, the degree to which the financial system is tipping into uncharted waters, as a result of this debt drama; and secondly, just how much unfinished reform business remains. In the past three years the authorities have addressed some systemic vulnerabilities that were revealed by the Lehman drama (say with CDS). But progress has been slow in the all-important areas of money market funds or the repo world.Little wonder then, that markets are so uneasy. Once again, the authorities crisis management – and communication – skills could soon be tested. Better just hope they have improved in the last four years.gillian.tett@ft.com"
644;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-07-27T21:39:49Z;BlackRock trades boost LCH.Clearnet’s US push;;LCH.Clearnet received a boost in its effort to break into the US market for clearing over-the-counter derivatives when BlackRock, one of the largest asset managers, said it had cleared its first interest rate swaps on SwapClear, the OTC derivatives clearing service operated by the UK clearing house and large banks.BlackRock executed two trades – one with Barclays Capital and the other with Goldman Sachs – on Tradeweb, an electronic trading platform for OTC derivatives and bonds.Goldman also handled both trades for clearing on SwapClear in a middleman role that is stipulated in the Dodd-Frank Act, which mandates derivatives that are eligible for clearing be processed through clearing houses to help safeguard the financial system.The act also says that trades eligible for clearing should be carried out on exchanges or other types of trading platform of which Tradeweb, owned by Thomson Reuters and a group of banks, is one.Dodd-Frank was passed as part of sweeping reform of the financial sector in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and is designed to move OTC derivatives such as interest rate swaps away from a market where trades were done bilaterally between banks, and onto formal trading systems where prices are more transparently displayed to the wider market.Competing clearing houses have this year been gearing up to handle an anticipated wave of OTC derivatives. The development pits LCH.Clearnet, which launched its US SwapClear service in March, against CME Group, the Chicago-based operator of exchanges and clearing houses.SwapClear has been clearing OTC interest rate swaps traded between banks since 1999, but the battleground in OTC derivatives clearing shifted this year to winning clearing business from non-bank users of OTC derivatives that will be required under Dodd-Frank to clear their OTC derivatives deals – such as that of BlackRock, one of the largest so-called “buyside” users of interest rate swaps.“Executing with multiple dealers while maintaining operational efficiency for clearing services is a terrific step forward for the industry,” said Supurna Vedbrat, co-head of electronic trading and market structure at BlackRock.SwapClear had not seen significant activity on its US service until BlackRock’s trades, in part due to lingering concern among US buyside players about LCH.Clearnet being subject to UK bankruptcy law, under which market participants are treated differently than under US law, in case of a default.It has also taken time for technical issues to be finalised over relationships between banks handling the trading and the key clearing broking function in the process of delivering an OTC derivative to the clearing house, the so-called “give-up” process.In the case of the BlackRock trade, the documentation governing give-ups – where Barclays, the bank handling the execution of the BlackRock trade, handed that over to Goldman Sachs, which then acted as broker delivering that to the clearing house – was not finalised until last month.Jack McCabe, co-head of futures and derivative clearing services at Goldman Sachs, said: “These interest rate swaps trades are among the first to be executed on an electronic platform and centrally cleared. [They] demonstrate our ability to provide clients with front to back execution and clearing services in preparation for the new regulatory requirements.”Jack Hattem, head of rates derivatives in the fundamental fixed income business at BlackRock, said: “These trades are the building blocks of how OTC derivatives will trade within the new market structure regime as defined by the Dodd-Frank Act. The ability to digitally trade, allocate and then send trades for clearing using ‘straight-through-processing’ …promotes competitive pricing and allows for operational efficiencies that impact transaction costs.”The move by BlackRock is also a sign that even as implementation of Dodd-Frank has slowed as regulators and market participants struggle with the complexity of much of its provisions, the industry is moving ahead with some of its key requirements.Lee Olesky, chief executive of Tradeweb, said: “These trades clearly demonstrate the benefits market participants will derive from the electronic trading and processing of interest rate swaps. The new paradigm is just around the corner and we are delighted to be integrated with SwapClear in advance of derivatives regulation.”
645;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-07-26T09:04:34Z;CME seals futures deal with Osaka exchange;;CME Group, the US operator of futures exchanges and clearing houses, has agreed a “strategic arrangement” with the Osaka Securities Exchange that will see Osaka listing a yen-denominated version of the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures contract, one of CME’s main derivatives products.CME will in turn offer a “e-micro” – or small – futures contract based on the Nikkei 225 index – Osaka’s flagship derivatives contract, a version of which is also offered on SGX, the Singapore exchange.E-micro futures trade at a fifth of the size of the existing CME Nikkei 225 futures contract. Both products are expected to be offered by early 2012.The introduction of yen-denominated Dow futures will add to volume on the OSE as the bourse continues talks with the Tokyo Stock Exchange on a potential merger.A combination of the country’s two largest exchanges could kick start a much-needed domestic consolidation process and would bring together Japan’s largest cash and derivatives exchanges which would help cut costs.Atsushi Saito, chief executive of the TSE, told a press briefing on Tuesday that it was a bad idea to “dawdle” over deliberations between TSE and OSE over a potential merger. However, he declined to comment on how the talks are progressing and when a decision could be made.“Looking at the current global trends, it makes sense to have a combination of a derivatives exchange and cash,” Mr Saito said.It remains unclear what structure a merged entity could have, as well as how TSE might be valued, given that it has yet to list. The Tokyo exchange said in March it was preparing to list, but has not said when.The CME’s move with Osaka builds on a memorandum of understanding signed in 2008 to pursue opportunities jointly to develop products and services. CME has offered full-sized Nikkei 225 futures contracts since 1985.For CME the move is another sign that it is forging alliances with exchanges globally instead of trying to acquire or merge, as most of its main rivals – such as Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext – are doing.CME has sat on the sidelines amid a wave of exchange mergers, although most deals have collapsed either due to nationalist and protectionist opposition in the country of the target exchange, or as antitrust authorities have blocked deals.Chicago-based CME has quietly been building up its business outside the US – which still accounts for the bulk of its business.
646;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Cost of Treasury futures set to rise;;The cost of trading US Treasury futures was set to rise on Monday, as the CME Group adopted defensive measures given the impasse in Washington over raising the Federal debt ceiling.The operator of the US’s largest futures exchange said it had raised margin requirements on US government debt futures and its other products linked to US Treasuries after a “normal review of market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage”.US long dated Treasury yields rose on Monday as Washington failed to reach accord over raising the $14,300bn debt ceiling and averting a possible debt default by the US Treasury next week.“Although the debt ceiling has been a media and market participant focus point for the better part of the last two months, it is now crunch time as the August 2 deadline is fast approaching,” said George Goncalves, head of interest rate strategy at Nomura Securities. “In that sense the bond markets in the US will now have the debt ceiling decision and deficit reduction talks as its highest concerns over the next week and a half.”The margin changes by CME cover new trades as well as current positions and will take effect at the close of trading on Monday. Treasury futures track the broader Treasury bond market, and are used to hedge interest-rate risk as well as for speculative trades. The futures market is deep and liquid, and helps banks and investors manage their overall exposure and trading of government bonds.The cost of trading 10-year Treasury futures for hedging purposes will rise to $1,300 from $1,100, but will be below the $2,200 that was implemented in October 2008 amid the financial crisis. Speculative traders will pay a margin requirement on new 10-year T-note trades of $1,755 per contract, up from $1,485.“It is a defensive and prudent approach,” said John Brady, senior vice-president hedge fund sales at MF Global. “Margin costs are back to the middle of their recent range.”Late on Monday, the CME announced higher costs for clearing US Treasury, US government agency debt and foreign sovereign bonds issued by Canada, France, Germany, Sweden, and the UK.The rise in margins and clearing comes ahead of auctions of $99bn in new Treasury debt this week.Traders expect higher yields and lower prices for this week’s sale of $35bn two-year notes on Tuesday, followed by $35bn five-year notes on Wednesday and $29bn seven-year notes on Thursday. Last month’s debt sales were poorly received and sparked a sharp rise in Treasury yields at the end of June.“Auctions in this uncertain environment will likely require larger than average concession, offering a buying opportunity for those with a medium-term outlook,” said Mr Goncalves.
647;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;No future for Chicago pork belly contracts;;The frozen pork-bellies futures contract, a staple of Chicago’s commodity markets for a half century, was unceremoniously killed after traders abandoned it.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced its demise in a terse notice. “Because of a prolonged lack of trading volume and after significant discussion with industry participants, CME will be delisting frozen pork bellies futures and options” effective Monday, exchange parent CME Group said in a report to traders. said.Pork bellies, used to make bacon, were once an anchor product at the CME. Launched in 1961, the contracts were used by slaughterhouses and food companies hedging price risks and speculators taking a punt on price direction.As bellies futures predated the creation of financial futures, some traders also used them to protect against macroeconomic risks, said John Lothian, president of the electronic trading division at brokers Price Futures Group in Chicago.“In the early 1970s, there were people that used pork bellies as an inflation hedge,” Mr Lothian said.Volume and open interest in the contract peaked in the early 1980s, just before the Hollywood film Trading Places introduced the market to the general public.Since then, the bacon business has changed, with consumers eating more year-round, requiring less need for cold storage and so less need to hedge the frozen meat for sale in summertime.“People don’t put bellies into storage the way that they did. It’s all fresh bellies these days,” Mr Lothian said.CME was last year reportedly examining ways to revive the contract, including trades settled in cash rather than physical delivery.But open interest disappeared in February. In May, CME informed regulators it was deleting its list of storage warehouses approved to take delivery of the 40,000lb contract.Companies still hedge some pork costs with CME’s lean hogs futures contract. CME July lean hogs on Friday settled at 95.15 cents a pound, up 22 per cent from a year ago. Pork belly prices, as measured by the US Department of Agriculture, are about $1.30 a pound.Elsewhere in commodities, gold dipped from its record high on Friday as a surge in prices encouraged consumers from Asia to the US to sell their gold for scrap. Nonetheless, the yellow metal remained within reach of the psychological barrier of $1,600, trading on Friday at $1,588 a troy ounce, down from a nominal record of $1,594.16 touched on Thursday but still up 3 per cent over the course of the week. scrap.Nonetheless, the yellow metal remained within reach of the psychological barrier of $1,600, trading on Friday at $1,588 a troy ounce, down from a nominal record of $1,594.16 touched on Thursday but still up 3 per cent over the course of the week.The surge came amid a week of political and economic turmoil across much of the developed world, sending investors rushing to bullion as a means of protecting their wealth.Additional reporting by Jack Farchy
648;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-07-15T17:21:05Z;Interview: ICE passed on Cetip in 2009;Sprecher aims to license technology to Brazilian group;IntercontinentalExchange, the US exchange and clearing house operator, looked at taking a stake in Cetip as far back as 2009, when the Brazilian post-trade group received its first investment from the private equity firm that this week sold its stake to ICE.The disclosure, by Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, is a sign that Brazil’s financial market infrastructure was attracting the attention of many of the world’s large exchange operators earlier than many investors may have realised.CME Group, ICE’s main rival, signed a letter of intent in 2007 with BM&F, then Brazil’s standalone futures exchange, covering a proposed cross-investment between them.Mr Sprecher said that ICE had looked at Cetip in 2009 but that “it wasn’t the right time for us”.Since then, the Bovespa stock market index has risen by 135 per cent in dollar terms and 58 per cent in local currency terms.Late on Thursday, ICE said it had agreed to buy a 12.4 per cent stake in Cetip at R$25.50 a share or about $512m, from Advent International and some other smaller shareholders. Advent took Cetip public in October 2009. Advent sold a portion of the 32 per cent stake it acquired earlier that year in the company’s IPO and sold additional shares in a block trade in January this year.ICE will take a board seat on Cetip.Speaking to FT Trading Room, Mr Sprecher said Cetip was a logical move for ICE given growth in emerging market commodities businesses and that many Brazilian banks were already using it for their post-trade needs.“Our company’s been benefiting from emerging economies because of coffee, sugar, oil and emissions – in all of which demand has been going up. And of all of the ‘Bric’ countries, Brazil is the country where we felt like having a direct investment could have long-term benefits because of how far along they are in developing a financial services infrastructure,” Mr Sprecher said.Earlier this year, ICE said it was launching BRIX, an electricity futures market, in partnership with Eike Batista, Brazil’s richest manMr Sprecher said Cetip was “going to become an important player in Brazil and it’s an entrepreneurial entity that the banks have been using for their post-trade needs, so it felt like a very good fit with ICE”.“Cetip has been looking to license world class technology and deal with the rapid growth of its business. We have a lot of pre- and post-trade matching technology that we hope over time we can licence to them,” Mr Sprecher said. “Cetip’s shareholder registry contains a lot of the Brazilian banks so this gives us an opportunity to work directly with them to develop post-trade services.”Asked whether it was planned to develop cash equities clearing that could be used by competitors wanting to challenge the near-monopoly of BM&FBovespa, Mr Sprecher said that was “not a priority right now”.BATS Global Markets, the US exchange group, has teamed up with Claritas, a Brazilian asset management firm, to explore the launch of a low-cost exchange in Brazil.Cetip already has a relationship with Clearstream, the settlement and custody business owned by Deutsche Börse, as part of a Bric strategy that Clearstream is pursuing.Mr Sprecher and Bob Greifeld, the Nasdaq OMX chief executive, were forced to abandon a hostile counter-bid in April for NYSE Euronext, which had agreed to merge with Deutsche Börse.“Given that Deutsche Börse is tied up with its merger, it seemed to us to make sense to enter and take a board seat and work with [Cetip] management,” Mr Sprecher said, adding that he was comfortable with Cetip continuing to do business with Clearstream.
649;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-07-13T18:52:43Z;High-frequency traders slowed by headwinds;;In Aurora, a blue-collar town 35 miles south-west of Chicago, CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, is building a vast data centre that will enable thousands of customers to trade at lightning speed.When it opens next year, the 428,000 sq ft “co-location” facility will allow traders to place their computers next to the exchange’s matching engine, shaving a millisecond off trade execution times that are already measured in tiny fractions of a second. Traders will, in industry parlance, benefit from the “lowest latency” available.The facility is a powerful symbol of how high-frequency trading – in which computers trade automatically using algorithms at speeds faster than people can match – is reshaping the world of finance and how exchanges are doing their utmost to capture the business.Yet, while new and cheaper technology has enabled ultra-fast traders to grab greater market share, the cost of being the very fastest has been rising, to such a degree that only very big or highly specialised firms can afford to compete in the race to cut trading times by ever-smaller fractions of a second.Just a few firms, such as Chicago-based Getco, have deep enough pockets to stay ahead of the pack. For the rest, the importance of speed has begun to diminish. Most HFT traders have become less interested in getting deals done as fast as possible than in developing profitable strategies that predict at what levels the markets are likely to be trading.“We are seeing some high-frequency traders becoming old-fashioned quants,” says Jose Marques, head of global electronic equity trading at Deutsche Bank. Quant funds traditionally use computers to look for price patterns in trading.A natural development from the move since the 1980s from the open-outcry trading pits to electronic, screen-based trading, high-frequency trading (HFT) has come to play an increasingly dominant role in financial markets. It comprised more than 60 per cent of shares traded in US equity markets in 2009 and makes up much futures trading as well as a smaller proportion of the options market.The cost of launching a high-frequency strategy has fallen from more than $1m to $200,000 or less, says Jayesh Punater, chief executive of Gravitas, a trading services firm for start-up funds. Cloud computing has cut the costs of storage and linkage. NYSE Euronext has started offering virtual co-location services.“Once only certain people could afford a Ferrari. Now it’s available to everybody,” Mr Punater says.But, as trading has become faster, opportunities to make money using speed alone are drying up. Making a profit from the difference in speeds between trading systems is now very difficult with many funds making the same trades and exchanges upgrading their technology.Rajesh Nagella, head of algorithmic products for Europe at Citi, says: “There is already overcapacity in the speed game.” At the same time, trading by small retail investors, the most profitable to trade against since these quotes can be quite far from expected prices, has been light. There has been a net outflow of $16bn from US equity mutual funds this year to the end of June, according to the Investment Company Institute.The retail business that remains is also increasingly captured by institutional marketmakers such as Knight Capital, or by big banks such as Citigroup.“HFT is cannibalising itself, since it is driving out of the market the very traders it needs to feed off,” says Karim Taleb, of Robust Methods, a New York trading firm. In response, most traders are already turning to other strategies less dependent on speed.Increasingly, they are investing in technology that enables them to try to predict where markets will move. Cameron Smith, general counsel at Quantlab, a proprietary trading firm, says: “The reality is you need to have some sort of model that sees something that others don’t.”Many Chicago trading firms, which specialised in futures, are looking to extend into options and equities, where they can use their expertise in asymmetric trading, where dealers respond to news events such as Federal Reserve interest rate decisions.Traders have also moved further into agricultural commodities and metals futures markets.Some firms have indeed become more like ‘quant’ funds, leaving their computers to find patterns in trading, while investing more in human research – the judgment and experience of strategists – to obtain an edge. Ultimately, that could mean trading times slowing in mature markets over the coming years: from microseconds, to minutes, hours, and even days.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant
650;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-07-11T14:53:48Z;Eurex appoints new head of EEX;Peter Reitz to drive push into carbon auctions;Eurex, the derivatives trading venue, has named Peter Reitz the new head of the European Energy Exchange, the carbon trading platform it took control over earlier this year.Mr Reitz, who spearheaded Eurex’s first moves into carbon trading four years ago, will drive EEX’s push to operate the new central platform for carbon auctions in the European emissions trading scheme.The European Commission is preparing for a radical reshaping of carbon permit auctions in its flagship scheme in 2013 and wants its new central platform to be an exchange. EEX, the derivatives unit of Deutsche Börse, has has already registered its interest in running it while rivals such ICE Futures Europe, part of Intercontinental Exchange, and Green Exchange, owned by a mixture of banks, brokers and CME Group, are considering their plans.It is also looking to expand its operations around Europe and opened an office in London last month.Mr Reitz will retain his position as executive board member of Eurex, and begin his new role on August 1. He replaces Hans-Bernd Menzel, who quit the company he had led for eight years after Eurex took control.Eurex secured control over the platform in February when it agreed to buy the 22.96 per cent shareholding in EEX owned by Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, adding it to the 35.2 per cent of EEX it already owned. Eurex paid €7.75 per share, valuing the equity of EEX at just over €310m.Since Mr Menzel’s departure, the carbon trading platform had been run in the interim by Christoph Mura, chief operating officer, and Iris Weidinger, chief financial officer. They will retain their roles in the new management structure. Mr Reitz will also become chief executive of European Commodity Clearing (ECC), which provides post-trade services for energy derivatives trading.
651;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;CME to launch revamped renminbi-based futures;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, is stepping up its moves into international foreign exchange markets with a revamp of its futures contracts based on the Chinese renminbi.The contracts are an indication of the Chicago-based company’s deepening moves into Asia and illustrate its preference to stand on the sidelines of the industry’s increasingly patchy attempts to consolidate. While mergers proposed by rival exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange and SGX, the Singapore Exchange, run into protectionist sentiment and regulatory hurdles, CME has focused on expanding its business organically.They also come amid growing concerns that the exchange group faces substantial challenges to its dominant position in US markets. Last month Standard & Poor’s issued a negative outlook for CME, saying a competitive challenge by NYSE Euronext was “a credible threat” to its most important interest rate contracts.The Asia-Pacific region is becoming the centre of attention for CME after May’s launch of European clearing operations for energy derivatives. The group saw volumes during Asia-Pacific business hours rise more than 25 per cent in the first quarter, and last month it hired Julien Le Noble, the former head of Newedge’s Japan operations, to run its regional office from Singapore. That office has doubled in size to 30 people in a year and is looking to keep hiring.At the same time CME is looking to expand beyond its traditional commodities futures markets into areas such as foreign exchange, the world’s most liquid financial markets.The renminbi futures contracts will be quoted in interbank terms to reflect the number of renminbi per dollar and will launch on Monday August 22.“We see the success of these new contracts following a similar pattern to that of our other emerging markets products, such as Russian rouble and Brazilian real, which have seen year-to-date growth of 350 per cent and 450 per cent respectively,” said Roger Rutherford, FX products managing director at CME.The contracts will be cleared through the CME’s operations in Chicago but the exchange operator said it had yet to make a decision on whether to build a separate clearing house in Asia. The choice is likely to be between basing the business in Singapore and Hong Kong. A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, guaranteeing their obligations.However, CME is weighing the cost of opening another clearing house against a string of initiatives that either do not promise a return for several years or may not deliver a return at all. It also faces competition for clearing from the SGX, which will start to clear the non-deliverable forwards of emerging Asian currencies. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing is planning to launch clearing services by the end of 2012.

Judge Michael Mason ordered Mr Yang to be detained at his home with electronic monitoring.Mr Yang will plead not guilty to the charge of stealing trade secrets from CME Group, according to Christopher Graul, a public defender appointed to represent the accused computer programmer.Mr Yang, a 49-year-old naturalised American born in China, was apprehended last week following a two-month investigation by CME and the FBI.He allegedly downloaded proprietary software critical to CME’s business and planned, in emails with contacts in China, to use the code to establish a futures exchange in China and to sell trading software.The FBI said that “many of the downloaded files were critical to the operation of the CME Group and are considered proprietary in nature and contain protected source code”. CME has stressed that none of its data were compromised, and said it alerted the authorities and moved to sack Mr Yang as soon as it became aware of his activity.Mr Yang’s arrest by federal agents came days before he was allegedly planning to leave the US on a one-way flight to China. If convicted, he would face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.The case has shed more light on concerns about cybersecurity following several recent incidents in which Google, Sony and Citigroup have been targeted by hackers.
653;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-06-27T15:18:40Z;NYSE Liffe takes fight to ‘Fortress Chicago’;;The leading US futures exchange, CME Group, has at times sounded dismissive when talking about challengers to its dominance of the US interest rate futures business. It has a more than 95 per cent share of the market.When some of the world’s biggest banks – including JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs – backed a new electronic futures exchange in 2008 to challenge the near-monopoly, Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, dubbed the venture, known as ELX, “Ex-lax”, a well-known laxative.In recent weeks, though, CME’s tone has changed. That may have less to do with ELX, which has struggled to gain more than 3 per cent of the interest rate futures market, than NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext, the big US exchange operator.Three months ago, NYSE Liffe rolled out its own interest rate futures complex in the US and has rapidly gained a market share to rival that of ELX.The move marks the latest attempt to challenge “fortress Chicago”, whose dominance of this business has been the one constant in US exchange-traded futures since Chicago’s exchanges first developed interest rate futures in 1975.The unfolding battle between the financial exchanges of Chicago and New York might yet change that. A meaningful shift towards NYSE Liffe’s platform would inject significant competition into the biggest exchange-traded derivatives market. According to the Bank for International Settlements, turnover in US interest rate futures was $199,350bn in the first quarter, compared with $153,200bn in Europe.Michael Wong, analyst at Morningstar, says CME appears to be taking NYSE Liffe seriously, managing expectations of a possible hit to its interest rate business by emphasising the range of its products, from equity-index futures to commodities.“If the revenue from their interest-rate products were to trend downwards because of new competition, they can say there are other products out there that can take up the slack, that there are strong secular trends in the commodity markets,” Mr Wong says.Indeed, though the rivals are minnows, many in the industry see NYSE’s challenge as ominous for CME. Last week S&P issued a negative outlook for CME, saying NYSE Liffe US posed “a credible threat” to its interest-rate dominance.For a start, the challenger has the might of one of the world’s leading financial exchange groups behind it. NYSE Euronext’s proposed merger with Deutsche Börse, whose derivatives arm, Eurex, is CME’s main global rival, makes it a formidable opponent.But the most significant aspect of NYSE Liffe’s move is its attempt to lure traders by offering greater capital efficiency, rather than undercutting CME on price.In collaboration with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade services group that clears cash equities, the exchange group offers “one-pot margining” at New York Portfolio Clearing, its clearing house for Treasury futures. That enables dealers to post margin for both kinds of products in a “single pot”, allowing traders hedging their cash positions with futures to save on margin costs.Although interest rate trading volumes at NYSE Liffe US have grown faster than any other exchange start-up, the “single pot” is still relatively empty. The vast majority of trading so far has been in eurodollar futures, with low volumes in Treasuries – at a fraction of one per cent of the market.Eurodollar volumes have also trailed off in recent weeks – from about 3.5 per cent of the market (and up to 5 per cent on some days) to below 3 per cent – as Greece’s woes have left traders retreating to the deeper liquidity pools at CME.Tom Callahan, head of NYSE’s US futures business, says open interest has grown steadily and, even with low Treasury volumes, “one-pot margining” is showing its worth. He cites a client that was rebated $50m from its margin account.However, he says dealers want to see how the clearing house copes with its physical delivery cycle of Treasury securities, a process under way this week. That, Mr Callahan predicts, will give the market confidence and volumes will pick up.However, the clearing house us also being held back by the fact that it only offers one-pot margining for dealers, not clients. Mr Callahan says the company is currently working on a client solution that it hopes to put in place this year.Moreover, JP Morgan, which is thought to have the biggest Treasury repo book, is not participating in NYPC, which will limit clients’ ability to cross-margin with their repo positions.This means NYSE has so far depended primarily on price competition, not margin efficiencies, to build volumes, prompting some skepticism. “Lack of progress in Treasuries leads us to conclude that one-pot margining may not be attractive enough,” wrote Ken Worthington, an analyst at JPMorgan, in a recent research note.The fact that the newcomer has thus far not been able to take a bite out of CME’s trading volumes may also be because the Chicago-based incumbent has addressed the challenge head-on. Before NYPC launched, CME came out with its own plans for cross-margining between eurodollars and Treasury securities.The exchange says tests suggest the service will enable traders to save up to 65 per cent of their margin and is aiming to introduce the service in the third quarter.And CME is to take the battle with NYSE Liffe into its rival’s home territory. It announced plans this month to launch trading in euribor futures – NYSE Liffe’s flagship derivative contract – this year.Mr Callahan says there is room for both to prosper. Analysts argue that for NYPC to succeed it must gain at least 10 per cent market share in the near future. If it can make headway, it will become a foothold for a combined NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse to expand into the US.
654;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-06-24T09:04:43Z;S&P issues negative outlook for CME;;Standard and Poor’s issued a negative outlook for CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, saying that a competitive challenge by NYSE Euronext was “a credible threat” to its most important interest rate contracts.Although the ratings agency gave the outlook on Thursday while affirming CME’s the AA/A-1+ counterparty rating, it warned of a one third chance it could lower the ratings in the next six-24 months.Three months ago, NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext, launched trading in interest rate futures, attempting to break the CME’s near-monopoly over the sector: the Chicago-based exchange group controls more than 95 per cent of the market.NYSE Liffe is attempting to lure traders by offering greater capital efficiency, rather than simply undercutting CME on price, as previous efforts have attempted.In collaboration with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade services group that clears cash equities, the exchange group offers “one-pot margining” at New York Portfolio Clearing (NYPC), its clearing house for Treasury futures. That enables dealers to post margin for both kinds of products in a “single pot”, allowing traders hedging their cash positions with futures to save on margin costsNYSE Liffe US has gained about 3 per cent market share in eurodollars, CME’s flagship futures contract, although it has yet to capture more than a fraction of 1 per cent in US Treasury futures.The fledgling exchange’s eurodollar volumes have also trailed off in recent weeks – from about 3.5 per cent of the market (and up to 5 per cent on some days) to below 3 per cent – as Greece’s woes have left traders retreating to the deeper liquidity pools at CME.Nevertheless, S&P said NYSE Liffe US’s progress – which the exchange claims is the fastest growth of any new US exchange start-up – is “a credible threat to CME Group’s most important listed interest-rate contract”.“If CME Group loses a substantial portion of its market share in interest-rate products, the impact on its financial performance could be material, but not serious,” S&P wrote.S&P said it would take up to a year to determine the gravity of the challenge to CME’s dominance. “During the next six to 12 months, we should have a better idea whether NYSE Liffe US will continue to take market share from CME Group or will ultimately fade away like others before that tried, but failed, to break CME Group’s hegemony,” the ratings agency noted.Most analysts argue NYPC’s success depends on expanding its market share to at least 10 per cent in the near future S&P stated: “We could lower the ratings on CME Group if it loses significant market share in its flagship interest-rate products, which would hurt its business profile.”S&P also warned that CME’s competitive response to “one-pot margining” – creating a new class of membership for traders to benefit from cross-margining between eurodollars and Treasury securities – “could be an incremental credit risk” to its clearing house, since CME would not have control over the securities, and would be shifting responsibility to a clearing member, who would act as a guarantor for the trader. However, S&P said CME’s financial safeguards would nevertheless remain strong.In March, S&P placed CME on negative watch after the exchange announced plans for the “Financial Instruments Clearing Memberships” (FICM). CME has said FICM – which it plans to launch in the third quarter – will allow some firms to save up to 65 per cent on margin payments.
655;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-06-23T18:02:36Z;New circuit breaker rule under fire;;The much anticipated new circuit breaker mechanism for US equity markets, known as “limit up-limit down”, has come under fire by industry groups.The “limit up-limit down” proposal by the US’s largest exchanges was backed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year, hailed as superior to the initial circuit breakers approved last year following the “flash crash” last May.While the current system halts trading if a stock rises or falls a certain percentage, the “limit up-limit down” mechanism simply bars trading outside that range. If there are no trades inside the range after a short period of time, then trading is halted.The purported advantage is that the new breaker would make trading halts more predictable, and would not interfere as much with the market’s pricing mechanism.But in a series of comment letters filed on Thursday, several aspects of the new system have come in for criticism. Market participants also expressed concern about the sheer complexity of market rules following the “flash crash”, given that part of the underlying cause of the crash itself were poorly understood mechanisms.“The more complex the commission makes the market, the more likely it is that surprises like the flash crash will occur,” wrote Steve Wunsch, president of the Arizona Stock Market and former executive at the International Securities Exchange.“The remedies that have been enacted or are contemplated to address extraordinary volatility in the wake of the flash crash, including the ‘limit up-limit down’ plan, have ratcheted up complexity by an order of magnitude from anything we have seen before,” he wrote.Craig Donohue, chief executive of CME Group, wrote that the CME “has consistently argued that single security circuit trading halts that meaningfully interrupt price-discovery serve to exacerbate rather than remediate uncertainty”.The Securities and Financial Markets Association (Sifma), the US’s largest financial services industry group, wrote that the proposal could “inadvertently reduce market liquidity or otherwise introduce unintended and adverse consequences into the market”.The group said that the halts should not apply during the market close, arguing that they would “impede what otherwise would be a fair and accurate mechanism for determining an orderly closing price for a security”.It also said the mechanism should not be applied to any trades not reported to the consolidated tape, such as privately negotiated transactions.There was disagreement about the length of the amount of time prices could trade outside the band, known as the “limit state”.Gus Sauter, chief investment officer at Vanguard, an asset management group, said the 15 seconds proposed is “a short time threshold and will lead to an unnecessary number of trading halts”.Sifma, however, recommended that the period for new quotes to be entered once a price hits a limit should be 5 seconds, rather than the proposed 15 seconds.“The longer the period allotted for exiting a ‘limit state’, the greater the potential for uncertainty among market participants,” Sifma wrote.The Managed Funds Association, which represents hedge funds, said that the limits should not apply to “smaller, less-active instruments for which there is less prior experience from other markets”. They said it should only apply to S&P 500 and Russell 2000 companies.The US’s largest exchange operators, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, earlier this year told the FT that they would withdraw their own mechanisms if the “limit up-limit down” proposal was deemed suitable to replace them.Sifma said that the SEC should itself write the rule, rather than approving exchanges’ proposals, for that reason.
656;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-06-19T07:34:09Z;Dow Jones rolls out European indices;Indices will compete with Stoxx index business it used to part-own;Dow Jones Indexes on Monday will launch two indices that underscore its ambitions, and those of its parent, CME Group, for European expansion.Exchanges are increasingly focusing on indices as an alternative revenue stream and complement to their traditional listings businesses. The launch of the two European-focused indices also means Dow Jones will be competing directly with the Stoxx index business it used to part own.In December 2009 the German and Swiss exchanges, Deutsche Börse and SIX Group, became sole shareholders of Stoxx, when News Corp, owner of Dow Jones Indexes, sold its stake for $309m. In February last year, CME Group, the Chicago-headquartered exchange operator, bought 90 per cent of Dow Jones Indexes.The new indices are designed to cover a significant portion of Europe’s market capitalisation. The Dow Jones Eurozone Titans 80 Index represents 80 stocks listed in the eurozone. The Dow Jones Europe Titans 80 Index encompasses the wider European market.Jamie Farmer, executive director at Dow Jones Indexes, said: “This launch is the first of a series of planned rollouts in Europe that will allow investors to follow markets, strategies and themes of local interest. Europe represents a critical component in our strategic business plan and future.”
657;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;CME tilts at NYSE Liffe with euribor futures launch;;CME Group on Thursday turned the tables on NYSE Euronext in their battle in the futures markets by unveiling plans to offer trading in a version of euribor futures, NYSE’s flagship derivatives product.The move comes three months after NYSE Liffe, the futures arm of NYSE Euronext, started offering trading in eurodollar futures – the flagship contracts offered by Chicago-based CME Group.The tit-for-tat by two of the world’s largest derivatives exchange operators highlights how traders are forcing exchanges to offer products outside the confines of their home markets and instead on a global basis.It comes as interest rate futures are expected to see rising volume amid expectations of gradually rising interest rates. Years of record low interest rates have depressed euribor and eurodollar volumes, although those recently have started to pick up.CME said it would launch trading in euribor futures in the second half of this year. Such contracts are used by traders to hedge against or speculate on the euro interbank offered rate (euribor).NYSE Liffe dominates the market in euribor futures through its exchange in London. The contracts is by far its largest by volume and revenue generated. Similarly, the eurodollar contract at the CME is the US exchange’s largest.Robin Ross, CME’s managing director of interest rate products, said: “We have a global client base which trades global products so there is a need to build out our interest rate complex to include a suite of non-dollar products.“Clients are living in an environment where not all monetary policy in each area of the world is the same, so they want better access and a more diverse suite of products in the interest rate suite to trade.”Attempts by futures exchanges to challenge rivals in their flagship contracts rarely succeed as it is tough to shift “open interest” – trades outstanding at the end of a day – from the incumbent and its clearing house.NYSE Liffe in February launched eurodollar trading in competition with the CME, but has so far captured only 3 per cent market share. Ed Ditmire, analyst at Macquarie Securities, said: “We see incumbent futures exchanges as difficult to displace, and thus CME faces long odds. But this opens an exciting chapter for CME as an offensive minded competitor.”He estimated that NYSE Euronext earned $250m-$350m from its euribor complex in the past 12 months, with total revenues from European derivatives trading at about $600m.Interest rate derivatives are set to become more of a battleground between exchanges as a wave of over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps are shifted on to exchanges and other trading platforms under the Dodd-Frank act in the US and similar proposals emerging in Europe.Ms Ross said CME planned to launch clearing of euro-denominated OTC interest rate swaps in the US in the third quarter. “We’ll look to expand that into other currencies after that as part of diversifying into non-dollar denominated interest rates [contracts], not only on the listed side but in OTC.”
658;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-06-02T08:06:18Z;LCH.Clearnet hires Susan Milligan as US lobbyist;;"LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearing house, has poached a top government affairs specialist from The Options Clearing Corporation to be its first Washington-based lobbyist, people familiar with the matter said.Susan Milligan has been the Chicago-based options clearer’s eyes and ears in the US capital for years, and has been responsible for tracking the implementation of the Dodd-Frank’s provisions on clearing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives in the act. She will become head of US public affairs for LCH.Clearnet.The move by the London-based clearer comes as it has been focusing significantly more resources on the US as it rolls out a new clearing service in OTC interest rate swaps, in competition with CME Group.In addition to the launch, through its SwapClear service, LCH.Clearnet has added staff at its New York office, opened in 2009, bringing the total to 25. That included hiring a new head of sales and marketing, Floyd Converse, in January. The clearer has also moved its head of OTC risk and operations, Dan McGuire, to the US.The UK clearer is watching how the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission are coming up with final rules under Dodd-Frank on issues such as clearing house governance and membership.In his maiden testimony to the Senate banking committee in April, LCH.Clearnet’s chief executive Ian Axe highlighted three areas of concern regarding differences between the US and Europe in rules governing the mitigation of conflicts of interest at clearers; risk management requirements; and protection of cleared swaps.Mr Axe said LCH.Clearnet was concerned that proposals to impose ownership caps on clearing houses had re-emerged at the CFTC and SEC since passage of Dodd-Frank last year. The issue is of concern to LCH.Clearnet since 80 per cent of its shareholders are banks active in OTC derivatives.Ms Milligan also worked as a lawyer at the New York Stock Exchange, and has extensive experience dealing with Chicago’s futures exchanges. She starts work at LCH.Clearnet on Monday."
659;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-31T17:42:50Z;LME concerned about LCH.Clearnet ‘viability’;;The London Metal Exchange has warned that decisions by IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and NYSE Liffe to build their own clearing houses may undermine LCH.Clearnet’s “viability as a clearing house”.The commodities exchange is in talks with members about creating its own clearing house in a move that would bring it into line with rivals such as CME Group and ICE and give it control over launching new products. In doing so, the LME is considering splitting from LCH.Clearnet, the LME’s long-standing clearing house.It comes as LCH.Clearnet is being eyed by exchanges as wave of bourse consolidation sweeps up Europe’s largest independent clearing house. NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange have all tabled bids for the clearer in an effort to profit from sweeping post-crisis reform of the financial system, people familiar with the matter have told the FT. However the LSE has said it is not in any discussions with LCH.Clearnet about any transaction.In a statement to members explaining its reasoning, the LME said it was “concerned” by the effect of the decisions of ICE, NYSE Liffe and the LSE to self-clear.“With its diminishing exchange portfolio, LCH.Clearnet is focusing on the growing market in over-the-counter derivatives clearing. This could be to the detriment of those exchanges that remain,” said Chris Evans, head of business development.Alberto Pravettoni, managing director, corporate strategy at LCH.Clearnet, said: “LCH.Clearnet is committed to continuing to serve both exchange traded and OTC markets and we have invested significantly in our infrastructure in order to ensure we are best placed to do so.“As we stated on May 3, we value our relationship with the LME and shall continue to provide the LME and its members with an excellent service and the benefit of our unique experience in clearing for this complex market – we are a leader in commodities clearing globally. Market participants tell us they are looking for proven, efficient and consolidated clearing offerings. LCH.Clearnet is best placed to continue to deliver this.”A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, stepping in to ensure that a deal goes ahead even if one party defaults. Regulators in Washington and Brussels are keen for central counterparty clearing in the market in order to reduce the risk traditionally associated with such trades. The LME has not yet committed to a decision and has considered partnering with ICE Clear, CME Clear and other houses but self-clearing is its preferred option.“Preliminary discussions suggest that self clearing is achievable, could give the market a more efficient service and will place decisions about the exchange’s independence more firmly in the hands of LME shareholders,” Mr Evans told members.The LME added that its financial advisers have indicated it would have “little problem” raising debt finance to start a clearing house. However, it added: “if there was shareholder appetite for a rights issue to fund an LME-owned clearing house, this would be considered”.LCH.Clearnet collects some £10m annually in direct fees for clearing LME trades, the LME estimated. “Modelling done by the LME Executive and its consultants indicates that treasury revenue from members’ margin funds brings LCH.Clearnet a further return that is a multiple of the clearing fee income,” it said.Regulators have been keen to ensure that clearing houses do not become a potential new weak link in the financial system. The LME said work on the establishment of the size of a potential default fund had not begun. However it envisaged that there would be little change to LME clearing member default fund contributions as the contribution it would normally pay LCH.Clearnet would switch to a potential new LME-operated clearing house.The group added that it was recruiting a director of post-trade services but said the move to build the house was not part of larger plans to sell the exchange.
660;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-31T12:04:14Z;Quick View: Why LCH.Clearnet is in play;Control of the OTC space increases access to exchanges;To understand why LCH.Clearnet is a bid target, it helps to go back to a conversation in Chicago that took place after the stock market crash of 1987.As told in an excellent new book* on clearing by my former colleague Peter Norman, the chief executive of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Bill Brodsky, and Wayne Luthringshausen, chief executive of the Options Clearing Corporation, discussed the idea of “cross-margining”.Brodsky recalled that Luthringshausen called him after trading on October 19 about a member of his clearing house, a trading firm, that was having problems meeting margin payments on two sets of positions at once: on long positions in S&P 500 futures traded and cleared at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and a portfolio of options traded on the CBOE and cleared at the OCC.The two positions offset each other so that viewed as a single portfolio, the firm would not have to post margin at the CME’s clearing house as will as the OCC – saving money. The two men agreed – verbally – to allow cross-margining between their entities, in one of the first examples of the practice.Cross-margining involves calculating a single amount of margin, or cash payment, that a customer is required to put up against trades (to guarantee payment in the case of a default) where the trades concerned offset each other even though they may trade on separate markets.It is fast becoming a holy grail in the trading world.You only have to look at the New York Portfolio Clearing project backed by NYSE Liffe and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) to see this: a key part of their offering, and of their hope that they will compete successfully against CME Group of Chicago in futures, is by offering cross-margining between eurodollar interest rate futures and US Treasury bonds.Now add Dodd-Frank into the mix and you have a very interesting set of circumstances.Dodd-Frank – and its equivalent in Europe, “Emir” and Mifid” – require that swaths of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives onto exchange and other trading platforms. They are also to be cleared, where such contracts are sufficiently standardised to be cleared – which will be a lot of them.By far the biggest contracts in the frame are OTC interest rate swaps. They make up 77 per cent of the entire OTC derivatives market, according to International Swaps and Derivatives Association figures out this month.Now, LCH.Clearnet – through its SwapClear service operated with dealer banks – already clears far more interest rate swaps than anyone else. It has just launched a service aimed at “buyside” users of interest rate swaps in the US.We can safely assume that interest rate swaps are set to grow in volume as they are forced into electronic trading, either on an exchanges or “swap execution facilities”. That’s what happened when pit-traded futures contracts – like the eurodollar at the CME – shifted onto the electronic screen, in 2004.This means a whole bunch of products needing cleared that are economically not so different from the interest rate futures that are already traded on-exchange – like eurodollar futures at the CME and euribor futures on NYSE Liffe.This is where cross-margining comes in. Rather than have to post two sets of margin for each type of trade, the first exchange and clearing house to offer cross-margining between formerly OTC interest rate swaps and the existing futures contracts at the short end of the yield curve, is onto a winner.Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman, a consultancy, say the move to clearing generally will create an available “pool” of clearing revenues of about $1bn by 2013, more than double the pool in 2009-12CME is already onto this. It launched in October last year a clearing service with some of the big dealer banks for interest rate swaps. It already has its own clearing house, and it well-positioned to offer cross-margining between US interest rate swaps and its flagship eurodollar future.Yet LCH.Clearnet is only a clearing house and doesn’t have the trading piece on top. Bring in NYSE Liffe and – presto – you have the whole shebang. Customers can be offered massive savings through cross-margining their trades in the interest rate swaps with euribor futures on Liffe.Now assume that the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse merger goes ahead. Clearing of Liffe products will shift from London to Eurex Clearing in Frankfurt. One of the key attractions of the merger is – according to the two exchanges – the margin efficiencies offered by slamming together Liffe’s products at the short end of the yield curve with the Eurex products at the long end.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, recently put this at $3bn in savings for customers (although I slightly wonder whether this figure wasn’t plucked out of thin air).Add in the cross-margining with the formerly OTC interest rate swaps, and you can see how compelling owning LCH.Clearnet then becomes. This, in short, explains why LCH.Clearnet is in play.Effectively, it all comes down to one thing: exchanges believe that whoever controls the OTC space will increase their ability to control the exchange space.Whether the banks – in particular the SwapClear banks at LCH.Clearnet – will allow this vision to play out, remains to be seen.Let the games begin.* The Risk Controllers: Central Counterparty Clearing in Globalised Financial Markets, John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.
661;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;Exchanges: Dodd-Frank act drives tie-ups and innovation;;The world’s exchanges must be exhausted. It was scarcely a decade ago that many of the largest groups – including the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange – became public companies.A few years later, a wave of consolidation began within and across national borders, as they sought scale to cut costs and fend off electronic upstarts.Now, another wave has overtaken them, and it may be the most significant yet.Exchanges are engaged in another round of mergers partly to take advantage of the most recent big change: in the wake of the financial crisis, there is a global effort to regulate over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, a $600,000bn market in notional value traded annually.“For the future of exchanges, the capacity to create new derivative possibilities is huge,” says Georges Ugeux, a former exchange executive and chairman of Galileo Global Advisors, a consultancy.“Without that, it becomes extraordinarily difficult to figure out exactly how to make money in the long run,” he adds.The most notable example is the proposed NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse tie-up. The two have made derivatives the core logic of their combination, with a key target the OTC market, that makes up 89 per cent of notional values, globally.“The most volume in [the] derivatives business is OTC,” said Reto Francioni, chief executive of Deutsche Börse at the initial conference laying out the deal. “And I think together we are much stronger to tackle the whole OTC market in the trading area but also in the clearing area.”In addition to creating an enormous European futures exchange on the scale of the US’s own giant, the CME Group, which combined the “Merc” with the Chicago Board of Trade, it would also bring Deutsche Börse’s Eurex, and its clearing and settlement businesses, closer to the US market.Those groups could become important cogs in a new market structure that will see more derivative trades – such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and other products – taking place in centralised market places.The driving force is the US Dodd-Frank reform laws, which require that standardised derivative products be centrally cleared. The Tabb Group, a research company, estimates that 90 per cent of OTC derivatives could need to be cleared in the wake of the reforms.To be cleared safely, and in volume, many contracts will need to be simplified. The increasing cost of OTC trading will also make exchange-based products that hedge against credit, interest rate and currency risks more competitive.Andy Nybo, a senior analyst at Tabb Group, says that notional value in the most liquid markets, such as interest-rate swaps, could easily see more trading on exchanges.But less-liquid markets, such as credit-default swaps, or markets that trade via dealers, such as currencies, will be more challenging.“The hard parts are figuring out clearing margins and building liquidity. Replicating the size of the market on an exchange will be a huge undertaking, especially considering that the biggest players in the world, the banks, trade in such large size they just aren’t liquid,” he says.Some of the exchanges’ efforts are already quite mature.The clearing houses owned by the futures exchanges (CME and the IntercontinentalExchange) will be central to market structure. ICE launched ICE Trust, a clearing house for credit default swaps, in 2008, and leads the market in volumes.CME Group’s Clearport already serves as the clearing backbone for several credit and rate swap products, including those of CME and competitors, for example the Eris Exchange – launched by several marketmaker hedge funds.NYSE Euronext has launched NYSE Liffe US, a futures exchange, that uses its own clearing function, New York Portfolio Clearing, to clear Treasury futures and eurodollar swaps in the same account, reducing costs for traders.“The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for these exchange mergers is being able to cross-margin positions across asset types,” says Mr Nybo.For now, many efforts are still modest. Nasdaq OMX has co-ownership of the International Derivatives Clearing Group, which will clear interest-rate swaps, though it has so far attracted only a small sliver of the market.Since its launch this year, NYSE Liffe US has taken a 5 per cent market share in eurodollar futures.The exchanges are not alone in moving to trade OTC contracts.US regulators have also created a new category of trading venue, called a swap execution facility, or SEF, that will handle markets with modest volume or that are not traded electronically.That market is expected to be dominated by interdealer brokers such as Icap, Tullett Prebon, BGC and GFI.But innovation may be a powerful tool.Start-up exchanges, such as Eris or Plus-DX, launched by the UK market data provider Plus Markets, have created new products. Eris’s contracts are designed to replicate the cash flow of an OTC swap. Plus-DX will trade index-based swaps.It is the opportunity – and the peril – for exchanges that no one knows yet which products will be successful.
662;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;New front opens in battle of exchanges;;"A gigantic game of chess has been playing out between the world’s exchanges for the past few months.The owner of the New York Stock Exchange – NYSE Euronext – is pursuing a merger with Germany’s Deutsche Börse and was until recently fighting a counterbid for NYSE from rival Nasdaq OMX and another US exchange known as ICE.The London Stock Exchange is pushing an agreed merger with TMX Group, operator of Canada’s exchanges, in the face of a counter-bid for TMX from a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds.But now the action is moving to the arcane business of clearing.LCH.Clearnet, one of the world’s largest clearing houses, confirmed at the weekend it had “various proposals indicating an interest in pursuing some form of possible business combination or other co-operation”.People familiar with the matter say LCH.Clearnet recently received three bids – from NYSE Euronext and Markit, a UK financial information company; Nasdaq; and from the LSE – valuing the business at €350m-€1bn ($500m-$1.4bn).Since then the LSE has distanced itself, saying it is “not engaged in any discussions with LCH regarding a possible transaction”.The London-based clearer is a product of the merger in 2003 of the London Clearing House and Clearnet, a Paris clearer. It clears cash equities for the LSE as well as commodities, energy, freight, repos and – the big attraction for any bidder – off-exchange, or over-the-counter, derivatives.This shows that the wave of exchange mergers is being driven as much by growing exchanges as by capitalising on post-financial crisis regulatory reforms forcing greater use of clearing in key markets.A clearing house stands between parties in a trade, ensuring that a deal is completed even if one side defaults. More clearing in the OTC derivatives markets is a key part of G20 reforms aimed at preventing another crisis, and is enshrined in the Dodd-Frank act in the US.Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman, a consultancy, say this will create an available “pool” of clearing revenues of about $1bn by 2013, more than double the pool in 2009-12.LCH.Clearnet is well positioned. It runs, with OTC dealer-banks, a service called SwapClear that has been clearing interest rate swaps since 1999.Pre-tax profits at LCH.Clearnet last year fell 80 per cent to €32.3m, while revenues were 39 per cent lower at €553.6m. Clearing fees from equities fell by 26.9 per cent to €44.3m. But revenue from clearing OTC derivatives rose more than 26 per cent to €21.2m.The International Swaps and Derivatives Association puts the notional value of OTC derivatives contracts outstanding at about $601,000bn as of December, of which 77 per cent is interest rate swaps.Industry experts say the opportunity to clear swaps will only grow as they shift from being negotiated bilaterally in large contracts to traded electronically on exchanges and other platforms, since this will slice orders into smaller sizes – increasing volume.Exchanges with clearing houses are already jostling to capture this business, with CME Group launching last year and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing also preparing a service.SwapClear launched a rates clearing service in the US in February. Nasdaq OMX hopes to compete through International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearer set up a year ago. But it has gained little traction, which may explain its interest in LCH.Clearnet.NYSE Euronext’s choice of Markit reflects the importance of regulators’ desire to see derivatives data that flow from trading and clearing made more transparent as well. Yet structuring any deal will be delicate. Any acquisition of LCH.Clearnet risks removing from the industry the only remaining derivatives clearer that is not controlled by an exchange, with trading and clearing integrated in a “vertical silo”.Market participants complain that silos – such as CME and Deutsche Börse – give their owners undue market power and fret that this will only increase as consolidation deepens.LCH.Clearnet is a not-for-profit utility owned by 98 shareholders, from banks and other market participants – which own 83 per cent – to NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange, with the rest.Any acquirer would face complex talks with the SwapClear banks, which take most of the revenues from OTC clearing, with LCH.Clearnet earning a fee. LCH.Clearnet cautioned its “considerations are at a preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that these proposals will result in any transaction”."
663;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-28T11:17:19Z;Exchanges fight for LCH.Clearnet;;Three of the world’s largest exchanges have entered a battle for control of LCH.Clearnet as a wave of exchange consolidation sweeps up Europe’s largest independent clearing house, three people familiar with the matter said.The move for the London-based clearer, between NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, is a sign that the world’s bourses are desperate to snap up businesses that allow them to profit from sweeping post-crisis reform of the financial system.All three bourses tabled bids ranging from €350m ($500m) to €1bn at a board meeting held two weeks ago.LCH.Clearnet confirmed on Saturday that it had “received various proposals indicating an interest in pursuing some form of possible business combination or other co-operation with LCH.Clearnet”.“LCH.Clearnet’s considerations are at a preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that these proposals will result in any transaction,” the London-based clearer said.The LSE has offered €21 a share for LCH.Clearnet, valuing it at €1bn, one person said. However, the LSE on Saturday distanced itself from any move, saying it noted “recent press speculation” regarding it and LCH.Clearnet and “confirms that it is not engaged in any discussions with LCH regarding a possible transaction”.Clearing houses have long been part of the unglamorous back office processes that ensure deals are completed in shares, binds and derivatives and bonds.But they have shot to prominence amid financial reforms designed to clean up the financial system after the 2008 financial crisis. Such reforms, enshrined in the Dodd-Frank act in the US and similar European proposals will force over-the-counter derivatives on to exchanges and through clearing houses to make such markets more transparent.A clearing house stands between buyers and sellers, stepping in to ensure a deal is completed if one party defaults. The London clearer was formed from a merger in 2003 between the London Clearing House and Clearnet, clearer for the Paris Bourse.All three bidders want control of LCH.Clearnet since it operates, with big banks, a clearing service for OTC interest rate swaps called SwapClear, which recently pushed into the US to compete with CME Group, the US exchange, in derivatives clearing. Interest rate swaps are the largest part of the OTC derivatives market and are set for growth, market experts believe, as they are pushed on to electronic platforms by the reforms.One person said LCH.Clearnet had not yet responded formally to any of the offers. “It’s very fluid and nobody knows. The board’s gone away to think about it,” the person said.The board is made up of 21 people, including Ian Axe, former chief operating officer for Barclays Capital, who became chief executive in February. At the time of his appointment, he said: “As the market leader in OTC clearing and with expertise in a broader range of assets than any other clearing house globally, LCH.Clearnet is well placed to benefit from the worldwide drive to reduce systemic risk.”Ownership of a clearing house boosts revenues at exchange but also gives them quasi-monopoly control of derivatives trading and clearing and locking out competitors in so-called “vertical silos”. Derivatives are growing faster than equities, with certain benchmark futures contracts – a popular type of derivative – among the fastest-growing of them.For the LSE, one of the few exchanges not to own a domestic clearer, the move was described by a second person as “a survival move” to get deeper into clearing as rivals Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext pursue a $9.4bn merger. That deal, if consummated, would bring together the Börse’s Eurex futures exchange with NYSE Euronext’s London-based Liffe futures exchange, with clearing being concentrated at Eurex Clearing, owned by the Börse.The LSE is next month set to launch an assault against Eurex and Liffe in futures, with clearing to be carried out at LCH.Clearnet and an Italian clearing house operated by the LSE through its ownership of Borsa Italiana, Italy’s main exchange operator.Shares in the LSE soared more than 10 per cent this week to their highest level in three years amid speculation that Nasdaq might make its second attempt since 2006 to buy the British bourse.The LSE is in the midst of a separate battle against a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds as it pursues an agreed merger with TMX Group, operator of the Tornonto Stock Exchange and Montreal derivatives exchange.Nasdaq OMX has tabled a bid that would value LCH.Clearnet at €350m, the first person said. “The offer’s a bit low and complicated,” that person said, referring to how Nasdaq has proposed to include in its cash offer the existing clearing businesses it owns in Europe.Nasdaq’s talks with LCH.Clearnet started about six weeks ago, just before Bob Greifeld, the exchange’s chief executive, was forced to abandon an audacious joint bid with InterContinentalExchange for NYSE Euronext, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, after it failed an antitrust test. “It gets Nasdaq more firmly into Europe,” one person close to the Nasdaq bid said. “But this is not a deal that needs to be done.”Nasdaq declined to comment.Mr Greifeld said last week at Nasdaq’s shareholder meeting that the company would be “maniacally focused on executing our business plan and at the same time ensuring that we are strategically positioned for emerging growth opportunities”.A move for LCH.Clearnet would secure Mr Greifeld a major presence in clearing of cash equities and OTC derivatives in London, at a time when an existing US OTC derivatives clearer he controls, International Derivatives Clearing Group (IDCG), has failed to gain traction in interest rate swaps. It has secured only a few members of the clearing house, meaning it has too few members that would be able to bring it OTC derivatives trades from customers using them that need them to be cleared.LCH.Clearnet already has a thriving interest rate swaps business at SwapClear in London and recently launched such a service aimed at non-banks users of interest rate swaps in the US, which competes with a service also recently launched by CME Group.NYSE Euronext has teamed up with Markit, a financial information company specialising in OTC derivatives, in a €10 a share bid that values LCH.Clearnet at under €500m, the first person said.Markit is involved in the pricing and dissemination of data in the OTC derivatives markets, which are also a focus of regulators as they insist that such data be more formally organised, electronically, to provide pricing more transparently to markets and to help build an “audit trail” of trades that can be easily seen by regulators.However, a takeover of LCH.Clearnet would be complicated because it has 98 shareholders, including NYSE Euronext with 9 per cent and the London Metal Exchange with 8 per cent.In addition, the banks involved in the OTC derivatives clearing business that falls under the SwapClear service must give their consent to any change in control that affects SwapClear. Many of those banks – including JPMorgan and Barclays Capital – are on the LCH.Clearnet board.The banks share revenues from the SwapClear service with LCH.Clearnet as part of a complex arrangement. They are seen as unlikely to be in favour of selling to an exchange unless on terms that secure their ongoing involvement in OTC derivatives clearing.This is the third time since 2008 that LCH.Clearnet has been faced a possible change in ownership or takeover bid. The first came that year when The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US clearing and settlement group, agreed a merger with LCH.Clearnet, to create a transatlantic clearing group.That deal collapsed after the emergence of a consortium of 11 banks – many of the same ones affiliated with the SwapClear service – joined forces with Icap, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, in 2009 for a €11 a share cash offer valuing the UK clearer at about €830m.
664;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
665;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Thomson Reuters launches trade confirmation service;;Thomson Reuters is stepping up efforts to push into services associated with electronic trading of over-the-counter derivatives with a new trade confirmation service, and has signed up the clearing houses of SGX and CME Group as its first customers.The development is a sign that market participants – from trading platforms to clearing houses – are moving ahead with the creation of new market infrastructure before the regulations governing them have been fully completed.The Group of 20 major economies has committed to regulating the vast OTC derivatives markets by forcing as many derivatives trades as possible on to regulated exchanges and other electronic trading platforms and ensuring they are processed through clearing houses. A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, ensuring that deals are completed even of one party defaults.However trades must be legally confirmed before being cleared. The Thomson Reuters venture will provide legal confirmation of trades and send details of executed trades to clearing houses, trades repositories and regulators in real-time. SGX, operator of the Singapore exchange, and CME Group, the US futures exchange owner, have signed up to the service.Rich Kiel, head of post-trade services at Thomson Reuters, told FT Trading Room that the group was in talks with several other large US, European and Asian clearing houses.He said the group was trying to be compliant with the as-yet undefined rules governing trading of derivatives. Regulators in the US and Europe are still finalising the details to the broad principles agreed by policymakers. Thomson Reuters’s move, however, echoes moves in the market to launch their new derivatives infrastructure.Icap, the interdealer broker, has seen 41 banks transact more than 4,300 trades and €360bn ($513bn, £319bn) worth of trades on its new electronic broking platform while SGX is already clearing interest rate swaps in Asia and CME Group has begun commodities clearing in Europe.Mr Kiel added that the platform could be used either as trade matching service or simply be used to connect from their own compliance departments to clearing houses.Muthukrishnan Ramaswami, president of the Singapore exchange said the venture would allow it to offer clearing services for Asian foreign exchange derivatives.
666;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Rate swap volumes set to surge on new system;;Volumes in the interest rate swaps market are set to surge as regulatory reforms push the bulk of contracts currently traded over-the-counter onto electronic platforms.Icap, the world’s largest interdealer broker, and Tabb Group, a consultancy, predicted the Dodd-Frank act in the US and similar reforms of OTC derivatives in Europe would transform the interest rate swaps market – largely voice-brokered – into one with a far broader range of investors.The prediction echoes what market observers said in the 1980s when futures contracts moved from pit trading to electronic dealing at the US. That sparked a huge rise in volumes, turning them into among the most traded financial instruments in the world.While the OTC derivatives market is large in terms of notional value of trades done, trading volume is low relative to the exchange-traded futures market.Both the Dodd-Frank act and European reforms require standardised OTC derivatives be traded on exchanges or new types of trading platform, known as “swap execution facilities” in the US. Most of those platforms are expected to be electronic.Interest rate swaps are the largest OTC derivatives market, dwarfing the credit default swaps market.Mark Yallop, chief operating officer at Icap, said large deals would be done in smaller sizes. “Probably in a couple of years’ time, the standard electronic interest rate trade will be worth $5m rather than the $100m that it is at the moment. And there will be 100,000 of them happening, or 250,000 of them happening.”John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, said electronic trading would “democratise the business, making it a much more level playing field”.The US and European reforms also require that OTC derivatives, where possible, be processed through clearing houses to help safeguard the system against large defaults. A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, ensuring that the trade is completed if one side defaults.In a report, Tabb said: “Mandated central clearing and reporting requirements for interest rate swaps will foster a more transparent marketplace, with concentrated liquidity in standardised instruments developing over time.”On Thursday the latest initiative in electronic interest rate swaps trading came as Eris Exchange, a Chicago-based platform backed by proprietary trading firm DRW Trading, and others, launched an electronic platform for interest rate swap futures, with clearing done at at CME Group.
667;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-17T01:48:36Z;CME launches forex swaps clearing;;CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, launched clearing for over-the-counter foreign exchange transactions by offering clearing for contracts on the US dollar versus the Chilean peso.The move is the first in the sector after the industry received a big boost last month when the US Treasury granted foreign exchange swaps an exemption from sweeping new rules regulating derivatives, following years of intense lobbying by dealers and users of the contracts.Craig LeVeille, CME’s director of forex products, characterised the offering on Monday as a “first step” in the exchange group’s plan to provide clearing for a wide range of foreign exchange contracts.“Chile has a strong economy generating large investment exposures to foreign assets,” Mr LeVeille said. “Local institutions can use our clearing service to mitigate the growing credit constraints they face when hedging currency risks, and this should lead to a boost in liquidity and an expansion in cross-border activity.”CME has focused on developing its clearing business to cater for over-the-counter trading, offering clearing for credit derivatives and interest-rate swaps. Adoption of those services has been hampered by continuing regulatory uncertainty – something that should not affect foreign exchange swaps as a result of the exemption.The exchange group’s push into OTC clearing comes as its traditional business is becoming more competitive than ever, with a head-on attack from NYSE Euronext on its dominance of the interest-rate futures market.NYSE Liffe US, the fledgling US futures exchange operated by NYSE Euronext, gained more than 5 per cent of the Eurodollar futures market on Friday. The two-month-old venture aims to attract traders by offering “one-pot margining” for Treasury futures and cash Treasuries, in effect enabling traders hedging their cash positions with futures to save on margin costs.Tom Callahan, NYSE Liffe US chief executive, said the Eurodollar futures market share figure was boosted by a block trade of 50,000 contracts, which he said had saved the customer $90,000 on the transaction compared to what would have been paid in standard non-member fees at CME.
668;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-16T19:29:53Z;Chill wind blows over plans for market mergers;;Another day, another global exchange merger turns to dust.The withdrawal by Nasdaq OMX of its audacious counter-offer, in partnership with Intercontinental-Exchange, for NYSE Euronext is as stunning for its timing as well as for falling a day after another exchange combination was all but scuppered.The London Stock Exchange is licking its wounds after a consortium of Canadian financial institutions on Sunday tabled a C$3.6bn ($3.7bn) bid for TMX, which had earlier agreed a tie-up with the British exchange.So, with the failure of the Singapore exchange’s takeover of the Australian exchange only five weeks ago, was the much-vaunted wave of exchange consolidation merely a gigantic spasm of executive hubris?After all, for Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, it rankled that his crosstown rival Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, had managed to pip him to a deal by tying up with Deutsche Börse.“We are moving into a period where any deal is going to be hard to get off the ground. This will really test the mettle of CEOs and differentiate between those who thrive on buzz of deal-making versus those with the real strategic vision to grow their organisations organically,” said Niki Beattie, managing director of The Market Structure Practice, a consultancy.More importantly, it may even be the wrong time for exchange consolidation to be taking place.In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, regulators and market participants are struggling to figure out how market structures – exchanges, trading venues, clearing houses and banks – should best be built for a post-crisis world.They know they must be run in a way that safeguards both the stability of the financial system to prevent another crisis, but also allows enough competition to keep markets liquid and functioning smoothly. The question is: does allowing structures like exchanges to get bigger and more powerful achieve that balance?That tension is causing uncertainty as market participants wait for regulators in the US to implement the Dodd-Frank act on over-the-counter derivatives and clearing houses, and as Europe grapples with similar issues.“Everyone’s struggling with putting the right regulations in place for future market structures and until those are squared away it’s going to be difficult to do any cross-border deals, particularly these megamergers,” said Robert Hegarty, global head of market structures at Thomson Reuters.Crucially, there are signs that antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have concerns about the bulking up of certain businesses and the market power they appear to have.A few weeks ago the European Commission launched a sweeping probe into the arrangements that ICE has with leading banks in OTC derivatives for the clearing of credit default swaps at its clearing house in London. The concern is possible abuse of a dominant market position, since ICE has built the clearing service in a revenue-sharing partnership with dominant dealers in OTC markets.Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said on Monday: “Competition control should ensure that the actual evolution of the market does not lead to structures that harm users and legitimate market participants. In particular, we should prevent that any one entity or group controls essential infrastructure – be it a trading platform, a clearing platform or a pre-trading service – to the benefit of a restricted few.”In the US the failure of Nasdaq’s proposed merger with NYSE to pass antitrust tests is another sign of increased scrutiny.It stands in contrast to the approval that the justice department gave for the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade in 2007, even as that created a near-monopoly in US futures trading, showing that US antitrust watchdogs are paying close attention too.Matthew Cantor, a partner at US law firm Constantine Cannon, said: “I think that in the last six months the [US] antitrust authorities have really stepped it up a notch and are shown they will be a vigorous force.”That may complicate matters for the only exchange merger left that has not run into trouble: NYSE Euronext’s agreed tie-up with Deutsche Börse which Mr Greifeld had been attempting to break up.It faces a deep and lengthy probe by Mr Almunia’s department, which is likely to study plans to combine the Börse’s Eurex futures business with Liffe, NYSE Euronext’s London-based futures exchange. This would create a near-monopoly in European futures markets, with clearing of futures contracts all taking place at the German group’s clearing house.Mr Almunia, speaking at the Cass Business School at the City University London, did not address the German-US tie-up. But he said: “Lack of competition is always a red line.”
669;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-12T18:49:08Z;Fears over effects from clearing reforms;Such structures have significant power in markets;New regulations in Europe that push over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives into clearing houses must not reinforce monopolies in the clearing business, otherwise the wider economy will suffer, a British government minister has warned.The comments, by Mark Hoban, financial secretary to the Treasury, are a sign of growing unease in London over a trend gathering pace globally for exchanges to have their own clearing houses in a so-called vertical silo.Such structures have significant power in markets because control over clearing, on top of trading of financial instruments such as derivatives, makes it hard for rivals to compete.Such concern over silos is growing because the current wave of exchange mergers would strengthen some of the biggest silos, including the planned merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext.The issue has become a hot topic as officials at the European Commission grapple with how to ensure competition in derivatives clearing in Europe’s OTC derivatives reforms.The Commission is working on a draft of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), which is Europe’s equivalent of the Dodd-Frank Act in the US. It mandates clearing of standardised OTC derivatives and will create new rules for how clearing houses, or central counterparties (CCPs), are to function and be authorised by regulators.Mr Hoban said: “But we must not allow new standards for CCPs, combined with a legal obligation to clear derivative products, to embed monopolies in clearing that will result in costs passing back to the wider economy.”“To prevent this, our view is that, while linked structures – so called vertical silos – can be effective, they must be subject to fair and open access requirements,” he told a conference organised by Markit, a derivatives data company.Proponents of vertical silos, which include Deutsche Börse and CME Group, the US exchange operator, say that vertical silos are efficient and that derivatives traders like the fact that they offer a single pool of liquidity in key derivatives contracts, offering more opportunities to get deals done at keener prices.In the latest draft of Emir, circulating among EU member states, a clearing house that has been authorised to clear [OTC] derivative contracts “shall accept clearing such contracts on a non-discriminatory, and transparent, basis, regardless of the venue of execution”.Mr Hoban said: “Market participants should be offered a meaningful choice of using all or part of a vertical structure.”www.ft.com/tradingroom
670;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-09T15:19:51Z;EU states in clearing houses authorisation push;;Foreign clearing houses wanting to operate in the European Union would be authorised by EU member states’ national regulators and not by the regions’ powerful new markets regulator, according to a joint UK-German amendment to draft European Commission proposals for derivatives market reforms.The UK-German intervention on the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) is one of the most significant since the document was first published in mid-December.It highlights concern in the two EU member states with the largest clearing houses that the power to authorise the operations of clearers remains with national regulators and not move to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the new Paris-based watchdog.London is home to five “recognised clearing houses” – LCH.Clearnet, ICE Clear Europe, CME Clearing Europe, Euroclear UK & Ireland and European Central Counterparty – as well as seven “recognised overseas clearing houses”, including Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia, the Borsa Italiana clearer, SIX x-clear and The Chicago Mercantile Exchange.The amendment comes under a chapter of Emir dealing with “Relations with third countries”. It was inserted by the British and German governments.It says: “A CCP [central counterparty] established in a third country may provide clearing services to clearing members and their clients established in the Union only where that CCP is recognised by the competent authority of a Member State in which a CCP intends to provide clearing services or activities”.The move is an apparent attempt to ensure that London and Frankfurt retain the power to authorise which clearing houses are based there, and will stir intense political debate between member states.It comes as a flurry of changes are being made to Emir and to an accompanying document working its way in parallel through the European Parliament’s Economic Committee, or “Econ Committee”, chaired by British MEP Sharon Bowles.Another change included in the latest draft of the Econ Committee’s document for the first time addresses the issue of indices, or benchmarks, which include the Euro Stoxx and FTSE 100 indices. Emir, by contrast, does not address indices.That is becoming a controversial issue as the London Stock Exchange and LCH.Clearnet have been frustrated in their attempts to licence the Euro Stoxx index, owned by a company controlled by Deutsche Börse.A new “Article 48a” has been inserted into the document, and says: “A CCP shall have the right to non-discriminatory access to the data feed of any particular trading venue and access to any relevant settlement system that it needs for the performance of its duties”.Both Emir and the Econ Committee document were supposed to be finalised by the summer, although the number of amendments and complexities thrown up means they are unlikely to be finalised until after the summer when Poland takes the EU presidency, Brussels lobbyists say.
671;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-06T15:44:06Z;Commodities: epic rout;Worst sell-off in some cases since Lehman;The Latin words com (with) and modus (measure) evolved, via French, into the separate English nouns commodity and commode. The latter definition comes to mind after Thursday’s epic rout that, according to scuttlebutt, not only saw billions of dollars go down the drain but probably buried some funds and individual investors in a blizzard of margin calls. It was the worst sell-off for many commodities since the collapse of Lehman Brothers and, in dollar terms, the biggest ever for Brent crude.But why exactly did it happen? Earlier in the day, Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank president, signalled that an interest rate rise was unlikely next month, sparking a rapid 2 per cent rally in the dollar versus the euro. Other markets twitched, but at the margin this news should have been good for commodities. More likely, pressure had simply been building. This year’s hottest commodity, silver, up 57 per cent through Friday, had already began to slide after CME Group raised margins over the weekend.It really does not matter what started it, though. The notion that commodities were a one-way bet tied substances that had little to do with one another – industrial ones such as oil and copper, renewable ones such as wheat and corn, and those with largely intrinsic value such as silver and gold – to the same fate. Since the announcement last summer of a second round of quantitative easing, owning things rather than the pieces of paper in which their value was denominated, seemed, as traders say, a “no brainer”.Notwithstanding Thursday’s sell-off, cash may yet underperform hard assets. That will be small solace to those who thought making money in commodities was child’s play and have no funds left to invest. As that simple children’s game suggests, sometimes paper beats rock.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
672;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-06T09:40:23Z;Lessons for exchanges in oil’s ‘flash crash’;Crude price rout has damaged the reputation of the oil market;The $10-plus rout in oil markets on Thursday has not only brought some big losses to bull investors, it has also damaged the reputation of the oil market. It is ironic that the sell-off happened on the eve of the first anniversary of the equity markets “flash-crash” of 2010.One can look for answers for the rout – the US dollar, fears about economic slowdown, a sell-off in silver, a calmer Middle East after the death of Osama bin Laden, etc. – but the truth is that there is not an easy fundamental reason to explain why oil prices dropped more than $10 in a single day.Over the next few weeks the market will look for its real level. In the meantime, the rout leaves some lessons: oil markets lack effective “circuit breakers” and daily fluctuations limits to manage a panic sell-off, like the one witnessed on Thursday.The New York Mercantile Exchange, owned by the CME Group and home of the popular West Texas Intermediate contracts, has a daily fluctuation limit of $10. After hitting it, trading stops for a while, before resuming and in theory allowing calmer responses. But there are no limits on the last hour of open-outcry trading, which is precisely when the sell-off gathered pace on Thursday. As such, the limit for the after-hours market on the Globex electronic platform was set at a ridiculously wide $20.Worse, ICE Futures Europe, owned by Atlanta-based InterContinental Exchange and home of the benchmark Brent contract, does not have any fluctuation limit at all, so short of an emergency shutdown, prices could fluctuate wildly. That is just plainly wrong.Both exchanges need to revisit their policies: fluctuation limits, both up and down, and circuit breakers are as necessary in commodities markets as they are in equities.Commodities regulators should force them to do something if they do not act soon. The exchanges’ defence is that Thursday’s trading was orderly, a seller was there for every buyer. And yes, that is true. But there was unnecessary panic and distressed forced-selling. We have seen the same problem on the way up, when relatively small geopolitical hiccups have triggered excessive price hikes.With the G20 looking at the commodities markets, a pre-emptive response from the exchanges would be wise. Circuit breakers and a narrower daily fluctuation limit –perhaps set at $5 a barrel –would be helpful.
673;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-06T09:11:20Z;LME unveils common access deal with Interxion;Exchange hopes to attract high-frequency traders;London Metal Exchange has signed deal to provide same-site services with Interxion, the data centre operator, in a push to attract high-speed trading institutions to the commodities exchange.The exchange operator will open an access point for traders on the LME’s electronic Select system to its existing operations at Interxion’s site, based just outside London’s financial district as the LME’s own data centre reaches capacity.“We see increasing demand for fast access from new and existing members of the exchange,” said Michael Warren, chief technology officer at the LME. “The access point at Interxion in the City of London will ensure that all our members will be able to benefit from cost-effective, low-latency access to the LME”.The move comes amid increasingly fierce competition from other commodities exchanges around the world. CME Group, the largest US futures exchange, on Friday launched a new clearing house in London and is considering using it as a stepping stone to offering clearing services to exchanges in Europe.Exchanges around the world have been keen to promote co-location services, in which traders and institutions place their routers and servers as close as possible to the exchange trading engine, often within the same data centre, to reduce the distance an order must travel.In doing so it attracts new customers, particularly high-frequency traders, to the exchange. Although only a small part of the total market, high frequency traders often account for the majority of daily trading volume.By placing its servers at Interxion’s site, the LME hopes to attract traders who use other exchanges and alternative trading platforms also located at the same data centre. They include NYSE Euronext, Bolsas y Mercados Españoles, SIX Group, Burgundy and Equiduct. The LME Select system accounts for the largest volume of the exchange’s three trading platforms and attracts most of the volume growth.In 2010 the LME achieved volumes of 120.3m lots, equivalent to $11,000bn annually and $46bn on an average business day.
674;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Silver falls for fifth day;;"Silver prices plunged for the fifth consecutive day on Friday as the grey precious metal suffered its biggest correction since the billionaire Hunt brothers cornered the market in 1980.The reversal of fortunes for silver – which until this week’s 25 per cent drop had been up 56 per cent since January – has led a wider sell-off in commodities markets, which were heading towards one of their worst one-day falls on record.“The silver market has become even more unhinged as the week nears an end, with no sign yet that the nervous selling momentum is near petering out,” said Edel Tully, precious metals strategist at UBS.“This has paved the way for a wider commodity slump,” she added.On the spot market in London, silver fell by a further 1 per cent to $34.35 a troy ounce, unable to hold gains seen earlier in the session. The fresh losses came after falls of as much as 9 per cent on Thursday to a six-week low of $35.82 a troy ounce.The volatility in silver has been exacerbated by a series of increases in margin – or the amount of cash that investors must set aside to trade each contract – by CME Group, which runs the silver futures exchange in New York.CME has raised its margin requirements five times in the past 15 days. Investors must now set aside $14,000 per silver futures contract, worth about $180,000 at current prices. The rate will rise to $16,000 on Monday.The increase in trading costs has forced some investors to sell their futures positions if they are unable to raise sufficient cash.
The changes in margin rates are a function of the increases in volatility and price rises.Investors have also been rushing to sell silver held through exchange-traded funds.Holdings of silver through ETFs fell by 520 tonnes on Wednesday, the second largest daily drop on record, according to Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst at Barclays Capital in New York.Investors had withdrawn 1,105 tonnes of silver from ETFs in seven days, Ms Cooper added, a decline of about 10 per cent.The drop in silver comes after a spectacular rally in which the metal soared 175 per cent between August last year and last week, when it rose to within touching distance of the
all-time nominal high of $50 an ounce, amid widespread enthusiasm among investors.Sales of silver coins surged to record levels as retail investors, particularly in North America, bought the metal as an expression of dissatisfaction with the perceived profligacy of the Federal Reserve and the US government and the faltering US dollar.The tumble in silver has led the price of other precious metals lower. However, gold has managed to remain relatively unscathed compared with its poorer cousin. Since hitting an all-time peak on Monday, the yellow metal is down 5.9 per cent at $1,483 an ounce.Platinum and palladium, the other two main precious metals, have fallen 5.2 and 10.4 per cent respectively in the past four days.GFMS, a leading precious metals consultancy, said in its annual survey of the
two metals that palladium could rally to a fresh 10-year high of $975 a troy ounce, while platinum would hit a peak of $1,925 a troy ounce this year.However, Philip Klapwijk, the consultancy’s executive chairman, warned that before the metals hit new highs, a “summer slump” across the precious metals was “quite likely”."
675;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-05T23:55:35Z;Critics question real-time reporting proposal;;A proposal by US regulators to build a new real-time trade reporting system is still a “major source of debate”, a year after the May 6 “flash crash” that accelerated its development.Speaking at a panel co-hosted by Georgetown University and the Financial Times, some experts said they did not believe that the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has proposed a consolidated audit trail, needed to watch trading as it happened.Chris Isaacson, chief operating officer of BATS Global Markets, the US exchange group, said: “We are supportive of the audit trail but question the value of having the data in real time. However the regulator is set up, action takes quite a bit of time and analysis.”“We do have a concern that if real time is what has to happen, it could turn into a pseudo-transaction cost and could result in spreads widening,” he added.Pete Kyle, professor of finance at the University of Maryland, said: “I don’t think the SEC needs data in real time, maybe a couple of days [later].”There were also concerns about overlaps with existing systems. Joe Mecane, executive vice-president at NYSE Euronext, said it would make sense to harmonise efforts by the SEC and existing programmes by exchanges and industry groups “so as not to have duplicative infrastructure”.Exchanges and brokerages have balked at the $4bn price tag that the SEC estimated it would cost to build a system that collects synchronised and detailed quotes from multiple markets and large traders in “real time”.After several groups filed critical comment letters, Mary Schapiro, SEC chair, has since revised that estimate to $1bn.However, Bryan Durkin, chief operating officer of CME Group, said at the forum that futures markets such as his, which unlike equity markets are highly consolidated, benefited from real-time data.“We had technology in place that provided very granular and complete audit trail data at our fingertips on essentially a real-time basis. Our counterparts in the securities industry have not been as fortunate in accessing this kind of information even within months of the market event,” said Mr Durkin.David Shillman, associate director of the division and trading at markets at the SEC, acknowledged that the proposal was a “major source of debate”, but said: “We are optimistic that technology has developed [so] that there are solutions that will allow information to be collected and normalised in real time.”“We want to design a system that could last 15-20 years. Our hope is technology could be developed to help stop manipulations,” he said. “If real time can be achieved at a reasonable cost and reliability, it could have the benefit of allowing us to do additional surveillance.”Systems like “mirroring” trading data, which would not require a separate data feed to regulators – just a copy of what exchanges and brokerages already collect – could be a cost-effective mechanism, he said.
676;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;CME launches London clearing house;;CME Group is considering offering clearing services to exchanges in Europe as the largest US futures exchange establishes a beachhead in the region by launching a new clearing house in London on Friday.The move into clearing in Europe highlights the Chicago-based operator’s ambitions to expand into Europe, where CME’s two biggest rivals, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and Deutsche Börse, have established clearing businesses.It comes as clearing has been thrown into flux amid a wave of exchange mergers. The CME’s move to start clearing in London also comes a month after LCH.Clearnet, the dominant clearer in the UK, launched clearing of over-the-counter derivatives in the US in competition with the CME.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, stepping in to guarantee that trades are completed even if one party defaults.CME Clearing Europe, the US group’s London-based clearing house, will start by clearing in 153 OTC commodity contracts such as WTI and Brent crude swaps, freight forwards and swaps on rapeseed oil, which is used in food and cosmetics and in making biodiesel.This pits the CME against ICE, which has offered clearing in similar Brent and WTI swaps for some years on ICE Clear Europe, also based in London.Andrew Lamb, chief executive of CME Clearing Europe, conceded there was a “large overlap” between his business and that of ICE. “There’s no doubt that we are a head-to-head alternative to ICE Clear Europe. But the absolute intention is to expand that initial range [of products] into other areas.”He said the launch of CME’s London clearer meant there were now two competitors for ICE in the US and Europe, including CME’s existing US clearing house.Mr Lamb said that CME Clearing Europe aimed to offer “as complete a range of clearing services” in Europe as CME already does in the US”.“There would also be nothing stopping us clearing for third party exchanges. We’d definitely be open to that,” Mr Lamb said.Speculation has been rife that CME wants to poach the business of clearing trades at the London Metal Exchange from LCH.Clearnet. Mr Lamb declined to comment. The LME this week said it was studying setting up its own clearing house.CME initially applied to the UK regulator, the Financial Services Authority, to set up a clearer in London to clear credit default swaps. But last year CME changed tack, saying it would start clearing OTC energy and commodity contracts.The switch came as ICE grabbed the lion’s share of CDS clearing in the US and Europe. But last week ICE was hit with an antitrust probe from the competition authorities in Brussels, which is investigating special profit-sharing arrangements and preferential tariffs it granted to nine banks with which it is involved in clearing.Mr Lamb said CDS clearing was still on the agenda and it was possible that CME Clearing Europe could launch CDS clearing for non-banks users of such products this year. “We haven’t lost track of financial OTC derivatives, they are absolutely on the radar.”CME Clearing Europe will launch with 15 members, including Bache Commodities, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, futures brokers MF Global and Newedge, RBS and UBS.
677;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-05T14:53:32Z;Cleartrade rules out creating integrated bourse;;Cleartrade Exchange, a start-up commodities bourse, has ruled out joining the London Metal Exchange in mulling the creation of an integrated exchange encompassing trading and clearing.The two-year old group, which is regulated in Singapore, is looking to muscle in on the fast-growing over-the-counter (OTC) commodity derivatives markets, particularly freight and metals.The group’s comments come amid increasing debate among exchanges around the world over whether it should create a “vertical silo” model, an industry term that refers to an exchange that controls both the trading of assets, especially derivatives, and the clearing of them.“I don’t see it as a utopia,” Richard Baker, chief executive of Cleartrade told FT Trading Room. “I understand some of the cost mitigations but I don’t see the benefit for the trading principals.”A vertical silo potentially gives exchange operators the power to keep lucrative contracts and revenue in-house while allowing users to net trades, thus saving on collateral costs, as well as cut IT connection costs.The debate was given fresh impetus this week after Martin Abbott, chief executive of the London Metal Exchange (LME), said the bourse was looking at building its own clearing house “in a world where the horizontal clearing model is being steadily eroded.”Market participants such as banks and interdealer brokers have opposed silos because they wield pricing power over them, derived from control of a clearing house that also helps prevent rivals from offering competing products. Mr Baker said that the freight market was a broker-led market and an integrated exchange would diminish that role.“We hear strong reactions to the IntercontinentalExchange and CME model,” said Mr Baker, who felt the main obstruction in the market was clearing houses not opening up to each other to allow investors a choice over where their trades are cleared – so-called interoperability.“If the clearing houses found a way to interconnect, the argument for the vertical model would soon fall away,” Mr Baker said.Cleartrade connects to three clearing houses. LCH.Clearnet, SGX and Nos Clearing, a Norwegian specialist commodities clearing house, but none as yet interoperate.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, stepping in to ensure that a deal goes ahead even if one party defaults. Regulators in Washington and Brussels are keen for central counterparty clearing in the market in order to reduce the risk traditionally associated with such trades.However many of the world’s largest exchanges, such as CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and NYSE Euronext are already already moving to their integrated transactions and clearing services.
678;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;ICE steps up attack on deal rival;;Intercontinental Exchange, the US exchange operator, intensified its campaign to take control of NYSE Euronext’s futures business with a blistering attack on a rival bid by Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, which it characterised as “absurd”, “risky” and full of “empty promises”.ICE teamed up with Nasdaq OMX last month to launch an $11bn cash-and-stock offer for NYSE Euronext, attempting to break up an agreed friendly merger between NYSE and Deutsche Börse.ICE and Nasdaq are offering a higher price to buy NYSE with the aim of splitting its futures and equities exchanges between them, giving ICE control of Liffe, the London-based futures exchange. NYSE’s board has rejected the proposal twice, calling it an “empty vessel”.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, hit back on Wednesday, saying: “It’s understandable why NYSE Euronext’s response has been focused on attacking our superior proposal,” he said.“The alternative is to acknowledge and address the serious deficiencies in the Deutsche Börse takeover.”He made his remarks as ICE reported first-quarter net income of $129m, or $1.74 per share, up from $101m, or $1.36 per share, in the prior year quarter.Excluding extraordinary items, net profit was $131m, or $1.77 per share, above analysts’ average forecasts of about $1.69 per share.Mr Sprecher revealed he had first been in talks almost 10 years ago about buying a stake in Liffe – which was acquired in 2002 by Euronext, which was in turn bought by NYSE in 2007 – but had been unable to strike a deal.The ICE chief said that while he wanted to run Liffe as a viable business in its own right, under the Deutsche Börse bid it would “likely be gutted and for all intents and purposes moved to Frankfurt to be subsumed as part of a European product set within the Deutsche Börse”.His comments came as Deutsche Börse published its offer to its investors to tender their shares in return for shares in a Dutch holding company being created for the merger with NYSE Euronext.The deal needs holders of at least 75 per cent of the German group’s shares to approve it. It also needs regulatory clearance by March 2012 from the European Union, as well as authorities in the US, Germany and seven other countries.Investors can tender their shares until July 13, by which time NYSE shareholders are expected to have voted on whether to approve the merger plans.However, Mr Sprecher said it was “absurd” to imply that the combined entity – which would be based in the Netherlands – would be a US company. “Billions of dollars worth of NYSE stock could be dumped on the market by its current institutional shareholders as a result of this new status,” he claimed.ICE shares were down 1.4 per cent at $114.85 in New York.FT Trading Room
679;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-05-03T16:11:11Z;Quick View: The LME faces the future;;"The sleeping giant wakes.The London Metal Exchange, one of the few remaining member-owned exchanges, has finally realised that the world around it is changing - and fast.In a notice to members Martin Abbott, chief executive, says it is time to think about building its own clearing house.The key line comes in the second paragraph of his notice: the LME’s decision stems from a recognition of “a world where the horizontal clearing model is being steadily eroded”.In other words, Mr Abbott is warning members that the march of the “vertical silo” appears unstoppable and, if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.Stripping away the jargon, he is saying that with clearing increasingly part of an exchange’s business - as opposed to being run, like LCH.Clearnet, as a user-owned entity, with a mix of exchanges and banks as owners - the LME is operating with one hand tied behind its back, strategically, if it does not also have its own clearing.That trend towards verticalisation is starkly illustrated by the proposed Deutsche Borse/NYSE Euronext deal, which will strengthen an already large exchange and clearing silo in derivatives. Then there is the CME Group in the US, which launches its London-based clearing house this week- another little silo in the City.(Incidentally, Mr Abbott’s notice will not have gone down well at the CME, which had hoped to clear for the LME, which has long been critical of what it sees as LCH.Clearnet’s bloated cost base and patchy service.)By building its own clearer, or central counterparty (CCP), the LME will do three things: gain control over the launch of new products (because relying on LCH.Clearnet’s readiness to clear new products has long ensured that the LME does not have that control); internalise clearing revenues that currently accrue to LCH.Clearnet; and sets it on a path to being more strategically attractive either to a predator (assuming the membership were ever to agree to a deal), or as an acquiror.The big question is, of course, how the LME builds a default fund. Not easy. But there may be a critical mass of LME customers that could see this as an opportunity.Mr Abbott would need to be absolutely sure on this point, as otherwise this goes nowhere. His counterpart at the London Stock Exchange, Xavier Rolet, tried to convince the LSE’s biggest customers to build a default fund for a CCP last year, but they could not see the revenue opportunity since the LSE appeared at the time not to have a sufficiently credible plan to get into derivatives (where the clearing revenues are).One opportunity that the LME has so far missed is clearing over-the-counter (OTC) products like iron ore contracts. That has been snapped up by LCH.Clearnet, SGX in Singapore and others. As if the point needed underscoring, this week sees the CME Group’s London-based clearer, CME Clearing Europe, launch its clearing service with over 150 OTC energy and commodity derivatives contracts.The LME can’t afford to sit idly by if it wants to be a player in the new world order of OTC derivatives clearing that is being thrust upon exchanges and clearers by Dodd-Frank in the US and “Emir” in Europe.Mr Abbott says there is “no deadline set for reaching a definitive decision” on the clearing idea.But given the emerging challenge to the LME’s core metals franchise from China - specifically the Shanghai exchange - time is not necessarily on the LME’s side.That will ultimately come down to the members. They would do well to look west to Chicago, circa 2003. Then, the Chicago Board of Trade’s members were faced with competition from Europe and, in spite of their differences and making a perfectly comfortable living trading Treasury bond futures “open outcry” in the CBOT’s pits, they decided the exchange needed to make drastic changes if it was to survive and thrive in a new world of electronic trading and competition.It remains to be seen whether the LME’s members understand that their turn has come to do the same with the world’s biggest metals market, and make some key strategic choices."

If the LME goes ahead with the plan, it would bring it into line with many of its rivals and give it control over launching new products.Martin Abbott, chief executive, acknowledged the study into building its own clearing house was driven by a fast-changing market “in a world where the horizontal clearing model is being steadily eroded.”The move comes at a time when the LME is facing a challenge from metals trading in China, especially Shanghai. The UK group opened an office in Singapore last year and expanded its trading hours to attract the Asian market. It also comes in the same week that the new London-based clearing house of CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, will begin clearing its first products in Europe.“After several months of feasibility studies, we have reached the point at which deeper examination of the issues requires some discussion in the public arena,” Mr Abbott said in a notice to members. “In addition it should be noted that we believe self-clearing would also be accretive to earnings at the LME,” he said.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, steppng in to ensure that a deal goes ahead even if one party defaults. Regulators in Washington and Brussels are keen for central counterparty clearing in the market in order to reduce the risk traditionally associated with such trades.Private companies like CME and IntercontinentalExchange hope ownership of their own clearing house will better enable them to compete globally for business in clearing privately-negotiated derivatives.Building its own clearing house would bring LME into line with other exchanges, which are either already offering integrated transactions and clearing services. CME and ICE have their own clearing houses while NYSE Euronext has already put LCH.Clearnet on notice that it is also building its own model.An integrated model offers traders cheaper IT costs and the ability to net trades, leading to large savings in collateral and other costs. The exchange can introduce new products much more quickly. In the past it has been reliant on whether LCH has been ready.The LME said it would begin consulting with shareholders, members and other stakeholders before a final decision was made. No deadline had been set, it added.LCH.Clearnet said it had not received notice from the LME about withdrawing from its relationship. “We value our relationship with the LME and shall continue to provide the LME and its members with an excellent service and the benefit of our unique experience in clearing for this complex market, we are a leader in commodities clearing globally,” said Ian Axe, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet. LME owns an eight per cent stake in LCH.

CME and ICE have their own clearing houses while NYSE Euronext has already put LCH.Clearnet on notice that it is also building its own model.The LME said it would begin consulting with shareholders, members and other stakeholders before a final decision was made. No deadline had been set, it added.LCH.Clearnet said it had not received notice from the LME about withdrawing from its relationship.

They hope the promise of further savings may help fend off the approach from Nasdaq and ICE.At the meeting in New York, Mr Niederauer responded to individual shareholders who suggested the German group contribute 0.5 shares per share of the combined entity, rather than the current 0.47 ratio.“If we push that ratio too far and the other side doesn’t get the vote, I’d hate to miss out on the accelerating opportunity [of the Deutsche Börse merger] because we got a touch greedy,” he said.Mr Francioni said in Frankfurt: “We believe that the structure and terms are very attractive to both sets of shareholders. We stand by the terms.”Deutsche Börse will require 75 per cent shareholder approval, versus the 50 per cent needed by NYSE Euronext.Also on Thursday, NYSE reported first-quarter earnings per share of 68 cents, versus 54 cents a year ago; Deutsche Börse said earnings were €1.14 per share, versus €0.84 a year ago. Both said the results were driven by stronger derivatives revenues and lower costs. Expenses are a sensitive issue, as Nasdaq-ICE have argued that their rivals are not efficient at controlling costs.Mr Niederauer also highlighted his group’s falling leverage ratio, which he said will enable the group to pay large dividends and close the value gap with the rival offer; it also served to illustrate DB-NYSE’s argument that Nasdaq is too heavily indebted to take on its rival.Echoing comments earlier this week by Mr Niederauer, Mr Francioni said the group also promised more savings for customers.“Consolidating clearing services is expected to provide efficiencies in the range of several billion euros per year,” he said.After questions from shareholders about the nationality of the new group, NYSE said the companies would reveal the composition of the board before July 7, when NYSE shareholders will asked to vote on the merger. Membership will reflect discussions with European regulators who want to have national representatives on the board, highlighting the political risks involved in the deal."
683;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;CME criticises NYSE-DB merger plan;The biggest US futures exchange group vowed that the bidding war over NYSE Euronext would not deter it from its strategy of expanding its business internationally;CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, vowed that the bidding war over NYSE Euronext – which has pitted two of CME’s main rivals against each other – would not deter it from its strategy of expanding its business internationally.NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have agreed a friendly merger that would create a powerful transatlantic exchange, while Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental Exchange want to break up that deal and buy NYSE with the aim of splitting up its futures and equities exchanges.CME, which has undertaken two large exchange takeovers in recent years, has declined to be drawn into making a bid for NYSE. The group insisted on Thursday that it was committed instead to link-ups with international exchanges that enable traders in other countries to access CME’s markets.International business is growing faster than in the US, CME said, with trading volumes during non-US hours up by 27 per cent in the first quarter of 2011 from last year, compared with 20 per cent growth during the US trading day.A central part of CME’s international expansion is the imminent launch of a London-based clearing house, which the group said will initially clear 150 over-the-counter commodity contracts before extending its offering to other OTC and listed futures contracts.“We have more strategic investments and commercial linkage arrangements with major exchanges around the world,” said Craig Donohue, chief executive. “I don’t think that changes whether Nasdaq and ICE are successful or whether NYSE and Deutsche Börse are successful in completing their transaction. Our focus is on expanding our global distribution network and acquiring more customers.”CME also weighed in on the relative merits of the bids for the first time, pouring cold water on the proposed DB-NYSE merger.Mr Donohue said the merger would not benefit traders. “We’ve never, frankly, been big believers in the large, multi-asset class exchange concept,” the CME chief said. “It’s not clear that it has actually delivered demonstrable value to customers in terms of increased efficiencies.”“The synergy opportunities from those very different and very differently regulated businesses are inferior to the synergy opportunities of combining much more similar derivatives businesses as we have done,” Mr Donohue said.Terry Duffy, CME chairman, told the Financial Times that from a cost-saving perspective, the ICE-Nasdaq bid might make more sense. “The way the plan is laid out, ICE would get the Liffe businesses [NYSE’s European futures arm] and that would be more synergistic,” he said.The executives spoke as CME reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter on record revenues, boosted by surging commodity markets and uncertainty in the global economy.Excluding extraordinary items, CME made a net profit of $292m or $4.36 per share, up from $240m or $3.62 per share in the same period last year and ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about $2.40 per share. Revenues were $832m, up from $693m a year earlier.Shares in CME were trading down 1.9 per cent at $303.94 by noon in New York.
684;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-04-27T22:11:33Z;Antitrust rumblings over index ownership;;As shareholders in NYSE Euronext ponder the bid battle raging between the US exchange and its partner Deutsche Börse on the one hand, and Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange on the other, they may not be paying much attention to the Eurostoxx 50 index.They may be more focused on the cost synergies and revenue opportunities touted by the two camps as they try and convince shareholders that their proposal is best amid the current wave of global exchange consolidation.However, the low-key business of indices, such as the Eurostoxx and in the US the S&P and Dow Jones indices, are emerging as a controversial issue in Europe.That is because ownership of such indices – more precisely of the companies that compile them – is being concentrated among a handful of exchanges. They see them as a lucrative new source of revenue since products such as derivatives and exchange-traded funds can be created that are based on them.Yet rivals wanting to spin off products based on those indices cannot be sure they will be able to, since the power to license products on an index rests with the owner of the index compiler – the exchange.Some see this as a potential antitrust issue. Edmund Parker, global co-head of derivatives and structured products at law firm Mayer Brown, says: “You do have a potential tension, if it comes down to bigger and bigger exchanges deliberately closing out other exchanges. If that happens, this seems to me the sort of thing that competition authorities can take a look at.”The Eurostoxx 50 index is central to the debate in Europe because it is owned by Stoxx, an index compiler controlled by Deutsche Börse and SIX Group of Switzerland, operator of the Swiss exchange. In 2009 the pair took control of Stoxx after buying out a stake held by Dow Jones.Revenue generated by Stoxx grew at a compound annual rate of 20 per cent from 2006-08, the latest period for which figures are available.While the S&P index is owned by publisher McGraw-Hill, the Dow Jones index has been owned by CME Group, the Börse’s biggest rival in derivatives, since last year.Critics of the status quo include the London Stock Exchange, which last month unveiled plans to start competing against Deutsche Börse’s Eurex derivatives exchange, and NYSE Liffe, owned by NYSE Euronext, starting with derivatives based on the FTSE 100 stock index.The LSE would also like to be able to launch derivatives based on other indices, including those run by Stoxx.Yet an application to license the Eurostoxx by the LSE was rejected last year by the German group. People familiar with the matter say the LSE recently raised the issue with the European Commission.Separately LCH.Clearnet, the UK clearing house, is also in contact with Brussels after being similarly rebuffed after applying to Stoxx to be able to offer clearing of OTC equity derivatives based on the Eurostoxx 50.Neither the LSE nor the LCH.Clearnet would comment.So far there is no indication that the antitrust authorities in Brussels are including the index issue in their impending review of the proposed NYSE Euronext/Deutsche Börse merger.And Stoxx counters any suggestion that index ownership is unfairly exclusive, saying Stoxx faces “strong competition worldwide from other index providers and also from OTC private-label derivatives”.It also argues that an index does not “define a market by itself”.“All indices are calculated and maintained using data which is generally available to the public and in particular to Stoxx’s current and future competitors,” Stoxx says.Yet the index issue could yet become part of a wider debate in Europe over fair access to services such as clearing, often also controlled by exchanges.A key element of Europe’s version of reforms of the vast over-the-counter derivatives markets – mirroring the Dodd-Frank in the US – is how to ensure that clearing houses allow open and fair access to their services from any trading platform, not just one that happens to also be owned by the same exchange.Says one Brussels-based industry observer: “This [index] issue is a fairly close sibling to the issue of access to clearing.”
685;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-04-15T01:20:39Z;Nasdaq OMX appoints permanent CFO;;Nasdaq OMX has hired a new permanent chief financial officer, Lee Shavel, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch banker and key adviser in Nasdaq’s efforts to buy arch-rival NYSE Euronext.Nasdaq’s previous CFO, Adena Friedman, a long-time top company strategist, had left the company in February, just after NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse announced they planned to merge. At the time, Nasdaq was in the early stages of launching its offer to buy NYSE in a joint effort with the IntercontinentalExchange.Mr Shavel was head of financial institutions investment banking for the Americas. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has been a critical partner to Nasdaq and ICE’s $11.3bn cash-and-shares bid for NYSE Euronext, for which BofA Merrill and Wells Fargo have agreed to provide financing, if necessary. Nasdaq and ICE have not yet made a formal bid.During his 18 years at BofA and Merrill Lynch, Mr Shavel helped sell the International Securities Exchange, a US options market, to Deutsche Börse, with whom Nasdaq is currently wrangling to take over NYSE.He also helped sell the New York Mercantile Exchange to the CME Group, and Brut, an electronic trading network, to Nasdaq. He advised on initial public offerings for major exchanges and brokerages, including Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.“Lee has been a valued adviser to Nasdaq OMX for the past seven years on a variety of mergers and acquisitions, funding and capital transactions,” said Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, in a statement.Mr Shavel will take over officially from Ronald Hassen, interim CFO, on May 23. Mr Shavel has also been named vice-president of corporate strategy.The departure of Ms Friedman had raised eyebrows, coming at a critical time for the company as its top rival planned to join with Europe’s biggest exchange group. Nasdaq has lost other top executives in recent years as its share price struggled and it lost equity trading market share to new market entrants.However, Ms Friedman left to take the same position at The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that is mulling a transition to public company. It was an opportunity she wanted to pursue to be nearer to her family in the Washington area, where Carlyle is based, people with knowledge of her decision have said.
686;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-04-14T15:44:06Z;NYSE and D Börse consider measures to boost deal value;;"Deutsche Börse is considering a share buy-back and NYSE Euronext is looking at a special dividend as ways of bolstering the value of their proposed tie-up, according to people familiar with their thinking.The two groups are fending off a potentially higher offer for NYSE Euronext by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange.The chief executives of Deutsche Börse and NYSE began meeting shareholders this week, following the NYSE board’s rejection of an informal $11.3bn cash-and-shares offer by Nasdaq and ICE to buy the company and separate its equities and futures businesses.NYSE has told investors it has the option of paying a one-off dividend if the deal closes, as a way to narrow the price gap with the proposed counterbid, a person familiar with the talks said.Deutsche Börse has said it probably cannot alter the price of its $9.4bn deal, in which its shareholders will receive 60 per cent of the joint entity, because it must receive 75 per cent shareholder approval, a person close to the company said.However, it would consider a share buy-back after the deal closes, which would boost the value of the combined group, in essence raising the promised return, the person said.Deutsche Börse and NYSE have also told shareholders that the synergies of their deal will be higher than the $426m outlined, as they have proposed in recent days, but they have not finalised new figures.The companies declined to comment.A buy-back would also be possible for ICE, the US futures exchange, which has some $200m remaining in an authorised buy-back. However, a person close to ICE said the option was not under consideration.ICE declined to comment.Deal-related buy-backs are not an unfamiliar route for the exchanges. The CME Group made a similar offer during its merger with the Chicago Board of Trade, which ICE had made an unsuccessful hostile bid to buy.Nasdaq and ICE have said they will not raise their proposed bid, though analysts have suggested other tools that could improve their offer.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst at Raymond James, said in a note that Nasdaq and ICE could “potentially make things more interesting” by offering a reverse break-up fee for their deal, which would give investors protection if regulators blocked it. It could also help match the large $340m break-up fee agreed by NYSE and Deutsche Börse.Mr O’Shaughnessy estimated that NYSE could receive as much as $50 a share in an auction, but he said the board was unlikely to go down that route. Nasdaq and ICE suggested they could pay some $42 a share; the Deutsche Börse offer is worth about $37 a share."
687;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
688;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-04-12T23:52:40Z;ICE to open electronic platform in Brazil;;IntercontinentalExchange has made its first big move into Brazil by teaming up with one of the country’s most famous businessmen to create an electronic marketplace for power contracts.The world’s biggest bourses, which are fighting for pole position in a rapidly changing industry, have increasingly looked to emerging markets such as Brazil to get ahead of their competitors.Rival Chicago-based CME Group already has a strong presence in the Latin American country after forming a strategic partnership with the country’s exchange BM&FBovespa in 2008.ICE said on Tuesday it had formed its own partnership with Eike Batista, Brazil’s richest man, and other top executives to create BRIX, a new marketplace for electrical power contracts.“ICE was founded more than a decade ago to serve global energy markets, and we believe our history of providing transparency and market-based prices will bring important risk management tools to the Brazilian power industry,” said Charles Vice, president and chief operating officer.The electronic platform, which is set to open in June this year, follows an agreement with the country’s regulator last month to allow Brazilians access to ICE’s oil futures.At the same time, ICE is embroiled in a takeover battle in the US, where it has teamed up with Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange group, to take over the NYSE Euronext.ICE’s goal in that deal is also international expansion. In that proposal, in which ICE is contributing the majority of an $11.3bn bid, it would take control of Liffe, the UK-based European futures exchange.It would be ICE’s second big European deal, having acquired the International Petroleum Exchange in 2001, which was renamed ICE Futures Europe.Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE chief executive and former power trader himself, is a well-respected dealmaker, having built ICE into a formidable global exchange in just over a decade.Mr Sprecher and his counterpart at Nasdaq OMX, Robert Greifeld, have been reaching out to US shareholders of NYSE Euronext to convince them to back their deal, rather than NYSE’s proposed friendly tie-up with Deutsche Börse.Mr Sprecher told reporters in Brazil that his group had received a “great response” from NYSE shareholders and said he would “continue to talk to shareholders” as NYSE and DB hold their own talks.NYSE’s board rejected ICE and Nasdaq’s bid on Sunday. NYSE and DB believe their combined group, which would be the world’s largest exchange group, would be in a leading position to partner with exchanges in fast-growing markets like Brazil and Hong Kong.Trading groups and brokerages in the US and Europe are increasingly turning their attention to markets such as Brazil as opportunities compress in developed markets.Additional reporting from Reuters
689;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;LSE to begin FTSE 100 futures trading in June;;The London Stock Exchange has set the stage for a battle in European derivatives trading after unveiling plans to launch trading in futures contracts on Britain’s FTSE 100 stock index in June, in direct competition with NYSE Euronext.The move comes only weeks after NYSE Euronext launched an assault in the US on CME Group, the largest US derivatives exchange, by offering interest rate and bond futures in competition with the Chicago exchange operator’s flagship contracts.Taken together, the two moves are a sign that derivatives exchanges on both sides of the Atlantic are facing challenges to their long dominance over some of the most widely-traded contracts.The two latest efforts will face an uphill struggle as it is notoriously hard to persuade traders to shift from using an exchange that has a near-monopoly in a derivatives contract to a newcomer.The FTSE 100 futures contract is the fourth-largest contract traded at NYSE Liffe, with an average daily volume of 138,000 trades year-to-date, and is available for investors to trade 20 hours a day.“NYSE Liffe has invested a significant amount of financial and human capital in developing and building liquidity in our FTSE futures and options franchise,” said Garry Jones, EVP and Head of Global Derivatives at NYSE Euronext.However there is increasing debate in Europe over the structure of derivatives trading, focused on exchange ownership of clearing houses in a so-called “vertical silo”.That has been prompted by the proposed combination of Deutsche Börse with NYSE Euronext, and proposals working their way through the European Parliament to overhaul the over-the-counter derivatives markets in an effort that mirrors new regulations in the Dodd-Frank act passed in the US last year.The LSE said 10 months ago that it planned to take on the two incumbents in Europe in derivatives – Eurex, owned by Deutsche Börse, and NYSE Liffe, the London-based derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext.Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, hopes that the planned combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse, which will create a single, powerful derivatives exchange in Europe, will help the LSE’s derivatives push by showing market participants worried about the Liffe-Eurex combination’s market power that there is an alternative.Antitrust regulators in Brussels are set to scrutinise the Eurex-Liffe combination as part of an examination of the Deutsche Börse-NYSE proposal. They are likely to focus on its near-monopoly position in derivatives, and the strengthening of its vertical silo, which helps an exchange to keep trading in a single “liquidity pool”.However there is no sign so far that regulators will challenge the vertical silo. The same model underpins the derivatives business at CME Group in the US.The LSE is using Turquoise, a trading platform it operates together with large banks, for its derivatives push. Adrian Farnham, the new chief executive of Turquoise, said “Participants are crying out for a genuinely competitive derivatives market in Europe, and Turquoise Derivatives is proud to be leading the charge in making that a reality.”“We will build a competitive and open framework that will challenge the existing approach of other markets, bringing new trading opportunities and improved efficiencies to our customers,” he said.Turquoise will use the Sola derivatives trading system provided by TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses. The LSE in February unveiled a deal to combine with TMX Group in a deal that has fuelled a wave of exchange consolidation sweeping the globe.The LSE said Turquoise would not only undercut NYSE Liffe’s FTSE index contracts on fees charged to trade such contracts, but would offer a 5p cash rebate to traders placing orders on it in the expectation of a match being found, while charging 20p per contract fee for traders coming in to find a match on the platform – a so-called “maker-taker” fee model.Turquoise also said it would reduce per-contract clearing costs, which it claimed would be a third lower than competitors’ charges.Clearing will be provided by a combination of Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia, the LSE’s Italian clearing house under Borsa Italiana and LCH.Clearnet.“Subject to the granting of appropriate consents, under this arrangement Turquoise is aiming to offer fungibility and/or margin offset with products traded on other markets that are likewise pro-competition,” the LSE said.Separately Deutsche Börse said it had made a “significant improvement” to its trading network linking its trading platforms in Frankfurt and London, provided by Colt Technology Services.Also on Tuesday Eurex said it would at the end of this month launching trading in equity options based on 11 of the most liquid Irish stocks, including Bank of Ireland, Kerry Group, Ryanair and Smurfit Kappa Group.
690;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-04-11T21:22:50Z;CME-linked index looks at tracking Brent;;A leading commodity index marketed by CME Group is to look into tracking benchmark European crude, potentially draining billions of dollars from the exchange operator’s flagship energy contract.Supervisors of the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index will consider adding Brent crude to the basket of 19 futures contracts tracked by about $77bn in assets.Crude oil makes up 16.5 per cent of the index.The proposal would likely shift more oil trading volume, and investor money, to Brent, the main rival to CME’s own benchmark oil futures contract.The only crude type now in the index is West Texas Intermediate, the blend that has lagged behind Brent by $10 or more this year as a glut has grown at the contract’s US delivery point.WTI is mainly traded on CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent is chiefly traded on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, a unit of IntercontinentalExchange.On Monday, Nymex May WTI settled at $109.92, down $2.87 a barrel, and ICE May Brent closed at $123.98, down $2.67 a barrel.“If they do a reshuffling in January 2012, they are going to have to buy Brent and sell WTI,” said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix, a consultant in Switzerland.CME has defended the benchmark in newspaper advertisements and videos and pointed out that open interest in WTI futures reached a record last month. However, traders from the Saudi state oil company to Delta Air Lines have lost faith in WTI as a pricing tool.CME owns 90 per cent of Dow Jones Indexes, which markets the commodity index. The index handbook this month said a supervisory committee “intends to consider whether storage and delivery characteristics of crude oil” would make an “allocation to Brent crude oil in the index appropriate” in 2012. The handbook cited a research note by the International Energy Agency titled: US WTI Price Structure Collapsing Under Weight of Surplus Inventories.CME told the Financial Times that commodity indices “make weighting decisions in accordance with transparent policies and rules. And, while we can’t comment on the prospective changes, we respect those processes and believe adherence to transparent and clear rules is sound policy.”
691;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-04-08T15:26:10Z;Quick View: What next for SGX and ASX?;;It was more of a bloody nose than a slap in the face.The rejection on Friday by Wayne Swan, Australia’s treasurer, of SGX’s bid for ASX, the Australian exchange as a “no brainer” makes you wonder why Magnus Böcker, chief executive of the Singapore exchange and his ASX counterpart Bob Elstone, tried in the first place.Not only did Mr Swan express his outright opposition to the deal but it emerged that the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission had been against it too.The concern was allegedly over Australia’s inability to exercise full “regulatory sovereignty” over ASX. Crucially, Mr Swan highlighted not share and derivatives trading, but the post-trade infrastructure underneath that: clearing and settlement.What puzzles me is that the two exchanges answered about 100 questions from the Australian treasury before even submitting their application to the Foreign Investment Review Board.If clearing and settlement was such an issue surely this would have been evident from the barrage of questions they got. And surely if they were challenged on this, they addressed them, or at least tried to?In the meantime, what now for Mr Böcker? There is a lot of speculation out there about SGX turning from predator to prey.Unlikely. While SGX’s shares have fallen by12 per cent since the day before the ASX deal was unveiled, you have to doubt whether the Singapore government would allow this scenario to happen (especially given the national interest precedent that Canberra has set for all exchange mergers by its decision on Friday).A more likely outcome is that SGX hunts elsewhere. The obvious – on paper – combination is to join the London Stock Exchange-TMX Group tie up, adding the Asian time zone to the deal and creating what would be the first exchange spanning global time zones.There are obvious “Commonwealth” synergies: a common language (English), legal system and business culture. Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, has thought about the “Commonwealth” exchange construct before now, in fact. (Although if he was interested in doing a deal on Thursday that might have been hard as he was in Mongolia, signing a deal to help grow the Ulan Bator exchange). But I don’t see this necessarily as a given.I don’t see SGX going after Nasdaq OMX either. Yes, Mr Böcker was the key figure in the Nasdaq acquision of OMX, the Nordic exchange network and knows Nasdaq well. And yes, SGX and Nasdaq share the same technology.Washington politicians were remarkably relaxed about the prospect of a German exchange – Deutsche Börse – taking over the New York Stock Exchange. But I think SGX taking over Nasdaq would almost certainly not be received the same way.The fact is SGX doesn’t need to do anything straight away. In fact, I question why this deal was even contemplated in the first place because there is a lot that SGX and ASX could have achieved without actually doing a corporate transaction.A comparison with the CME Group in Chicago helps to explain why. The owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has stayed conspicuously aloof from the merger mania, preferring to get on with building cross-listings and distribution arrangements with other exchanges in Brazil, Malaysia, South Africa and South Korea.This week, a “south-to-north connection” linking CME with the MexDer derivatives exchange went live. The idea is to give Mexican investors access to US benchmark futures contracts on CME’s Globex platform, and US investors access to MexDer’s products. All that’s involved is the establishment of a new CME telecoms hub in Mexico City, which MexDer’s customers then connect to their trading platforms.No need for approval from the Mexican equivalent of the treasury or FIRB. No fat fees payable to M&A bankers either. And a key objective of exchange mergers is met: growing and aggregating liquidity at both venues.SGX has already done some of this. It is likely to do more. Others in the region are doing the same: this week the Bombay Stock Exchange signed a memorandum of understanding with the Osaka Securities Exchange to “develop opportunities” including (you guessed it) cross-licensing of indices.As for the ASX, the future looks pretty mixed. It can continue to grow but it faces competition from Chi-X, and the fragmentation of the Australian share market is only just beginning.In its favour I will say that, of all the national exchange incumbents that have faced similar headwinds – like the LSE – the ASX has reacted more nimbly, not waiting until competition starts. It has a pretty convincing roadmap: attract high-frequency traders, build a data centre, offer colocation, cut fees. It has also set some pretty high charges for any outsider wanting to use its clearing services.But medium- to long-term, it looks isolated and growth-constrained. Mr Elstone’s contract is up soon and ASX will be needing a new chief executive. Who knows, maybe they will turn to Mr Böcker? For him, that might not be a bad way of putting behind him what is undoubtedly the biggest setback of his career.
692;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-04-06T17:24:31Z;Hint of Prada as Nasdaq sets out antitrust stall;;When Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX’s chief executive, was making the case for his counterbid for the owner of New York’s “Big Board”, he turned to an Italian handbag maker for help.Prada may seem an unlikely ingredient in any business case for combining Nasdaq OMX’s cash equities and listings business with that of NYSE Euronext, which runs the New York Stock Exchange.But for Mr Greifeld, the Italian luxury goods house is a key strand in his argument that the proposed merger of the two businesses should not face any antitrust issues.Prada chose to launch an initial public offering not in its home market of Milan, but in Hong Kong, to tap surging investor demand for luxury goods companies in a part of the world where the market for upmarket bling is growing fast.Mr Greifeld argued that this was the sort of company the US should have fought to attract to its exchanges. Since 1995, global listings in the US have fallen from 8,000 to 5,000, while listings on non-US exchanges grew from 23,000 to 40,000, according to Bernstein Research.Yet, because New York is home to two main listings venues, Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, the US was unable to compete strongly enough to win back IPOs choosing places such as Hong Kong and London, he argued. “We have a fractured message coming out of the US. We need to be competitive for large IPOs that we are not currently competing for,” Mr Greifeld said.His point is that the listings business should be seen as a global, not purely domestic business. Many analysts acknowledge that combining Nasdaq and NYSE’s listings businesses will be the key antitrust issue in a Nasdaq-ICE counterbid for NYSE Euronext, unveiled last week as a spoiler for NYSE Euronext’s already agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.But overcoming that hurdle will depend on whether US regulators will see competition in the listings business as global or whether they take a narrower, US-centric view.A combination of NYSE and Nasdaq would bring the US into line with places such as Britain, where one exchange, the London Stock Exchange, competes for listings with New York and Hong Kong.The global market argument has also been used successfully in other antitrust cases. In one of the last big domestic exchange deals scrutinised by the US Department of Justice, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s 2007 acquisition of the Chicago Board of Trade, the existence of global rivals to the combined group was one argument put forward by the CME.Yet with Nasdaq-NYSE, the antitrust issue is more nuanced and breaks new ground, some lawyers say.That is because most American companies considering an IPO are unlikely to look globally. They will want a choice of listings venues in the US, which would be removed if NYSE and Nasdaq combined.David Balto, a senior fellow at American Progress and an antitrust lawyer, says: “There are some aspects of competition which are clearly global, but the question is if you are a new American company doing an IPO and issuing stock, are there really significant alternatives?”Stephen Axinn, senior partner at Axinn Veltrop & Harkrider, a law firm, says: “The competition for domestic listings is the relevant issue.”In testimony to a congressional antitrust hearing last week, Larry Harris, professor of finance at the University of California, said a combined NYSE/Nasdaq “could have substantial pricing power in the listing business”. “Such concentration also could reduce innovation in listing standards, which might not be in the public interest,” he said.Other lawyers argue that US antitrust regulators typically are less interested in how a market is defined than whether customers are being offered fair prices. One said: “The question of reducing choice is not generally considered to be a value in and of itself that the antitrust laws protect. They protect the price and quality of the service.”Nasdaq argues that the listings business is already overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which must approve any changes to the fees charged by NYSE or Nasdaq for listings. That would limit the ability of a combined entity to charge monopoly-style rent, it argues.Moreover, Nasdaq is considering maintaining separate branding for the two listings platforms and keeping a two-tier pricing structure, people familiar with the matter say. Last month, BATS Global Markets, a smaller rival, said it planned to offer listings, in competition.The issue is likely to provoke heated debate in the US in coming weeks. Evan Stewart, managing partner in the New York office of law firm Zuckerman Spaeder, says: “I don’t think either side is taking a cut and dried view of this and there are lots of imponderables. Anyone who thinks these [exchanges] deals are going to get a pass in Europe and automatically get a pass from the American antitrust regulators doesn’t understand these issues very well.”Additional reporting by Matthew Kennard in Washington
693;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-04-04T19:02:53Z;Prospect of Fed rise boosts CME interest rate futures trade;;Interest rate futures trading in the US surged last month, as markets appeared to price in the increasing likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in response to inflation sooner than previously thought.Interest rate volumes at the CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, were up by a third in March compared with last year, with an average of 6.6m contracts changing hands a day.The rise in volumes followed a surge in volatility in energy markets and concerns about the effect of the Japanese earthquake.“The story in March was around the Middle East unrest and Japan,” said Robin Ross, CME’s managing director of interest rate products. “That’s what drove volumes, combined with mixed data, which always creates volatility.”Better-than-expected jobs figures released last week were the latest sign of economic recovery in the US, which, along with rises in energy and other commodity prices, are lending weight to the view that inflation could prompt the Fed to increase rates. The Fed has maintained short-term interest rates at zero per cent for more than two years.“The [futures trading] action has not been in the stock market this year,” said Jeff Carter, a trader at the CME. “It’s been in currency, foreign exchange and interest rates. The real pros are starting to say that this price inflation thing is real. Unemployment has gone down and there’s risk ahead because if there isn’t a bumper crop of grain this summer, we’re going to have rampant inflation.”“That means the Fed will have to move on interest rates,” Mr Carter added. “This free money thing just can’t last for ever.”Traders are closely following apparent signals of dissent within the Federal Reserve. “Signs that inflation expectations are beginning to rise or that growth rates are accelerating significantly would suggest that it is time to begin taking our foot off the accelerator and start heading for the exit ramp,” Charles Plosser, head of the Philadelphia Fed, said last week.The CME’s markets indicate that traders at present think there is a 41 per cent chance that the Fed will raise rates at its December meeting and a 63 per cent chance of a rate rise in January 2012. Markets reflect an 80 per cent probability of an increase to 0.5 per cent at the Fed’s March 2012 meeting, and a 78 per cent chance of an increase to 0.75 per cent at the central bank’s April meeting.Ms Ross said there had been a strong increase in volumes in five-year Treasury futures, whereas last year volume had been focused at the longer end of the yield curve.“Those volumes are shifting forward, reflecting a higher probability of a Fed hike in January than there was a month ago,” she said.Mr Plosser added that it was “certainly a possibility” that the Fed would raise rates before the end of the year. “In my mind it’s definitely on the table but it will depend on how things play out over the next few months,” he said.Narayana Kocherlakota, head of the Minneapolis Fed, also said last week it was “certainly possible” that the central bank could raise the funds rate by more than 50 basis points by the end of the year.Average daily trading volume also rose last month from a year ago at Intercontinental Exchange, the CME’s main rival, although trading was down from February.
694;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;US exchanges in $11bn NYSE bid;;Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange have challenged a plan to create the world’s largest exchange, making an $11.3bn offer for NYSE Euronext weeks after it had agreed a merger with Deutsche Börse.Friday’s counter-bid, which Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, described as “an unexpected opportunity”, suggests that a wave of exchange consolidation triggered five months ago has entered a new phase. The world’s biggest bourses are fighting for pole position in a hyper-competitive industry confronted with regulatory changes.The battle for NYSE will also shape the fates of the world’s leading financial centres. Nasdaq-ICE’s cash-and-share offer would bolster New York’s position as a global listings centre, while strengthening London’s position in derivatives.Nasdaq OMX and Atlanta-based ICE are proposing to pay $42.50 a share for NYSE Euronext – 19 per cent above Deutsche Börse’s all-share bid. It is also 27 per cent higher than NYSE Euronext’s share price on February 8, the day before the owner of the New York Stock Exchange said it was in talks with its German rival.According to Nasdaq OMX and ICE, their spoiler bid would create “a unified US equities market” and “ensure that the US is better able to compete globally in a rapidly changing international market for equity trading and capital-raising”.“Our industry is undergoing a period of historic change,” Mr Greifeld added. “During the last five years, more than 90 per cent of the top 100 global listings chose not to list in the US, depriving US investors of the opportunity to easily invest and trade in these companies.”If successful, the deal would also give ICE a US futures business to compete with the CME Group in Chicago and Deutsche Börse in Europe.“We have the backdrop of a new regulatory regime sweeping the world and these markets are changing as we speak,” said Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive. “Bob [Greifeld] and I will be able to set the example … as to how [these] businesses should be formed as we move towards greater transparency and a better market structure.”In the wake of the global financial crisis, leaders from the G20 nations advocated reforms that would move previously opaque derivatives trading on to formal trading platforms, to be processed by clearing houses.Under their proposal, ICE would buy NYSE Euronext’s futures businesses, known as NYSE Liffe, while Nasdaq OMX takes over NYSE’s remaining operations including the Euronext group of stock exchanges in New York, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon, as well as its US options business.As a result, Nasdaq OMX would acquire a presence in pan-European share trading which combined with its existing Nordic business, would be able to challenge Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange. Nasdaq and NYSE, meanwhile, would merge their trading, listings, options and market technology businesses.Nasdaq and ICE plan to finance the acquisition through cash-on-hand and a combined $3.8bn “financing commitment” from a syndicate of banks led by Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The two exchanges said they could save $740m within three years. Neither disclosed how many jobs could be lost, although Mr Greifeld pledged not to close NYSE’s famous trading floor.Standard & Poor’s placed the credit ratings of NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq on watch pending the outcome of the bid, saying the combined company would have about $6.5bn in debt and warning that the “key credit metrics, at least initially, would not be those of an investment-grade company”.NYSE Euronext shares were up 12.6 per cent at the close. Nasdaq was up 9.25 per cent but ICE dropped 3 per cent.Nasdaq and ICE said they believed they could “secure EU competition clearance in contrast to the expectation of a deep and extended probe for the proposed Deutsche Börse’s transaction”.Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would together dominate European derivatives trading by controlling Liffe and Eurex, the Börse’s futures exchange. But that dominant position is likely to be a key part of European antitrust scrutiny of the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse deal.Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Evercore Partners are advising Nasdaq OMX, while ICE has retained Lazard, Broadhaven Capital Partners and BMO Capital Markets.
695;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-04-01T17:03:18Z;ICE-Nasdaq bid: What they are saying;;"Nasdaq OMX has teamed up IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) to make an $11.3bn offer for NYSE Euronext. Here is some early comment on the deal.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX: “I never thought we’d get the opportunity to bid for NYSE. I was surprised when we got the chance. We will deleverage in around 18 months, then look at a capital return programme that could include dividends.“We think these steps will be positively received by all. We’re keeping the NYSE floor. There should be no scepticism about that statement.”“The synergies comes from consolidating the platforms. We have the ability to process every transaction on our processors.”Jeff Sprecher, chief executive and chairman of ICE: “I have become convinced that this is the right thing for the market and the right thing for ICE shareholders. This merger is about who can take cuts out of the business. Bob [Greifeld] and I have engineered a deal that does it much better.”On the creation of ICE-NYSE LiffeJeff Sprecher: “I see Liffe better as a nimbler competitor to Deutsche Börse and CME Group. It would also allow London to remain a competitor on the derivatives world. It would be creating a strong global derivatives player but not a dominant one. It would bring [into Europe] a new asset class of interest rates clearing.”Diego Perfumo, analyst at Equity Research Desk: “The New York-Deustche Borse deal didn’t change the landscape for ICE. But when somebody like Nasdaq comes in, it creates an opportunistic deal for ICE. The deal terms are will within what synergies ICE can achieve. They may be paying a bit more than expected, but they are getting more too, such as parts of the equity derivatives business. ICE and Liffe have significant cost synergies in Europe, and some potential revenue syergies in the US as well. Oil traders can now trade interest rate derivaitves with them, too.”On prospects for a renewed offer from Deutsche BörseAnalysts at Citi: “Deutsche Börse could support €666m additional borrowings, or $940m, which is 27 per cent above valuation before the Deutsche Börse offer. Adding in 50 per cent existing on balance sheet cash resources, we believe Deutsche Börse could offer an extra $6 per share, enabling them to match Nasdaq-ICE’s offer. Nasdaq/ICE is targeting $740m synergies by the end of the third year – $540m from Nasdaq/NYSE combination, $200m from ICE/Euronext. This compares to Deutsche Börse’s €300m cost synergies and €100m revenue synergies. But we believe Deutsche Börse and NYSE were lowballing the synergies achievable.”Market share and effect on US equity tradingThomson Reuters: Nasdaq and NYSE Euronext account for 51.75 per cent of all reported US equity trading in 2010. That is almost 5 times the size of the next biggest exchange, BATS, with 11.45 per cent.Additionally, the data shows that in global terms the combination would represent 33.7 per cent of all reported activity in US, European & Asia stocks compared with the 22.4 per cent share that the combination of Deutsche Börse & NYSE Euronext represents.Anthony Conroy, head of trading at BNY ConvergEx said: “One centralised exchange would help alleviate the fragmentation of US equity trading.”Sang Lee, managing partner at Aite Group: “In the short team, it makes sense to consolidate US cash equities trading and a combined Nasdaq and NYSE would give them a decent position in US equity options.”“The move by Nasdaq is not a surprise and you have to think both NYSE and Deutsche Börse have a contingency plan to counter this.”“In my mind ICE looks the potential winner as it gives them an instant entry to derivatives outside the US. Liffe is not a small piece of the puzzle; it puts them on a par versus CME and Eurex [part of Deutsche Börse].“For shareholdersDiego Perfumo, analyst at Equity Research Desk: “As a shareholder, I might feel more comfortable waiting for someone like LSE or Singapore to come in and buy Nasdaq in two years, avoiding the significant execution risk in integrating the platforms and trying to deleverage.”Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James: “The only clear winner here is NYX [NYSE] shareholders. We are sceptical about the upside for Nasdaq OMX…. Although Nasdaq OMX will certainly be able to create substantial synergies and more operating scale, an acquisition of NYSE Euronext’s US equities and options businesses would represent a doubling down on businesses that are currently out of favour with investors.”“Another failed hostile bid might be frowned upon by [ICE] investors,” he added."
696;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-04-01T16:16:09Z;Quick View: Does Nasdaq-ICE move make sense?;;"“Seizing the NYSE Euronext Opportunity”.That is the headline on one of 34 slides that Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange are showing to persuade analysts of the merits to their plan to bust up the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse deal.It is bold and brassy – typical of both Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, and Jeff Sprecher, his counterpart at ICE.The length of time that it took for Mr Greifeld to show his hand after his rival, Duncan Niederauer at NYSE Euronext, did his deal with Deutsche Börse’s Reto Francioni had many wondering if he really did plan to try and break up the deal.With $2.1bn of debt on Nasdaq’s balance sheet, many wondered if Mr Greifeld could pull something off, even with the aid of ICE and bank financing that is not yet fully committed. Only weeks ago Mr Sprecher was on the record saying how hard it was to break up mergers that already have been agreed. He seemed to be signalling he had doubts. Something must have happened since then, because he now has none.But does the Nasdaq-ICE plan stack up? It is actually a pretty clever play on three counts, quite apart form the fat premium that NYSE Euronext shareholders are being offered (which includes cash, unlike the DB/NYSE deal).First, it should pose far fewer regulatory issues than the DB/NYSE deal.On the US cash equities side, Nasdaq would combine with NYSE’s business, creating a single pool of liquidity. Some might suggest a US antitrust issue here, but I would not jump to that conclusion.The story of US cash equities market structure in the very recent past has been one of fragmentation – excessive fragmentation, in the minds of many including Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Mary Schapiro. Since the “ flash crash” she repeatedly has said that this has made it hard for investors to navigate markets and know what they are dealing with.By bringing Nasdaq and NYSE together – in effect re-aggregating liquidity – Mr Greifeld would be reversing that trend. Regulators will like that. And a combined Nasdaq/NYSE would still only account for just more than half of US equity trading – nowhere near enough to be a worry to antitrust people. Let us not forget that there are plenty of competitors in share trading - such as BATS Global Markets, Direct Edge, brokers and dark pools.Second, Mr Greifeld argues that the US needs a bigger listings champion at a time when the US has seen its leadership eroded here. Fair enough. Why have Nasdaq and NYSE continue to compete to drive listings to the US when you have London with a free run out of the UK. Then there’s Asia, and on the analyst call, Mr Greifeld cited the potential listing of Prada, the Italian luxury goods group, in Hong Kong as a missed opportunity.Also, competition is on the horizon in the US listings business, thanks to the announcement only the other day BATS plans to launch a primary listings platform. Mr Greifeld told me how “grateful” he was to BATS for that.Third, unlike the DB/NYSE deal, this sidesteps completely any antitrust issue over derivatives in Europe. ICE would take London-based Liffe, continuing its existence as a standalone business, while DB/NYSE will probably face a deep and lengthy antitrust probe of its plan to create a virtual monopoly in European derivatives in the form of Eurex and Liffe.And at the same time it gives ICE a big derivatives presence in Europe, where ICE already has a clearing house in London. That will be boosted by plans, unveiled by Mr Sprecher on a call, to expand into interest rate swaps clearing. At the same time, ICE will take over NYSE Liffe US, which has just started competing against CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, in interest rate and Treasury bond futures.For Europeans, this will all look like the consolidation of US ownership of European market structures. But there is little they can do about it; that is not an antitrust issue.Nasdaq OMX has been slipping down the rankings of global exchanges and is the most leveraged of its peers. But Nasdaq is still investment grade, and the cash flow from this proposed deal, Mr Greifeld says, will get his business back to “normal capital velocity” 18 months after the proposed deal has closed.Mr Greifeld has a record as a deal maker, cost-cutter and integrator. So does Mr Sprecher. Both men admitted on Friday that their proposed deal “fell into their laps” after they saw the DB/NYSE tie-up. As opportunistic as it may look, it might just work."
697;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-29T17:37:31Z;BMV in talks with Bovespa over routing;;Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV), the Mexican stock exchange, is in “very advanced” talks with its Brazilian counterpart BM&FBovespa over an order-routing agreement expected to increase trading volumes between Latin America’s two largest bourses significantly.In an interview with FT Trading Room, Luis Téllez, BMV president, said: ”I hope by the end of the year we will have something with Brazil. We do think it will increase liquidity in the Mexican market substantially.” He added: “We are working with them very tightly, and we have a good relationship.”The proposed alliance, which would give Mexican and Brazilian investors direct access to each others’ markets, comes amid a wave of alliances and tie-ups involving the region’s leading stock markets.Last year, BMV announced an order-routing agreement with CME Group as part of a deal in which the largest US futures exchange bought BMV shares worth $17m.That came just weeks after the Chicago operator deepened an existing alliance with BM&FBovespa, the Brazilian exchange group, as the São Paulo-based company increased its stake in CME to 5 per cent.More recently, the Colombia and Peru stock exchanges announced plans for Latin America’s first merger of bourses. That is expected to speed up the birth of Mila, a separate Chile-Colombia-Peru tie-up that will begin direct trading following a test phase, which could be completed in the coming days.Mr Téllez dismissed the possibility of a merger with another exchange, in particular, a buy-out by one of the world’s large international bourses. “Thinking about becoming part of a mega-merger at this stage does not make much sense,” he said. “There is value to be created by staying a Mexican exchange.”However, he did say that BMV was interested in exploring other order-routing agreements with regional bourses, and said that the exchange had just signed an agreement with Chile similar to the one currently being negotiated with Brazil.Order-routing technology is proving popular with many exchanges as it allows investors to send orders to multiple exchanges and other types of trading venue to maximise the possibility of filling them. That, in turn, provides markets with more liquidity.Mr Téllez declined to say how much an alliance with BM&FBovespa would boost liquidity in the Mexican market, but he said it would be “substantial”.He also said that he was inspired by what the Brazilian exchange group had achieved in recent years, in particular enticing Santander, the Spanish-based bank, to list its Brazilian subsidiary in the local market at the end of 2009. The bank raised more than $8bn in the initial public offering, a Brazilian record.”I hope that eventually we can do that in Mexico,” said Mr Téllez. “Brazil is a giant, and they have done things very well.”
698;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-28T19:35:24Z;Delta Air Lines shifts fuel hedges out of US benchmark;;Delta Air Lines, one of the world’s largest carriers, has shifted almost all its jet fuel hedges away from US crude in the latest sign that the benchmark has run into trouble as a tool to manage energy costs.Delta and other US airlines have traditionally purchased contracts for US benchmark crude oil to hedge volatile jet fuel costs. Jet fuel is refined from crude oil and usually tracks its price.But this year the US crude benchmark, known as West Texas Intermediate, has lagged behind the 27 per cent rise in jet fuel, creating difficulties for US airlines. The rise in Brent, a European benchmark, has been more in line with the jet fuel trend.“We’ve needed to restructure our hedge position,” Ed Bastian, Delta president, told a conference last week. The airline spent $7.6bn on fuel and related taxes in 2010.“WTI, which is the instrument that many of us hedge in this market, has dislocated from Brent in terms of pricing.”The US benchmark has sold at a rare discount of $10 per barrel to Brent for most of this year as a glut developed at the Oklahoma delivery point for WTI crude futures traded on CME Group’s New York Mercantile Exchange.With supplies pouring in from the US and Canada, analysts said the disparity of WTI with Brent and other grades might persist until pipelines reconnect the landlocked delivery point with waterborne markets along the Gulf of Mexico. This could take years.US airlines seeking long-term protection against oil price swings have tended to favour crude oil to refined products because the market is more transparent and heavily traded. Delta uses a combination of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap and option contracts to manage fuel costs.Mr Bastian said Delta had “converted, over the course of the last 45 days, nearly all of our WTI positions” to Brent or heating oil.JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America have also raised concerns about the discrepancy between WTI and jet fuel.Energy exchanges are trying to take advantage of the shift. IntercontinentalExchange, the main Brent futures venue, on March 14 launched futures contracts that track the spread between heating oil, a jet fuel proxy, and Brent. ICE cited “requests from US-based market participants”. On Monday CME listed a similar contract.
699;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-21T09:59:54Z;Eurex aims to allay clearing default fears;;Eurex Clearing, the clearing house owned by Deutsche Börse, is seeking to address a key concern of market participants over the risk to which they can be exposed when traders default on deals put through a clearing house.The clearer also said it would expand into over-the-counter interest rate swaps and equity derivatives clearing, as it tries to catch up with rivals CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and LCH.Clearnet, which have all launched OTC derivatives clearing to take advantage of regulatory changes under the Dodd-Frank act in the US.Eurex Clearing plans to expand its derivatives clearing service to allow clients of a clearing member to shift their positions and margin to another sound clearing member if the first clearing member defaults.The process, called portability, insulates the margin of the client of a defaulting clearing member from the administrator handling the default of another clearing member. It also does so if the clearing member is brought down by the default of one of its clients.Usually the margin payments of market participants are held at clearing houses mixed in with that of others in “omnibus” accounts. But many so-called buyside market participants, such as asset managers, worry that their funds would be used to bail out other market participants, and could not be legally segregated, or separated, from the margins of others in the case of a default and subsequent bankruptcy process.Eurex Clearing’s new client asset protection service would allow “immediate portability of positions and assets in case of a clearing member default”, the clearer said. The service would apply to its US service, once that is launched, according to Thomas Book, the clearer’s executive board member for clearing.LCH.Clearnet already offers a similar service, which is increasingly being discussed in industry circles as asset managers and hedge funds assess the risks and costs of having to use clearing, as Dodd-Frank requires.At LCH.Clearnet, client funds are held in what it calls “operationally commingled, legally segregated” accounts, which is a different model from the Eurex model. This model is in use at the UK-based clearer’s OTC interest rate swaps clearing service, aimed at the buyside in the US, and launched this month.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet’s outgoing chief executive, said last week at the Futures Industry Association’s annual conference in Florida that giving customers the option of segregated accounts was important because “the risk that one client could submit an unrelated client to risk is incredibly dangerous”.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is considering the issue of segregated, versus omnibus accounts as part of its work of coming up with rules that will allow the industry to implement Dodd-Frank.Eurex Clearing said it was also launching interest rate swaps and OTC equity derivatives clearing. But it did not set a launch date. Mr Book said: “The further expansion of our product coverage is an important part of our strategic agenda enabling our customers to prepare for the new regulatory environment. We will offer all clearing services in the relevant asset classes to our clearing members and buyside clients to comply with new requirements in the most effective and capital efficient way.”The German clearer said it would also introduce a new “portfolio-based” risk management system that takes account of multiple positions held by trades across different asset classes, reducing the overall amount of margin that customers can use.
700;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-17T22:24:45Z;ICE chief cools talk of merger disruption;Such break-ups are ‘hard to do’, says Sprecher;IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), a US operator of commodity and derivatives exchanges, sought to damp speculation about its possible involvement in an attempt by Nasdaq OMX to break up the planned combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse saying such break-ups were “hard to do”.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said at a conference in Florida that ICE had “great experience” with disrupting deals. ICE in 2007 tried and failed in a bid for the Chicago Board of Trade, which had recently agreed to be sold to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. That bid eventually went through, creating what is now CME Group.“We have great experience with this and we see that breaking up other people’s mergers is hard to do,” Mr Sprecher told the Financial Times at a Futures Industry Association conference in Florida. “There has to be a really compelling proposition for shareholders and the markets.”However he would “neither confirm nor deny” whether he was involved in an attempt, led by Nasdaq OMX chief executive Bob Greifeld, to pull together a bid for NYSE Euronext, in an attempt to prise it away from Deutsche Börse.The US and German exchange operators last month unveiled an all-share deal that would see Deutsche Börse shareholders control 60 per cent of a new holding company, with NYSE Euronext shareholders holding the rest.People familiar with the matter said Mr Greifeld was locked in talks with bankers aimed at securing financing for a bid that would involve buying the cash equities and options business of NYSE Euronext.They said that Mr Greifeld believes the merger synergies outlined by the US and German operators of €300m ($420m) do not go far enough and that he could take more costs out, faster. “His cost-cutting would be taken more credibly,” one said.The people also said Mr Greifeld believed that NYSE Euronext shareholders may be more likely to consider an alternative offer given that NYSE Euronext’s shares have fallen in value by more than 9 per cent since the deal was unveiled, to just over $35 on Thursday, valuing the company at $9.3bn.However, Nasdaq’s shares have fallen sharply this week alone, and are down 12 per cent at $24.50.Craig Donohue, chief executive of CME Group, told the Financial Times: “I really do not think that bigger is better. What do you achieve through these types of transactions?”
701;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-17T02:03:30Z;CBOE to capitalise on market volatility;;The Chicago Board Options Exchange is moving to capitalise on growing interest in its Vix volatility indices, launching single-stock volatility options on companies, including Apple, amid a striking jump in volatility sparked by Japan’s devastating earthquake.Trading in the Vix, which measures implied volatility of S&P 500 index options, has rocketed higher following the sharp jump in crude oil prices amid chaos in Libya, and the spike in trading volumes and nervousness after the earthquake off Japan’s coast.On Tuesday, trading in Vix options and futures hit an all-time high, with more than 1m options contracts changing hands, blowing past the previous record of about 715,000 contracts in December 2009. Vix futures also saw a record, with 97,337 futures contracts changing hands.The Vix index has seen its volumes boom in the last two years, in spite of volatility in global markets dropping sharply in 2009 and 2010, as hedge funds make bets on the direction of volatility, and fund managers take advantage of its inverse correlation with stock prices.CBOE on Wednesday said it has asked for regulatory approval to create tradable Vix options for Apple, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Google and IBM. It also said it would begin publishing Vix measurements on a crude oil exchange-trade fund, a gold and a silver ETF, and on Chinese and Brazilian stock index ETFs.“It’s the right time, given the growing occupation with volatility around the world,” said William Brodsky, chief executive of CBOE, at the Futures Industry Association gathering in Boca Raton, Florida.The success of the Vix, which is a proprietary product of CBOE, has been a key part of the exchange’s survival as an independent company during a round of consolidation for trading venues, pushing CBOE’s to a level that makes it too expensive for another group to snap up.Mr Brodsky and CBOE also announced that it was forming a group of exchanges that have licensed the Vix to develop their own products. The group includes the Australian Securities Exchange, CME Group, Deutsche Borse and Toronto’s TMX Group.“The buzz on Vix is enormous,” Mr Brodsky said.CBOE also said it would begin publishing volatility measures on several ETFs, including the Crude Oil ETF based on the United States Oil Fund, the Market Vectors Gold Miners Fund and the FTSE China 25 index fund. CBOE started publishing those same measures on Apple and the of single stock Vix options in January, as a precursor to tradable instruments.
702;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-16T23:50:33Z;NYSE Euronext names first 10 clearing members;;NYSE Euronext named a group of 10 banks, brokers and proprietary trading firms as inaugural members of New York Portfolio Clearing, a clearing house behind the launch on Monday of the New York-based exchange’s attempt to break the CME Group domination of trading in interest rate and bond futures contracts.The move is the culmination of an 18-month effort by NYSE Euronext to prepare the ground for an assault on the CME’s Eurodollar futures business, which has repeatedly withstood challenges from earlier rivals, including by Euronext-Liffe, now the futures exchange known as NYSE Liffe and part of NYSE Euronext.The New York-based group, which is pursuing a merger with Deutsche Börse, hopes that it stands a chance of winning market share by allowing traders to reduce the total amount of margin collateral required by allowing the margin held in accounts for derivatives and cash-based fixed income products to be used.The system, known as “one-pot margining”, has been devised by New York Portfolio Clearing (NYPC), a new clearing house jointly owned and operated by NYSE Liffe and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US securities and bonds clearing and settlement group, also based in New York.Capital requirements will be cut by an average of 30 per cent, according to Walt Lukken, the NYPC chief executive. Speaking at the Futures Industry Association’s annual conference in Florida, he said that reducing the capital that market participants must post to clearing houses would be attractive at a time when capital was becoming more expensive because of the financial crisis, combined with new clearing obligations as a result of the Dodd-Frank act and Basel capital requirements for banks.Thomas Callahan, chief executive of NYSE Liffe US, the US platform of NYSE Liffe where the new contracts will be traded, said: “Capital efficiency is going to be key to generating liquidity. Market structure has never been so up for grabs.”The clearing members are Advantage Futures, Barclays Capital, Getco, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Ronin Capital, Rosenthal Collins Group, UBS Securities and futures brokers Newedge and MF Global.Getco and Ronin Capital, both proprietary trading firms, join market makers on NYSE Liffe US including Citadel, Goldman Sachs and DRW Trading.NYPC also said that Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank were in the process of becoming members.
703;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-15T14:58:45Z;Bombay exchange inks derivatives deal with ISE;;The latest sign of exchanges in western markets forging ties with those in Asia emerged on Tuesday as the Bombay Stock Exchange said it had signed a licensing agreement with the International Securities Exchange, the US options exchange owned by Deutsche Börse, to launch derivative contracts.The move also demonstrates how exchanges are using their ownership of index businesses to expand into Asia, and Asian exchanges. Deutsche Börse is a 5 per cent shareholder in the BSE.BSE will be seeking approval from Indian regulators to launch derivative products for Indian investors, based on ISE indices, as part of the BSE’s futures and options product portfolio.Kris Monaco, head of new product development at ISE, said: “ISE’s indexes provide investors with equity-based exposure to highly topical investment themes, including emerging markets, widely-traded commodities and water. We look forward to working with BSE as they broaden their derivatives business with new products based on ISE’s indexes.”This time last year the National Stock Exchange of India, BSE’s main rival, signed an arrangement with CME Group of the US, under which the Indian exchange’s S&P CNX Nifty index, the leading Indian benchmark index for large companies, will be made available to the Chicago operator for the creation and listing of US dollar-denominated futures contracts for trading on CME.At the same time CME said it would make the rights to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indices available to the Indian exchange for the creation and listing of rupee-denominated futures contracts for trading in India on the NSE.
704;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-15T13:45:37Z;Boca Beat: ICE gives the show a 2007 feel;;If the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) is about to launch a counter-offer for the derivatives business of NYSE Euronext, as part of a joint effort with Nasdaq OMX to break up the planned Deutsche Börse/NYSE Euronext deal, ICE chief executive Jeff Sprecher was giving away almost nothing on Monday night.Standing at the bar at the Boca Raton resort on the first night of the Futures Industry Association’s annual conference, all Mr Sprecher would say was: “I can’t say anything, I can’t legally anyway.” And that wasn’t just because company spokeswoman Kelly Loeffler – who is also his wife – was standing next to him.We may know later whether reports of a Nasdaq-ICE break-up are proven correct. But this, and the fate of the other two exchange mergers, were just about all that delegates were talking about as the conference prepared for record attendance. At 850 registered, this puts FIA Boca back up to levels last reached before the financial crisis in 2007.That year Mr Sprecher stole the show with a surprise counter-offer for the Chicago Board of Trade in an attempt to break up an agreed offer from CME Group. So when it comes to breaking up exchange M&A deals, Mr Sprecher certainly has form at Boca.As far as the idea goes, some analysts are coming round to the idea of a Nasdaq/ICE move, having previously been colder than lukewarm. Rich Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, tells FT Trading Room: “I think [Nasdaq OMX chief executive Bob] Greifeld believes he needs to take part in the current consolidation. But I am still sceptical.”On Monday, Ed Ditmire, an analyst at Macquarie, noted that while Nasdaq’s relatively indebted position means it cannot bid for NYSE Euronext by itself – current NYSE market capitalisation is also about double that of Nasdaq – by teaming up with ICE “each can bid for portions of NYSE Euronext which best mirror their own business, creating high overlaps/cost-synergies”.He thinks Nasdaq/ICE could put a $45 a share offer on the table, with Nasdaq paying $20 per share for NYSE excluding its Liffe European derivatives business, while ICE could pay $25a share for Liffe.Liffe would give Mr Sprecher a big European presence that he currently lacks. He could leverage his ICE Europe clearing house, which is already well-established, and steal a march on the CME in Europe. No coincidence, perhaps, that CME on Tuesday announced a date for the launch of clearing at its new London-based clearer.Mr Sprecher could also be making a very shrewd gamble on what happens on the regulatory front in Europe. We already know that European antitrust authorities are going to take a long, hard look at the planned combination of Liffe and Eurex under Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext proposal.If Brussels decides that it doesn’t like the idea of a derivatives powerhouse with interest rate futures at both ends of the yield curve, and thinks therefore that Liffe and Eurex should not be owned by the same operator, then having clear interest from ICE in ownership of Liffe may give regulators one more reason to look at the landscape this way.And in the US, a combined Nasdaq-NYSE would recreate market share in US cash equities in a single liquidity pool, just as BATS Global Markets is starting to look more of a threat with its recent Chi-X Europe deal, ambitions in Brazil and the possibility of an IPO. Plus Nasdaq-NYSE would be a US-US deal, which would make Chuck Schumer, senior Democratic senator for New York, no doubt happy.Meanwhile as exchanges duke it out, regulators are grappling with Dodd-Frank implementation and budget squeezes. Or so you would think.In an unusual twist, it turns out that four out of five Commodity Futures Trading Commission commissioners are attending FIA Boca. Yet the fifth commissioner, Gary Gensler, the chairman, is not. Instead, he will deliver his keynote address via video link-up from Washington, DC.Normally Mr Gensler attends in person. But this year he apparently wants to demonstrate that he is keeping a tight rein on CFTC spending by declining to travel to Florida.Besides, Mr Gensler will not have a ringside seat on the action should Mr Greifeld and Mr Sprecher decide to liven things up.
705;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-15T10:56:53Z;CME to begin European clearing in May;;CME Group’s new European clearing house will begin operations in May with 15 initial members and clearing in more than 150 over-the-counter energy and commodity derivative products.The Chicago-based company, the world’s largest futures exchange, said on Tuesday operations would begin on Friday 6 May and allow clearing in derivative products in energy, rapeseed oil and freight.Regulatory approval in December for CME’s proposed clearing house has prepared the next battleground between global clearing houses in the processing of OTC derivatives.The counterparty risk inherent in OTC trading was widely blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis, and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are keen for central counterparty clearing in the market in order to reduce the risk traditionally associated with such trades. CME hopes the move will better enable it to compete globally for business in clearing privately-negotiated derivatives.“The start of clearing at CME Clearing Europe is timely in light of the need for enhanced risk management in commodity markets and the imminent legislative change mandating the clearing of OTC derivatives,” said Andrew Lamb, chief executive officer of CME Clearing Europe.However there is still uncertainty in the industry about how profitable OTC derivatives clearing will be.Mr Lamb added: “While the initial focus of our product expansion will be on commodity products – energy, metals and agricultural – we aim to introduce clearing for OTC financial derivatives, beginning with interest rate swaps, in parallel with the deepening of the commodity clearing.”CME added that fifteen international financial companies were on track to become initial clearing members, including BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, MF Global UK, Newedge, State Street Bank and UBS.Citibank will also become a settlement bank alongside Barclays and JPMorgan. CME also said it would clear eight OTC contracts based on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange’s Oman crude oil futures contract.
706;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-13T09:14:29Z;CTAs: ‘true diversifiers’ with returns to boot;;The trials and tribulations of 2008 appeared to demonstrate all too cruelly the old investment adage “correlation is the only thing that goes up in a downturn”.Investors that had painstakingly built prudent, optimally diversified portfolios fared little better than those who rashly put all their eggs in one basket, as equities, corporate bonds, property, commodities and hedge funds all tumbled.But not quite every asset class incurred the wrath of investors in 2008. Managed futures funds, also known as commodity trading advisers, excelled, returning 17 per cent.If this was a flash in the pan it would be of little more than academic interest. But, in reality, the contrarian performance of managed futures funds – predominantly computer-driven, systematic trend-following vehicles – during downturns seems to be baked into markets’ DNA.AlphaMetrix Alternative Investment Advisors, a Chicago-based research company, and the CME Group analysed the 15 worst quarters for equities (as measured by the S&P 500) since 1987, during which the S&P fell at least 3.8 per cent.They found the BarclayHedge BTOP 50, an index of managed futures funds, made positive returns in 12 of these periods, including double-digit returns in the quarters encompassing Black Monday, Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, the Long-Term Capital Management crisis and the bursting of the dotcom bubble. Of the three negative quarters, the worst was a loss of 3.7 per cent.Similar analysis by London-based Frontier Investment Management found positive returns during all five of the equity bear markets since 1980.Furthermore, Frontier found managed futures funds also made a positive return in each of the six bull markets of the past 30 years.And although they typically underperformed the markets during these bull periods, the Center for International Securities & Derivatives Markets CTA Asset-Weighted Index (minus 1 per cent a year to correct for survivorship and other biases) returned 2,491 per cent in nominal terms between January 1980 and December 2010, outstripping the 1,320 per cent total return of the MSCI World equity index.“Managed futures is an insurance policy that doesn’t cost. It generates a return in most years. I love the asset class, it has so much going for it,” says Michael Azlen, executive chairman of Frontier.“It has performed so well when everything is becoming more correlated. Commodities, real estate, even hedge funds are becoming more correlated to equities.”Ranjan Bhaduri, chief research officer at AlphaMetrix, concurs, adding: “When equity markets are rising there is a positive, non-trivial correlation [between managed futures and equities] and they have a negative correlation when the markets are going down. That is the best case scenario.“They are a true diversifier that over time produce an attractive risk-adjusted return. They should be a core part of any portfolio regardless of one’s risk appetite,” says Mr Bhaduri, who defines managed futures funds as the subset of the hedge fund universe that purely trade highly liquid instruments such as futures, options and foreign exchange, and can thus include some non-trend following and discretionary managers, as well the core systematic trend followers.This liquidity gives managed futures funds another advantage over other types of hedge funds – investors generally do not have to lock up capital for long periods or be hit with gates, suspensions or sidepockets when things go wrong.Mr Azlen regards managed futures as a separate asset class to hedge funds, thanks to the markedly different return stream it provides.As to where these returns come from, Mr Azlen suggests behavioural factors, driven by the opposing emotions of fear and greed, create the trends these funds can surf.In essence, trend-following funds appear to benefit from the momentum effect that has been observed in equity markets – buying the previous year’s winners and selling the losers appears to deliver solid long-term outperformance – suggesting this effect is not confined to equity markets.“They are engineered to take advantage of a trend. If there is a bear market or recession then a good trend follower should be able to take advantage of that trend,” says Mr BhaduriHe acknowledges some downsides to the sector, namely that returns can be “lumpy”, not the steady 1-2 per cent a month some investors seem to expect, while the often “black box” nature of many funds mean investors need to conduct “prudent” due diligence.Leon Beukes, head of the multi-strategy hedge fund team at Towers Watson, echoes this latter point. The consultant has historically not had any exposure to managed futures in its client portfolios, because “we didn’t get comfortable with the level of transparency from managers”, who closely guard the secrets of their proprietary trading strategies.However, Mr Beukes says managers are increasingly keen to attract “stickier” institutional money and “have become more open and more willing to give detail on their process”.As a result, Towers Watson is revisiting the largest managers. “Potentially there could be a role for CTAs in client portfolios,” says Mr Beukes.Jeff Holland, managing director of Liongate Capital Management, a $3bn fund of hedge fund manager, also avoids CTAs, on the grounds that they can complicate the construction of a balanced portfolio, saying: “There is a danger that you can concentrate the portfolio too much on, say, commodity exposure. [CTAs] can be short one day and long the next.”In comparison, Mr Bhaduri argues that managed futures funds should account for half of the typical investor’s exposure to hedge funds.
707;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-09T01:04:23Z;Indonesian traders enter global market;;The Indonesia Commodity & Derivatives Exchange (ICDX) said domestic traders could now trade abroad on foreign exchanges – including CME Group and the New York Board of Trade – for the first time.The move highlights how the barriers that have prevented local traders in Asia’s fast-growing commodity derivatives markets accessing trading opportunities abroad are coming down, as regulations are relaxed and technology is making connections easier.It also comes as big western exchange groups, such as CME, are forging links with commodity exchanges in emerging markets as a way of tapping into new customer bases.CME Group in 2009 forged an alliance with Bursa Malaysia to allow the Kuala Lumpur-based exchange’s customers to access CME products in the US.Separately, the Taiwan Futures Exchange (Taifex) is in talks with CME Group to list Taifex’s index futures on CME’s Globex trading platform.“We hope to attract more foreign institutions to trade on our market through Globex,” said Steve Wang, Taifex president.Jakarta-based ICDX offers trading in derivatives on metals, soft agricultural products and energy.Megain Widjaja, the exchange’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that legislation had been passed last year that would allow domestic traders to access foreign markets. Overseas trading had been previously executed by a combination of phone broking and overseas accounts.“We really need to think how to make ICDX more accessible to a broader audience. We just completed the infrastructure and trading systems last week. Now we can allow Indonesian participants to actually trade offshore products,” Mr Widjaja said.“The system was up and running as of last week and we have brokers already signed up. Licences were granted and everything is in place.“Brokers are offering to their clients. Through this we will give them direct access to CME and Nybot.”The move does not involve any alliance with CME or Nybot – the New York Board of Trade, a commodity exchange operated by IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), a CME rival.The arrangement initially involves three local brokers: Sinar Mas, Millennium and Phillips.In 2009, ICDX picked Patsystems, a UK-based trading technology company, to provide the exchange with a new trading system, which will be used to help traders connect abroad.www.ft.com/tradingroom
708;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-07T22:58:22Z;Traders build up record bets against the dollar;US currency hits four-month low against euro;"The dollar dropped to a four-month low against the euro after figures showed that traders had built up record bets against the US currency.Positioning data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, widely seen as a proxy for hedge fund activity, revealed that the value of bets against the dollar rose $11.5bn in the week to March 1 to $39bn, $3bn more than the previous record of $36bn in 2007.Traders said the dollar was suffering given expectations that the Federal Reserve was likely to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy in coming months as other big central banks raised interest rates.This contrast was heightened last week as Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, warned that “strong vigilance” on inflation was warranted, a phrase used throughout the bank’s 2005-08 rate-tightening cycle to pave the way for a rate increase at the next governing council meeting.Jane Foley, of Rabobank, said Mr Trichet’s comments had cemented the view that the ECB would raise interest rates well before the Fed. “Interest rates are set to remain a solid support for the euro against the dollar this year; we see the euro at $1.50 towards the end of the year,” she said.The dollar dropped to a low of $1.4037 against the euro on Monday, its weakest level since early November. The dollar index, which tracks its progress against a basket of six major currencies, also fell to a four-month low of 76.124.However, by late trading in New York, the dollar had rebounded slightly as stocks fell. The index rose 0.1 per cent to 76.48, though the yen was still stronger by 0.1 per cent, at Y82.28.Kathleen Brooks, of Forex.com, said the dollar index was at a pivotal level, with a break below 76 potentially opening the way for momentum traders to target the benchmark’s record low of 71.80.However, she warned that these big technical levels warranted caution. “While the downside pressures continue to threaten the dollar, stretched positioning in one direction increases the chances of a reversal,” she said."
709;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-07T22:15:47Z;US considers mass mortgage write down;;It was the rant from Chicago that resounded in Washington. In 2009, Rick Santelli, a reporter from CNBC, captured the mood of a sizeable portion of the country when he railed against government efforts to “subsidise the losers’ mortgages”.To cheers from the CME Group’s trading floor, he went on to say: “This is America! How many of you people want to pay for your neighbours’ mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can’t pay their bills?”Two years’ on, the centrist president’s manoeuvring and the slow economic recovery have dampened ardour for anti-government demonstrations that Mr Santelli and the Tea Party movement displayed.But now the Obama administration is involved in talks that would go much further than the mortgage modification efforts of 2009, going so far as to write down the principal– the debt outstanding – on thousands of mortgages.Rather than rely on a recalcitrant Congress to launch the scheme, the funding mechanism is a neat one: the 14 biggest mortgage servicers would pay up to $20bn of the cost as punishment for a series of failures that led to foreclosures being halted across the country last year.Principal writedown has long been advocated by consumer groups as the most efficient way to help the biggest possible group of struggling homeowners. Conflicting incentives and the resources needed for voluntary loan modification programmes have kept the effort modest so far.On Monday, protesters’ picketed a conference of the attorneys general in Washington, calling on them to push ahead with big fines and mandatory principal writedowns.Government officials agree the bang for the buck from principal writedown would be large. A one-off reduction, perhaps to a 97 per cent loan-to-value ratio, would kick-start the housing market and improve consumer confidence, they say.But others remain sceptical. There are the administration officials who worry about the political impact, the reawakening of Santelli-style protests as thousands of prudent Americans watch less fortunate or more reckless neighbours receive a bail-out.In the second camp are regulators who think it might not be legally justifiable to use fines from the foreclosure mess as funding for such a programme.It has been widely assumed that banks will accept whatever terms are put to them to draw a line under the issue and avoid reigniting anger. But some officials fear an outsized fine that cannot be justified by harm perpetrated on homeowners could be struck down in court.It is still unclear whether all the agencies will sign on to the same terms. The attorneys general last week sent a proposal to the banks that include new procedures to make it easier for delinquent borrowers to lower mortgage payments through loan modification.The new procedures would prohibit banks from foreclosing on borrowers while the terms of their loan are being considered for a modification, a practice that has become common in the current housing crisis.The banks will have an opportunity to present a formal response to the settlement terms before negotiations begin. None of the major banks under investigation would comment on the investigation or the proposed settlement.
710;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-03T01:33:56Z;Battle for US interest-rate futures intensifies;;The war for the US interest-rate futures market will officially kick off on March 21, when NYSE Euronext launches a trading and clearing initiative aimed at wresting a slice of the business from CME Group.Chicago-based CME, the largest US futures exchange, controls about 98 per cent of the US market, but NYSE Liffe, NYSE Euronext’s US futures arm, has been preparing an assault on the dominant player for two years. Rather than attempt to attract business by undercutting CME – as previous efforts have targeted– NYSE Euronext is hoping to lure traders by offering greater capital efficiency.In collaboration with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade services group that clears cash equities, the exchange group will offer “one-pot margining” at New York Portfolio Clearing (NYPC), a clearing house for Treasury futures. Its backers envisage that NYPC will enable dealers to post margin for both kinds of products in a “single pot”, which would, in effect, mean that traders hedging their cash positions with futures would be able to save on margin costs. On Wednesday, after two years of preparation, NYPC finally secured all the regulatory approvals it needs to launch Eurodollar futures on March 21 and US Treasury futures on March 28. CME struck what appeared to be intended as a pre-emptive blow against the initiative on Monday by announcing its own plan to offer cross-margining between eurodollars and US Treasury bond futures, in an attempt to undermine NYPC. “Imitation is the highest form of flattery,” Walt Lukken, chief executive of NYPC, said in reference to CME’s announcement. Mr Lukken and Tom Callahan, chief executive of NYSE Liffe US, both said the CME proposal was so far little more than a press release and said they awaited the details. CME denies its venture comes in response to NYPC, saying it has been preparing to offer cross-margining for a year. Chicago’s futures exchanges created Treasury futures in the 1970s: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange developed contracts on short-term Treasuries, while the Chicago Board of Trade launched longer-term contracts. The former bought the latter for $11bn in 2007, creating CME Group, which controls almost the entire US Treasury futures business.
711;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Brazil’s own exchange, BM&FBovespa, has also sought to open itself up to the world via its partnership with Chicago-based CME Group and expansion plans in Asia.“Brazil is one of the world’s most dynamic economies and an increasingly important producer of crude oil,” said David Peniket, president and chief operating officer at ICE Futures Europe. “We are delighted to be able to respond to demand for ICE products, particularly given the increased reliance on the benchmark ICE Brent Crude Oil futures contract.”Brazil’s financial regulator, the Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM), authorised the access to ICE Futures Europe products via ICE’s trading screens in the country. ICE Futures US has already been approved to provide screen-based access to its markets in Brazil since October 2009.Oil futures are particularly in demand in Brazil as the country prepares to exploit huge reserves recently discovered deep beneath the ocean floor off the southern coast. The so-called “sub-salt field”, which is thought to hold more than 50bn barrels of oil, would turn Brazil into one of the world’s top energy producers.

In this way, NYPC aims to build market share by appealing to traders’ desire for capital efficiency.NYSE Euronext has long touted the venture as a long-term challenge to the CME’s dominance over the market. However, CME Group, operator of the largest US futures exchange, struck a pre-emptive blow against the initiative on Monday by announcing a plan to offer cross-margining between eurodollars and US Treasury bond futures, in a clear attempt to undermine NYPC.Chicago’s futures exchanges created Treasury futures in the 1970s: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange developed contracts on short-term Treasuries, while the Chicago Board of Trade launched longer-term contracts. The former bought the latter for $11bn in 2007, creating CME Group, which controls almost the entire US Treasury futures business.CME’s “early response” suggests it takes the NYPC threat seriously. At the same time, CME is starting from a position of dominance. It would take a seismic shift in industry behaviour to make a significant impact on its market share.NYPC’s “one-pot margining” proposal still awaits approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before a scheduled launch this month.
714;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-03-01T12:51:55Z;EC official urges OTC derivatives reform;;European regulations to reform derivatives and clearing markets should be extended to exchange-traded derivatives and not limited to over-the-counter (OTC) products, according to the top official in charge of the European Commission’s financial reforms.Patrick Pearson, head of the Commission’s unit spearheading reform of the OTC derivatives markets, told the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament on Monday that the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) should be extended to so-called listed, or on-exchange, derivatives.The development marks a fresh drive by European regulators to push for more competition in derivatives markets in a bid to break up virtual monopolies in on-exchange futures and options markets – such as the one operated by Deutsche Börse, the German exchange. The UK Treasury is understood to support Mr Pearson’s view.But it also highlights a battle raging in Europe over the shape of market structures such as clearing, where the “vertical silo” model of exchanges owning clearing houses is gaining traction amid a wave of global exchange mergers.A furious lobbying battle has broken out between proponents of greater competition in all derivatives markets – such as the banks that are large customers of exchanges, opposed to such silos – and exchanges that own their own clearing houses. Deutsche Börse has been at the forefront of efforts in Brussels to keep its model intact.Mr Pearson’s comments cast a cloud over the proposed combination of Deutsche Börse with NYSE Euronext, unveiled two weeks ago. That would create the world’s largest exchange, ahead of the CME Group of the US by revenues. Its rationale is partly based on the survival of the group’s vertical silo and its ability to squeeze savings and greater revenues from it.The deal would cement the position of Deutsche Börse’s Eurex derivatives exchange, since it would involve folding it in with the NYSE Liffe derivatives business run by NYSE Euronext. That in turn would create a derivatives powerhouse in Europe, with clearing running exclusively through the Eurex Clearing business that Deutsche Börse controls.NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse declined to comment.Much of the €100m in revenue synergies that the two groups have proposed stem from streamlining their two derivatives businesses and benefiting from the use of a single clearer, with Liffe Clear, NYSE Liffe’s clearer, potentially ceasing operations.However any move to open up exchange-traded derivatives to competition would threaten that plan. One industry official in London said: “This [Mr Pearson’s comment] is obviously significant and material.”Mr Pearson’s views carry weight as he is the lead official on the Commission’s efforts to push G20 reforms of the financial, system in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008. They mirror new rules enshrined in the Dodd-Frank act, passed by the US administration last July.At the same time the Commission has been pushing for clearing houses to open up to each other in cash equities market to allow investors a choice over where their trades are cleared – so-called interoperability.Werner Langen, a German MEP who is steering Emir through the Parliament, has caused anguish among banks and brokers by wanting to abandon attempts to pursue interoperability. He wants references to it removed from Emir. That is seen as a further sign of the strength of the lobby in favour of maintaining vertical silos, which would stand to lose if interoperability were to be mandated.Stephen Burton, director at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, which represents banks and brokers, said: “User choice and flexibility are essential to well functioning markets and important to enabling economic recovery in Europe.”However it is not clear how much support the idea of extending Emir to listed derivatives has. Significant sections of the European Parliament are in favour of keeping the scope of Emir to OTC derivatives.Sharon Bowles, a British MEP who chairs the Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, has been a critic of silos. “This is a battleground and I’m not sure that we’re going to win it but I am still fighting for it. We should still have interoperability and we should broaden it out to listed derivatives for a variety of reasons. One is attacking silos, another is creating a level playing field.”In an early draft of Emir, the regulation stipulated that a clearing house that has been authorised to clear eligible OTC derivatives must accept for clearing contacts from any trading venue, not merely a trading venue belonging to the exchange group that owns the clearer.In the latest draft, approved under the Hungarian presidency of the European Union, the text no longer includes the acronym “OTC”, meaning that Emir would now apply to exchange-traded derivatives as well.The effect is that Emir could force Eurex Clearing to accept derivatives for clearing from competing exchange groups, and allowing contracts traded at Eurex to be cleared somewhere else. Dodd-Frank is limited to OTC derivatives.One official told FT Trading Room: “We have decided to broaden the scope as there is no need to split up walls between on-exchange and off-exchange products. If OTC is put on platforms and required [to be] cleared, why should there be a different regime with listed products?”A key hurdle for Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext will be whether European antitrust authorities will approve the creation of a single derivatives powerhouse, with clearing done exclusively under it.However the call for Emir to be extended to exchange-traded derivatives could alter the picture, industry experts said. “We are entering a dangerous mandated vertical world unless we get this right,” one Brussels-based industry expert said.At stake is whether Europe is prepared to preserved the silo in Europe as a counterweight to a similar model that exists in the US in the form of the CME Group and its 98 per cent market share in futures trading, or whether Europe believes that silos are anti-competitive and act as a barrier to new entrants and lower transaction costs.If Europe decides to undermine vertical silos, that could pave the way for US exchanges – such as CME - to enter the European market and compete with Deutsche Börse and others. Yet at the same time European exchanges would not have reciprocal access to the US, since the CME would retain control of 98 per cent of the futures market under a protected vertical silo model.
715;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-28T17:07:38Z;CME launches pre-emptive attack on NYSE Liffe;;CME Group, operator of the largest US futures exchange, has launched a pre-emptive strike against rival exchange operator NYSE Euronext by offering cross-margining between its two flagship futures products in a bid to undermine similar plans by its New York rival.The move aims to cut the cost of using the CME’s products – the two most widely traded futures contracts in the world – by reducing the total amount of upfront margin payments that must be made to trade them.It comes only weeks after NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse unveiled plans to combine, creating what would be the world’s largest exchange and one that would create a major competitor to the CME.NYSE Euronext had already been working, through its NYSE Liffe futures exchange, on a plan to challenge the CME’s near-monopoly of trading in interest rate futures, known as eurodollars.NYSE Liffe plans to offer eurodollars and two-year, five-year, 10-year and 30-year US Treasury futures this quarter.NYSE Liffe has teamed up with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the New York-based post-trade services group, to offer cross-margining, meaning that traders do not have to post margin for each asset class they trade, only one lower amount taking into consideration so-called “risk offsets” between products.But on Monday the CME said it would offer similar cross-margining between eurodollars and US Treasury bond futures, in a clear attempt to undermine NYSE Liffe’s effort before it is launched. In some cases, the margin put up by traders could be cut by up to 65 per cent, CME said.Derek Samman, CME’s managing director of interest rate and FX products, told the FT the cross-margining idea had been in the works for about two years and “had not been dreamed up in the last couple of weeks or months”. It would reduce margin requirements for customers at a time “when, post-Lehman, capital efficiency is absolutely at the top of customers’ minds”.The move sets the stage for the biggest battle between rival US exchanges since the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, now operated by CME Group, faced an attack on its eurodollar complex in 2003 from Euronext-Liffe, which was later acquired by New York Stock Exchange group to become NYSE Euronext.CME said it had created a new class of clearing membership, Financial Instruments Clearing Membership, which it planned to make available by the end of the first quarter.It would provide margin offsets of up to 65 per cent to qualified firms that trade both US Treasury securities and interest rate futures products.Bryan Durkin, CME group’s chief operating officer, said the move was designed to offer “greater capital efficiencies, enabling firms to trade cash/futures strategies in a highly cost-effective manner”.CME said a number of trading firms, including Breakwater Trading, Endeavor Trading, Henning-Carey Proprietary Trading, and HTG Capital Partners, had “tested and validated” the FICM membership and were working with CME Group to become FICM members.The group said a full CME clearing member must sponsor the FICM and act as the firm’s “facilities manager” to transact in the US Treasury securities market.
716;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Fears over CFTC derivatives rule;Move could hamper key strategy in round of exchange mergers;"Leading US exchanges are gravely concerned about proposed rules that could hamper the launch of new derivatives products – a key strategy in the current round of exchange mergers.The issue revolves around a rule proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that 85 per cent of annual trading in a futures contract or swap must occur on an exchange, or what is called a Designated Contract Market.The regulator wants to prevent the growth of block trading away from the
central market.But the rule has aroused the enmity of 11 exchanges in a series of comment letters posted on the CFTC’s website this week.Under the rule, if a contract does not meet the 85 per cent threshold on a DCM, it must migrate to another market venue.This can include SEFs, the new trading platforms for trading over-the-counter derivatives under the Dodd-Frank Act.It means that exchanges planning to create new products to attract market share away from OTC swaps face a huge hurdle getting enough volume inside a 12-month period.CME Group was one of 11 exchanges to criticise the rule with comments also issued by Intercontinental-Exchange and ELX Futures.Craig Donohue, chief executive of CME, said in the exchanges comment letter: “The 85 per cent requirement will significantly deter the development of new products by existing exchanges like CME Group and likewise deter any new futures exchanges from being established.”He added: “New futures products often initially build open interest and gain trading momentum in off-exchange transactions, and in many instances, it takes years before trading on the centralized market becomes the predominant mode of trading.”NYSE Euronext, via its US derivatives subsidiary, NYSE Liffe US, was also critical.Janet McGinness, corporate secretary at NYSE Liffe US, wrote: “It is also puzzling why the Commission would establish a set of rules that would tend to move contracts from the more highly regulated environment of a DCM to a less regulated platform such as an SEF.”A significant selling point of NYSE’s proposed merger with Deutsche Börse is the opportunity to compete with SEFs in the OTC market.Reto Francioni, chairman of the new entity, said that, “together, we are much stronger to tackle OTC”.The merger will combine Eurex and Liffe to create a dominant European derivatives exchange.NYSE Liffe US is set to launch interest-rate futures in the next month.Some analysts believe that Deutsche Börse will register as a clearing house in the US but that might change if the rules are adopted.Diego Perfumo, an analyst at Equity Research Desk, said: “What the new company does depends on regulation. Rather than bring their European clearing to the US, they might start to launch their new products in Europe to escape this kind of regulation from the CFTC.”"
717;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-24T00:20:52Z;US crude oil price hits $100 for an instant;;US crude oil briefly touched $100 a barrel the same way it first reached three digits in 2008: after a lone trader bought a single futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange floor.Benchmark West Texas Intermediate for April delivery was trading at $99.84 a barrel at 1:05pm on Wednesday in New York when 1,000 barrels – the minimum trade size – changed hands in the crude futures pit at $100.00 a barrel, brokers said.The price level made headlines as the crisis in Libya inflamed worries about supplies and commodity inflation.But $100 WTI lasted less than a second, with the price settling up 2.8 per cent at $98.10 and causing a loss for the trader if he were to exit his position. The fleeting event recalled the first time WTI touched $100, on January 2 2008. A trader at ConAgra Trade Group, then a unit of ConAgra Foods, said he had waited three months for oil to reach $100, which he called “the big one”, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.When he called his floor broker to become the first to buy crude at $100, electronic markets were about 40 cents lower, the CFTC said. ConAgra Foods and Gavilon, the trade group’s current owner, paid $12m to settle charges that a “non-bona fide price” was reported to the exchange.The trader who bought Wednesday’s $100 oil contract declined to come to a phone when sought on the Nymex floor. CFTC and Nymex parent CME Group declined to comment.His trade was also uncommon because most futures volume changes hands on electronic screens, not on the Nymex floor in lower Manhattan. People continue to trade oil options on the floor, forming a backdrop for financial television, but the futures pit is a calm place.WTI prices have lagged behind Brent, the European benchmark, as oil inventories have risen to records at the Nymex crude delivery point in Oklahoma. Brent settled on Wednesday at $111.25 a barrel on the all-electronic ICE Futures Europe exchange.But WTI futures trading volumes have this year broken records as volatility returns and more traders connect via electronic platforms. WTI futures volume totalled about 1.3m contracts on Wednesday.After WTI first breached $100 a barrel in 2008, it surged above $147 by July, then plunged as low as $32 the following December.
718;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-23T17:10:15Z;D. Börse takes majority stake in EEX;;Deutsche Börse has taken a majority stake in European Energy Exchange, the German energy exchanges group, as it expands its business beyond stock and derivatives trading.The German exchanges operator secured an option, via its Eurex derivatives platform, to buy the 22.96 per cent shareholding in EEX owned by Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in December. On Wednesday it secured a majority of EEX shareholders who agreed to waive their pre-emption rights to buy the stake.Eurex and EEX, which operate platforms to trade emissions rights and power derivatives, have had trading and clearing ties for more than three years.Eurex will pay €7.75 per share, valuing the equity of EEX at just over €310m. The move comes as many of the world’s largest exchanges are looking to deepen their push into the commodities trading market.Stock market-focused exchanges such as Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, which have announced plans to merge, have seen their market capitalisations rivalled by commodity and futures exchanges like CME Group, owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Intercontinental Exchange.EEX has already signalled its interest in operating the new central platform for carbon auctions in the European emissions trading scheme. The European Commission is preparing for a radical reshaping of carbon permit auctions in its scheme and wants its new central platform to be an exchange.The first tender to EEX shareholders saw 31 of the 40 eligible voters agree to forego a proportional increase in their stake. It will mean Eurex’s stake will rise from 35.2 per cent to more than 50 per cent although the final total will be determined by the results of a second tender.Earlier this week NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Börse’s planned merger partner, finalised its plans for a joint venture with US-based APX, to expand its trading volume in electricity, renewable energy and carbon dioxide allowances.Called NYSE BlueSM, the venture will see NYSE Euronext fold its 60 per cent stake in BlueNext, the Paris-based exchange for spot trading of carbon dioxide allowances. APX will contribute its systems for trading and settling power and environmental contracts in the US.The two parties have agreed to maintain current EEX jobs at the group’s headquarters in Leipzig. The deal requires regulatory approval but the Exchange Supervisory Authority in Saxony and the German Federal Cartel Office have already given their consent, EEX said.
719;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-22T22:37:00Z;NYSE expects full antitrust inquiry into D Börse merger;;Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext expect it could take up to a year for European competition regulators to decide whether to clear their proposed merger and that authorities will want to conduct a full investigation, a top NYSE Euronext executive said.Dominique Cerutti, deputy chief executive at NYSE Euronext, said on Tuesday it was “likely” that the European Commission, Europe’s top antitrust watchdog, would open a “phase two” inquiry.He remained confident, however, that the deal would not ultimately pose problems for regulators. “We understand the competition review is going to be intense,” Mr Cerutti said, adding that he expected concerns to focus primarily on Europe rather than on the US, where he saw fewer challenges.Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext last week published details of a plan to combine their businesses, whose combined exchanges and clearing houses would generate an annual €4bn ($5.5bn) in revenues, more than any other exchange group. CME Group of the US would be next biggest with €2.3bn.The German-US combination would also create the dominant derivatives exchange in Europe by merging Liffe – NYSE Euronext’s futures and options exchange – with Deutsche Börse’s Eurex platform. Some market participants expressed concerns about the market power exerted by such a combination, although they noted it would be similar to that wielded in comparable products at the CME Group, which held 98 per cent market share of futures trading in the US.Mr Cerutti was speaking in Brussels shortly before meeting Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner.Mr Cerutti described it as a “preliminary” encounter with the European official, in which he hoped to explain the deal “with more colour” before the two companies made a formal filing with the commission. That is likely to take place within the next several weeks.The two exchange operators are expected to argue that derivatives trading is a global business, as the CME stated in 2007 when its proposed takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade was set to form what became the dominant futures exchange in the US. That deal was eventually approved by the US Department of Justice.
720;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-22T19:36:39Z;LCH.Clearnet in interest rate swaps drive;;LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearing house, said it would launch clearing for non-bank users of interest rate swaps next month, setting the stage for a showdown with CME Group of the US.The move creates the next battleground between global clearing houses in the processing of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives since some of them launched clearing of credit default swaps in 2009.It also comes amid growing uncertainty over how profitable OTC derivatives clearing will be as the industry looks to make sense of how the Dodd-Frank Act, passed last year, should be implemented.Bruce Hamilton, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said: “There is still some uncertainty on regulatory reform and hence the overall economics and structure of the infrastructure space.”LCH.Clearnet – owned by market participants– said its SwapClear interest rate clearing service would launch in the US for non-bank users of such derivatives, known collectively as the “buyside”, on March 8.SwapClear has dominated clearing of OTC interest rate swaps traded between dealers for a decade. But its move into the clearing of products that are used by non-banks such as asset managers, hedge funds and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the US mortgage lenders, marks its entry into a market segment where the Dodd-Frank Act requires the use of clearing for the first time.The interest rate swaps market is likely to be hotly contested since it is 10 times larger than the CDS market. Nasdaq OMX is also trying to compete in clearing of interest rate swaps through International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearer set up over a year ago.LCH.Clearnet has been forced to come up with an innovative clearing solution for the US, where some market participants had been uneasy about the clearer’s London base. Bankruptcy laws, important in the management of a default, differ in the UK from those in the US.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, guaranteeing that a deal is completed even if one party defaults. The Dodd-Frank Act gives “futures commission merchants” (FCMs) a key role in acting as broker between OTC derivatives user and clearing house.LCH.Clearnet said its US customers would access LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear service through a US-based FCM “of their choice . . . under [US] regulation”.
721;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Quick View: Battleground drawn for carbon exchanges;EU’s main polluters opt out of auction platform;The European Commission wants to create a pan European carbon emissions trading platform as part of its grand ambitions to cut greenhouse gases under the Kyoto protocol. So it is a bit of blow when Europe’s three biggest polluters decide not to join the EC’s centralised auctioning platform.Spain – part of a group of four main refuseniks – may have decided this weekend to join the scheme. But the UK, Germany and Poland decided to hold back, preferring to conduct their own national auctions.EU member states had until the weekend to decide whether they would participate in a centralised auctioning platform or conduct their own national auctions.Their refusal to join is a serious blow to the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), to be introduced in 2013 with the aim of improving liquidity and price transparency in this market. It also adds a further twist to the drama surrounding cyberthefts. The states’ decisions not to join were in part motivated by security concerns over a new centralised platform.Last month’s scare around security of carbon permits in registries has left the market wary. It highlighted the differences between each country for investor protection and confusion still remains over the legal ownership of outstanding permits that have crossed borders.It sounds technical, but the ETS remains a vital component in a coming radical change in the carbon trading market in two years’ time. It was set up to help achieve the EU’s Kyoto goal of cutting greenhouse gases by 8 per cent by 2012, by imposing caps on emissions from energy-intensive industries, such as steel, cement and power generation. The decision by the UK, Germany and Poland to go their own way introduces complications to a market that the participants, such as electricity and gas companies, want simplified. As a rule, they would prefer a single auction platform with harmonised rules.Germany has argued that the stability of trade will profit when it is spread over different national platforms instead of a central one. Others worry that it will add unnecessary costs while having several venues make it more difficult to provide a robust price signal.But the biggest issue is likely to be between the banks and exchanges to see who hosts both the new central platform and the national auctions.European Energy Exchange, the German body, has already registered its interest and it is unlikely to have gone unnoticed at rivals such as ICE Futures Europe, part of Intercontinental Exchange, Bluenext – founded by NYSE Euronext and Caisse des Depots – and Green Exchange, owned by a mixture of banks, brokers and CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange.Let battle commence.
722;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-18T18:23:45Z;BM&FBovespa open to Asian partners;;Brazil’s BM&FBovespa, Latin America’s largest exchange operator, said it is looking to grow through partnerships in China, Hong Kong, India and even Japan as it battles for market share in a rapidly changing industry.“There is no doubt that Asia is where we see the possibility of development and growth,” Edemir Pinto, chief executive, told reporters on Friday after the release of the group’s fourth quarter results.The exchange operator told the Financial Times earlier this week that it will sign a memorandum of understanding next week with the Shanghai Stock Exchange, with the view to the eventual cross-listing of stocks.“China has a volume five times as big as we do…it’s a market with spectacular potential,” said Mr Pinto. But he added that it was more of a “medium to long-term project” because of regulation issues and the closed nature of the Shanghai market. “Sometimes you need to sign an agreement just to have lunch with the Chinese,” he joked.The exchange operator beat market expectations for the fourth quarter, increasing its net income nearly 19 per cent against the same quarter a year earlier to R$261.5m. Net profit for the full-year was R$1.14bn ($6.86m), up nearly 30 per cent since 2009 as investors flocked to emerging markets such as Brazil.Net revenue rose 10.7 per cent to R$470.1m in the fourth quarter and 25.8 per cent for the full-year to R$1.89bn. High-frequency trading, which accounted for 5.7 per cent of the total traded volume in January 2011, is also expected to help drive growth this year.However, BM&FBovespa, the world’s fourth-largest exchange operator by market value, is now facing the prospect of competition from a new alliance led by BATS Global Markets, the alternative trading venue, and Claritas, the Brazilian asset manager.The pair announced this week an agreement to explore the creation of a new trading platform with its own clearing and depository services to challenge the BM&FBovespa’s virtual monopoly. This comes as other national incumbents are seeking to protect their market positions through equity tie-ups.Mr Pinto said he welcomed the competition and was confident BM&FBovespa could increase trading volumes through its various partnerships, rather than outright acquisitions.Its existing partnership with the Chicago-based CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, is likely to grow, but Mr Pinto denied speculation the two were engaged in discussions over a possible merger.“We’re partners with CME and partners get closer, they fall in love…they can even separate. But everything indicates this love affair is going well.”
723;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-17T22:56:29Z;Quick View: Why CME will not go for NYSE Euronext;;"Duncan Niederauer has for the first time addressed the lack of a counter-bid for NYSE Euronext, since the exchange operator he heads unveiled its tie-up with Deutsche Börse to create the world’s largest exchange. At a briefing with the Financial Times in London, I asked him if he was surprised that the CME Group had not yet showed its hand or tried to break up the party. Some media have reported that the Chicago-based CME – possibly with Nasdaq in tow – was preparing a counter-strike.He answered: ”We saw the same rumours you saw. You’ve also seen the statements by the CME since then. I’m personally not surprised given the complexity of our business.”Mr Niederauer would not comment further. But to anyone who has followed the exchange business, it should come as no surprise that the CME has not yet come in. For a start, buying NYSE Euronext would be a can of worms for the CME, even if getting NYSE Liffe, its futures exchange, has its attractions.The last thing the CME wants is to be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is what would automatically happen if it bought an exchange – or even parts of one – that operate a stock or options exchange – as NYSE Euronext does. The SEC oversees stock and options exchanges while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates futures.Many people say that the CME has got the CFTC pretty much where it wants it to be on many issues that matter to the Chicago derivatives guys. The SEC would be a whole other ballgame and not nearly as …friendly. At least there is the risk of that, so why go there and become SEC regulated?Secondly, CME really is not interested in cash equities. In fact, Chicago views cash equities with the disdain that the New Yorkers used to have for Chicago’s derivatives business (until they realised that’s where the margin, growth and excitement are). Some analysts seem to be coming around to the view that no counter-bid is likely. On Thursday, Patrick O’Shaughnessy of Raymond James downgraded NYSE Euronext to “market perform” from “outperform”, on the grounds that a bidding war was “unlikely”.He added: “There are only a small number of exchanges with the size to make an unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext, and some of the possible combinations tossed around have serious flaws. Furthermore, the modest premium that Deutsche Börse is paying for NYSE Euronext relative to our standalone fair value estimate, as well as the value creation for NYSE Euronext shareholders from the proposed synergies, will create a high hurdle for a competitive bid.”As further back-up for his thesis, he mentioned that Bernie Dan, former chief executive of the Chicago Board of Trade – taken over by CME in 2007 – thinks a takeover is unlikely.The other reason why CME is unlikely to make a move is the “F-word”: fungibility. This refers to the ability to open up one futures contract on one exchange at its clearing house and close it out at another and its clearing house – currently not permitted in the US. The CME would like to keep it that way, since this is largely how it maintains a 98 per cent market share in financial futures. If CME were to buy NYSE Euronext – and thus Liffe – there is a threat that the antitrust issue could be reopened – the one that raised its head briefly when Mr Dan was selling the CBOT to the CME.So, while I would never say never, I think the CME sits tight for now. It has enough on its plate anyway. Its last earnings showed a cost base running ahead of itself. It really needs to get on with further building its business outside the US, which it has made a pretty good start at with what it is doing in Brazil and Mexico and the alliances with exchanges there. It has just received approval for a London clearing house. We wait to see what products it will clear there.A combined NYSE Euronext/Deutsche Börse will dwarf CME Group on many counts, but is it really being the biggest that matters? Shareholders do not care; they just want returns from a scale business that is run efficiently on a global basis. And that is what the CME has every prospect of being.If there is a question in this for anyone, it is for Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX. The partners you might have been able to do a deal with already have hooked up with the remaining others – SGX with ASX; NYSE Euronext with Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange with Canada’s TMX Group. Over to you, Bob."

The only humans around are maintenance staff checking that containers filled with icy sludge are ready to pump coolant around the site should the air-conditioning fail.Welcome to the stock exchange run by NYSE Euronext, operator of the Paris and Amsterdam bourses. Across the Atlantic, in New Jersey, the group has built an identical facility for the trading of US stocks.At data centres such as these, “high-frequency” traders are offered rack space that enables them to place their computers alongside the ex­change’s electronic trade matching system, cutting microseconds off the time it takes to complete a deal.They may not look familiar to anyone used to seeing the more traditional trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange, also run by NYSE Euronext, on their television screens. But these facilities will be the new face of a colossal transatlantic exchange – the world’s biggest – set to be created after NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, Europe’s largest exchange operator, agreed a merger this week.Duncan Niederauer, the NYSE Euronext chief executive who will run the combined group, appeared on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, chatting to traders moments before details of the merger were spelt out in a transatlantic broadcast with Reto Francioni, his counterpart at Deutsche Börse.Optically, it was important to nod to the old ways. For as they are swept up in a fresh wave of global consolidation – also including a planned merger between London Stock Exchange and TMX, operator of Canada’s largest bourse – exchanges and the role they play in economies are rapidly morphing way beyond the long-held perceptions of most investors, companies and the public.Today, rather than the members-owned clubs of old that provided companies with a platform on which to raise capital, they are for-profit businesses, listed in the same way ordinary companies and eager to satisfy external shareholders.And, with their formerly core business of share trading battered by competition from new platforms that have emerged in less than a decade, the big exchanges are seeking new sources of revenue – including trading in financial derivatives and clearing.That is sparking concern among their bank competitors about their power at a time when regulators from the Group of 20 leading economies are subjecting the “ecosystem” of trading – known as market structures – to sweeping reforms as they strive to make the financial system safer in the wake of the 2008 crisis.“People need to completely rethink how they see exchanges. They are not a single place where humans ring bells – they are vast, amorphous, global technology networks,” says Professor James Angel of Georgetown University, Washington.According to Michael Gorham of the Illinois Institute of Technology: “No matter how often stock exchanges say they are capital-raising venues, and futures exchanges say they are risk-management venues, the bottom line in a profit-driven model is: anything that generates more trading and speculative activity is going to generate more commercial activity for them.”A look at the numbers behind the Deutsche Börse -NYSE Euronext deal tells the story. At 37 per cent of the total, the combined group’s biggest source of revenue will be trading in derivatives and clearing. Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset, such as a commodity, or by an investor’s view of an economic indicator, such as interest rate expectations. Clearing is the post-trade process that helps guarantee trades are completed if one party defaults, which has moved centre stage as legislation such as America’s Dodd-Frank Act mandates its greater use in the over-the-counter, or off-exchange, derivatives markets.Second to clearing and derivatives trading come equities trading and listings, at 29 per cent of the new group’s source of revenue. Indeed, Mr Niederauer said on Tuesday that he “never thought the future of exchanges was just about trading equities”.Exchanges have been forced on the defensive as the rules of the game in share trading have created competition. Regulations such as the European Commission’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), enacted in 2007, prompted the emergence of upstart competitors to Europe’s former national exchanges. Most were backed by the banks that used to be the exchanges’ largest owners in mutualised days.Two of them, Chi-X Europe and BATS Global Markets, on Thursday finalised a deal to combine, creating the largest share trading venue in Europe. They have many shareholders in common: Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Getco, a Chicago-based proprietary trading firm known for high-frequency trading, whereby computer algorithms are used to eke tiny profits by darting in and out of markets.At the same time, technological advances have enabled the emergence of non-exchange competitors, including “dark pools” – off-exchange trading venues often backed by banks and brokers. These platforms are also being helped by the emergence of high-frequency traders.Now, more beholden to their shareholders than to other constituents, exchanges find themselves pitted against these banks and brokers in a struggle to attract liquidity – trading orders – to their platforms. Seth Merrin, founder and chairman of US-based Liquidnet, the largest operator of dark pools, says: “Exchanges in developed markets have seen significant market share erosion and have had their best customers turn into their toughest competitors.” Morgan Stanley estimates that, in Europe, competition has shrunk exchange revenues by 15 per cent since 2008.Some exchanges are trying to find common ground with their competitors in the battle for equities market share. The SIX Swiss exchange last month became the first to co-operate with Liquidnet, each allowing the other access to its customers.Exchanges are also lobbying regulators to scrutinise off-exchange trading. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing market structures. Meanwhile, the European Commission is in the midst of its first review of Mifid and has already recommended measures intended to help investors build a clearer picture of where and how shares are traded.Yet the exchanges believe the most effective weapon in their fightback is a combination of consolidation and a drive into derivatives and clearing. This is also the main cause of concern for other market participants – especially where an exchange owns a clearing house, as most of the big ones do.The control of both the trading of derivatives and the clearing of them – a combination known as a “vertical silo”– gives exchange operators the power to lock out competitors and keep lucrative contracts and revenue in-house. This is how the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, has built its 98 per cent market share by trading volume in US interest rate futures contracts.Interest rate futures are also the most lucrative contracts at both NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse. Bringing together their two derivatives markets – respectively NYSE Liffe, based in London, and Frankfurt-based Eurex – is the main goal of their merger, allowing them to challenge the dominance of CME Group.The prospect of this global duopoly worries the banks, which have repeatedly tried and failed to take on incumbent derivatives exchanges. ELX, a two-year-old New York-based ex­change backed by some of the banks, has barely dented the CME. Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, says: “Mergers between larger entities such as NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse bring up the spectre of antitrust complaints as they further consolidate key markets.”Another powerful tool is ownership of a stock market index. Deutsche Börse owns the Stoxx index, while CME last year took control of the Dow Jones from News Corp. This gives each exchange the exclusive right to develop derivatives products based on their indices.Concern over the power of exchanges has only been heightened as banks and exchanges seek to capitalise on market structures emerging from reforms enshrined in new regulation involving OTC derivatives and clearing. Like America’s Dodd-Frank act, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) proposals and the Mifid review seek to push OTC derivatives into clearing houses.Ownership of clearing houses puts a combined Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext in pole position to capitalise on any OTC clearing opportunities, although industry participants remain unclear exactly how big the benefits will prove.Others jostling for the business are the CME Group, which owns not only the Chicago Mercantile Exchange but also a vast clearing house; LCH.Clearnet, a UK-based clearing house; and IntercontinentalExchange, a US exchange and OTC trading and clearing business that, like its rival CME, has a clearing house in London too.Bruce Hamilton, analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates that OTC clearing might offer $1bn of revenues shared across all of them – relatively modest for a business that has been touted as a huge opportunity.Yet on one crucial question, the shape of OTC regulation is still unclear: whether to enshrine the vertical silo exchange model – which would hand massive power to exchanges – or insist that clearing houses are opened up to competition.America’s Dodd-Frank requires clearing houses to accept for clearing OTC derivatives from any platform. Some see this as a possible prelude to the eventual erosion of vertical silos involving exchange-traded derivatives.In Europe, a fierce lobbying battle has erupted on the issue in recent weeks. Exchanges – including Deutsche Börse – are pushing for the Emir proposals requiring clearance of derivatives to be limited to OTC products, people close to the issue say. Others, largely banks, are lobbying for open access to clearing to be extended to on-exchange derivatives, which would threaten the vertical silo.Alex McDonald, chief executive of the Wholesale Market Brokers’ Association – which represents the interdealer brokers that negotiate deals between banks in OTC derivatives – says the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext combination “will further create a dominant vertical clearing silo”, and believes Emir should allow open access to clearing houses.Indeed, the market power of exchanges in this new landscape could yet be limited in other ways, as banks and dealers fight to keep control of the business of trading in OTC derivatives. Some of the banks have already swung behind new platforms hoping to capture this kind of business, such as Tradeweb, owned by Thomson Reuters and 10 banks.Interdealer brokers are pressing ahead with OTC derivatives trading platforms, with Icap, the largest broker, also building specialist OTC post-trade services to support such platforms and banks.Mr Hamilton says: “It is not clear to us that exchanges are best placed to grasp these opportunities. This sets up a new battleground for the exchanges and it’s by no means clear how it will turn out.”"
725;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;NYSE and D Börse set $340m break-up fee;;NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, who agreed a merger earlier this week, have set a price of €250m for abandoning the deal in favour of another combination.The large break-up fee is meant to discourage rivals from attempting to break up the deal, which is being done as a stock swap with only a nominal premium being paid for NYSE Euronext shares.Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, says the fee “looks reasonable but at the same time substantial”. He said the fee of €250m, or $340m, was larger than the $288m break-up fee in the CME Group’s merger.Investment bankers have privately suggested that other groups who will see their competitive positions challenged by the new entity, notably CME Group, could attempt to step into the deal with its own bid for NYSE Euronext, either on its own or in combination with Nasdaq OMX.CME and Nasdaq have denied the rumours. Terrence Duffy, CME chief executive, told CNBC that he had not spoken to Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext.The stock swap will see 0.47 shares of NYSE Euronext and one share of Deutsche Börse exchanged for one share of a Netherlands-based holding company that will own the combined group. At NYSE’s current stock price of $37.14 and Deutsche’s price of €57.89, that implies a premium of less than $1 a share for NYSE.The small premium has also encouraged some speculation that it would not be prohibitively expensive for a larger exchange group, such as Brazil’s BM&FBovespa in Brazil or Hong Kong Exchanges Clearing Corporation, to step in.The Brazil exchange’s market capitalisation is $14.6bn, while Hong Kong’s market cap is $23.1bn. That compares to the $9.7bn value for NYSE Euronext.“We believe the three already announced cross-border exchange deals could drive further consolidation, but we believe this would be a 2012 event at the earliest and only after these deals get regulatory approval and have good visibility into promised synergies,” said Niamh Alexander, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in a note to clients.But NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have been in discussions for several years, according to people close to the deal, and are loathe to consider other alternatives.The two companies have carefully arranged the combination to preserve leadership roles for NYSE Euronext executives, including Mr Niederauer who will be chief executive of the combined group, while giving Deutsche Börse a majority of the seats on the board.“The value creation for NYSE Euronext shareholders from the proposed synergies, will create a high hurdle for a competitive bid,” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James.Mr O’Shaughnessy downgraded NYSE Euronext’s shares to market perform, from outperform, citing little risk of another bidder emerging to drive up shares.
726;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-16T22:02:22Z;There is more to an exchange than a name;The attraction of a merger for the NYSE;Some very important questions are raised by the proposed merger of the Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, but Chuck Schumer, a New York senator, has zeroed in on the most trivial one: its name.Mr Schumer wants to preserve his state’s name because “the New York Stock Exchange is a symbol of national prestige and its brand must not suffer under this merger”. It would be more sensible to worry about taking care of the other half of the name – Stock Exchange.The exchange founded under a Buttonwood tree on Wall Street in 1792 was once the most powerful engine of US capitalism. Now, the attraction of a merger for the NYSE is that the merged body would be more a derivatives than a stock exchange, combining Euronext’s Liffe with DB’s Eurex.The right way to look at this merger is not as Germany versus the US but as public versus private. The true competition to the NYSE does not come from other national exchanges but from the myriad private and proprietary ways of trading shares, and the broader shift in financial markets away from publicly traded equities.Mr Schumer should forget regional pride and focus on helping the NYSE, or whatever brand a consultant devises, be a place where more investors trade and more small and medium-sized companies list. Without that, the action will keep moving elsewhere, regardless of name or ownership.That has serious implications for the US and other economies in which banks and institutional investors prefer private, over-the-counter transactions to those on public exchanges. It not only makes it impossible for retail investors to compete on equal terms but imposes a drag on the real economy.The NYSE’s role in share trading has been severely weakened. In 2005, when the Securities and Exchange Commission passed Regulation NMS, which was meant to reinforce the “national market system”, 79 per cent of the volume in NYSE-listed shares was traded on the exchange itself. By last March, that figure had fallen to 23 per cent.The NYSE has been squeezed out not only by upstart exchanges such as BATS, but by “dark pools”– private exchanges on which institutions trade with each other in large blocks – and by banks making transactions internally. The two now account for about a third of US equity trading.“We face a lot of dark execution that happens, away from the lit market, and share trading has become a commodity in which the NYSE and Nasdaq have trouble competing,” says Joe Ratterman, chief executive of BATS. NYSE Euronext’s equity trading and listing revenues fell by 10 per cent last year and the activities would be only 29 per cent of the merged group.As stock exchanges have become dominated by high-frequency trading and index funds, institutions have sought higher returns in private investments, which range from private equity and hedge funds to private placements. Goldman Sachs’ $1.5bn placement of Facebook shares, which it had to limit to international investors, is the kind of business Wall Street covets.Exchanges, which make money from high volumes of transactions, have instead turned to derivatives and technology businesses. The CME Group’s market capitalisation is more than double that of NYSE Euronext, which puts Chicago ahead of both New York and Frankfurt.The derivatives challenge is similar to that in equities – private markets dwarf public ones. According to the Bank of International Settlements, the over-the-counter derivatives market had a notional value of $582,000bn last June, while the value of exchange-traded futures and options was $75,000bn.Regulators are trying to push derivatives on to exchanges, or at least to being centrally cleared, which is one of the opportunities NYSE Euronext and DB see from the merger. But banks and large corporations would still prefer to do a lot of this business away from public exchanges.Competition to public exchanges from private markets and investment banks has value – it took such competition to force the large exchanges out of being guild-dominated, inefficient institutions. But investors will lose transparency and liquidity if exchanges are pushed to the sidelines.Furthermore, although a private trading regime may suit big investors, banks and corporations, it damages small companies that want to go public. The number of initial public offerings on the NYSE has fallen abruptly since the 1990s, according to a study by Grant Thornton. The US has averaged 126 IPOs annually since 2001, compared with 530 a year in the 1990s.The highly-fragmented regime in public company shares makes it cheap and easy for institutions to trade large blocks of shares, but has destroyed the old Wall Street infrastructure of equity broking and research, making it hard for new companies to gain attention.“The more efficient markets become, the less is the incentive to support small companies. The feeder system of the innovation economy is being hurt,” says David Weild of Grant Thornton. He believes the US economy needs a new utility-type stock exchange with higher trading commissions.It is impossible, and undesirable, to return to the days before fixed commissions were abolished on Wall Street in 1975 (followed by Big Bang in the City of London) but this merger signals the emerging weakness of public stock exchanges. That is harder to fix than a name but much more important.john.gapper@ft.com
727;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-16T20:20:26Z;Shanghai forges bourse link with Brazil;Agreement expected to lead to cross-listings of stocks;The Shanghai Stock Exchange and BM&F Bovespa, Latin America’s biggest exchange operator, are set to sign an agreement on Monday that is expected to lead to the cross-listings of stocks.Cross-listings, which would give benchmark Brazilian stocks access to liquidity in China and would increase trading of them during the Asian day, will add another element to one of the world’s most important emerging bilateral trade relationships.“What we are looking for is the double listing of stocks,” said a spokesperson for BM&FBovespa on Wednesday.“Because of the timezone, we see Asia as more opportunistic if we compare it to Europe or the US.”He declined to name any specific stocks planned for listing after the memorandum of understanding is signed, but they are expected to include the Brazilian market’s benchmark companies, such as national oil group Petrobras, and miner Vale.The move comes as Brazil’s exchange operator, the world’s fourth-largest by market value, is facing the prospect of competition from a new alliance led by BATS Global Markets, the alternative trading venue, and Claritas, the Brazilian asset manager.The pair announced this week an agreement to explore the potential creation of a new trading platform with its own clearing and depository services to challenge the BM&F Bovespa’s virtual monopoly. This comes as other national incumbents are seeking to protect their market positions through equity tie-ups.Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, the London Stock Exchange and Toronto’s TMX Group, and SGX of Singapore and Australia’s ASX are all in takeover talks.The spokesperson for BM&F Bovespa said the memorandum would be signed on Monday evening and would be followed the next day by a Brazil-China capital markets forum.Zhang Yujun, the chief executive officer of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, will lead a delegation that will also include senior executives from Chinese investment bank China International Capital Corp and other financial groups. The BM&F Bovespa said the listing of stocks in Asia, which follows a similar deal with Hong Kong, would help it win back market share in the trading of some of its bellwether stocks.About 50 per cent of the trading in shares, such as Petrobras and Vale, is in their American Depositary Receipts, which are listed on the NYSE. In December, Vale became the first Brazilian company to dual list in Hong Kong.The BM&F Bovespa has been quoted as saying it was eyeing similar tie-ups with Indian exchanges, although it is believed there are no concrete talks as yet on the issue.It is also developing a multi-asset class trading platform with CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange.To generate higher volumes, the BM&F Bovespa has also been seeking to attract high-frequency traders to its platforms.BM&F Bovespa opened a representative office in Shanghai six years ago, only its second presence outside Brazil after opening an office in New York four years previously. It opened an office in London in 2009.
728;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-16T01:45:49Z;D Börse and NYSE expand list of advisers;;The list of banks working on the agreed merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext quietly grew when the agreement was officially announced.The two companies said in their statement on Tuesday that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Société Générale and Credit Suisse provided “further financial advice” on the deal.That followed the weekend addition of BNP Paribas to the group of “principal advisers”, which included Perella Weinberg for NYSE Euronext, and Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase for Deutsche Börse.Some of the large banks, who are also customers and competitors of the exchange in their trading businesses, have privately expressed concerns about the market power of the deal.An exchange banker who was not working on the deal said “there is little doubt” that the banks were welcomed to the deal by the two companies partly to gain their consent on the deal.The new entity will control more than 90 per cent of European interest rate futures trading, though the Eurex market, partly owned by Deutsche Börse, and Liffe, owned by NYSE Euronext, trade different products. The group will also trade 40 per cent of US options and 28 per cent of European equities, according to figures from analysts at Sandler O’Neill.“In some markets, like equities, there is clear competition between banks’ crossing networks and the exchanges,” said Sang Lee, an analyst at the Aite Group. “However, you would expect the advisory teams at those banks to be involved. It was a huge merger.”Another banker noted it is important to “get the marketplace on your side” on these deals, especially if political or regulatory headwinds appear unavoidable.NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse were also said to be eager to bring on as many advisers as possible so as to block banks working for the CME Group, which was rumoured to be considering a bid for NYSE Euronext, according to a person close to one of the banks.The CME Group said in a statement that it did not comment on deal rumours, and that “like other industry participants, we will continue to monitor ongoing developments in the global exchange sector and the implications of those developments on our long-term growth strategy”.A person close to the transaction said that the banks approached the two groups following the initial leak of the deal last week.With so many exchange deals ongoing globally at the moment, some advisers have begun to overlap. For example, Morgan Stanley, through its individual country offices, is also advising the Singapore Exchange in its talks with Australia’s top exchange, Russia’s Micex exchange in its merger with RTS and the London Stock Exchange in its deal with TMX Group.A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
729;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;D Börse and NYSE unveil deal terms;;Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext have formally unveiled their plan to create what would be the largest stock and derivatives exchange run from dual headquarters in Frankfurt and New York.The move caps a week of frenetic merger activity among the world’s exchanges, but also carries the threat of counter-bids with speculation centred on CME Group, the new group’s main rival.In New York, the German and US groups appeared to have neutralised a backlash against the prospect of the New York Stock Exchange being absorbed in a group whose majority shareholders are from Deutsche Börse.Charles Schumer, senior Democratic senator for New York, said: “There are many things to like about this announcement, especially that it will open up new markets to NYSE and keep New York the world’s leading financial centre.”NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse said they were aiming to achieve extra savings of “at least” €100m ($135m) from the combination, in addition to synergies of €300m sketched out last week, through cross-selling of products. The combined group would have revenues of $5.4bn, and pro forma 2010 earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation of $2.7bn.The transaction would be structured as a combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext under a new Netherlands-based holding company, which would list in Frankfurt, New York and Paris.Duncan Niederauer, the NYSE chief executive, will take the same role at the combined group. He said the name would not be DB-NYSE. “It won’t be ‘The Big Börse’ either. It’s still under discussion.”CME Group said it would “continue to monitor ongoing developments … and the implications of those developments on our long-term growth strategy”. The German-US combination would provide the biggest global rival for the CME Group, which dominates trading and clearing of interest rate futures, the biggest US financial futures contracts.A merged Deutsche Börse-Euronext would bring together similar European futures contracts traded on NYSE Liffe, NYSE Euronext’s London-based derivatives exchange, with Eurex, the Börse’s derivatives exchange.Questions are also gathering over the fate of Nasdaq OMX, whose chief financial officer Adena Friedman resigned unexpectedly late on Monday. Its market capitalisation of around $5.5bn makes it far smaller than the other three.Under the terms of the proposed deal, each Deutsche Börse share would be exchanged for one share of the new company, and each share of NYSE Euronext share would be exchanged for 0.47 shares of the new company. That would leave the new company 60 per cent owned by Deutsche Börse shareholders and 40 per cent by NYSE Euro-next investors. Nine of the merged group’s 17 board members (apart from the chief executive and chairman) would be appointed from Deutsche Börse and six from NYSE Euronext.Reto Francioni, chief executive of Deutsche Börse, would be chairman of the merged group.Shares in NYSE Euronext opened down 4.1 per cent in New York at $37.83, while Deutsche Börse shares were down 0.7 per cent at €60.88 in Frankfurt.The proposed merger is subject to approval by a majority of NYSE Euronext shareholders and by 75 per cent of Deutsche Börse shareholders. It would also require the blessing of competition and financial, securities and other regulatory authorities in the US and Europe.Deutsche Börse was advised by Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Securities, while Perella Weinberg and BNP Paribas acted for NYSE Euronext.
730;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-15T12:40:15Z;BATS and Claritas consider Brazilian exchange;;BATS Global Markets, the alternative trading venue, is talking to Claritas, the Brazilian asset manager, about building a new stock exchange in Brazil, challenging BM&F Bovespa’s monopoly.The two parties have signed an agreement to explore the potential creation of a new trading platform with its own clearing and depository services.Ken Conklin, senior vice president of business development and marketing at BATS, said the partnership would explore “the unique opportunity that exists in the Brazilian market, which has many of the same frictions we’ve witnessed and overcome in the US and Europe.”The potential arrival of a new exchange, which would include clearing and depository services, would act as a threat to BM&FBovespa, Brazil’s national exchange. The exchange is the fourth largest in the world by market value and while trades on the equities market totaled 129bn reais ($77.4bn) in January.Other national incumbents face challenges from new and cheaper entrants to the market. Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, the London Stock Exchange and TMX Group and SGX of Singapore and Australia’s ASX are all in takeover talks to protect market share and grab lucrative areas of business.Although BM&F Bovespa has a domestic monopoly, in recent months it has followed many of the developing market trends and pre-empt potential competition. In particular it has sought to attract high-frequency traders to its platforms to raise volumes and increase liquidity in shares.Among the initiatives include price cuts for its futures business and investments in co-location services, in which trading firms can place their servers in the data centre next to the exchange servers, thus reducing the speed of execution, known as latency. It is also developing a multi-asset class trading platform with CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange.According to the exchange, January was a record month for volumes and trade from co-location services with volumes of 2.5bn reais and 385,960 trades.During its six years in existence, the privately-owned Bats has grabbed market share from established exchanges in the US and Europe by offering faster trading and lower fees than incumbents. It is currently in takeover talks with Chi-X Europe, a rival alternative trading venue, which would create the largest share trading venue in Europe by volume.“The Brazilian capital markets are ready for access to the best technology in the world and there is certainly no one better than BATS for the job,” said Carlos Ambrósio, senior partner at Claritas.Kansas City, Missouri-based BATS is owned by a group of its users, including Getco, one of the world’s largest proprietary trading firms, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.BATS and Claritas said the venture would include clearing and depository services in Brazil, highlighting how normally-staid post-trade services are becoming strategically vital assets for many exchanges.As competition from new venues in cash equities erodes profits, exchanges are looking to strengthen their derivatives and clearing operations as they provide more lucrative returns. At the start of the month Bm&F Bovespa said it would separate trading and clearing fees for investors and introduce a block trading platform.
731;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-14T23:03:20Z;CME signs up dealers for swap clearing;;CME Group announced on Monday that is has signed up a group of 10 global swap dealers as founding members for its clearing service for over-the-counter interest-rate swaps.This brings together a host of big dealers with buyside investment firms including BlackRock, Citadel, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Pimco. Since the CME clearing service was launched last October, it has cleared just under $1bn in gross notional value.The dealers include: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and UBS.Over-the-counter clearing is a critical part of CME’s growth plan for the next few years.The company’s leadership has been targeting international customer growth as central to its business – focusing its efforts, for example, on its new European clearing house.However, with last week’s revelation that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are planning to merge, such initiatives could be curtailed. That would place even more pressure on CME to make OTC clearing a success.One uncertainty is regulation. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is still crafting rules to govern the OTC market and it will be difficult for clearing houses to garner much volume before the shape of those rules is clear.More fundamentally, questions remain about how much business the dealers will put through CME’s clearing house and the profitability of clearing OTC transactions. CME scrapped a previous attempt to establish a trading platform for credit-default swaps after failing to garner dealer support.CME faces a battle to clear swaps with LCHClearnet in interest rates and ICE Trust in credit derivatives. International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearing house backed by Nasdaq is also trying to gain traction with clearing interest-rate swaps.NYSE Euronext in conjunction with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is also pushing ahead with plans to offer clearing for interest-rate futures.Terry Duffy, CME Group executive chairman said: “The non-binding term sheet entered into today provides additional momentum and further demonstrates dealers’ commitment to support our solution and reduce systemic risk in the market.”Under Dodd-Frank, the US financial regulatory reform legislation, ‘standardised’ swaps must be cleared through a Derivatives Clearing Organisation or DCO. In turn a cleared swap must trade on a Swap Execution Facility, with large blocks that are cleared, reported to an exchange or SEF.The CME hopes ultimately to allow traders to cross-margin OTC contracts with its benchmark futures.
732;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-14T09:41:59Z;Exchange mergers;Shareholders should focus on the risk of political intervention;"Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext should announce the terms of a merger any day now. Rather than worrying about the new entity’s name, shareholders should focus on the risk that politicians could throw a spanner in the works. Two grounds might prompt them to get involved.First is competition. Second is the desire of financial centres to defend their patch. Both suggest that this merger, like past exchange mergers, could become a political saga, with attendant arbitrage opportunities.Cash equities barely present any antitrust issues as rival electronic platforms have made the trading business highly competitive. But US options might be a problem. The merger would combine the second and third-largest options businesses by volume, with about 42 per cent of the market. But the market is competitive, with the Chicago Board Options Exchange and Nasdaq offering significant alternatives, so antitrust regulators will not necessarily get involved.European futures are more problematic. Between them, Deutsche Börse’s Eurex and NYSE’s Liffe have a 90 per cent share while barriers to new entrants are high. This seems a deal breaker.But the exchanges can cite the merger of the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a combination similar to Eurex-Liffe, as a precedent. Further, the CME Group wants to compete in Europe; the new exchange could argue that a new goliath is needed to keep the established one in check. A forced divestment of one of the futures exchanges is not, therefore, inevitable, but cannot be ruled out.Nationalism may be more dangerous. This new exchange has significant businesses in New York, Frankfurt, London and Paris. It will be hard to cut 12 per cent of the combined cost base, as announced, without leaving one of these worse off. Financial nationalism is anachronistic for this global business, but it is nevertheless dangerous.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
733;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
734;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Exchanges race to become one-stop shop;Competition propels global consolidation;In the same way that many countries cling to the idea that they deserve a national airline, so having a stock exchange is also seen as a badge of pride.Even tiny Laos has opened a bourse, offering trading in two state-controlled companies. That, in a country a long way from having a shareholder culture and average per capita income of $880. But the wave of exchange consolidation unveiled this week shows a bigger game is being played. It has dawned on the biggest exchanges in the past five years that merely offering trading in a home base is no recipe for growth. The revolution in electronic trading leading to borderless, ultra-fast traders, has forced exchanges to think more widely.The race is now on to become the preferred one-stop shop for traders no matter where they may be. One of the biggest customers of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is a trading firm based in Prague. The Chicago exchange has been looking south, forging an alliance with Brazil’s fast-growing BM&FBovespa exchange. Customers trading Brazilian soyabean futures in São Paulo will soon be able to gain access to US soyabean futures through a common technology link to Chicago – and vice versa.Yet the previous wave of consolidation got the big exchanges only so far along this road. NYSE Euronext is a product of that period, created when the New York Stock Exchange bought Euronext, a club of exchanges in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon.It has managed to marry its US business with the Euronext markets by rolling out a trading system that operates across its cash equities and derivatives markets. It has built an aircraft hangar-sized depot outside London, and another in New Jersey, to house traders’ computer servers.But the big players have also struggled with low volumes since the 2008 crisis knocked market confidence. Competition from new players has eroded revenues too.Now Duncan Niederauer, the basketball-playing American chief executive of NYSE Euronext, and Reto Francioni, his soft-spoken Swiss-German counterpart at Deutsche Börse, have decided to get together. The deal has taken many by surprise. It is hardly a neat cultural fit: the German exchange is famous for its plodding, methodical approach. The New Yorkers are, well, New Yorkers.Mr Francioni has failed to articulate a clear strategy for the group in the past two years as his rivals – notably his new friend Mr Niederauer – have announced initiatives to take advantage of regulatory reforms changing the way over-the-counter derivatives and clearing will operate.There are also potential antitrust and nationalist barriers. The proposed purchase by the Singapore Exchange of the Australian bourse unveiled three months ago has run into a nationalist backlash in Canberra. And in Canada there is some squeamishness about this week’s other deal: the London Stock Exchange’s merger with TMX, operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange.American unease over a German exchange controlling the New York Stock Exchange is thus a distinct possibility (although the anchors on CNBC’s morning business programme were making light of the issue with a cheery “Guten Morgen Wallstrasse”).The forces of regulation, competition and technology are propelling greater globalisation of exchanges and consolidation is inevitable. The test of this wave will be whether nationalist impulses can be set aside. That will be hard in Asia, where having an exchange is still as important as the flag-carrier. But with the big exchanges looking to Asia as their next move, even there those days are numbered.Jeremy Grant is the editor of FT Trading Room. Inside Europe will appear on Monday
735;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-10T21:16:56Z;WTI-Brent price divergence hits record $16;;The price difference between the world’s top oil benchmarks reached an intraday record of more than $16 a barrel, doubling in three weeks, as West Texas Intermediate oil disconnects from top global oil references Brent and Dubai. The spread fell back to just above $14.The divergence, which is wreaking havoc among energy investors and traders, prompted Saudi Arabia two years ago to drop WTI as its benchmark for pricing oil to US customers.Dispatches from the US embassy in Riyadh, obtained by the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks, quoted Prince Abdulaziz, Saudi’s deputy oil minister, as describing the WTI market as “too much like gambling”. According to the cables, Saudi officials explained to US diplomats that the shift to a new benchmark would leave the kingdom “less subject to speculative price swings”.In the past, Saudi officials have highlighted technical problems with WTI, rather than the influence of speculative price swings, as the reason to drop the benchmark.The WTI-Brent price divergence meant that companies hedging their exposure to rising energy prices through WTI contracts were left exposed to losses, analysts said.WTI is the backbone of the New York Mercantile Ex­change’s flagship oil contract, the world’s most liquid oil futures contract, which is often cited as the “real” price of oil.But a surge in oil inventories in Cushing, Oklahoma, where WTI is delivered into America’s pipeline system, has depressed the value of the benchmark against other yardsticks. The International Energy Agency said on Thursday that with “few relief valves” to cut the stock overhang in Cushing, the price dislocation “may persist for months [or years] to come”.CME Group, which owns Nymex, has strongly defended the WTI contract, saying the price difference between its benchmark and Brent is a “cyclical phenomenon”.
736;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Chicago may feel the heat from D Börse/NYSE;;The revelation that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are in advanced merger talks was not exactly welcomed in Chicago, the home of the US’s listed derivatives market.Terrence Duffy, executive chairman of CME Group, told reporters in Chicago that he was concerned that the combined entity could have their derivatives and stock trading businesses “eventually moved to overseas territory”, which could help it evade US Dodd-Frank reform rules. “That’s a big deal,” he said, according to Reuters.However, he also said that “we positioned ourselves exactly because we could anticipate this coming down the pipe”. He added: “I like the place the CME is in right now.”A merger would combine NYSE Liffe and Eurex – the futures arms of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse respectively – creating a market that would overtake Chicago-based CME Group as the world’s biggest futures exchange.It would also bring together the two US equity options-trading platforms operated by NYSE Euronext with Deutsche Börse’s International Securities Exchange, forming by far the biggest options exchange group in the US and swamping the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s first and until recently its biggest options-trading venue.But it is in futures that the deal would be more of a game-changer. “This merger is a big headache for the CME,” says a former CME senior executive. “Separately, each of these companies is a formidable competitor. Together, they will be even more formidable.” Even before news of the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse discussions broke on Wednesday, there was a cloud hanging over CME, after the company revealed last week that rising costs in 2010 eroded the benefits of increasing revenues, a trend that is expected to continue this year. While CME has not kept its investment in a string of new ventures a secret, the extent of the outlays – pushing profits down below expectations – apparently wrongfooted Wall Street analysts, who rushed to lower their profits forecast and share price targets. “If you were to tell us at the beginning of 2010 that CME would grow its revenue 16 per cent organically but see its operating margins contract, we would have said you were nuts,” Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst at Raymond James, wrote in a research note. “The operating leverage of the firm’s business model should easily translate 16 per cent revenue growth into 20 per cent-plus earnings growth.”Expense growth outpaced the rise in revenues in the fourth quarter, pushing down net income from $203m to $196m and operating margin dropped from 60.3 per cent to 60.1 per cent.While most of those costs were accounted for by higher compensation expenses – bonuses nearly doubled from 2009 to $72m – CME this year expects costs to rise by $110m to $1.26bn, with half of the increase due to investment in new ventures. One such initiative is a “co-location” facility in the Chicago suburbs, allowing traders to place their computers next to the exchange’s trade matching engine, slashing trading times. They also include plans for a multi-asset trading platform that CME is developing with BM&FBovespa, the Brazilian exchange, clearing over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and a European clearing house. The problem is that none of these ventures will start to pay off materially until at least next year. “2011 is shaping up to be a relatively lacklustre year for CME Group,” Mr O’Shaughnessy observed.CME management says the initiatives are setting the foundation for long-term growth, but not everyone is convinced that revenues will overtake the extra cost burden in the foreseeable future. Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays Capital, has warned of “the potential for CME’s expenses to trend higher as the company travels further down the path in growing its new initiatives (primarily OTC clearing)”. Moreover, there is uncertainty about how profitable the initiatives will be, prompting some observers to ask whether the company has overextended itself.Clearing interest-rate swaps, for example, depends on attracting the big banks that are the main dealers in the contracts. The CME scrapped a previous attempt to establish a trading platform for credit-default swaps after failing to garner dealer support. Even if CME were able to get the dealers on side, it is not clear that clearing OTC transactions will become a significant source of revenue, and building volumes could take several years.In recent years, CME has grown through big exchange acquisitions, such as its $11.6bn purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 and a deal to buy the New York Mercantile Exchange for $7.6bn in 2008.But some say it now lacks a coherent strategy – a deficiency that a NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse merger could expose. “They became fat and happy, and now it’s pretty clear that they don’t have a game plan,” says the former CME executive.Few, however, are betting against the company in the longer term. Analysts seem convinced that CME is setting the stage for long-term growth and most are still bullish on the company. Mr O’Shaughnessy, for example, expects “the business likely to improve much more sharply in 2012”. Meanwhile, likely rises in the cost of energy and other commodities will drive volumes in CME’s core business this year, while interest rates could start to rise next year, driving growth in Treasury futures. However, a NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse merger would add new heft to a significant challenge to CME’s near-monopoly in US Treasury futures, as NYSE Euronext readies its own clearing house for US Treasury futures. That could erode CME’s ability to raise fees in its traditional business, even if costs continue to rise fast. 
737;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-10T19:56:47Z;Francioni led bourse on path to deal;;Deutsche Börse’s intention to merge with NYSE Euronext has surfaced almost exactly 10 years after the German group’s initial public offering launched it on the path of becoming Europe’s most valuable exchange group.But in recent years opportunities have seemed to be slipping away – and Reto Francioni, its chief executive, has taken some of the blame.Some shareholders and insiders at the company report losing confidence in the 53-year-old chief executive. He had to abandon talks with Euronext about forming a powerful European exchange in 2006, and instead NYSE combined with Euronext the following year. The idea of a subsequent combination between the German group and the US group is not new – but talks in 2008 and 2009 did not come to fruition.Now Mr Francioni, a keen angler, has shown the patience to reel in a big fish. Deutsche Börse shareholders are set to emerge with the larger share of the world’s biggest exchange group by revenues.But Mr Francioni will cede the chief executive’s role in the merged company to Duncan Niederauer, his NYSE counterpart. His presence means a “significantly stronger” management team for the new group, analysts at Bernstein Research said yesterday.The two men have some things in common. Mr Francioni is seen as quite academic in terms of his knowledge of trading and exchanges, and as a less colourful figure than Werner Seifert, his predecessor. Mr Niederauer, who spent 22 years at Goldman Sachs in equities trading roles, was greeted as an “exchange nerd” when he took the NYSE job in 2007.Mr Niederauer, 51, has proved more than a simple tinkerer, launching a US derivatives exchange that would compete with the CME Group. From early in his tenure, according to people close to the deal, he was discussing the merger with Deutsche Börse.“He’s played on a global platform before, coming from Goldman, and he believes this is the next step in the evolution of global trading,” said Richard Torrenzano, a public strategies adviser and former NYSE executive.Mr Francioni was seen as a competent cost-cutter at Deutsche Börse. But attempts to map out where he was taking the company in the strategic sense have been less successful, say many observers. “He is someone who lacks vision,” says someone familiar with Deutsche Börse. An analyst says investors had applied a “leadership discount” to Deutsche Börse shares.Deutsche Börse did buy the International Securities Exchange in 2007, beefing up its US equity options business – but the $2.8bn deal caused friction with shareholders and has led to big writedowns.Attempts to create businesses such as pan-European equities trading and settlement of credit default swaps have been only partially successful.But Mr Francioni will see the merger plan as vindication of his insistence that Deutsche Börse should retain a “vertical” model, encompassing not just equities trading but also derivatives trading and back-office business.Like the javelin thrower he was in younger days, Mr Francioni may have kept himself and his group in the contest with a final heave.
738;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-10T10:06:54Z;D Börse and NYSE in advanced talks;;The world’s bourses are being swept up in an accelerating wave of consolidation after Deutsche Börse revealed that it was in advanced talks with NYSE Euronext to create the world’s largest exchanges operator by revenues and profits.The proposed all-stock deal trumped the tie-up unveiled just hours earlier by the London Stock Exchange and Canada’s TMX Group and would create the world’s largest stock exchange by market value after Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing. Deutsche Börse has a market value of $15.3bn while NYSE Euronext has a market value of $8.7bn.Shares in Deutsche Börse, which were suspended on Wednesday, jumped 6.6 per cent on Thursday morning in Frankfurt to €61.20. NYSE shares closed up 14 per cent in New York on Wednesday at $38.10.The proposed exchange mergers are a sign that competition from new types of trading venues, regulatory changes in the wake of the financial crisis and rapid advances in technology are forcing exchanges to create global champions.Talks between exchanges started in October when the Singapore and Australian exchanges unveiled their surprise merger plan. Axel Pierrion, senior vice-president at Celent, a Boston-based consultancy, said: “The race is on to create regional trading gateways to serve international institutional investors, and the drivers are accelerating.”A deal between Deutsche Börse – Europe’s largest exchange group – and the owner of the New York Stock Exchange throws down the gauntlet to their arch rival CME Group, because it promises to create a dominant player in European derivatives as a counterweight to the CME’s dominance in the US.But the German-US deal could face antitrust issues in Europe. And in the US some analysts feared political opposition in Washington, since the deal would leave Deutsche Börse shareholders holding 59-60 per cent in a new, Netherlands-based holding company, with NYSE Euronext shareholders holding the rest. In a statement only hours after the chief executives of the LSE and TMX unveiled plans to create the world’s largest exchange by number of listings, the US and German bourses said they aimed to create a group “that is both a world leader in derivatives and risk management and the premier global venue for capital raising”.The combined Deutsche-NYSE group would have dual headquarters in New York and Frankfurt. Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, would become chief executive of the new company from New York.Reto Francioni, chief executive of Deutsche Börse, would become chairman of the new business and be based in Frankfurt. The executive committee would be drawn equally from both companies.The two parties also expect to make around €300m in cost synergies from savings in information technology and clearing operations. That is far bigger than the £35m in synergies after two years planned by the LSE and TMX. Talks between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext over a merger failed in 2008. A source said that the deal had “good support” at the highest political level in Germany.Shares in the main Australian and Singapore exchanges advanced on Thursday in response to confirmation of talks between Deutsche Börse and NYSE as investors judged that the prospects of a successful merger between the Asian rivals had been improved by the signs of further consolidation in the sector.ASX, which operates Australia’s biggest bourse, rose by as much as 5.2 per cent in morning trading in Sydney, with shares in the Singapore Exchange up 1.3 per cent before the lunchtime break.The SGX/ASX proposal has been cleared by the Australian competition regulator but faces tough political opposition, which many observers think will make it difficult for the deal to win the necessary approval from Australia’s parliament.“The latest developments underscore the rationale for exchange consolidation and the merits of an enlarged group. Exchange consolidation is a global trend and one which is set to only accelerate,” Magnus Böcker, chief executive of the SGX, said on Thursday.Senior officials at both exchanges are understood to see the North American/European deals as potentially positive for the Singapore/Australia takeover.One said it might make a difference “at the margin” by helping demonstrate to Australian opponents of the deal that mergers were an essential element in the development of the exchanges industry.Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase are advising Deutsche Börse on the deal, while Perella Weinberg Partners is advising NYSE Euronext.Additional reporting by Helen Thomas in New York and Kevin Brown in Singapore
739;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-10T01:13:34Z;Quick view: D Börse-NYSE deal complicates US market;;The proposed tie-up between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext may have clear implications for the European exchange landscape, combining Liffe and Eurex into a derivatives giant.What it means for the US market, however, is less immediately clear.The direct result would be the creation of the US’s largest single-stock options exchange.The International Securities Exchange, owned by Deutsche Börse, would join forces with the NYSE’s two options markets, NYSE Arca Options and NYSE Amex Options.Going by Tuesday’s volume figures from the Options Clearing Corporation, the combined markets would have a 42 per cent share, surpassing Nasdaq OMX’s 27.5 per cent and CBOE’s 26 per cent.Some of the €300m synergies the two groups have said would result from the tie-up, which could be passed on to NYSE-ISE customers and add a small advantage.But volume is not the goal in the US options business at the moment. The cost of options trading is already quite low, and recently was pushed even lower by new entrants such as BATS Options. Further price competition could be deadly. Deutsche Börse has already taken writedowns on the ISE, which it acquired for $2.8bn in 2007.Instead, the current race in the US options market is for differentiation, rather than for scale. The CBOE has been very successful trading licensed products, such as index options and options on the Vix index, the popular market volatility measure.Nasdaq, which has increased its options volume in the past year, already plans to launch its own proprietary Alpha index, developed by the same economist who created the Vix for CBOE, Robert Whalley, in the next few months.So, unless the merger results in a burst of creativity and products, the only consideration might be valuation, where NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse would be favoured by investors who prize its diversity of businesses.“Will there be more conversations about consolidation potential? Absolutely,” said Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill. “But Nasdaq and CBOE were already beating ISE.”Meanwhile, in plain-vanilla stock trading, Deutsche Börse brings no US cash equities market to the table. NYSE’s share via NYSE Amex, NYSE Arca, and the New York Stock Exchange hybrid floor markets would remain unchanged at about 25 per cent. Again, the relative valuation advantage over Nasdaq, its biggest rival, would be the catalyst for reactionary moves.The real action may eventually come in the futures market.Deutsche Börse sent a brief but sharp chill up the spines of US futures exchanges several years ago when it launched a US version of its Eurex futures market in 2003, Eurex US.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange was quick to react, pushing further toward electronicisation and eventually merging with the Chicago Board of Trade to create the CME Group.NYSE has already launched an effort to take on the CME Group using the Liffe business it gained with Euronext. NYSE Liffe US is expected to begin trading interest rate futures this year, though gaining significant market share against the CME colossus will be very difficult.If Eurex were to use this opportunity to again attack the US market, and provide NYSE’s effort with greater scale, it could give Chicago pause.“Eurex and Liffe in the US could very much compete with the CME Group and give them something to think about. I’m sure they’re taking note,” said Simmy Gerwal, analyst at Aite Group.
740;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-10T00:03:54Z;Quick View: Powerhouses for whose benefit?;;Herr Niederauer, how is your German?The prospect that the New York Stock Exchange might fall into the hands of the Germans – that is, Deutsche Börse – is but one of the many fascinating, game-changing aspects of the announcement today that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are in advanced talks that may lead to a sort of a merger. Except that, in the all-shares transaction, Börse shareholders would end up with up to 60 per cent of the shares in the new group. This will surely not go unchallenged by US politicians, in particular Democratic Senator Charles Schumer, long known for defending New York’s corner when it comes to financial services.For those who remember the Börse’s ill-fated attempt in 2002 to take on the Chicago Board of Trade, the US’s then-dominant futures exchange, it is a bit of deja vu. The Germans were rebuffed through a bit of old Chicago-style street fighting. Sensitivities were high. And politics played a part in defeating Eurex, the Börse’s futures arm, in its attempt to prise trading away from the CBOT. This time may be different. The scale of the enterprise is far greater and more complex, and the global exchange business has moved on a long way since 2002. This is about more than simply control of the Treasury bond futures contract in Chicago. It was – and is – a huge pool of liquidity. But the game now is a mixture of an anti-Chicago ploy, building a big derivatives silo in Europe, to match the pool of liquidity that Chicago has and, for Deutsche Börse, making one last attempt to build a transatlantic business. Its latest attempt, the purchase of International Securities Exchange, the options exchange, has been a disaster. Look at the write-downs on that deal, where Deutsche Börse paid $2.8bn.For Mr Niederauer, this fulfils a number of objectives. And let’s dismiss the cash equities piece of this, right off the bat. This is about derivatives and clearing, which is what drives exchange M&A these days (it is also why Mr Niederauer’s predecessor, John Thain, bought Euronext in the first place – to get hold of Liffe, the high-margin futures exchange then-owned by Euronext). Structurally, this is about consolidating an integrated derivatives and clearing business in Europe, not just as a way of heading off CME encroachments in the region (note that CME last month got approval from UK regulators for a London clearing house) but also as there is an almighty battle over the role of “vertical silos” brewing thanks to regulatory reforms such as Dodd-Frank in the US and “Emir” and “Mifid” in Europe.NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are feeling the pressure from competition on the cash equities side from the fragmentation of markets across multiple different types of venues – BATS and Direct Edge, broker networks, “dark pools” in the US, Chi-X and other similar interlopers in Europe. The answer is to reinforce the power of the derivatives-clearing silo. That’s where the obvious returns are.Does this cause an antitrust issue in the European Union, given how much power vertically integrated exchanges with clearing houses have?I think the scaremongers on this are (probably) wrong. Again, go back five years. The US Department of Justice waved through the Chicago Board of Trade’s takeover by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. What were the exchange’s two main financial products? Eurodollar interest rate futures – at the short end of the yield curve – and at the CBOT, Treasury bond futures at the long end.Slam NYSE LIffe and Eurex together in Europe – as the NYSE Euronext/Deutsche Börse deal envisages – and you have exactly the same scenario playing out in the European equivalent of those products. Do we seriously think that antitrust people in Brussels are going to have a problem with this, when the Department of Justice in the US approved it for Chicago? Okay, the staff in that same department expressed serious reservations later in an infamous letter to the US Treasury, but the original decision still stands. And imagine this: let’s say you are the CME and you are lobbying Brussels against any NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse tie-up. You can hardly use the antitrust card, given that you yourself were given a clean slate by your own antitrust people on the same issue a few years ago in the US.I know that some people might say that the CME argued that the CME-CBOT deal was okay from a competitive standpoint because there was a third party, IntercontinentalExchange, to keep everyone honest. But ICE never offered the same products as either Chicago exchange.The real losers here, potentially, are the market participants who hoped that we might have arrived at a point where vertical silos were being challenged by what is coming out of Dodd-Frank and Emir in Europe when it comes to things like open and non-discriminatory access to clearing houses by trading venues. The tendency seemed to be away from big vertical silos, driven by for-profit exchanges. If you are LCH.Clearnet, for example, this has not been a good 36 hours, given your user-owned, quasi-utility structure.The slow death of “interoperability” between clearing houses in Europe in recent weeks is also a blow against those who had hoped for a democratisation of market structures away from the vertical silo.Mr Niederauer and his counterpart at Deutsche Börse, Reto Francioni, had better know what they are doing. All I see in the announcements over the last two days from incumbent exchanges is hyperbole about creating global “powerhouses”. The question is, for whose benefit?
741;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-09T19:13:42Z;Exchange chiefs seek global powerhouses;;Even as Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange and his counterpart at Canada’s TMX Group were wrapping up a sales pitch in Toronto for the creation of a “true powerhouse in the global exchange business”, two far bigger rivals were plotting to steal their thunder.By unveiling plans for their own merger, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have not only put the UK-Canadian tie-up in the shade. They have shown that another wave of exchange consolidation is cascading through global markets.The last spasm of merger activity took place five years ago when NYSE Euronext was created through the takeover by the New York Stock Exchange of Euronext, the network of pan-European exchanges.In the US, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange swallowed its cross-town rival, the Chicago Board of Trade.This time, there are fewer options and fewer combinations that make sense.Justin Schack, head of market structure analysis at Rosenblatt Securities, a US broker, said: “There are only so many exchanges out there. People have had to intensify their discussions and make sure they are not left at the dance without a partner. That’s what’s happening here.”Like the last wave, the driving force is the need to build global scale as technology is driving down the cost of accessing markets across the world, sucking in new communities of traders. Those changes have even reached China, which launched futures trading only months ago.Exchanges are generally fixed-cost businesses, so the more trading and clearing they attract from around the world by expanding their reach, the easier it is to make money.But there are new forces at work this time. Sweeping regulatory change is bearing down on exchanges and clearing houses – the “plumbing” that makes much of the markets work – as regulators clean up the system after the 2008 financial crisis.Vast swathes of off-exchange financial instruments called derivatives are being forced by new rules such as the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by the US government last year, onto exchanges and clearing houses. This is seen as a way of safeguarding the financial system against future big defaults like Lehman Brothers in 2008. The same is happening in Europe.That has sparked a rush to retool the exchange business in anticipation of this new landscape. NYSE Euronext has been trying to build a new clearing house to capture OTC derivatives clearing in the US, while Deutsche Börse is trying to build a similar business in Europe with its existing clearer.But large exchange groups have also been feeling the heat from competition. In the US the New York Stock Exchange not only competes against Nasdaq, but at least 10 other smaller platforms that have emerged, as well as “dark pools” and trading facilities offered by brokers and banks.The same pattern has played out in Europe since the passage of the so-called Mifid rules that broke exchanges monopolies. Upstart platforms pose a serious threat to exchanges’ share of stock trading: the LSE has seen its share of the FTSE 100 plunge to under 60 per cent at the hand of nimbler operators like Chi-X.It is a confusing patchwork that has raised pressure on exchanges to defend their eroding franchises, and caused regulators to question whether having so many trading venues threatens price transparency.NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have taken a swipe at those venues, saying the combined company would “create an important counterweight to the proliferation of alternative trading venues that operate with less transparency and far fewer regulatory requirements than [our companies].”Yet the deal faces obstacles. The proposed structure has Deutsche Börse ending up with 59-60 per cent of a new holding company based in the Netherlands, and NYSE Euronext shareholders with 40-41 per cent. That may provoke political backlash in Washington, irked by the prospect of a German group having control over the New York Stock Exchange.And both exchanges operate the biggest futures and options markets in Europe: the US group has NYSE Liffe – the former London International Financial Futures Exchange – while the German group has Eurex. The LSE’s Mr Rolet said he wanted to use the deal with TMX to help compete against this “duopoly”.Merging that duopoly would create a virtual monopoly in derivatives trading in Europe, which would likely attract strict scrutiny from antitrust authorities, although US antitrust authorities waved through the CME-CBOT merger when similar concerns were raised.But that is unlikely to stop consolidation. “Eventually, when all the M&A is finished, there will be 3-4 worldwide exchanges,” said Jeff Carter , a former board member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and trader. “It will look like the credit card industry.”
742;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-09T15:54:47Z;LSE / TMX;Merger should benefit both parties unless there is a commodities fall;The London Stock Exchange has never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Its merger with Canada’s TMX, operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, partially reverses this dismal pattern. The transaction is low-risk, and will work out well if the commodity boom keeps going. But it is not as great an opportunity as the many the LSE spurned, and neither is it as great an opportunity as the market currently seems to believe.Downside risk is not great. The two exchanges are a good fit, and have bent over backwards to include everyone in the new management. They combine the two biggest venues for listing mining companies, giving them the superlatives companies like to spout when unveiling a merger. The valuation, close to market, is uncontroversial. Projected synergies of £35m in the first two years, out of LSE’s 2010 cost base of £350m, sound plausible.Revenue “synergies” (projected at £100m per year by the fifth year) should, as always, be taken with a pinch of salt. TMX might help the LSE redress its historic weakness in derivatives. The LSE’s MTS platform might help Toronto to build a business in government bonds. None of this should be relied on.Further, revenues might be hurt by a commodities downturn, while the LSE’s price/earnings multiple of 25, double Nasdaq OMX’s and richer than either the CME or NYSE Euronext, enshrines hopes for a continued boom. Wednesday’s 10 per cent rise in LSE’s share price suggests the market thinks TMX is worth more, and might yet prompt a rival bid. But none of this affects the underlying common sense of the transaction.Buying Liffe, or selling itself to Nasdaq for twice its current share price, would have been far better deals for the LSE. But at least it has grasped one of the few remaining opportunities in an almost consolidated sector.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
743;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;LSE hopes TMX will turn its transatlantic vision into reality;;"For as long as many in the City can remember, the London Stock Exchange has been prey, stalked by some of the world’s biggest bourses.Clara Furse’s tenure as chief executive was marked by a grinding battle to fend off hostile takeover attempts by Deutsche Börse and Nasdaq OMX of the US, eager to snap up a trophy among world exchanges.Yet Dame Clara’s successor, Frenchman Xavier Rolet, is now on the cusp of doing a deal with an exchange operator in Canada.If advanced talks between the LSE and TMX Group , operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, lead to a deal, the combined entity would still rank only seventh behind NYSE Euro-next, Deutsche Börse, CME Group of Chicago and even the Brazilian and Hong Kong exchanges, measured by the exchanges as listed companies. So why is this happening?The 210-year-old bourse has suffered as upstart trading platforms such as Chi-X Europe, formed in 2007, have cut the LSE’s share of trading in FTSE 100 stocks to below 60 per cent – a far cry from its near-monopoly position of a few years
earlier.The LSE has also long lacked two crucial pieces of business that its rivals developed while it was distracted by takeover attempts: derivatives and clearing, both lucrative additions to the share trading business that have helped boost multiples at the LSE’s rivals.Mr Rolet has certainly shaken up the LSE since he came on board in May 2009, slashing headcount by more than 10 per cent, buying a Sri Lankan technology company whose trading systems are being installed throughout the exchange, in part to attract the “high-frequency” traders that are now the lifeblood of most mature exchanges.He is also working on a plan to launch equity derivatives, setting the LSE up for a head-on clash with NYSE Liffe and Eurex, the Deutsche Börse futures arm, both of which dominate derivatives in Europe.Yet those moves alone are unlikely to deliver on Mr Rolet’s ultimate goal of restoring the LSE to top table of global exchanges.By picking TMX Group, Mr Rolet has spotted something big: mining and resources.Both bourses are home to a huge number of mining and resource company listings – the key attraction of the deal.The two together would have more company listings than any other exchange – more than 6,300, compared with NYSE Euronext’s 4,500. And that would create a resources behemoth at a time of high commodity prices and unprecedented activity in exploration.TMX Group has for some time been viewed as a logical partner for the LSE.An early sign of the flirtation between London and Toronto came back in March 2009, when they agreed a “strategic partnership”.The challenge will be to turn the transatlantic vision into reality, as long as the mining and resources boom lasts."
744;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;Quick View: Why the LSE and TMX are getting together;Both exchanges have spotted an opportunity to create a mining listings giant, writes Jeremy Grant;At first sight, it looks like the exchange world equivalent of two drunks leaning on each other for support.The London Stock Exchange and the TMX Group in Canada are in merger talks. The British bourse is a shadow of its former self, cut back by competition from rival trading venues such as Chi-X Europe and twisting in the wind as it tries to build a derivatives business and sort out a proper clearing infrastructure – both things that grown up exchanges such as Deutsche Börse and CME Group in the US have had for years.The Toronto Stock Exchange, which is operated by TMX, has watched as its market share has been eroded by a Canadian unit of Chi-X and other upstarts. Just look at the pie charts at the top of FT Trading Room for a stark visual on that.Both the LSE and Toronto are victims of one of the biggest trends sweeping the exchanges globally: competition, and the erosion of exchange monopolies.And you could hardly call the LSE one of the world’s leading exchanges any more. Its brand may be one of the most recognisable in the world but it has slipped in the rankings to 10th-largest bourse as measured by the market capitalisation of the exchange as a listed entity. TMX is 11th.Yet this would be to miss the significance of the deal. It is mostly about one thing: creating a mining listings giant. Both bourses are home to a huge number of mining and resource company listings.Together they would have more company listings than any other exchange – more than 6,300, compared with NYSE Euronext’s 4,500. And that would create a resources behemoth at a time of high commodity prices and unprecedented activity in exploration.A next step to boost liquidity in London and Toronto could be offering cross-listings between both markets in key mining stocks, allowing seamless trading across two big time zones, with the obvious attractions that both markets share the same legal system and language. (Can a “Commonwealth” of exchanges be far off, linking Australia, Singapore and India too? Mr Rolet recently inked a co-operation deal with the National Stock Exchange of India.)In a hint of Mr Rolet’s new resources focus, though, the LSE last month agreed to co-operate with the stock exchange on Mongolia, the latest hotspot for mining and resources. The aim is clear: to land that next big Mongolian resources IPO. That is by no means an outlandish idea.As for TMX Group, it has for some time been viewed as a logical partner for the LSE. It too is suffering at the hands of competitors such as Chi-X in Canadian stocks. But its TSX Ventures Exchange junior board – similar to the LSE’s Aim market – is booming amid a flood of mining and resources listings.An early sign of the flirtation between London and Toronto came back in March 2009, when they agreed a “strategic partnership”. The Canadian bourse has provided the LSE with its Sola derivatives trading system and has a 19.9 stake in EDX, the LSE’s small Russian and Nordic derivatives exchange.Thomas Caldwell, a Canadian who runs arguably the best known fund that invests in global exchanges, Caldwell Financial, says the Sola system has a good track record and has been used by Euronext and others over the years and could help the LSE develop its derivatives business too. “It doesn’t give them a slam dunk but it does give them a system on which they can trade and develop products”.TMX Group also owns the Montreal Exchange, a derivatives exchange which itself owns BOX, one of the eight options exchanges in the US. So the LSE now has a toehold in the backyard of rivals Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext.That raises an intriguing possibility: could there be a counter-bid from either of those two US players?
745;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-08T22:36:31Z;Nasdaq looks to derivatives to boost margins;;Outside the office window of Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, the global exchange operator, progress on the Ground Zero rebuilding is visible, with the Freedom Tower up to 40 storeys.Mr Greifeld, meanwhile, is presiding over Nasdaq’s own transformation, from a stock exchange to a more diversified group, the fruits of which he hopes will soon be visible to investors.US equity trading volumes have declined and margins have been squeezed by competition from upstart exchanges and venues such as BATS Exchange and Direct Edge.But Nasdaq’s shares hit a 2½-year high this week – its 40th anniversary – following full-year results that showed it generated more revenues from derivatives than equities for the first time in its history, which also resulted in record earnings for the fourth quarter.Mr Greifeld, who has run Nasdaq since 2003, says the most recent quarter marks “a watershed”. Nasdaq, like its peers, has been attempting to diversify away from low-yielding equities into derivatives, which provide higher margins in a faster-growing market.Mr Greifeld says he is expecting an upswing as investors return to higher-yielding stocks from low-yield but less-risky fixed income investments. “We look forward to enjoying the change of investor psychology,” he says.But Nasdaq’s rebound is not yet complete. Post-crisis, it has seen its share price trail that of its rival NYSE Euronext. The shares are up 32 per cent since the market bottom in March 2009, versus an 86 per cent rise for NYSE and a 75 per cent rise in the S&P 500 index.While NYSE engineered a 2007 merger with Euronext, operator of exchanges across Europe, Nasdaq has made several smaller acquisitions in recent years. It began with OMX, the Nordic exchange group acquired for $3.7bn in 2007, and PHLX, the US single-stock options market, acquired for $652m in the same year.More recently, Nasdaq has launched an over-the-counter derivatives clearing house and a power market in the UK.That has been an expensive and difficult strategy at times. Costs have risen sharply, with Nasdaq recently forecasting expenses for 2011 that exceeded analysts’ estimates. Its total debt-to-operating earnings ratio is higher than that of rivals NYSE Euronext and CME Group.Last year, Nasdaq closed Nasdaq OMX Europe, its attempt to build a pan-European share trading business, after it attracted persistently low volumes. Nasdaq also lost out to BATS Global Markets, parent of BATS Exchange, in the running to buy Chi-X Europe, a much larger pan-European trading platform than the failed Nasdaq venture and which is now the second largest trading venue in Europe.None of that seems to bother Mr Greifeld. “There are not many [exchanges] making much money in pan-European trading today,” he says.Nasdaq also sold $367m in debt to finance a repurchase of its shares held by Borse Dubai. Diego Perfumo, analyst at Equity Research Desk, said: “That is what you see in a mature business. They are using balance sheet leverage because operating leverage in trading is minimal, with so much competition and traders demanding big rebates.”Mr Greifeld sees opportunities to reverse that perception of maturity in derivatives. With equity derivatives, he aims to build on the growth of its single stock options market – which took top market share in the US, beating rival Chicago Board Options Exchange – by launching higher-margin proprietary products.“We see what CBOE has done with the Vix and its proprietary indices, and it’s our job to innovate,” says Mr Greifeld.Nasdaq will this year launch options on its Alpha index, which was created by the same economist who developed the Vix volatility index for CBOE. It has also invested in expanded services for stock issuers, such as investor relations and tools for corporate boards, as a way to fend off a more aggressive campaign by NYSE to win US listings, especially in the technology sector.“It’s been a high-revenue growth opportunity for us,” says Mr Greifeld.However, it has also increased Nasdaq’s exposure to cybercrime, already a concern for exchanges. It was revealed last week that Directors Desk, a cloud-based tool for corporate boards to share information, was hacked into last year. Nasdaq said the attack did not lead to any documents being stolen and did not threaten its trading systems.Mr Greifeld sees opportunities in the technology around market structures, such as surveillance and pre-trade risk management, increasingly a focus for regulators as they seek to ensure that high-frequency trading does not jeopardise market systems. Last year, Nasdaq acquired FTEN, a US provider of pre-trade risk software, and Smarts, an Australian group that tracks market data for regulators.“[Market] surveillance is not adequate, at the regulator level, the broker-dealer level, the exchange level,” he says. “We didn’t buy Chi-X, we bought FTEN and Smarts, and we obviously feel pretty good about that.”
746;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-08T22:30:11Z;NYSE to launch futures market by March;;NYSE Euronext, the global exchange operator, said it would launch a US futures market by March, marking the next step in its shift toward derivatives and technology.The launch of New York Portfolio Clearing, the clearinghouse co-owned by NYSE and the Depository Trust & Clearing Company, has received initial regulatory approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Final approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission for the clearinghouse’s proposal to allow traders to use margin from accounts in other markets operated by NYSE as credit toward futures margins is also anticipated this month, the company said on Tuesday.By next quarter, NYSE Euronext is expected to begin clearing interest rate futures traded by NYSE Liffe US, a unit created after the merger of the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext in 2007. The market for US rate futures has traditionally been dominated by CME Group.“We do believe if we build it, the volume will come,” said Michael Geltzeiler, NYSE chief financial officer. “There is fundamental value in cross-margining, and we expect significant volume early on.”NYPC lost $30m in the fourth quarter. NYSE expects the business to lose money again in 2011, but much less, Mr Geltzeiler said.NYSE’s earnings per share in the fourth quarter were 46 cents excluding one-time merger and tax changes, the company reported on Tuesday. That was a decline of 21 per cent from the same period a year ago. Net income was $120m for the quarter, also a decline of 21 per cent year-over-year.Volumes across the industry have been depressed as volatility in interest rates in the US and Europe were much subdued following central bank easing, and investors shied away from equities in favour of fixed-income investments.NYSE was able to top analyst expectations, however, thanks to better-than-anticipated cost control and fees generated by trading. Analysts had expected earnings of 43 cents a share.Expenses of $425m were below the $432m expected. Analysts have been watching NYSE Euronext’s costs carefully as it expands its “co-location” data centres in the US and UK, which were launched in the fourth quarter. Those units are expected to begin generating revenues in the first quarter of 2011.NYSE’s technology sales continued to grow, however. Sales were $114m for the quarter, up $11m versus a year ago. That included a new agreement with Goldman Sachs to power its SigmaX electronic exchange in Europe.Revenues for the group were $613m in the fourth quarter, a decline of 4 per cent from the same period a year ago, due largely to reduced volumes in US share trading and European rate derivatives.The revenue mix continued to shift toward faster growing businesses. Technology sales, which include co-location services and trading software for other exchanges, were 18 per cent of total revenues, up from 15 per cent last year.Revenues from derivatives, the bulk of which are in its US options market and European interest-rate derivatives, accounted for 33 per cent of total revenues in the fourth quarter, up from 29 per cent in the same quarter a year ago.Trading of shares declined from 56 per cent to 49 per cent of revenue.“A key part of the growth story is becoming a technology firm. Investors are looking toward the first quarter of 2011 with co-location revenues, even if they may be a bit disappointed there wasn’t more growth in the fourth quarter,” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, exchanges analyst at Raymond James.The shares fell 1 per cent in trading on Tuesday to $33.41. They are up 48 per cent in the past year and have doubled since the market’s post-crisis low in March 2009.
747;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-04T13:02:07Z;Traders shun reopened European carbon market;;Europe’s spot carbon trading market reopened after a three-week shutdown on Friday but investors shunned trading amid ongoing concerns that the full extent of alleged hacking attacks was still unknown.The two major exchanges that resumed next-day trading of carbon emissions permits, Bluenext and EEX, recorded just a single trade between them in the first three hours of business.Confidence in the €80bn market, the largest carbon trading scheme in the world, has been badly affected after the European Commission suspended national registries – the electronic warehouses where permits are kept – following allegations that emissions allowances worth up to €30m had been stolen.This week the Commission gave permission for five national registries to reopen after they satisfied tighter security requirements but uncertainty in the market has meant only some exchanges have resumed the exchange of permits for cash, known as the spot market.“Members are reluctant to trade because of the uncertainties caused by the stolen certificates and the registries,” said Toralf Michaelsen, head of trading at EEX, the German exchange.Some exchanges operators remained unclear exactly how many allowances were allegedly stolen and did not know the unique serial numbers of the certificates.Furthermore the industry acknowledged legal ownership of the stolen permits that have crossed national borders needed to be resolved. The EC as yet has no centralised procedure for the recovery of illegally-transferred allowances and has stressed it is a matter for national law enforcement authorities.“We have the filter technology in place to isolate the serial numbers but we are of the opinion that we do not have a full overview of everything reported, said Hendrik Hasselknippe, managing director of global product development at GreenX, the exchange owned by CME Group, the US-based group. Trading in the daily carbon spot contract remains closed on GreenX.Paris-based Bluenext, which announced it would reopen late on Thursday, said it received confirmation lists of the contract serial numbers that were in dispute.“Our members can be absolutely confident that no known permit under question can be traded on our market,” said François-Xavier Saint-Macary, chief executive of Bluenext.However ICE Futures Europe, GreenX and LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house, remained closed to spot carbon trading. Dealers said business remained firm in carbon emissions derivatives, which accounts for more than 90 per cent of trading on the market and has remained unaffected by hacking.“There’s no need to rush things,” said Mr Hasselknippe. “The market can cope.”
748;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-04T09:54:27Z;ICE holds off resuming spot carbon trading;;Attempts to restore confidence to Europe’s stalled carbon trading market has been thrown into doubt as ICE, operator of the region’s largest emissions trading exchange, said it would remain shut for spot trading, even as authorities cleared some national registries to resume business.The European Commission confirmed on Thursday it would allow five national registries – France, Germany, the Netherlands, Slovakia and the United Kingdom – to resume operations following a series of attacks by computer hackers on the European emissions trading system last month.Each national registry had “given reasonable assurances” they met the EC’s minimum requirements to restore confidence in the market after the attack, the EC said.The physical market, also known as the “spot” market, has been closed in Europe since January 19, when the Commission suspended national registries to stabilise the market. Authorities estimate that as much as €30m worth of permits were stolen from a system in which permits that put a price on industrial pollution are bought and sold.“These national registries will resume normal operations on February 4 at 8am central European time. Co-operation with national authorities is constructive and the Commission expects several more reports to be submitted in the coming days,” it said in a statement.EEX, the German exchange, and Bluenext, the Paris-based operator, opened for business but reticence by other infrastructure operators highlighted the extent to which confidence in the €80bn a year market has been affected by the security breach.Operators remained unclear exactly how many allowances were allegedly stolen and did not know the unique serial numbers of the certificates. ”The major issue for us is the ability of the market to run smoothly, safely and to have a price building mechanism for emissions,” said Hans-Bernd Menzel, chief executive of EEX.ICE Futures Europe, the region’s largest exchange for carbon trading, extended its suspension on its next-day physical contract while it “assessed market conditions”.“We will advise the market at least 36 hours before reopening the daily futures contracts to ensure a fair and orderly market,” said David Peniket, president and chief operating officer at ICE.LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house, and GreenX, the exchange run by CME Group, also gave no indication when it would allow spot trading in the carbon market.Industry executives welcomed the reopening of some national registers amid rising pressure from traders that to restore falling confidence by reopening a market that had been shut for two weeks.However trust in the market remained low. Traders and exchanges pointed out that the issue of the legal ownership of the stolen permits that have crossed national borders needed to be resolved. The EU’s emissions trading scheme, the largest carbon trading scheme in the world, allows the free trade of permits across a 30-country bloc. As details of the thefts emerge, it has become clear that many permits have dispersed across Europe but standards of investor protection and compensation vary from country to country.The EC as yet has no centralised procedure for the recovery of illegally-transferred allowances and has stressed it is a matter for national law enforcement authorities.
749;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-03T22:10:19Z;CME sees ‘mimimal impact’ from reform;;CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, said on Thursday that US financial regulatory reform would have a “minimal impact” on its core business of listed derivatives, although it still hopes to capture a share of revenues from over-the-counter trading.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, made the comments as CME reported quarterly profits that fell short of Wall Street expectations.The financial industry is braced for the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed last year, to make itself clear as Washington regulators rush to craft rules to implement the legislation.CME hopes to benefit from the law’s requirement that standardised contracts in the vast OTC derivatives market must be cleared by central counterparties. The exchange group has launched clearing for interest-rate swaps and credit-default swaps, although neither has gained much volume.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, said on Thursday that the overhaul would be exclusively focused on the OTC sector.“Dodd-Frank will have a minimal impact on exchange-traded markets,” he said, although he added that the exact implications of the legislation remained unclear and would do so until at least July, when regulators hit a deadline to devise rules for implementation.In its resuts, net income fell to $196m or $2.93 per share from $203m or $3.04 per share in the same period a year earlier.Excluding extraordinary items – a tax-related charge of $51.3m and an $8.6m charge incurred for the early payoff of a term loan – net proft was $3.77 per share, below analysts’ average forecast of about $3.82 per share.The company is increasing its dividend to about 35 per cent of the prior year’s cash earnings, up from about 30 per cent, reflecting the lack of big acquisition opportunities on the horizon. CME finished last year with $905m of cash and $2.5bn in debt.MF Global, one of the world’s biggest commodity brokerages, also reported results on Thursday that missed analysts’ forecasts. The company – run by Jon Corzine, the former head of Goldman Sachs and governor of New Jersey – said it made a net loss of $9.7m or 6 cents per share in the last three months of 2010, compared to a loss of $22.3m or 18 cents per share a year earlier.Excluding extraordinary items, MF Global earned 3 cents per share in its fiscal third quarter, below average estimates of 5 cents.The company was granted primary dealer status by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York this week, a critical step in Mr Corzine’s long-term strategy of transforming it into an investment bank. The development will enable MF Global to participate directly in auctions of US Treasury securities.CME shares were down 4.5 per cent at $300.86 in New York, while MF Global was 1.4 per cent lower at $8.36.
750;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-01T16:55:35Z;CFTC grants licence to NYPC clearing house;;Two of the world’s biggest financial exchanges moved closer on Tuesday towards a head-on battle for the US interest-rate futures market, after regulators gave the go-ahead to a clearing challenge to the CME Group’s near-monopoly over the business.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, granted “derivatives clearing organisation” status to New York Portfolio Clearing (NYPC), a clearing house for Treasury futures that NYSE Liffe – NYSE Euronext’s US futures arm – plans to launch in collaboration with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade services group that clears cash equities.NYSE Euronext has long touted the venture as a long-term challenge to the CME’s stranglehold over the market. However, although the CFTC decision marks an important step in the process, NYPC has yet to receive approval for its central business proposition – the ability to cross-margin interest rate futures with US Treasuries and other fixed income securities and repos. The regulator said on Tuesday it is “still considering that request”.Its backers envisage that NYPC will enable dealers to post margin for both kinds of products in a “single pot” which would, in effect, mean that traders hedging their cash positions with futures would be able to save on margin costs. In this way, NYPC aims to build market share by appealing to traders’ desire for capital efficiency.Chicago’s futures exchanges created Treasury futures in the 1970s: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange developed contracts on short-term Treasuries, while the Chicago Board of Trade launched longer-term contracts. The former bought the latter for $11bn in 2007, creating the CME Group, a company that controls almost the entire US Treasury futures business.While the CME is wary of the challenge that NYPC presents, it is starting from a position of dominance and calculates that it would take a seismic shift in industry behaviour to make a significant impact on its market share.The most recent upstart to challenge the CME’s position has been ELX, an electronic futures exchange that launched in 2009 and is supported by some of the most important Treasury futures trading houses including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan.In spite of an aggressive campaign to win business, ELX has so far garnered less than 5 per cent of the interest-rate futures market. The exchange has taken a number of steps in the past month to try to win more business.This week it cut its trading fees to a flat 9 cents per contract – down from 24 cents for smaller transactions – while last month it reduced its minimum block-trade size to 300 contracts from 1,000 contracts.
751;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-01T02:51:43Z;Natural gas trading briefly halted on CME;;Natural gas trading on a CME Group electronic platform halted unexpectedly on Monday in the latest glitch to bedevil the exchange operator.CME said gas futures and options trading on the Globex platform stopped at 12:11pm central US time due to “a technical issue” it did not specify. It resumed 34 minutes later.“This was a rare occurrence, and we’ve implemented immediate corrective procedures to prevent a reoccurrence in the future,” the exchange said in a statement.The Chicago-based company has been dogged by technology problems in recent months. In September an employee mistakenly placed 30,000 fake orders on active energy and metals markets during a quality assurance test. Days before, in an unrelated episode, the CME inadvertently sent out an e-mail virus to many of the same firms affected by the fake orders.CME’s gas contracts, offered on its New York Mercantile Exchange unit, are among the most widely traded energy derivatives. A rival gas swap is offered by CME competitor IntercontinentalExchange.A New York gas broker said that during the hiatus, “nobody would make markets. No one would trade. But it wasn’t exactly an outbreak of chaos.”Front-month March Nymex natural gas traded at $4.318 per m British thermal units before the halt, then was about a penny higher after trading resumed.CME said some working orders left open before the halt would be cancelled, but no trades were cancelled.…
752;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-02-01T02:17:25Z;Wells Fargo becomes clearing member of CME;;Wells Fargo Securities has become a clearing member of CME Group, operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, making it the latest bank to seek to take advantage of opportunities in providing over-the-counter derivatives broking services.The move, announced on Monday, is a boost to the CME, coming four months after it launched its OTC interest rates swaps clearing service, which now boasts 12 clearing members. The last was RBS, which joined in November. CME is one of the world’s largest derivatives clearing houses,It also comes weeks before London-based rival LCH.Clearnet is set to launch a similar service clearing interest rate swaps for so-called “buyside” users of such swaps. These buyers range from hedge funds, pension funds and other institutional investors, to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two US government-sponsored mortgage lenders.The Dodd-Frank act passed in the US last year mandates clearing of “standardised” OTC derivatives. The interest rate swaps market is seen as the biggest business opportunity for clearing houses and OTC derivatives brokers since it is 10 times bigger than the higher-profile credit default swaps market.Banks and independent futures brokers, such as Newedge and MF Global, are set for a central role in the Dodd-Frank reforms since the law requires that “futures commission merchants” (FCM) – futures brokers – act as intermediaries between users of OTC derivatives and clearing houses.Banks that already had FCM operations, broking on-exchange futures and options, have been busy re-engineering those to include an anticipated wave of business from clients wanting them to handle OTC derivatives as well.Wells Fargo, however, had no existing futures and options business and has built its OTC derivatives broking business from scratch.Jeff Gore, managing director at Wells Fargo Securities, told FT Trading Room: ”We realise our clients have a need as it relates to Dodd-Frank and clearing so we are taking the approach of being able to serve our customers’ needs. We expect that this is going to be a big need in terms of OTC clearing.”CME said it had cleared $980.5m in notional value of OTC interest rate swaps since launch of the service in October.

March West Texas Intermediate gained 66 cents to $86.85 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.The disparity, the widest since February 2009, could muddy the debate over the causes of and response to higher oil prices.WTI, regularly cited in the US press as the authoritative oil price, has fallen 4.6 per cent in the past month. Brent has gained 3.6 per cent and topped $99 in mid-January.“We tend to always think of the US price as the price of oil. It is getting harder to do that,” said Tom Bentz, a broker and analyst with BNP Paribas Commodity Derivatives in New York.The divergence reflects shifting supply dynamics. Nymex WTI futures are delivered to a tank complex at Cushing, Oklahoma.The US government reported a near record 37.7m barrels of crude at Cushing last week, weighing on prices for imminent delivery there.Cushing stocks could rise further with the opening of a new pipeline from Canada and new shipments by rail from North Dakota state. TransCanada, the pipeline developer, said on Wednesday it had received interest in building another line to send 150,000 barrels a day from Cushing to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico, but it would not open until 2013.High Brent prices, meanwhile, reflected declining supplies in the North Sea and greater oil demand in Asia, said Lawrence Eagles, head of oil research at JPMorgan.“Brent and WTI have been trading increasingly as entirely separate commodities in recent weeks,” Mr Eagles said.Some Wall Street analysts have suggested investors reduce exposure to WTI.“We prefer to express our bullish view on crude through Brent,” Morgan Stanley said this month.Nymex parent CME Group recently offered free trading in its lookalike Brent contract.Investors appear to be sticking with WTI, however. ICE traders hold futures contracts worth 962m barrels of Brent on ICE, a rise of 26 per cent from a year earlier. On Nymex, WTI open interest was equal to 1.5bn barrels, 14 per cent more year on year.
754;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-01-24T17:39:45Z;Energy options traders cotton on to soft commodity volatility;;Frustrated energy options traders are exiting New York oil and gas pits for sugar and cotton as volatility sweeps through “soft” commodities.Traders are migrating from New York Mercantile Exchange, an energy bourse on the third storey of a CME Group building in Manhattan, to a soft commodities exchange run by IntercontinentalExchange on the seventh floor.The shift reflects divergent trends in volatility, which is vital to commodity options trading. Ample spare energy supply has stifled wild moves in oil and gas, while strong demand and weather problems have induced sharp moves in softs.On Monday, ICE cotton surged by the daily allowable limit to an exchange record. ICE cocoa, also traded on the seventh floor, jumped after an export banin Ivory Coast, the largest producer.“Guys who were trading crude and natural gas downstairs are working their way upstairs,” said Roger Corrado, a softs broker with Spectron. “The volatility in our markets is pretty off the charts.”A common measure of realised volatility in the Dow Jones-UBS softs sub­index has soared 38 per cent in the past year. Volatility in the energy subindex has fallen 31 per cent.Trading volume doubled in ICE cotton options in the fourth quarter of 2010 from a year earlier and rose by half in sugar options. Nymex gas options volume rose 7 per cent and oil volume rose 1 per cent.Ed Hernandez, a natural gas marketmaker, recently moved to the seventh floor to trade cotton options. Volatility “is pretty much everything” he said.“When I made my switch, cotton was limit-up every day. That’s the reason I jumped in here.”Energy traders, used to following gas storage data and Opec statements, will have to get used to markets guided by obscure statistics on cotton stockpiles or tropical rainfall.“But people are trading derivatives more than the fundamentals of any commodity,” said Mark Benigno of Hudson Capital Energy, an options dealer. “It’s a portable expertise.”Steven Williams, volatility strategist at Louis Capital Markets, said thinly traded softs markets could quickly become saturated, cutting traders’ margins.“Softs will be good for a while, but I know from my floor days that once people start talking about how good trading is, it’s the beginning of the end,” he said. “The easy money was likely made before the migration started.”Nearly all commodity futures trading on CME and ICE now takes place on computer screens, but the complexity of options has kept traditional open-outcry trading floors busy.ICE declined to comment on the shift. CME said: “Energy market participants typically trade a variety of products.”
755;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Euro bets switch as hopes on debt rise;;Hedge funds and currency traders have reversed their bets against the euro amid hopes that European leaders will resolve the region’s debt crisis.Figures from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, often used as a proxy for hedge fund activity, show that investors bought $8bn worth of euros in the seven days to January 18, a record for a week.This meant that speculative positions switched from a $7.4bn bet that the euro would fall against the dollar, the biggest “short” position since July, to a $688m bet that the single currency would rise. The figures capture a small part of trading in the global foreign exchange market.The sharp shift in sentiment comes amid mounting speculation that Europe’s politicians are preparing a more radical response to the crisis, including options for overhauling the eurozone’s €440bn bail-out fund. China and Japan, the world’s largest holders of currency reserves, have also voiced support for efforts to end the crisis.Hawkish comments from Jean-Claude Trichet, European Central Bank president, have helped improve sentiment towards the single currency too.Gareth Berry, forex strategist at UBS, said that the adjustment in traders’ euro positions was so sudden and on such a scale that it had eclipsed the more gradual trimming of bets against the single currency that followed the European Union and International Monetary Fund rescue of Greece in May last year. “Clearly, the belief has taken hold that European officials could be planning a massive policy response to the sovereign debt crisis, and investors have closed their short positions out of caution,” he said.The shift was reflected in the performance of the euro, which put in its strongest performance since the Greece bail-out in the week to January 18. The single currency rallied more than 4 per cent from a four-month low of $1.2871 against the dollar to reach a one-month high of $1.3400. The euro has since risen further, gaining two cents to a two-month high just below $1.36 against the dollar.Jens Nordvig, currency strategist at Nomura, said he saw no reason to sell into the euro’s rally, estimating that speculators on the CME had added another $1.5bn in bets on further euro strength last week, taking their long position to about $2bn.The rise in the euro has come amid persistent reports from traders of buying by Asian central banks, notably China, which have expressed a desire to diversify their currency reserves away from the dollar.Michael Derks, chief strategist at FxPro, said one of the explanations for the euro’s rise against the dollar had been China’s public expression of support for the single currency. Beijing has amassed $2,900bn of foreign exchange reserves.“In terms of both talk and money, China faced down the euro shorts when the single currency broke down through $1.30 against the dollar and was looking fragile,” he said.
756;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME eyes bigger Brent oil market share;Move to woo investors deserting WTI contract;CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, has launched a bid to capture market share in Brent oil trading, waiving fees for dealing in the North Sea crude oil as it woos investors deserting its flagship West Texas Intermediate contract.Brent is the benchmark oil contract of London-based ICE Futures Europe, but a similar contract also trades on CME, which owns the New York Mercantile Exchange. West Texas Intermediate is the flagship oil contract at Nymex.“Complement your Brent trading with free-trading Brent crude oil,” CME said in a memo to customers on Tuesday. Joe Raia, managing director of energy and metals products at CME, said the waiver would be extended six months. “Brent has always been an important part of the contracts we offer to our customers,” he said.The move to encourage Brent trading comes as the WTI contract has suffered several setbacks as booming inventories at its landlocked delivery point in Cushing, Oklahoma, have depressed prices, disconnecting it from the global oil market, analysts and traders said. Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, dropped WTI as its benchmark for sales in the US two years ago.In spite of its problems, financial investors have remained loyal to WTI and volumes of the benchmark traded on Nymex are much higher than Brent volumes on ICE.However, banks, including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, have recently told investors to shift their oil exposure to Brent, dropping WTI. Bankers said there was anecdotal evidence some investors had changed their benchmark.Trading volumes rose faster on ICE Brent last year than on Nymex WTI.Jan Loeys, strategist at JPMorgan in New York, told clients last week that Brent was a “better expression” for the bank’s bullish view on oil than WTI.“We believe that although WTI remains an important benchmark for Canadian and inland US crudes, Brent is now a better gauge of the global oil market.”The International Energy Agency said this week Brent was “gaining more acceptance as the global benchmark” given its role as a price link to European, Asian, and Middle East and Russian crudes.But traders and analysts said that Brent was not foolproof. From time to time, the North Sea blend of different crudes – in reality, Brent nowadays is a mix of Brent proper, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk crudes – also detaches itself from global trends due to local production problems.
757;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
758;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Large bets fuel commodity bull run;Speculative trading sends prices excessively high;Still in its infancy, 2011 is conjuring up memories of the start of 2008. Soaring crop prices have stoked fears of a food crisis and oil markets are bubbling.In some parts of the world, inflationary pressure is building: once again, the commodity speculator is centre stage.Prices for corn, soyabeans and wheat have in January returned to highs that only two years ago sparked food riots in more than 30 countries from Haiti to Bangladesh. Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, hit $99 a barrel on Friday, its highest level for 27 months.In America this week, regulators unveiled sweeping rules to keep big traders from wielding too much power over prices, amid fears that another food crisis could jeopardise global economic recovery. US senators warned of a “speculative bubble that threatens to drive up gas and food prices even further”.Many commodity prices are rising for good reasons. Physical demand is rising strongly, whether for petrol (Chinese car sales rose by a third last year) or for corn (the US ethanol industry will consume 40 per cent of the nation’s crop this year).But investors are stoking the commodities bull run with some big bets. Money flows into commodities have been huge. Barclays Capital estimates $60bn was injected into commodities in 2010. Some observers believe speculative trading has sent prices to excessively high levels, making a sharp recoil likely should the fragile economic optimism fade.Figures from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US regulator, reveal very bullish bets among money managers such as hedge funds.In late December they owned a record net “long”, or buying, position in crude oil futures and options on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In September the same types of traders held record net longs in corn.As well as hedge funds analysing global economic trends, money managers include trend followers who use computer programs to ride market momentum and “high-frequency” traders who move in and out of positions in microseconds. Electronic traders helped send volumes last year in energy, metals and agricultural commodities at the CME, the largest US futures exchange, to a record.Boris Shrayer, head of commodities marketing at Morgan Stanley, says: “Our business has changed. In the past there were more hedge fund participants who were fundamental or discretionary, going long or short commodities. Today there is an enormous amount of quant funds.“Look at the correlations: copper goes up and two seconds later oil clicks up. The dollar falls, oil rallies. It’s very clear there’s an enormous amount of this correlation trading going on.”At the opposite end of the speculative spectrum are investors passively tracking baskets of commodities, such as the S&P GSCI or Dow Jones-UBS indices, and who trade once a month at most when they roll out of expiring futures contracts.These investors, which include Calpers, the US’s largest public pension fund, and other big institutions, are strictly buyers, often to hedge against inflation. As such, they have become targets of critics claiming they themselves push up prices.“To me it’s a bubble,” says Amy Myers Jaffe of Rice University in Houston, who has studied the relationship between oil prices and speculation. “The question is: are we going to have an orderly unwind or a disorderly unwind?”Hard evidence, though, of strong correlations between traders’ positions and price movements is elusive.In New York cotton trading managed money’s bullish position has fallen by half since mid-September. Prices hit their highest level in exchange history in December. Money managers, moreover, were bearish on soyabeans as recently as July, just before a months-long rally. They quickly built a record net long position by November.“The weight of evidence points to small marginal impacts at most on the average level of prices,” says Scott Irwin, economist at the University of Illinois.Stung by accusations it was blind to the activity of index investors, the CFTC in 2009 began publishing their overall positions. The data did not help the critics.It showed indexers’ net long position in US crude futures fell 11 per cent in the first six months of 2008, even as oil rose to $140 a barrel. Their cotton position was roughly unchanged in 2010, in spite of the surge to record prices. Even as wheat has jumped since July, the index net long position has declined.Lawrence Eagles, head of oil research at JPMorgan, says: “When oil demand has risen by a massive 2.5m barrels a day [in 2010] and supply is still being held off the market, it’s very difficult to create a case that speculators are pushing oil prices higher.” Oscar Bleetstein, of Credit Suisse, says: “There was a huge bubble and it collapsed. People got out and then scrambled to get back in. Now it seems like it’s more back on track.”The CFTC wants to limit big speculators’ holdings. Yet even some of its members doubt its proposals would affect prices.Alberto Weisser, chief executive of Bunge, one of the world’s biggest agricultural traders, is dismissive. “We don’t feel we have too many speculators, and the speculators we have we don’t like to call speculators. We really need people who like to be long because we need to sell our hedges.”
759;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-01-13T00:33:53Z;Illinois business angered by tax increase;;"Some of the world’s biggest businesses reacted angrily after the Illinois legislature approved tax increases of up to 67 per cent, warning that the measure would harm investment and job-creation in the recession-hit state.Proponents of Wednesday’s increases – a jump in the personal income tax rate from 3 per cent to 5 per cent and a rise in business income taxes from 7.3 per cent to 9.5 per cent– say they will help the state tackle a $15bn budget deficit, unfunded pension liabilities of at least $80bn, and more than $8bn of unpaid bills to educational institutions and social welfare providers.However, Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, said the legislation was “a step in the wrong direction” and said it “would make it more
difficult for Caterpillar to compete in today’s global economy”. The company, which has its headquarters in Peoria in downstate Illinois, employs 23,000 people in the state.CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, said the new tax rates “will negatively impact jobs and business opportunities for Illinois residents and stifle economic growth in our state”. The Chicago-based group noted that the legislation “will give Illinois one of the highest corporate tax rates in the US”.“The only businesses that will benefit are the moving companies that will be helping many of my members move out of this state,” said Gregory Baise, head of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association.As well as the tax increases, business is also upset over a clause in the legislation to eliminate companies’ ability to carry net losses over from one financial year to the next. “That means that even companies that have been running at a loss could be paying tax if they have income in the current year – that’s something they weren’t planning on,” said Jim Kane, managing director at True Partners Consulting, the tax consultancy.Neighbouring Wisconsin signalled it wanted to take advantage of business animosity to the taxes. “Years ago, Wisconsin had a tourism campaign targeted to Illinois with the motto, ‘Escape to Wisconsin’,” said Scott Walker, the governor. “Today we renew that call to Illinois businesses, ‘Escape to Wisconsin’. You are welcome here.”The tax increase received a muted welcome in the bond markets. In the derivatives market, the cost of default protection on Illinois bonds fell, market sources said, an indication that the perceived risk of lending to Illinois is less.“By no means is Illinois ‘fixed’,” said Matt Fabian, managing director at Municipal Market Advisors. “But they have taken a positive step for a state that has taken no positive steps for the last two years.”State and local governments in the US are in the spotlight amid concerns that years of fiscal mismanagement laid bare by the recession could lead to a spike in defaults.The tax proposal initially called for combined business taxes to rise to 10.9 per cent, the highest of any state, a 75 per cent increase in the personal income tax rate to 5.25 per cent and a $1-per-packet rise in cigarette taxes.It passed only after the increases were moderated, the new cigarette tax was scrapped and spending limits were added. The proposal passed the Illinois House by 60 votes to 57 and the Senate by 30 votes to 29. No Republicans voted for the measure, arguing that the state needed to do more to cut its spending.Democrats countered that lower spending would not be enough to solve the state’s financial woes. “Illinois is in crisis, absolute financial crisis, and there is no way we can dig ourselves out of the crisis without increased revenues,” said Barbara Flynn Currie, House majority leader. “There is no way we can cut our way out of the deficit we face.”Republicans were unmoved. “You may think you’re stabilising the budget, but you’re not,” said Matt Murphy, a senator from Palatine, in the Chicago suburbs. “You’re bankrupting our state.”During the debate, House Democrats twice failed to win support for a measure to borrow an additional $8.75bn to help pay overdue bills."
760;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-01-12T22:36:57Z;LCH.Clearnet targets American launch;Plan to begin clearing of interest rate swaps next month in US;LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearing house, plans to launch clearing of interest rate swaps in the US next month, setting the stage for a battle between clearers for dominance of the largest over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market.Sweeping financial regulation, enshrined in the Dodd-Frank act in the US, is forcing much of the derivatives market on to exchanges and other types of trading platforms, as well as through clearing houses to help safeguard the system against the fallout from a big default.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, guaranteeing that a transaction goes ahead even if one party defaults.Regulators have until July 15 to finalise rules laying down how the industry should comply with Dodd-Frank, including defining what derivatives must be cleared and how clearing houses should be governed.On Thursday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, had been due to decide how the boards of clearing houses, also known as central counterparties (CCPs), should be filled to prevent any one group– such as dealer banks – having too much influence. The vote was delayed at the last minute, however.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, said the London-based clearer would not need to wait for the new regulatory regime.Pending approval from the UK’s Financial Services Authority, its SwapClear unit would start offering clearing of swaps to asset managers, hedge funds and other non-bank users of such derivatives in the US early next month.“Some clients want to be ‘early adopters’ in clearing so we will be ready before July 15,” Mr Liddell told the Financial Times. “We’ve got clearing members lined up.”Last week, LCH.Clearnet appointed Floyd Converse, a former Merrill Lynch banker, to a job based in New York spearheading the clearer’s push into the US.The new SwapClear service will pit LCH.Clearnet against CME Group, the Chicago-based futures exchange and clearer which launched interest rate swaps clearing in October. International Derivatives Clearing House, a swaps clearer controlled by Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange, has also launched a service.While much of the focus on reforming the derivatives markets has been on credit default swaps – seen as having exacerbated the 2008 financial crisis – the focus of the clearers is on interest rate swaps, a market that is 10 times bigger.The launch of swaps clearing before the implementation of rules around Dodd-Frank has been finalised is a sign of the pressure on clearers to put their offerings in the market. Banks and large non-bank user of OTC derivatives, such as Freddie Mac and Freddie Mae, the US mortgage lenders, are scrambling to build new systems to allow them to connect to CCPs. One banker said: “There is so much work to be done that people want to get started as quickly as they can. They can’t wait until July.” Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, this week expressed concern that the wave of OTC derivatives business “could unsettle the competitive equilibrium in the US clearing industry”.

Progress Energy was down 2.1 per cent to $43.075 on the news.iGate, the IT outsourcer, lost ground on deal news, tumbling 10.5 per cent to $17.14 after announcing it was buying India’s Patni Computer Systems. iGate said it would pay $921m to buy a 63 per cent stake in the medium-sized Indian IT group from its founders and private equity firm General Atlantic. The deal represents a 9.4 per cent premium to Patni’s closing price in Mumbai last week.Sara Lee was one of the few stocks to make ground on deal activity,up 4.5 per cent to $18.21 as rumours circulated that the food company was going to be the target of a takeover bid.The S&P 500 closed largely flat, falling 0.1 per cent to 1,269.75, as traders were reluctant to place large trades ahead of the earnings results season that starts this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 11,637.45 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2 per cent to 2,707.80.The Vix index, seen as a measure of fear on Wall Street, ticked up, rose 2.5 per cent to 17.56. In late December the index had dropped to levels not seen since before the financial crisis hit in 2008, but has since been rising steadily.Investor confidence also continued to be suppressed by fears that the US recovery in 2011 would not be as strong as many had hoped, after weak non-farm payroll data that came out on Friday.“The US employment data for December wrong-footed forecasters. Prior to release of the figures, market expectations of the month-on-month increase in non-farm payrolls had been rising,” said Stephen Lewis at Monument Securities Limited.The figures showed that the US economy created 103,000 non-farm jobs in December, falling short of the consensus forecast of about 140,000.Shares in Alcoa, the aluminium producer, crept up in anticipation of its fourth-quarter results which were due to be released after the closing bell. The figures heralded the start of the results season. Alcoa was up 0.4 per cent to $16.49. The aluminium maker was expected to announce earnings per share of 19 cents, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.Education stocks lost ground as Strayer Education, the fourth-largest for-profit education firm by market capitalisation, said enrolment in its university fell 20 per cent in the winter term, prompting fears of a wider drop in student numbers across the US. Shares in Strayer Education tumbled 22.6 per cent to $118.60. Capella Education was down 19.7 per cent to $53.94.Apollo Group, the US adult education company that owns the University of Phoenix, fell 5.5 per cent to $35.91. DeVry, an operator of for-profit further education colleges, lost 10 per cent to $42.81.CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, rose after Bernstein lifted its rating on the stock to “outperform” from “market perform”. CME was up 2.2 per cent to $314.31.Union Pacific, the railway group, was up 2.3 per cent to $97.36 as Goldman Sachs raised its price target on the stocks to $100 from $95.
762;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-01-10T16:19:42Z;Quick View: Is Brazil the next shoe to drop?;;As the new year starts it doesn’t look like there are many mature – or maturing – markets left where the incumbent exchange still dominates equity trading.The story of 2010 was one of fragmentation. And like dominoes they fell: this time last year the Tokyo Stock Exchange launched Arrowhead, a new trading system partially designed to forestall competition from Chi-X and the other PTSs (as alternative trading platforms there are known).The ASX exchange in Australia is about to feel the hot blast of competition, one reason why it is proposing to merge with SGX of Singapore.And in Fortress Spain – long resistant to the competitive forces of Mifid – the Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME) – has started to realise its monopoly may not last, while a home-grown challenger appears to be emerging.The latest shoe to drop is Brazil.As my colleague Jonathan Wheatley reports on beyondbrics, the FT’s emerging markets blog, it seems there is an embryonic plan to set up a stock trading platform that would challenge BM&FBovespa, the monopoly exchange in Brazil.At first sight, this seems inevitable. Brazil has attracted huge inflows of portfolio investment in the past year and it has become much easier to access Brazilian shares as the Bovespa segment of the bourse has upgraded technology, making such access easier.BM&FBovespa opened a marketing office in London last year, headed by Cathy Lyall, a former Chicago Board of Trade executive who knows the global markets well and should help the São Paolo-based exchange tap into a wider pool of traders in trading centres like London.But it’s not so obvious that the BM&FBovespa is as vulnerable as many other incumbent exchanges that have faced new upstarts. Things could be different this time.For one thing, there are no backers for this new trading platform yet. And there are signs that the most obvious candidates – the local banks and brokers that are presumably the Bovespa’s biggest customers – may not want to burn their bridges with an exchange that seems to be doing a pretty good job of modernising fast.Just today, it announced a deal with FlexTrade, a US-based trading technology company, that allows traders to use direct market access to BM&FBovespa through FlexTrade.Elsewhere the exchange has cut fees for high-frequency traders, introduced co-location and direct market access for derivatives and equities, developed a market-making scheme for cash equity options and cemented a strategic alliance with CME Group in the US. It is also building a multi-asset trading platform.Taken together, these measures show that the Brazilian exchange has anticipated market structure developments far better than other incumbents did in much more mature markets – one thinks of how long it took the London Stock Exchange to gear up for the arrival of Turquoise and Chi-X, and to embrace high-frequency trading.Alison Crosthwait, director of global trading research at Instinet, the broker owned by Nomura, says that to address regional financial crises that swept through Latin America over the last 15-20 years, Brazil’s market regulator developed a “robust equity market structure framework”.“This framework, combined with an improved trading platform and a low pricing structure, has helped the BM&FBovespa successfully court high-frequency trading groups over the last few years in a pre-emptive effort to stave off the competitors that have eroded the shares of other exchange incumbents.”Users sometimes complain about the high fees charged by the BM&FBovespa. But the exchange bundles together a whole series of services into its fee structure, services that long ago were outsourced by exchanges in New York and London to brokers (such as stock lending). So we have to be careful making apples to oranges comparisons between global peers on fees.Finally, perhaps the most significant hurdle to any would-be challenger is that, under Brazilian securities laws enacted in the wake of financial stock scandals more than 15 years ago, any new platform would have to either offer the whole gamut of exchange trading and clearing services – an expensive proposition – or set up a pure execution venue and outsource the rest to … guess who? BM&FBovespa. A tough choice.
763;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-01-09T08:14:01Z;Buyside seeks clearer view of OTC trading reconstruction;;Working nights and weekends is probably not in the job description of many government employees, and certainly not at the two US market regulators charged with coming up with detailed rules and regulations to implement sweeping reform of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. read the full reportBut Scott O’Malia, a commissioner at one of them – the Commodity Futures Trading commission, the US futures watchdog – said last week that was what some of the agency’s staff had been doing, so great is the pressure to get the work done by a deadline of July 15, set by the US Congress.By then, the precise ways in which large swaths of the financial industry are to deal in credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and other OTC derivatives are supposed to be clear. And by then, in theory, the way OTC derivatives markets function is supposed to be changed permanently, beginning a new chapter in the post-2008 financial crisis clean-up of the financial system. According to the Bank for International Settlements’ latest quarterly report, the notional amounts of outstanding contracts totalled $513,275bn as of June.Charles Marston is chief executive of Calypso Technology, a company picked by CME Group – which recently launched interest rate swaps clearing – to help its members manage intra-day clearing risks. He says: “Given the current regulatory initiatives designed to improve financial stability, we are going to see a fundamental shift in the OTC derivatives market toward the clearing of standardised OTC derivatives on exchanges.”Since passage of the Dodd-Frank act in June, the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission have been working on a series of “rulemakings” that set key definitions, such as what constitutes a “major swap participant” in the OTC markets, how big “block” trades should be. They also cover what an appropriate governance structure should be for entities such as clearing houses – through which many standard OTC derivatives are to be processed – and “swap execution facilities”, a new type of trading platform created by Dodd-Frank specifically for the trading of OTC derivatives.The workload is immense. That explains why the CFTC and SEC staff have been working anti-social hours to meet the July 15 deadline. Yet even as all this work is proceeding, what the new regulatory landscape means in practical terms for users of OTC derivatives such as pension funds, asset managers and hedge funds – the buyside – is far from clear.Mike Cahill, chief operating officer at the Options Clearing Corporation, a Chicago-based clearing house that clears for all eight US options exchanges, has been watching the process closely as the OCC plans to enter the OTC clearing business soon. He says: “The regulatory structure in the US has some significant uncertainty to it right now.”That may seem odd, given that Dodd-Frank set the stage for a revolution in the way OTC derivatives are to be treated. But a host of issues are bedevilling the buyside, including the added costs that use of clearing will impose, a matter of hot debate since last year.Fresh issues have cropped up in recent months. One is how pension funds and asset managers will be required to handle margin collateral, which is posted to a clearing house, of a central counterparty (CCP), to protect against a default.Large asset managers such as BlackRock and Pimco have been lobbying for collateral that must be held at a clearing house not to be held in so-called “omnibus” accounts, where such funds are pooled with that of other market participants.Instead, they are pushing for “segregated” accounts, where each buyside participant’s collateral would be ring-fenced from that of others, ensuring each participant is not exposed to the default of another – so-called “fellow customer risk”.Yet futures brokers – which are to play a key role in bringing customers’ OTC trades to a CCP – as well as the CCPs themselves argue that switching to this model for OTC derivatives “would bring significant added costs, which they aver would ultimately be borne by the customers”, the CFTC notes.One such cost would be an increase in the money CCPs ask of their customers to maintain an adequate default fund, since the collateral of non-defaulting swaps customers would not be available as a default resource. That, industry experts argue, will be another drag on investment returns for asset managers. The industry has until next week to pitch its comments to the CFTC, which may incorporate them into its final proposals.Some bankers argue that asset managers and pension funds face an additional headache simply in managing the operational complexity of posting upfront margin. Most will never have had to deal with placing margin before but will soon need to have the back office capability to manage daily changes to margin calculations that are routinely made by CCPs. Dave Olsen, head of OTC clearing at JPMorgan says: “It’s something the buyside has spent a lot of time trying to understand. It’s opaque and it’s reasonably complex.”Another thorny issue is how large-sized OTC derivatives trades are likely to be possible. In equity markets, it is common for institutional investors to carry out large orders on behalf of clients, and the same is expected in OTC derivatives as investors want to get large deals done without revealing their hand to the wider market.At the same time regulators want to bring transparency to the trading of OTC derivatives, so that as many of them as possible be traded on platforms where prices can be seen by all participants. Reconciling the desire by regulators to make swap trading and pricing data available to the public in real-time to promote transparency “while protecting the anonymity of market participants”, according to the CFTC, is the balance that the regulator will have to strike as it decides how big a block trade should be.Equally crucial will be the time delay by when a trade has to be reported publicly. The longer the time, the easier it is for a dealer to be able to hedge his position in the inter-dealer market as there will be less information about that trade in the public market, which rival traders might use to move prices.A current CFTC proposal suggests, in one of two scenarios, that only 5 per cent of OTC derivatives would classify as block trades.Lee Olesky, chief executive of Tradeweb, an electronic fixed income and derivatives trading platform, says: “There is a risk that if the rules are not sufficiently protective of block transactions it will be harder for anyone to take that trade on.” In Europe, too, uncertainty clouds the picture since reforms are proceeding on a twin – but not parallel – track.OTC derivatives clearing is being tackled in the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) proposals, produced by the European Commission in September, while the issue of how OTC derivatives are to be traded is being dealt with separately in a sweeping review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid).Hanging over all of this is a basic question: when will market participants actually have to start complying with the new regulations?Mr Olsen says: “It will be interesting to see if the requirement to clear will be for a ‘big bang’ on July 15. If that’s the case you’re going to have varying degrees of readiness.”Many large fund managers have been quite heavily involved in shaping the new rules by lobbying and attending regulators’ public roundtables. They are likely to be able to handle all the changes better than smaller players, he argues.But he adds: “I think you’ve got a pretty deep group of much smaller investors that have been less involved and have a less substantial call on the resources of the clearing providers. Their challenge gets bigger each day they are on the sidelines.”
764;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-01-06T19:48:18Z;Brent crude boosted by Asia demand;Premium over WTI rises to $6 a barrel;The world’s two main oil price yardsticks have diverged by one of the widest amounts in years, reflecting a change in global oil flows and commodity investment patterns, traders and analysts said.Brent crude, the European benchmark, was trading at $94.50 a barrel on Thursday, $6 more than US rival West Texas Intermediate. The price difference is the largest since May 2010 and the fifth largest since 2004. Similar in thickness and sulphur content, WTI regularly fetched more than Brent until recently.The price difference will influence the long-running contest for dominance in oil trading between CME Group’s New York Mercantile Exchange, home of the leading WTI futures contract, and IntercontinentalExchange’s London-based bourse where Brent is the flagship.Both Brent and WTI have risen in the past year as global oil demand recovers from the financial crisis, but Brent has outpaced its counterpart by nearly 10 percentage points.Traders said WTI has underperformed on expectations of a flood of new Canadian oil hitting Cushing, Oklahoma, the tank complex where WTI futures are delivered, with the opening of a new pipeline.“You have more and more crude bottled up at Cushing with nowhere to go,” said Abudi Zein of Genscape, which tracks oil levels at the hub.Cushing has few outlets to evacuate surplus oil, so a glut tends to depress the price of WTI relative to other US and international crude oil benchmarks.The price of Brent has by contrast held firm due to declining supplies from the North Sea, growing demand in Asia and an eastward shift in some Russian crude exports, which traditionally compete in Europe with Brent, traders said.Investors tracking the popular Standard & Poor’s GSCI index, a basket of commodity futures, are set to shift some bets to Brent from WTI starting today.But Michael McGlone, of S&P, disagreed that the pending changes were boosting Brent. “The information has been in the market for quite a while,” he said.Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, in 2009 dropped the widely used WTI oil contract as the benchmark for pricing its oil to customers in the US after another episode in which the price of WTI became separated from the rest of the oil market.The Saudi decision was later followed by other members of the Opec oil cartel, including Kuwait.
765;CME;CME Group Inc;2011-01-04T22:16:19Z;Investors seek solid assets as equities waver;Rise in trading volumes contrasts with decline in equity market activity;"Commodity trading surged to records at two leading exchanges last year as investors piled into hard assets and tight supply conditions sparked explosive price moves.The rise in trading volumes stands in contrast to a decline in activity on equity markets, where small investors remained reluctant to trade after losses in 2008 and the “flash crash” undercut stocks in a matter of minutes last May.CME Group, the US’s largest futures exchange, saw record volumes across its commodity categories in 2010, according to Sandler O’Neill, a New York investment bank. IntercontinentalExchange, the home of commodity futures including Brent crude oil, said volume on its UK-based energy exchange rose by a third to a new high.The rising volumes come as benchmark commodity prices have risen to the highest levels in two years; oil is above $90 a barrel for the first time since October 2008 and markets from cotton to wheat have seen dramatic volatility.Investors have also bought raw materials as insurance against inflation, with a record $354bn allocated to commodities as of November, according to Barclays Capital.“With the government printing money, some people have rushed to hard assets rather than paper assets, so in general commodities have done better,” said Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.Futures trading has also migrated on to computer screens and away from exchange floors.“The move to electronic trading and then to high-frequency trading pushes up volumes. It doesn’t show up in 2010 equity volumes because equities are years ahead of commodities with regard to both,” said Doug Hepworth, of Gresham Investment Management, a New York commodity-focused firm.“Large commercial hedgers and hedge funds can now trade significant volumes at very low cost and can take advantage of price discrepancies that would previously not have been profitable,” he said.Energy trading at CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange, which includes US benchmark crude oil and natural gas, rose 11 per cent last year, with a record 1.66m contracts changing hands daily. Agricultural commodities at CME, such as corn, soyabeans and wheat, saw daily volumes grow 23 per cent in 2010 to 913,000 contracts. Metals trading rose 40 per cent to 316,000 contracts daily on CME’s Comex as gold reached all-time highs above $1,400 a troy ounce.At ICE, trading in US-based soft commodities such as cotton, coffee and sugar rose 18.2 per cent to 235,000 contracts a day, but remained below a 2008 record, according to Sandler O’Neill. ICE Futures Europe, an energy exchange, reported volumes rose 32 per cent to a record 862,000 contracts a day.Separately on Tuesday, ICE frozen concentrated orange juice futures rose to $1.87 per pound, the highest point since April 2007, as traders surveyed the impact of a freeze last month in Florida. Later the January contract fell 1.7 per cent to $1.7720 before a broader correction in commodities prices. Copper for delivery in three months hit a fresh record of $9,754 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange before ending down 1.6 per cent at $9,532."
766;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-12-22T22:17:55Z;Clearers’ ownership model under scrutiny;;"Is it better for clearing houses to be run as bare-knuckle, profit-seeking businesses, or as more pedestrian public utilities?The Bank of England has just stirred the debate. It is considering whether banks should be allowed to hold lower capital weightings against positions held in a central clearing party that is user-owned and not-for-profit, a business model it says offers the best opportunity for good governance.Its suggestion, if adopted by US and European regulators, would be a blow to the dominant business model of clearing houses, most of which are owned and operated by exchanges and are viewed as mechanisms to maintain a lock on order flow. The UK central bank flagged its concerns about CCPs in its latest financial stability report, noting that one key way to counter risks to the UK financial system was through toughening capital requirements and risk management at clearers, “fostered by user-ownership and not-for profit arrangements”.Its concern over how CCPs are owned and run echo similar worries that have been raised by US regulators and the European Commission as they have pushed sweeping reform of the over-the-counter derivatives markets.One requirement of the new Dodd-Frank act in the US and of similar proposals now making their way to the European Parliament is that as many OTC derivatives as possible be processed through CCPs to help safeguard the system against the fall-out of another default such as that of Lehman Brothers. A CCP stands between buyer and seller in transactions, ensuring trades go ahead even if one party defaults.All this is set to transform CCPs, once the mundane machinery of the financial markets, into systemically important institutions. Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has said this makes CCPs “a potential single point of failure”.Yet many of the CCPs jostling for a piece of the OTC clearing business stemming from the regulatory reforms are for profit businesses, owned by exchanges – such as Deutsche Börse, which operates Eurex Clearing; IntercontinentalExchange; and CME Group, which runs the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.The worry is that in their zeal to attract business, CCPs may make it easier for customers by lowering thresholds on financial guarantees that need to be posted to a CCP in the form of margin collateral.This is seen as not such a worry at LCH.Clearnet, a UK-based clearer that is 80 per cent owned by market participants in OTC derivatives, and The Options Clearing Corporation, owned collectively by the eight US options exchanges for which it acts as clearer. It plans to launch OTC derivatives clearing next year. Bankers familiar with discussions among regulators about whether a particular ownership model should be encouraged say there is significant disagreement about whether changes are needed.“It has been the topic of wild discussions for months,” one said. “It is an open secret that the Anglo-Saxons prefer the user-owned model while the Germans and the continentals prefer the other.”The Bank’s financial stability report marks the first time it has so clearly stated its preference for user-owned systems: “From a risk perspective, not-for-profit, user-owned CCPs provide strong incentives for effective risk management.” The bank said governance reform of CCPs “might be needed over time given their increasing systemic importance”.For-profit CCPs argue that such concerns are overdone, noting that CCPs are acutely aware of the need to ensure they have adequate capital and robust risk management systems to cope with any default situation. Paul Swann, chief executive of ICE Clear Europe, IntercontinentalExchange’s London-based CCP, acknowledges there is “a natural tension” between the two models.“But I don’t see why people think it’s uniquely different in clearing to any other service business or industry. Running nuclear power plants, for example. Private firms run nuclear power plants. They are systemically important to the economy in terms of assurance of energy supply and actually are highly regulated businesses because, a bit like us, they have to be incredibly safe and secure and well run,” he says.“We think we can develop those services to meet market demand in a commercial environment more quickly …than a pure utility model.”www.ft.com/tradingroom"
767;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-12-21T22:30:36Z;Busy bureaucrats ‘inundate’ derivatives traders;;Government bureaucrats are facing an unusual complaint: they are moving too quickly.US regulators are writing dozens of new rules to reshape the $583,000bn derivatives marketplace. In most cases Congress gave them a year to act from July’s passage of Wall Street reforms.Armies of lawyers at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission have since recommended dozens of rules to implement the Dodd-Frank act. Once proposed, each rule is open for public comment. But the openness is becoming a mixed blessing for respondents.“We have big staffs, but we are getting inundated and have started getting behind on trying to keep up with this stuff,” said Terry Duffy, executive chairman of CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange. “We have to thoughtfully go through all these proposals and write comment letters. We’re going through it all very thoroughly. The problem is there’s one after another.”Spencer Bachus and Frank Lucas, Republicans who next year will chair the US House financial services and agriculture committees, respectively, have taken up industry concerns, writing to regulators to say they may “consider delaying statutory deadlines” for derivatives rules. Their opinions are significant because the committees oversee the regulators.Eleven bank and financial-industry groups this month asked that the CFTC and SEC extend some deadlines, reshuffle the rule sequence and phase in new regulations “over a reasonable period of time.”To Wall Street critics these complaints are simply tactics to hinder efforts to fix the derivatives market opacity that led to the government’s $180bn bail-out of AIG and exacerbated the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.“We think this is a disingenuous attempt to delay implementation of Dodd-Frank. We should allow the regulators time to do their jobs,” said Heather Slavkin, policy adviser to the US labour federation AFL-CIO.But the process is burdensome, and some say it has become Byzantine. In a single day – December 1 – the CFTC proposed 483 pages of rules. Among the rules were criteria defining highly regulated swap dealers, which make markets in over-the-counter derivatives.But the CFTC had already published rules on duties and conflicts of interest for these swap dealers three weeks before, meaning that the public was asked to comment on rules for entities that had not yet been legally defined. Scott O’Malia, a Republican CFTC commissioner, last week said the agency needs to “reorganise the rule-making process”.The nature of questions put to the public is also in some cases very broad. The proposal defining swap dealers summarises them this way: “If the person is available to accommodate demand for swaps from other parties, tends to propose terms, or tends to engage in the other activities discussed above, then the person is likely to be a swap dealer. Persons that rarely engage in such activities are less likely to be deemed swap dealers.”“We request comment on this interpretive approach for identifying whether a person is a swap dealer,” the 179-page rule states.“Every comment can generate more questions, and this makes it difficult to know what types of comments to focus on or what questions to try and answer,” said Joel Telpner, partner at Jones Day, which is helping clients respond to requests for comments.The Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, a research group, notes that the SEC must issue 59 new rules by July, compared with fewer than 10 a year before the crisis. The CFTC must issue 37 in the same period, compared with fewer than six before.“We believe that the current rule making process is sacrificing quality and fairness for apparent speed, risking lengthy court challenges and poor rules that will damage our financial system and hinder economic recovery,” the group said in a letter urging congressional hearings on the rule-making.Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, has said he does not plan to slow down, however, citing a 360-day timeline mandated by Congress and the need to prevent another financial crisis and end uncertainty about the new regulations.In addition to industry resistance, disagreement is beginning to surface within regulatory agencies. The CFTC, which is set to regulate the bulk of OTC derivatives, postponed by a week a vote on guidelines for swap trading facilities, finally releasing an amended version for public comment last Thursday. A vote on another proposal limiting positions in commodity derivatives was postponed over disagreements on its timing.Additional reporting by Aline van Duyn in New York
768;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-12-20T23:06:06Z;Position limits proposal under private scrutiny;US regulator changes tack over restraints on commodity speculation;A US regulator has changed procedural tack as it considers new restraints on commodity speculation after a public meeting on the measures ended without a vote last week.The so-called position limits proposal, which would cap investor holdings in 28 commodities from oil to palladium, is now being circulated privately among the five commissioners of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, people familiar with the process said. If a majority sign off, the plan will be released for public comment without another meeting.Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, unexpectedly adjourned a meeting last Thursday before a roll call on position limits could be taken. He said the proposal needed to “ripen” but said the matter remained pending.Position limits are one of the more controversial initiatives required by the Dodd-Frank financial reforms passed last July. Lawmakers directed the CFTC to pass rules limiting traders’ size in energy, metals and agricultural commodities traded on and off exchanges.Companies including CME Group, the exchange operator, and Morgan Stanley, the bank that is one of the world’s major energy traders, have raised concerns about strict new limits.The CTFC aired a draft proposal that would have set speculative limits at 25 per cent of deliverable supply for spot commodity contracts. Staff at the CFTC estimated that at most 70 traders in agricultural commodities, six in base metals, eight in precious metals and 40 in energy contracts would be affected by the new spot-month limits.The plan would phase in limits for later-dated contracts only after data on off-exchange derivatives exist, sparking concern from Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner, that the commission is moving too slowly.“I continue to make the case that we should fully utilise our existing authorities during the interim period of time before limits are implemented. Congress told us to implement now,” he said.“Despite much discussion in our public meeting about what we would do in the interim, I’m still not convinced there is any agreement. That’s unfortunate. Until I know what we are going to do in the interim, I won’t be supporting the existing position limit proposal,” he said.Last week Spencer Bachus and Frank Lucas, Republican congressmen who in January are to become chairmen of the House financial services and agriculture committees, respectively, urged regulators to avoid “overly prescriptive” position limits and said they would consider delaying deadlines in the Dodd-Frank law.Companies including exchange operator CME Group and Morgan Stanley, the bank, have warned against strict limits, while Delta Air Lines has encouraged them.The discussions come as commodity indices climb to the highest levels since October 2008.Cotton surged by the exchange-set limit as mill demand remains strong and merchantswere out of the market, said Andy Ryan of brokers FCStone. “There’s no natural selling in cotton today,” Mr Ryan said.ICE March cotton rose by 2.7 per cent to $1.5412 a pound, close to the nominal $1.57 record reached on November 10. Prices implied by options markets were bid at $1.5775 a pound before trading halted.Oil fluctuated. Nymex January West Texas Intermediate, was up 79 cents to $88.81 a barrel.ICE February Brent rose $1.07 to $92.74 a barrel.
769;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-12-20T19:27:40Z;Exchanges also face financial reform;;Exchanges like to boast that, while they are an unusually visible part of the financial markets, they had nothing to do with the financial crisis of 2008. Trading of stocks, options and futures carried on throughout the worst moments of the crisis, with prices being quoted continuously and deals done.However, exchanges are not unaffected by the sweeping changes to the financial landscape as a result of the regulatory overhaul of financial services– the biggest since since the US stock market crash of 1929.Efforts to rein in – and bring greater transparency to – the vast and opaque over-the-counter derivatives markets call for a big shift of such instruments on to exchanges and other as-yet undefined platforms called “swap execution facilities” (SEFs). OTC derivatives are also to be processed through clearing houses, increasingly important structures that help reduce risks in a trade default.The thrust of the reforms, enshrined in the Dodd-Frank legislation in the US and in similar proposals from the European Commission, is that trading of financial instruments should take place as far as possible on formally organised platforms where prices are visible to all before trades are sealed – the classic function of an exchange.This regulatory thrust has played into the hands of the exchanges, which have long competed with the OTC markets, themselves controlled by Wall Street and European banks. Exchange chief executives rarely miss opportunities at industry conferences to highlight their attributes as “trusted infrastructures”, in contrast to the off-exchange markets tainted by the crisis.This month, a report by consultancy Tabb Group and commissioned by the World Federation of Exchanges warned about “continued high risk in today’s OTC derivatives market”.Bill Brodsky, CBOE chief executive and WFE chairman, said the study was needed to “establish a benchmark on how much has been done and still needs to be done to mitigate the risk of OTC derivatives”.The exchanges are expected to be beneficiaries of the reforms but not as much as might be assumed.On the trading side, many OTC derivatives are expected to be traded on SEFs specially designed to trade certain OTC derivatives, not on exchanges that are used to handling traditional futures and options. Exchanges with clearing houses – such as CME Group, Intercontinental-Exchange and Deutsche Börse – do not expect to make huge profits from the anticipated wave of clearing that in theory will come from the regulatory push. Few are willing to predict how big the market for clearing OTC derivatives really is.BANKING AFTER THE CRISIS
770;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-12-16T16:54:16Z;CME Group gets clearing approval in Europe;;CME Group will launch clearing for the over-the-counter (OTC) derivative trades in Europe early next year after the world’s biggest futures exchange received approval from UK regulators on Thursday.The exchange operator hopes the move will better enable it to compete globally for business in clearing privately-negotiated derivatives. It is in the process of building up its staffing presence in London in preparation for a big push in Europe.The counterparty risk inherent in OTC trading was widely blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis, and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are keen for central counterparty clearing in the market in order to reduce the risk traditionally associated with such trades.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, guaranteeing performance of contracts if either side defaults. CME’s successful application for a licence also signals a broader threat to Europe’s exchanges, since control of a clearing house offers an exchange a way of expanding into new products and geographical areas.It will also allow CME to challenge the dominant market position of IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), its US rival, in the clearing of credit default swaps on both sides of the Atlantic.CME Clearing Europe - a wholly-owned subsidiary of CME that has its own employees, governance arrangements and capital – will initially clear only OTC commodity contracts, but said it hopes to launch financial products “soon after”, building towards to “multi-asset OTC clearing”.Authorities in Europe have been keen to see a European-based credit default swaps clearer to complement initiatives in the US, leading to a race among exchanges to provide lucrative CDS clearing.“Through this new London-based subsidiary, we will provide locally-relevant clearing services to meet the needs of our European customers, a key CME Group market,” said Andrew Lamb, CME Clearing Europe chief executive.Barclays and JP Morgan will act as the first settlement banks for CME Clearing Europe, while JP Morgan will also provide custody and liquidity services.CME Clearing Europe has also applied to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, to become a registered Derivatives Clearing Organisation in the US, a move aimed to help customers that are located both in the US and Europe.

Next year they plan to allow for direct access to markets and the standardisation of regulation.Brazil will seek alliances with Colombia and Peru similar to that signed with Chile, Mr Kawall said.In the first year, the focus of the agreement with Chile will be to “improve connectivity electronically from the country”, he says, but with the later possibility of assisting Chile develop its derivatives markets, encompassing options and futures on stocks, interest rates, and exchange rates.BM&FBovespa is the third-largest exchange in the world by market capitalisation of the group itself and houses the world’s sixth-largest derivatives market by number of contracts. At the moment, most of Chile’s derivatives trading is done over the counter, rather than centrally cleared and with a counter party, as in Brazil.By partnering up with Brazil, Chile’s exchange will also have access to the BM&FBovespa/CME trading platform for its markets. BM&FBovespa holds a 5 per cent stake in CME Group. Edemir Pinto, chief executive of the Brazilian group, was recently named to the board of directors of the Chicago-based group.BM&FBovespa and BCS have also agreed to receive and distribute each other’s market data, and establishment joint initiatives related to settlement and clearing.

He led the CBOT from 2002 to 2007, when it was taken over by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to form the CME Group. He had also been chief executive of Cargill Investor Services.Sun Holdings, which is based in Chicago, owns proprietary trading firms that provide liquidity to investors and short-term traders. It operates several trading firms, including Sun Trading in Chicago and Sun International Trading in London. Jeff Wigley, a former Chicago Board Options Exchange trader, founded the group in 2002.“We are pleased to have Bernie join our management team as president of Sun Holdings LLC. He brings a breadth of experience in financial markets and leadership to our organisation,” said Mr Wigley in a statement.At MF Global, Mr Dan had replaced Kevin Davis, who quit after a large trading loss shook the firm in June 2008. Less than a year later Mr Dan resigned, citing personal reasons. Within a week of his departure, Jon Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey and Goldman Sachs chief, took over as chief.Mr Dan helped MF Global expand its market share of segregated funds, a growth that has continued, and which the company trumpets as it makes a difficult transition from a futures brokerage to full-service investment bank.
773;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-12-03T16:21:01Z;Exchanges see November boost from derivatives;;Some of the world’s largest trading venues saw a solid uptick in volumes in November as investors sought out derivatives, especially in commodities, to hedge against the uncertain economic outlook.Monthly statistics from the world’s leading exchanges and trading venues showed year-on-year sequential improvements at CME Group and Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse as investors on both sides of the Atlantic looked to offset risk.Commodity derivatives have proved a hot spot, amid continued volatility in demand and supply in raw materials from cotton to copper and energy.Robert Ray, head of international products and services at CME Group, operator of energy exchange Nymex and of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, told a conference this week in London that commodity traders were back “putting on positions” as they had done before the financial crisis of 2008. Grain contracts had been “on a tear” because of supply and demand issues.“In many cases the fundamentals haven’t changed. In commodities and metals you’re seeing a re-establishment of positions,” he told the FOW Derivatives World conference.IntercontinentalExchange, the US exchange operator, saw record futures volume of more than 300m contracts, beating last November’s record of 262m.Average daily volume across its futures exchanges rose 26 per cent to 1.4m. Growth was driven by agriculture and energy futures, while its European futures business stablished an open interest record of 3.7m contracts on November 9, it said.CME Group, operator of the largest futures exchange in the US, saw average daily volume rise 31 per cent in November, up 31 per cent from November last year and 24 per cent higher than October this year, as it benefited from investor concern about the Federal Reserve’s latest quantitative easing cycle.The group said November represented the highest monthly average daily volume since September 2008, outside of the 16.8m contracts averaged in May when the “flash crash” took place. Volumes at its commodity futures rose 47 per cent compared to November last year while interest rate futures rose 46 per cent and metals rose 34 per cent.Deutsche Börse said a combined 221m contracts traded on Eurex and the International Securities Exchange, the US options exchange it bought in a $2.8bn deal in 2007.In Asia, derivatives volume at the SGX Singapore exchange increased 22 per cent year-on-year to 5.4m contracts, with average daily volume of 264,929, up 18 per cent year-on-year.Trading volumes for the main cash equities trading venues of the US and Europe, like NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, are set to be announced next week. The results are expected to be far more downbeat, as typified by NYSE Euronext. Its average daily volume of cash products has risen only 5 per cent year-to-date on 2009 levels while its US business has dropped 22 per cent.The securities market on SGX saw a 46 per cent rise in market turnover to $40bn for November, up 46 per cent year-on-year.The global strength of the derivatives business has made it all the more urgent that the London Stock Exchange pursue its planned foray into equity derivatives, which it announced in June.
774;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-12-03T15:53:04Z;Eurex plans launch of interest rate swaps clearing;;Eurex Clearing has not abandoned plans for over the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearing and is preparing to roll out a service for interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for “buyside” market participants, a senior executive said.The disclosure comes as doubts have persisted over the commitment of Eurex to building an OTC derivatives clearing business at a time when its key rivals – CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and LCH.Clearnet – are pushing ahead.Eurex all but abandoned an attempt to get into credit default swaps clearing for dealer-to-dealer business earlier this year after it became clear that ICE had a head start by forging a revenue-sharing arrangement with key dealer banks.Matthias Graulich, executive director at Eurex Clearing, owned by Deutsche Börse, said the group was now looking at interest rate swaps and equity swaps as well as offering credit default swaps clearing for buyside customers. ICE is also preparing a buyside CDS clearing service, likely to be launched in the first half of next year.“We said the dealer-to-dealer business is with ICE but we believe a broad product offering, in particular with the buyside, is a good value proposition for us. So we said we’d keep that offering alive,” Mr Graulich told FT Trading Room at the FOW Derivatives World conference in London this week.“We have this offering and if there’s interest we are ready to immediately start,” he said, referring to CDS clearing for the buyside.Like other clearers Eurex Clearing is hoping to be able to offer OTC clearing in the context of being able to offer portfolio margining with other on-exchange derivatives such as futures and options.Portfolio margining allows traders to avoid having to post collateral to a clearing house for each type of asset traded in full, instead calculating the risk offsets between the various asset classes and coming up with a single margin payment that is smaller than the total amount that would have to be posted if each asset class were treated individually. “We have a decent value proposition with the capital efficiencies that we can offer,” Mr Graulich said.A Eurex spokesman later said that the group was in “talks with plenty of other [buyside] firms regarding the extension of our OTC CCP [central counterparty] services”. He declined to name any.Mr Graulich said that the key issue to be sorted before the rollout of any offering was the treatment of buyside margin collateral. Asset managers that use OTC derivatives are keen to ensure their collateral is held separately – “segregated” - from that of other market participants, including the proprietary trading business of the clearing member the buyside client may be using to access a clearing house. That is so that their positions and collateral can be easily identified, separated and transferred to another clearing member in the event of a default by the clearing member.This issue is central to “client asset protection” (CAP) in clearing generally and is top of the agenda for regulators and the buyside in the US.Mr Graulich said: “The piece that is missing is the CAP regime, which we plan to roll out in the first half. This is the key area of interest at this point in time and is the missing piece to make it attractive to the buyside.”While clearers are jostling for a slice of the OTC business, it is not yet clear how lucrative the business will be. While more clearing is mandated in the Dodd-Frank legislation in the US, and will be once European Commission proposals on OTC derivatives are enshrined in law by the European Parliament, few in the industry are able to predict with confidence what revenues will be generated from it.Mr Graulich said it was “absolutely necessary” to offer OTC derivatives clearing “if you already offer futures and options. It’s [OTC clearing] an add-on. You have to look at this as part of a complete product portfolio”.
775;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-11-29T16:12:44Z;Investing: Low volatility limits hedge funds;;"In July the legendary oil trader Andrew Hall sent a letter to investors in his hedge fund, Astenback Capital Management. “We feel frustrated with our performance,” he wrote. “We have not been able to capitalise on significant moves within what is for the time being a range bound market.”Mr Hall was not alone. The year 2010 is shaping up to be a hard slog for specialist commodity hedge funds, whose managers are paid handsomely to reap big gains trading volatile energy, metals and farm crops. Many markets have ambled sideways, leaving few opportunities for profit.The HFRX Commodity Index, an industry yardstick, was down 3.5 per cent this year, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research. While fresh investment has varied from fund to fund, it “hasn’t been extremely active,” says Ernest Scalamandre, whose New York-based AC Investment Management puts money in commodity hedge funds. “Two or three years ago, the pace was much more robust.”Key selling points for these funds are that growth in emerging markets will boost demand and prices for energy, industrial metals and food. Commodities have historically moved out of step with equities, a draw for institutions seeking diversified portfolios.The global financial crisis challenged many of these assumptions. Oil markets suffered two years of falling demand in 2008 and 2009, creating spare capacity that continues to damp volatility. New US natural gas reserves ended the excitement in that market.Commodity and other markets also showed striking correlations. The debt crisis in Greece – which comprises just half of one per cent of the world’s daily oil consumption – nevertheless shaved $18 off the price of a barrel of crude in May, as commodities sank alongside equities. In the year to October, the S&P 500 stock index rose 6 per cent, while the S&P GSCI spot commodity index gained 7.5 per cent.“It’s been a challenging year,” says an executive at a leading commodities fund. “We have held out with a constructive view on commodities. We’ve done well in the past few months, but it hasn’t been easy.”The exception has been agricultural commodities, where weather events – including a dry spell in Brazil, a devastating drought in Russia and catastrophic floods in Pakistan – have sent prices soaring or plunging, creating the volatility that food companies dread but hedge funds crave.From July through October, ICE Futures US cotton had climbed 55 per cent, outpaced by ICE raw sugar’s 61 per cent rise. Maize gained 64 per cent and wheat rose 54 per cent on the Chicago Board of Trade.“Hedge funds collectively had a pretty tough go of it for the year ending in July. Then the whole [agriculture] complex exploded,” Mr Scalamandre says.Hedge funds are often wary of agricultural markets, whose relatively small size can make an aggressive position costly to unwind.But this year, open interest – the number of outstanding futures and options contracts – has topped records in CBOT maize, soya beans and wheat. Commodities trading at CBOT and other ex­changes owned by CME Group was a record 1.1m contracts a day in October, up 42 per cent on the prior year.“Corn is trading like Treasury bills; that’s how liquid it is,” says Chris Ny­gaard, former Cargill trader and co-founder of Vermillion Asset Management, a New York-based commodity firm that oversees $1.6bn.Results among leading firms have been mixed. Through October, Clive Capital, the $4bn London-based commodity group run by Chris Levett, was up about 10 per cent in the year, according to a person with knowledge of the results. Merchant Commodity Fund, co-founded by ex-Cargill traders Michael Coleman and Doug King, was up 17.5 per cent by the end of October.At Dwight Anderson’s Ospraie Management, based in New York, the commodity equities fund returned more than 9 per cent net of fees through October, while the commodity derivatives fund returned more than 2 per cent. Touradji Capital Management’s global resources fund, headed by Paul Touradji, was up 1.5 per cent net of fees. Vermillion’s main relative-value fund was recently up about 7 per cent for the year.Gold marked nominal records above $1,400 an ounce and has lured some of the world’s largest hedge fund managers including David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and John Paulson of Paulson and Co. These investments are a way of betting central banks will fail to preserve the value of paper currencies.Some of the commodity specialists are also keen on metals. Touradji Capital in a securities filing disclosed Barrick Gold, a mining company, was its largest shareholding as of September. Mr Anderson in a speech this month laid out a case for platinum, saying output has peaked."
776;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Quick View: Just an ICE-breaker?;LCH.Clearnet denial does not end US group’s interest in clearing;Is ICE buying LCH.Clearnet?A report in Britain’s Guardian – sourced, by the look of it, from a single “stakeholder” – says LCH.Clearnet has rebuffed a £400m offer from ICE, or IntercontinentalExchange.According to a statement from London-based LCH.Clearnet later on Monday, it has “not received an approach of any sort in relation to its ownership”.Let’s step back a moment.I have long wondered when Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, would make a move into clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps, having taken the lead among clearing house operators in pushing into clearing of credit default swaps (CDS). The opportunity in rates is far bigger given that the market is 8-10 times bigger than CDS.And his main rival, CME Group, upped the ante a few weeks ago by launching its long-awaited rates clearing business. LCH.Clearnet is itself expected by year-end to launch its interest rate swaps clearing service, aimed at the “buyside” – hedge funds and the like – while International Derivatives Clearing Group, controlled by Nasdaq OMX, is bringing up the rear with its own effort (not much traction there yet).So rates is where the action is.But an approach for LCH.Clearnet makes little sense. If you are interested in rates clearing, you need to be looking at doing a deal with the banks that clear their dealer-to-dealer business through SwapClear. It is notionally part of LCH.Clearnet but its revenues largely go to the banks that run it via OTC Derivnet, a curious governance mechanism that rarely gets mentioned.LCH.Clearnet – without the SwapClear piece – is essentially a clearer of products for the London Metal Exchange, and of cash equities for a dwindling group of customers. NYSE Euronext has announced its intention to stop using the clearer for cash equities and to set up its own Paris-based operation, while the London Stock Exchange has hinted that it might quit using LCH.Clearnet for UK cash equities clearing as well. LCH does have a nice business clearing things like OTC container freight contracts (it cut its fees for this by 40 per cent this month), natural gas in the US and, er, fertiliser swaps. But that, collectively, is not enough to secure LCH.Clearnet’s future.In any case, the mooted price tag of £400m is something like a 15 per cent premium to the book value of the group, at a time when its client base is evaporating.Also, such a valuation implies that OTC clearing really is the money-spinner that people started out thinking it would be because of the current regulatory reforms – ie the push for OTC derivatives clearing in the Dodd-Frank Act in the US and in the European Market Infrastructure Regulations (Emir) proposals by the European Commission. As Mr Sprecher himself has noted, the regulatory burden now faced by operators of new business in market structures – like OTC clearing – is substantial. He has had to make room in his offices for regulators who are monitoring what goes on. That costs money.Yet it does make sense for Mr Sprecher to talk to the OTC Derivnet banks. He pioneered the “mutualisation” model that is increasingly taking hold as exchanges figure out how to work with their biggest customers (the banks). His CDS clearing operation is a revenue-share deal with the big banks in CDS. Why not do the same, or similar, with rates? For it to work, however, there would have to be some ability for big buyside players to get a seat at the table too. But then Mr Sprecher is one of the most respected operators in the business.The interesting thing about the LCH.Clearnet statement is that the clearer has plausible deniability on the story, given that it is possible that an approach by ICE was made to SwapClear or some of the OTC Derivnet banks. Just a thought.Watch this space.
777;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-11-19T17:21:43Z;NYSE Euronext push into OTC derivatives clearing;;NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenues, unveiled a plans to push into over-the-counter derivatives (OTC) clearing, putting it head-to-head with CME Group, owner of the world’s biggest futures exchange.The group told an investor conference in London that it would offer interest rate futures clearing early next year once its US clearing house venture has been approved by regulators.It also said it was considering clearing OTC equity derivatives, aiming to profit from new regulations for the market designed to reduce market instability.NYSE Euronext has been building a clearing house called New York Portfolio Clearing in conjunction with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the New York-based post-trade group. It was set up as part of the group’s attempt to win market share from the CME in a range of US futures contracts.“Our NYPC venture with DTCC is out for comment. That should be approved in early 2011 and related to that, we expect to launch interest rate futures in direct competition with the CME, probably in February of next year and and those assets will be cleared with NYPC,” Duncan Niederauer, chief executive told an investor conference in London.The group also told investors it was looking at clearing OTC equity derivatives as, like rival exchanges, it looks to carve carve out business beyond its traditional business of cash equities.There are ongoing consultations with market participants to validate assumptions,” Garry Jones, the group’s head of global derivatives, said. “The solutions will link up to existing widely used OTC infrastructure and will leverage our planned purpose-built clearing-house.”Mr Jones said NYSE Euronext aimed at the G14 group of major derivatives dealers and their counterparties by building out BClear, NYSE Liffe’s cleared service for equity derivatives.NYSE Euronext’s interest in clearing for the equity derivatives market, which Mr Jones estimated had a notional outstanding value of $6,6000bn, comes as regulators in Washington and Brussels push more clearing of OTC products to improve transparency in market structures.For exchanges, getting paid a fee every time a derivative contract is cleared is an attractive source of revenues. Exchanges such as CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange and Deutsche Börse have joined LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house, in pushing into the emerging market.Clearing puts a third party in the middle of every trade, which means the risks and costs of defaults are absorbed by the clearing-house members.Regulators in the US are writing the detailed rules for clearing in the wake of the Dodd-Frank Act, which promises the most radical overhaul of privately traded OTC derivatives in their 20-year history.The US group announced in May this year that it would start clearing its own equity and derivatives trades in Europe, following Deutsche Börse in operating its own execution and post-trade services. It will use two new clearing houses, in London and Paris and built at a cost of $60m, and NYSE Euronext said it expected to earn annual revenues of about $100m from 2013.Dominique Cerutti, president and deputy chief executive, also told investors that it would probably make acquisitions to meet its target of reaching $1bn in technology revenues by 2015. In the year to date, it has made $330m of revenues, NYSE added.
778;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-11-12T03:51:43Z;Mexican exchange plans ‘block trading’ facility;;Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV) plans to launch a new block trading facility by the middle of next year as part of a raft of upgrades that the Mexican exchange is undertaking to increase domestic participation and lure high-frequency traders to Mexico.The moves come as Mexico has been making regulatory changes to remove long-standing market practices that foreign banks say were limiting their ability to offer trading on Mexico’s equity markets.BMV, the second-largest exchange group in Latin America after BM&FBovespa in Brazil, recently allowed “direct market access” (DMA), which allows brokers, who are not BMV members to access the exchange via the broker’s systems. It has also launched “colocation”, which allows high-frequency traders to place their computer trading systems next to an exchange’s trade matching engine, to speed up trading time.Luis Tellez, BMV Group president, told a press briefing that high-frequency traders had “increased liquidity in the Mexican market and we’ve had a very important jump [in volume]. It has been a big change and we’ve had to invest significantly in equipment.”Carlos Quevedo, vice president of the National Banking and Securities Commission of Mexico, the regulator, said that while high-frequency traders had been beneficial, “they can also bring some problems in the markets”.He said the Mexican regulator was working with securities regulators in developed countries to “help point us in the direction that other regulators are going” as they assess issues like use of algorithms and whether high-frequency traders add to or subtract liquidity from markets.In June, BMV plans to launch a trading facility that allows institutional traders to match large orders more easily than on the current phone-brokered market. The facility is similar in concept to one l aunched last month by Nasdaq OMX, known as Nasdaq PSX, and to Xetra’s Midpoint Match platform. TMX Group also plans a similar platform.The Nasdaq PSX platform is an attempt to attract volume consisting of large orders that would normally go to “dark pools”.Jorge Alegria, BMV’s senior vice president of markets and data services, said that it was important for the exchange to encourage large blocks of trades in the most liquid Mexican stocks to be done on the BMV because 20 such stocks were also listed in New York as American Depository Receipts (ADR) and there was a risk that Mexico could lose out. “If we don’t offer this functionality we may lose that volume,” he told FT Trading Room.Nasdaq’s PSX initiative is designed to lure some block trading that has gone to “dark pools” back to an exchange environment.Mr Alegria said there was “a fair amount” of phone-brokered business for block trades between dealers but the new BMV system should make it easier for traders to find the other side of an order. “There is no official way to find a large order on the other side today,” he said.“We need to provide tools for high-frequency traders but also some mechanisms for large blocks,” he added.Young Kang, global head of algorithmic trading products at Citi, said the BMV had “done a lot so far” to make it easier for foreign participants to trade in Mexico. Citi started offering its clients access to the country about four months ago, he said.“I think there’s a lot more left to do to make it [the market] truly interesting to electronic orders,” he added, citing a need for lowering of clearing and settlement costs.BMV in March cemented an alliance with US-based CME Group, operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, under which the CME has just under 5 per cent of BMV, and a board seat.Mr Alegria said that as a result of a decision two weeks ago by Mexican regulators to allow local banks to trade commodity derivatives other than gold and silver, BMV would allow members of MexDer, its derivatives arm, to trade futures and options on wheat, corn and natural gas on the CME Group’s constituent exchanges via the US operator’s Globex trading system, in the first quarter of next year.“For MexDer, it’s very important because all we need to do is route the orders to Chicago with no need to create our own products,” said Mr Alegria, who is also MexDer chief executive.CME members would be allowed to trade derivatives products listed on MexDer, BMV’s derivatives exchange, on Globex in June.Mr Tellez said that BMV had talked with BM&FBovespa about co-operation, but differences in the way the two exchanges handle customer accounts made this “difficult”.“We don’t see the growth of our market in going to South America. We see the potential in taking Mexican markets [abroad]. Our focus is on Mexico.
779;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Silver ETP inflows surge;ETP interest drives prices to 30-year high;Silver exchange traded products have been attracting extraordinary inflows this month, sending the price of the precious metal towards $30 an ounce, its highest level since 1980.Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst at Barclays Capital, described ETP inflows for November as “staggering”.On Tuesday alone, holdings in silver ETPs jumped by 354 tonnes, recording the largest daily inflow since December 2007.Inflows for November have already reached 604 tonnes, bringing inflows for the year to more than 2,000 tonnes.Total silver ETP holdings have swelled to 14,752 tonnes, worth around $12.9bn - nearly double the $6.7bn they held at the start of the year.However, Ms Cooper cautioned there was a growing divergence between the positive appetite shown by ETF investors for silver and the attitude of hedge funds, which have sharply reduced their long position (bets on prices rising) in New York’s silver futures market in recent weeks.She added that an increase in ETP interest would normally be viewed as reflecting positive longer-term demand but silver’s supply and demand fundamentals looked “burdensome”, which had left the market increasingly reliant on investment demand to drive prices higher.The market has become volatile at these rarified levels. On Wednesday, prices recorded their biggest one day drop for almost two years after margin requirements were raised for trading silver futures in New York by CME Group, the exchange operator.The increase in margin requirements prompted hedge funds to dump silver aggressively and analysts are now waiting to see if investors in exchange traded products will follow that selling or view the price drop as a buying opportunity.James Steel, precious metals analyst at HSBC said that although long positions held by hedge funds were “dwarfed” by silver ETP holdings, the more volatile futures markets was likely to influence trading strongly in the short-term.Mr Steel added that increases in margin requirements had not historically managed to reverse price rallies that were “well grounded” in positive fundamentals but they could dent them.“Silver may be particularly vulnerable to a correction,” said Mr Steel: “It does not have as compelling a bull story as gold or the the other precious metals.”November’s surge in inflows into silver ETPs comes as inflows into gold ETPs have slowed to a trickle this month.Ms Cooper said this suggested investors who felt they had “missed the boat”, with gold prices reaching record levels above $1,400 an ounce, were now turning to silver as an alternative.However, analysts, including Ms Cooper, remain concerned that silver prices look overvalued compared with gold.The gold-silver price ratio has fallen to the low 50s, well below the long-run average of around 60.“We continue to expect the silver market to be in [a supply] surplus this year and in 2011, with investment demand proving to be pivotal for prices,” said Ms Cooper.
780;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-11-11T11:30:08Z;BM&F Bovespa targets high frequency traders;;BM&F Bovespa is hoping to attract high-frequency traders with further price discounts after traders flocked to BM&F, the Brazilian exchange operator’s beefed-up futures business.The exchange, which fluctuates between being the world’s second- and third-biggest by market capitalisation, announced profits of R$389.2m ($228.3m) in the third-quarter, a 15 per cent year-on-year increase, boosted by a record-breaking $70bn share issue in September by state oil company Petrobras.Revenues for the third quarter rose 27.1 per cent to R$ 486.9m on the back of and clearing and settlement services on the back of large share offerings from Banco do Brasil and Petrobras.Revenues from trading and settlement at BM&F climbed 41.5 per cent to R$186.8m and accounted for just over a third of group revenues. This rise was due primarily to a 70.7 per cent year-over-year surge in overall volume traded, the group said. “The company is highly focused on its technology projects, and in strengthening its growth potential,” said Eduardo Refinetti Guardia, chief financial officer.BM&F Bovespa, like other former national monopoly exchanges such as NYSE Euronext and London Stock Exchange, has been investing heavily to attract high-frequency traders to its platform to raise volumes and increase liquidity in shares. Among them include investments in co-location services, in which trading firms can place their servers in the data centre next to the exchange servers, thus reducing the speed of execution, known as latency. According to the exchange, HFT accounted for 6.4 per cent of volume in October and could reach 15 per cent in the next two years.To attract high-frequency traders, the group has announced price cuts of up to 70 per cent and progressive discounts based on trading volume bands. Cicero Vieira, chief operating officer, said it also gave HF traders a strong incentive to identify themselves, making it easier to monitor the growing practice in Brazil than abroad, he said.BM&F Bovespa is also developing a multi-asset class trading platform with CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, which is set to be launched next year. It also intends to target individual investors in the US, Europe, and Japan by offering them the ability to buy shares in their own currencies, through the issuance of Brazilian Depository Receipts.Operating expenses for the period, however, rose 26.5 per cent to R$167.6m and 16.8 per cent from the previous quarter as it invested heavily in IT and marketing.Bernardo Mariano, analyst at Equity Research Desk, a firm specialising in exchanges, said he expected profit growth in the fourth quarter to drop to 7 per cent, but average 15 per cent for 2011. “Because of accelerating co-location, we are going to see volumes increase. That’s the long-term story.”BM&F Bovespa has put a set of rules in place to alleviate concerns about the dangers of high frequency trading raised in the wake of the May “flash crash” in the US.Large price movements, effected by consecutive trades or throughout the course of the day, are halted and turned over to an auction. Since there is only one exchange in Brazil, jumping around these circuit breakers is much harder than it would be in the US or Europe, Mr Vieira said.In the past month, the exchange has been unexpectedly caught in the crossfire of a “currency war” waged by the government, whose capital controls have created concerns about regulatory risk. Speaking in a conference call, BM&F Bovespa chief executive Edemir Pinto said that government measures taken to curb capital inflows and the appreciation of the country’s currency, the real, had affected some operations on the exchange and raised uncertainty for investors.In October, the Brazilian government raised a financial transactions tax on foreign investments in fixed income instruments. The moves have raised concerns among investors that the government might introduce more measures later. Capital controls are taking a toll on the exchange’s share price, but not on volumes, according to Mariano.
781;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-11-10T22:35:30Z;Price of crude oil closes in on $90 a barrel;Precious metals wildly volatile;Oil prices rose to a two-year high, within striking distance of $90 a barrel after the US government reported declines in petroleum stockpiles and rising demand in the world’s largest oil consuming nation.The US Department of Energy said commercial crude stocks fell by 3.3m barrels last week, though they are still at the upper end of normal ranges for this time of year. Stocks of petrol declined by 1.9m barrels and stocks of distillate fell by 5m barrels.Demand for distillate, mainly diesel in commercial transport, is now 16 per cent higher than a year ago and close to peaks reached in 2007.“The question is no longer whether this is strong demand, but more whether it is sustainable,” Tim Evans, energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective, said in a note to clients.Nymex December West Texas Intermediate crude rose $1.09 to $87.81 a barrel, earlier topping $88 for the first time since October 2008. ICE December Brent rose 63 cents to $88.96 a barrel.Prices closed in on the $90 level that Ali Naimi, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, last week identified as the top of a “comfortable zone” for producers and consumers.Other commodity markets took a breather on Wednesday after a very sharp rally in recent days.Industrial metals were softer on the back of the weaker dollar and Chinese trade data showing a drop in October imports by China, whose ravenous demand for raw materials has been the main price driver of most commodity markets in recent years.Copper for delivery in three months was 0.8 per cent lower at $8,732 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange after preliminary Chinese customs data showed October imports of iron ore, copper and oil all sharply lower than in September.But analysts cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from the data, pointing out that national holidays stretching for more than a week in early October could have been contributory factors.Some also said the figures could be under-reported because of inaccuracies in the customs data.Graeme Train, analyst at Macquarie, said the data did not make any sense: “Customs just hasn’t processed all the material that has arrived.”Mr Train estimated that China’s actual iron ore imports in October were between 55m and 60m tonnes, compared with the 46m tonnes reported by customs – a 13 per cent fall from the previous month. China’s monthly iron ore figures were “wildly erratic”, he warned.Iron ore prices have risen sharply in the past week, with traders reporting that Chinese steel mills are beginning to restock and Indian exports have been disrupted by a longer than usual monsoon season.The benchmark iron ore price in the Chinese spot market – 62 per cent iron content – rose 1.2 per cent on Wednesday to its highest level since May at $160.30 a tonne.Precious metals were wildly volatile, with silver trading at $26.91 an ounce, down 8.4 per cent from its peak on Tuesday. Gold was hovering just short of $1,400 an ounce by early afternoon in New York.Additional reporting by Jack Farchy in London
782;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;ICE Clear Europe to accept gold as margin collateral;;Intercontinental Exchange, the US futures exchange group, has followed rival CME Group by allowing its European clearing house to accept gold bullion as collateral for transactions.The precious metal will be permitted for initial margin only for all energy and credit default swaps (CDS) transactions from November 22 and will be accepted by ICE Clear Europe by electronic transfer in increments of 1 troy ounce. It will be priced daily using the London gold fixing price in US dollars.The use of gold to satisfy margin requirements has traditionally been relegated to extremely liquid securities and some currencies but futures exchanges are increasingly looking at accepting the metal.CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, last year allowed up to $200m of gold to be used to cover margin requirements for trades on all its markets as an alternative to debt or equities. The metal was physically stored at the JPMorgan Chase bank in London.Demand for gold has pushed the metal to an all-time high, leading Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, to argue that the world should to consider readopting a modified global gold standard to guide currency movements.The International Monetary Fund has accelerated the rate at which it is selling its gold but most analyst expect central banks to be net buyers of gold next year.“We are pleased to offer these enhancements as the first clearing house in Europe to permit gold bullion as collateral,” said Paul Swann, president of ICE Clear Europe. “Particularly in times of economic change or uncertainty, the addition of gold and Euroclear Bank’s triparty collateral management services bring additional flexibility and security to the markets we serve globally.”ICE Clear has more than 330 energy contracts for clearing and has cleared more than €3.7 trillion in gross notional value to date across 130 credit derivative products. Collateral for ICE Clear Europe currently includes cash and government securities.It comes a few weeks after ICE Clear Europe also agreed a deal with Euroclear Bank, the international central securities depository, through which European government bonds could be used as collateral to fulfil initial margin requirements.
783;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
784;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-11-08T01:02:55Z;Trading too thin to support OTC platforms;;Trading activity in key over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets is too thin to support the anticipated proliferation of OTC trading platforms – known as “ swap execution facilities” (Sef) – as a result of reforms being pushed in Washington, the head of LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independently-owned clearing house, has warned.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, said that in contrast to the level of activity in on-exchange futures contracts, there was far less trading in OTC interest rate swaps, which have become a key battleground as clearing houses start to compete to attract clearing of such contracts. The so-called Dodd-Frank act, passed by the US administration in June, requires that as many “standardised” OTC derivatives as possible be processed through clearing houses and that they be traded on exchanges or Sefs.While the notional amount of OTC swaps traded between dealers already cleared at LCH.Clearnet was large, the London-based clearer received only about 800 interest rate swaps contracts a day, Mr Liddell told a panel at the Futures Industry Association’s annual expo in Chicago.While the exact definition of a Sef has yet to be decided by US regulators, many types of market participants – OTC dealers and even exchanges – are expected to set them up. CME Group, the largest US futures exchange, has said it “reserves the right to set up a Sef at some point in the future”. ELX, a small bank-owned futures exchange that competes with CME, also last week said it may set up a Sef.Mr Liddell said: “I think that what may happen is that these Sefs will be switched on and not much may happen. To move from [the current] market to one that behaves like a futures market is a massive change and one that will only happen over time.”Speaking to FT Trading Room later, he added: “The issue is, when you switch on your Sef, what’s the chance that someone will be on the other side of the trade? The market doesn’t do that many trades now. It’s completely different to the [exchange-traded] futures markets where you have millions of trades a day. It’s not a deep, liquid market today.”Industry participants have become concerned that the existence of too many trading platforms could unnecessarily divide liquidity across multiple platforms, a feature of the equity markets that has come under scrutiny as the Securities and Exchange Commission studies US market structures in the wake of the “flash crash” in May.Garry O’Connor, chief executive of International Derivatives Clearing Group, a new OTC interest rate swaps clearer majority-owned by Nasdaq OMX, said: “We are concerned about a proliferation of Sefs and what that could do to fragmentation of liquidity.”Separately, Mr Liddell said LCH.Clearnet was likely to launch clearing of OTC interest rate swaps traded by so-called “buyside” market participants – such as hedge funds, asset managers, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government sponsored mortgage lenders – by the end of the year.LCH.Clearnet is waiting for approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator, to be able to launch the service for US clients from its base in London, with CFTC oversight.“I think we’re pretty much there in terms of all the technical requirements. What they will approve is an extension of the CFTC regime to cover the interest rate swap product,” Mr Liddell said.
785;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-11-04T21:53:08Z;Need for consistent market structure to avoid ‘flash crash’;;Mandating equity market-makers to quote bids and offers at all times would not prevent a repeat of the “flash crash”, according to US options industry leaders.In the wake of the May 6 “flash crash”, when markets plunged and rebounded within 20 minutes, some in the equities industry have suggested that market-makers should be obliged to provide bids and offers throughout the trading day, in order to prevent dramatic price drops and spikes.On May 6, many big market participants simply withdrew from the market when prices started to drop in earnest.However, the heads of the US options exchanges - which, unlike the equities markets, have market-maker obligations - agreed at the Futures Industry Association annual Expo in Chicago that the system would be unlikely to hold in the event of a “flash crash” sequel.Gary Katz, head of the International Securities Exchange, owned by Deutsche Boerse, dismissed the suggestion that US regulators should focus on creating incentives for market-makers.“When the market begins to fall like that, there are no incentives big enough to persuade market-makers to catch a falling knife,” Mr Katz said.Tom Whittman, president of Nasdaq OMX, which operates one of the biggest US options-trading platforms, agreed. “Market-makers wouldn’t have stayed in the market on May 6,” he said. “They’d rather pull out and pay a fine.”Ed Boyle, who runs NYSE Euronext’s options business, said the “flash crash” indicated there were bigger and more serious structural issues for regulators, such as the existence of “dark pools” for share trading.“There has to be a more consistent market structure than simply incentives for market-makers,” Mr Boyle said.Bill Brodsky, chief executive of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said the Securities and Exchange Commission’s report on the “flash crash”, which pinpointed a single trade by Waddell and Reed, a Kansas City-based firm, was suspect.“The SEC never figured out what happened on May 6,” Mr Brodsky said. “The SEC report just doesn’t add up in my view.”On a separate panel at the FIA conference, Scot Warren, managing director of equity index products at CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, attacked the SEC’s flash crash report for pointing a finger at Waddell and Reed in its report.“It’s abhorrent that the client name was released,” said Mr Warren, on whose exchange Waddell and Reed made trades identified by the SEC.Bob Hill, vice-president of NYSE Euronext, said exchanges and regulators were having frequent meetings about how to proceed with reforming the financial markets following the “flash crash”.
786;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Eris Exchange to use State Street system;;Eris Exchange, a Chicago-based trading platform launched for interest rate swaps designed as futures contracts, is to use an electronic trading system provided by State Street, the US financial services company, the two companies said on Wednesday.Eris was launched in July by a group of market-making and proprietary trading companies – Getco, DRW Trading, Infinium Capital Management, Chicago Trading and Nico Trading.It aims partly to challenge the dominance by Wall Street dealer banks of trading over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and offers trading in contracts designed to mirror, or be “economically equivalent”, to OTC interest rate swaps. They are also cleared through CME Group’s clearing house.The emergence of Eris is also a sign of the proliferation of types of trading venues that are likely in the wake of passage of the Dodd-Frank act, which sets new rules for the trading and clearing of OTC derivatives.Clifford Lewis, executive vice-president and head of State Street’s eExchange business, said: “State Street’s relationship with Eris Exchange is yet another important step realising our objective that asset managers, asset owners and other clients have the tools to benefit from the rapid transformation in the derivative market structure through expanded access to liquidity, improved transparency, and access to central clearing.”
787;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-11-03T18:14:26Z;CFTC commissioner ‘disappointed’ with CME Group;;A top Washington regulator has launched a scathing attack on the CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, for refusing to co-operate in the introduction of position limits in futures markets.Bart Chilton, one of the five commissioners of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the US futures watchdog, told the FT he had been left “frustrated and disappointed” by a meeting with the CME in Chicago on Tuesday ahead of the Futures Industry Association Expo, the industry’s annual jamboree.Under the Dodd-Frank bill l on financial regulatory reform, mandatory position limits are due to be introduced in energy and metals markets by mid-January and on agricultural commodities by mid-April.However, Mr Chilton said the CME was apparently hiding behind wording in the legislation that said such limits should be introduced “as necessary”. The CFTC commissioner said he suspected the exchange group was hoping to use the language to avoid implementing mandatory position limits.He complained that the CME had “refused to engage in a dialogue” with him over the issue.“I had hoped to gain some sense of how we should thoughtfully implement the mandatory position. Their position, however, is that there isn’t a need for additional limits and that the law doesn’t require that they even be implemented,” Mr Chilton said.“I think that would be news to the folks who wrote the law,” the CFTC commissioner said. “For me, it is very clear what we are required to do. Taking a pass on implementing position limits is a major non-starter. Congress passed the new law, it was signed by the President and we have to implement limits - full stop.”Mr Chilton said that by contrast, Intercontinental Exchange, the US’s second-biggest futures exchange, had been “very helpful and thoughtful” about the issue.The CME filed a comment with the CFTC last week in which it argued urged for a delay in the imposition of position limits until the CFTC collected more data to enable it to determine and police limits.Noting that the Dodd-Frank Act allows the CFTC to make broad exemptions to the new rules, the CME also urged the regulator “to accommodate all non-speculative positions”.A CME spokesman said the language of the legislation “might be up for interpretation”.Mr Chilton has proposed extending position limits to financial futures and to high-frequency traders, but he admitted that he had not worked out the details of how such a proposal might function in practice.
788;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-11-02T17:23:39Z;Settlement: Stock exchanges muscle in as clearing houses prepare for shake-up;;The business of clearing cash equities in Europe, a hitherto unglamorous and not wildly profitable segment, has become one of the central issues affecting the structure of the market.On the face of it, a clearing house plays a functional role in trading. Sometimes known as a central counterparty (CCP), it stands between buyers and sellers, ensuring that trades are confirmed and stepping in to complete a transaction if either party defaults.But it has become the unlikely setting for a heated debate between exchanges, banks, brokers and other clearing houses. Market participants expect a new wave of business to shift to exchanges and clearing houses as a result of financial reforms designed to safeguard and boost the transparency of the opaque over-the-counter derivatives markets.Ownership of a clearing house has helped seal a dominant position in US futures markets for CME Group, the Chicago-based operator, and in European derivatives for Germany’s Deutsche Börse. NYSE Euronext is looking at this market while the London Stock Exchange is expected to follow suit. In doing so, NYSE Euronext is set to build its own clearing house.The European landscape is highly fragmented, partly a legacy of national stock exchanges’ longstanding relationships with clearing houses that clear mainly domestic stocks. New clearing houses have emerged in recent years, taking large slices of business from the myriad of alternative trading venues that have sprung up. The European Association of Clearing Houses has no fewer than 21 members.New entrants have helped force down prices, but an oft-cited statistic is that the cost of clearing in Europe is up to eight times the cost of settling in the US. Up to 40 per cent of the total cost of a trade can be taken up in clearing costs.The likely emergence of vertical clearing houses runs counter to market participants’ preferences. They would like to see a market consisting of several clearing houses as it would bring down prices. Being forced into a vertical market, owned by an exchange, has raised fears that prices could be kept high.Many investors have argued that this is a disincentive to raising trading volumes, which remain well below US levels.The Association for Fin­ancial Markets (AFME), a banking lobby group, says its members want fewer clearing houses. “The consolidation of CCP clearing allows users to gather and offset their open positions in a single portfolio,” says a spokesperson.At the same time regulators, banks and clearing houses have been pushing for greater co-operation between clearing houses. Known as interoperability, two or more clearing houses connect with one another and trading platforms. It enables the clearing house to clear its participants’ trades irrespective of the platform the trade was executed on.To date, the industry has been encouraged, but not compelled, to interoperate. It escaped prescriptive regulation when the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) was launched three years ago.Instead, participants signed up to a code of conduct which insisted that clearers create links with each other to give market participants a choice about where their trades were sent.There have been some agreements, such as a tie-up between LCH.Clearnet and X-Clear of Switzerland, but by and large it has not happened. In the wake of the financial crisis regulators have been more concerned about inadvertently introducing systemic risk.Areas of the system are on the verge of a breakthrough. Regulators in the UK, the Netherlands and Switzerland are putting the finishing touches to an agreement that would see LCH.Clearnet, X-Clear and European Multilateral Trading Facility (EMCF), a Dutch clearer, interoperate. An agreement is expected as soon as this month.But newer entrants and banks have argued that a more fundamental problem is at work.“Investors (and intermediaries acting on their behalf) trading on a given trading platform are obliged to use the CCP selected by that platform to clear their trades,” says AFME.“In terms of disincentive, interoperability will in­crease liquidity and volumes, and the cost will come down further,” says Tony McGuigan, general manager at X-Clear, part of the SIX Group, the Swiss exchange. “Flow is finite. To survive you need flow.”Some are willing to run not very profitable, possibly even lossmaking operations, to position themselves for the coming business from OTC derivatives.All are considering their options. Consolidation is under way, with discussions between the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation of the US, EMCF and Euro CCP, the DTCC’s European arm, about the creation of a quasi-utility clearer for Europe.Others face a scramble for business. LCH.Clearnet faces the loss of NYSE Euro­next as a client and the potential loss of the LSE.But even if clearing houses become interoperable, fears remain that new obstacles will be erected.“Interoperability is only half the solution,” says Diana Chan, chief executive of EuroCCP. “Central counterparties that interoperate also need access to the trading venues that are upstream from clearing, in order that users can have real choice and benefit from effective competition. Access and interoperability are inseparable.”
789;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-10-28T13:06:11Z;CME co-location set to reap up to $40m;;CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange operator, has said it expects to generate $30m-$40m from co-location services in 2012, the year they are earmarked to go live.Co-location is when brokers locate their computer servers physically within metres of an exchange’s system to shave milli-seconds off the time it takes to execute a trade.The phenomenon is driven by algorithmic, or programme trading – the use of computers to execute trades on behalf of clients, usually in small, high-frequency tranches.It is growing in popularity globally as exchanges gear up to attract trading from such players, and as exchanges realise they can earn revenue from renting out “racks” of computer space in such centres.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, said the revenue estimates were for the service’s first year of operation but added that he expected the group to scale up thereafter.His comments came as CME said third-quarter profits rose by more than 20 per cent as agricultural commodity futures trading continued to grow and global demand expanded.Net income was $244m, or $3.66 per diluted share,, up from $202m, or $3.04 per share, in the same period a year ago. Analysts had forecast $3.66 per share. Revenue rose to $733m from $650m a year earlier, just ahead of Wall Street estimates of $731m.Trading in all product areas expanded compared with last year, although trading volumes in futures on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, energy and metals fell from the second quarter. Agricultural commodity futures, however, continued to grow strongly, with 941,000 contracts changing hands in the third quarter, up from 708,000 last year and 855,000 in the second quarter.The total average rate per contract was 81 cents, down from 83 cents in the same period last year.Last week, CME launched central clearing for over-the-counter, interest-rate swaps– a global market with a notional value of $349,000bn – in a venture backed by big dealers including Bank of America, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank.Mr Donohue said the venture had cleared contracts with a face value of $660m so far, but said the industry was waiting for regulators in Washington to determine new financial rules before embracing central clearing.“Many clients are waiting for greater clarity on final rules before moving forward with cleared interest-rate swaps,” he said.CME said it incurred charges of $4.7m to compensate customers for losses related to a trading error last month, in which an employee mistakenly placed 30,000 fake orders generated as part of a quality assurance test on its active energy and metals markets.Trading volumes at CME’s international hubs grew by 15 per cent from the third quarter of last year, with such trading making up 15 per cent of electronic volumes.
790;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-10-27T18:33:39Z;ABN Amro to begin interest rate swaps clearing;;ABN Amro Clearing, part of the Dutch bank group, will begin to handle clearing interest rate swaps from December as it fights for a slice of the world’s largest over-the-counter derivatives market.The group, which cleared 3bn in derivatives contracts last year, said it would offer instant access to OTC products across multi-asset classes.Financial reform legislation on both sides of the Atlantic will make clearing of standardised derivatives mandatory by the end of 2012, and while regulators work out the details, trading platforms, banks and clearing houses are lining up to be the key infrastructure providers.CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, announced two weeks ago that it was planning to clear interest-rate swaps. The International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearing house backed by Nasdaq OMX that has processed some $400m-worth of interest-rate swaps is also looking for a slice of the market. Further competition is set to come from LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearing house, which expects to launch clearing in coming weeks.A bank such as ABN is aiming to handle OTC trading on behalf of the buy-side firm.“It is because we are unconflicted and not a dealer that we are confident we can succeed,” said Jan Bart de Boer, chief commercial officer at ABN AMRO Clearing Bank. He added that it would provide tough competition for rivals. “There is a very small group of firms who have the balance sheet and capability,” he said.Interest rate swaps account for about 75 per cent of the OTC derivatives market. They are financial instruments where, for a defined period, a pre-agreed fixed interest rate is swapped for a floating interest rate. They are often used to protect their users, often industrial companies, from the impact of interest rate changes on borrowings and are also used by asset managers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage lenders, and used speculatively by banks.Clearing has been pinpointed by regulators as a way to reduce counterparty and systemic risk in the OTC market. There was an estimated global exposure of $418 trillion on interest rate swaps market globally in 2008 according to the Bank of International Settlement. A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, stepping in to ensure a deal is completed even if one defaults.
791;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Traders worried by CME’s IT mistakes;;When the CME Group unveils its third-quarter earnings on Thursday, the US’s biggest futures exchange will be forced to revisit an embarrassing episode from its recent past.Last month, an employee at the company mistakenly placed 30,000 fake orders generated as part of a quality assurance test on its active energy and metals markets, prompting an un­usual public apology to traders and a promise to compensate them for any losses incurred.The CME will almost certainly be quizzed about the incident on Thursday, and could reveal how much it will set aside to resolve any claims. While the amount of money involved may not be substantial, some firms affected by the error say it raises important concerns about risk management in the electronic trading era.Those concerns have been magnified in the wake of the May 6 US “flash crash”, when markets plunged and rebounded within 20 minutes. They were also aggravated by the fact that just days before the trading error, in an unrelated episode, the CME inadvertently sent out an e-mail virus to many of the same firms affected by the fake order incident.The CME was not the only exchange affected. Some firms report that NYSE Euronext also sent out the same e-mail virus.NYSE was also embarrassed last week when a system upgrade to the company’s Arca electronic stock market triggered a near 10 per cent drop in the popular SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund trust, forcing the exchange to “bust”, or cancel, affected trades.The CME told the Financial Times that its technology team “responded quickly to the e-mail virus that affected many companies around the world in order to minimise the impact”.Yet while most trading firms will not speak against the CME on the record, privately they are grumbling about the incidents and how they were handled.One concern is about the CME’s technology, long a source of pride for the exchange. “Although the [trading error and e-mail virus] are completely un­related, they point to the same issue,” says the head of one trading firm. “They need to beef up their IT staff. They don’t have up-to-date virus protection software. That’s not good. What else are they doing wrong?”Another gripe relates to how the exchange reacted to the mistake. Some traders affected complain that the company was slow to inform them about the error and, in some cases, that the information it initially sent out was in­correct.A third complaint is the lack of any procedure to cope with what occurred.The CME told customers to close out the affected positions and said it would compensate them. “It was sloppy,” said the head of one futures brokerage.“They said: ‘You get out of these trades on your own.’ That’s a scary thing – that sort of thing could really move the market.”The Futures Industry Association, an industry group, is preparing a global survey of financial exchanges’ risk management practices in case of incidents such as trading errors by electronic trading platforms.The incident has drawn attention to the CME’s rule 578, which limits the exchange to compensation of $100,000 per customer per day for any mistake made by its trading system or staff. Although the CME has promised to waive the rule and pay any losses on this occasion, some customers say the rule is worrisome given the clear demonstration that mistakes can easily happen.Nevertheless, John Lothian, who edits a widely read futures industry newsletter, said the incidents should be placed in context. “There’s always been problems with trading . . . but the reputation of the markets have bigger concerns than a technology hiccup,” he said.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York
792;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-10-21T23:01:21Z;Transatlantic clearing war set to get hotter;;A transatlantic battle in the derivatives business is poised to heat up after LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearing house, said it would launch clearing of a vast untapped section of the interest rate swaps markets “in the next few weeks”.The disclosure comes a week after rival CME Group, which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said it had started clearing interest rate swaps.It will provide a boost to LCH.Clearnet, which has pinned much of its hopes for growth on cracking the US market for interest rate swaps clearing as it is losing customers in cash equities clearing in Europe.New rules that have emerged in recent months in the US, and similar ones being developed in Europe, require swaths of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives to be processed through clearing houses.That is designed to safeguard the financial system against the potentially catastrophic fallout from a big default, such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers. A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, stepping in to ensure a deal is completed even if one defaults.LCH.Clearnet already clears more than 60 per cent of interest rate swaps bought and sold between dealers, mainly Wall Street and large European banks.But it is one of at least three clearing houses jostling for a slice of the huge amount of interest rate swaps that are used in the US by other institutions such as asset managers – also known as the “buyside” – industrial companies and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage lenders.This buyside business remains uncleared but much of it will have to be under the Dodd-Frank legislation, passed by the Obama administration in June.Interest rate swaps account for about 75 per cent of the OTC derivatives markets, with credit default swaps a distant second. These are financial instruments where, for a defined period, a pre-agreed fixed interest rate is swapped for a floating interest rate. They are often used to protect their users from the impact of interest rate changes on borrowings and are also used speculatively by banks.In addition to CME, International Derivatives Clearing House, a new swaps clearer in which Nasdaq OMX has a controlling stake, is trying to build up its business.Asked when LCH.Clearnet would follow, Alberto Pravettoni, head of corporate strategy at LCH.Clearnet, said: “We are finalising the …model so we hope to be in a position to launch the service in the next few weeks.”The Dodd-Frank act gives futures brokers, or “futures commission merchants” (FCMs) a key role in acting as middlemen between institutions wanting to clear OTC derivatives and the clearing houses. Mr Pravettoni said LCH.Clearnet was “finalising the FCM model” and “the legal and operational framework”.Asked how many clearers would end up in the interest rate swaps business, he said: “I wouldn’t say we'd capture 100 per cent in the US. But the reality is that the market wants to see competition.”
793;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-10-19T13:48:25Z;Tougher limits on price moves needed, says Tudor Jones;;Tougher limits on how far prices are allowed to swing up or down in cash equities, options and futures markets are needed to prevent the “abhorrent behaviour” that was seen on the day of the “ flash crash” and the stock market crisis of 1987, according to Paul Tudor Jones, a well-known hedge fund manager.“Clearly, this type of episode, if repeated, will drive all prospective investors away from our securities markets,” Mr Tudor Jones told the Global Financial Leadership Conference organised by the CME Group.His comments came as a system of circuit breakers had been implemented across US equity markets in the wake of the flash crash on May 6. Futures markets such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have a system of automated “stop-loss” systems and other circuit breakers.“Every exchange-traded instrument including all securities, futures, options and any other form of derivatives should have some form of price limit. And this is all the more urgently needed now that electronic execution dominates trading,” said Mr Tudor Jones, founder and chief investment officer at Tudor Investment Corporation.He said existing price limits on all derivatives, futures and options should be reviewed “with the intention of narrowing them”. He suggested that all stock index futures and options should have an 8 per cent daily limit both up and down, consisting of a 5 per cent move with a one-hour “timeout”, and a further 3 per cent limit “before that price move is exhausted for the day”.However, Mr Tudor Jones said that while limits existed in some markets, they should be co-ordinated across asset classes. “We must harmonise cash, futures and options markets so that we are not forcing liquidity into one arena because another arena is shut. It defies imagination that our regulatory agencies have not yet insisted on harmonisation when history is repeated with examples that scream for this easy fix.”Leo Melamed, chairman emeritus of CME Group, told FT Trading Room he had proposed to the CFTC in early 1987 that futures markets introduce circuit breakers. But the regulator saw no reason to introduce them since the cash equities markets did not have them at the time. The CME eventually introduced them in 1989. “They’ve worked famously well since they were implemented,” Mr Melamed said.However, he agreed that circuit breakers should be co-ordinated across markets because it was now “one market”. But there is also a need to think about how foreign exchanges handled circuit breakers as well, to ensure harmonisation with the US. “That’s something that regulators should be able to agree to,” Mr Melamed said.A joint Securities and Exchange Commission/Commodity Futures Trading Commission committee on “emerging regulatory issues” is studying various post-flash crash options. These include whether brokers should have the same obligations as exchanges, which have maximum order size limitations and “price banding” that prevent entry into the trading engine of an order that exceeds a predefined maximum quantity or a price difference from the current market. It is also looking at potential revisions to “market pauses”, such as whether they should be triggered earlier.
794;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-10-17T22:26:41Z;CME wins swap-clearing support;;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other big users of the $350,000bn interest-rate swaps market will back the CME Group’s swap-clearing house, a move that is likely to boost the exchange’s chances of breaking into this potentially lucrative new business.CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, is expected to announce details of its interest-rate swaps clearing plans on Monday. The exchange declined to comment, but people familiar with the plans said that the CME’s clearing push is being backed by 10 leading banks and six large users of the market, also called the “buyside”. These are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage financiers, and investors Pimco, Wamco, Citadel and BlackRock.Financial reform legislation has targeted the privately-traded derivatives market, with new laws requiring large parts of these derivatives to move to clearing houses. At the moment, these contracts are backed by individual derivatives dealers, which exposes the financial system to risks if one of the dealers goes under.The use of clearing houses is supposed to mitigate such risks because the losses that would follow a default of a big derivatives dealer would be absorbed by all the members of the clearing house.Interest-rate swaps are the largest part of the OTC derivatives market. They are used to place bets on the direction of interest rates and also to hedge investments and debts that are sensitive to interest rates. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are big users of interest-rate swaps. Their participation in the CME clearing house, as well as that of other big investors, will ensure that the CME gets clearing business. International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearing house backed by Nasdaq OMX, is also pushing for business, and has processed some $400m worth of interest-rate swaps.The 10 dealers expected to participate in clearing swaps with the CME include: Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and UBS. BlackRock said it was planning to participate in clearing swaps with the CME as it is part of an advisory committee consisting of buyside firms. Other investors and banks declined to comment.Additional reporting by Suzanne Kapner in New York
795;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-10-14T22:38:48Z;CME to start interest-rate swap clearing;;CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, plans to begin clearing interest-rate swaps on Monday as it attempts to break into the largest over-the-counter derivatives market.Although the exchange group did not make any official statement and a spokesman would not confirm the launch, people familiar with the situation said that the CME was hoping to launch with the support of some of the biggest dealers in the contracts.Financial reform legislation will make clearing of standardised derivatives mandatory, and clearing houses are lining up to capture this new business.The CME faces competition for the market from LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearing house, which for the past decade has been clearing dealer-to-dealer swaps and has also targeted this year to extend its SwapClear service to the US.Another competitor is the International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearing house backed by Nasdaq OMX that has processed some $400m-worth of interest-rate swaps.One big New York-based derivatives dealer said that it was looking at the possibility of clearing interest-rate swaps through the CME once the system was up and running.The CME has long said that it wanted to launch interest-rate swap clearing by the end of the year, and has said that it is negotiating with dealers including Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and UBS. It could also involve investors from the buy side.Chris Allen, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities in New York, said that volumes were likely to be slow at first. “This will probably be something of a ‘soft launch’,” he said. “There’ll be a lot of testing, some contracts will go on, but I wouldn’t expect it to be like flipping a light switch and all of a sudden the thing takes off.”Clearing interest-rate swaps presents a potentially lucrative opportunity for the CME. Outstanding contracts in the interest-rate swap market are valued at $349,000bn globally – some $112,000bn of which is US dollar-denominated, according to Ticonderoga’s figures. Of that, OTC derivatives industry experts estimate that about 70-80 per cent of contracts are eligible to be cleared.A key factor in who dominates US interest rate swaps clearing will be decisions by users of derivatives, or the “buyside”, which includes hedge funds, pension funds and government-backed mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.“An issue for buyside clients is that they prefer to have exposure to a US based entity,” said Alexander Yavorsky, senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.“The likely winner in the US interest rate swaps market will probably be the clearing house that ultimately gets picked by big users like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.”
796;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-10-06T13:01:34Z;MarkitSERV to provide multiple OTC clearing options;;Buyers of over-the-counter credit derivatives will now have access to multiple clearing houses via a new platform from MarkitSERV, the company announced on Wednesday.MarkitSERV, a service provider for OTC derivatives transactions, said that it will be linking its clearing house routing system to BlackRock Solutions, the services business of financial group BlackRock.BlackRock Solutions maintains more than $9,000bn of trading positions for clients through its Aladdin portfolio management tool.Regulators in the US and Europe are keen to see investors move to begin clearing contracts themselves, to reduce the dominance of investment-bank dealers acting as counterparties in the derivatives market and bring greater pricing transparency to such markets.Enabling investors to choose their clearing house and spur competition, also favoured by regulators, is a step toward allaying those concerns.MarkitSERV said that it is now able to link trades to over a dozen clearing houses in the US and Europe including LCH.Clearnet, the CME Group, and IDCG for interest rate derivatives, and ICE Trust, the CME and Eurex Clearing for credit derivatives.“There has been a big fire drill since OTC clearing went live last year, but buy side firms haven’t been showing much interest in clearing,” said Jeff Gooch, chief executive of MarkitSERV.“There’s going to be a sea-change in that attitude over the next year, with new rules in US and Europe being finalised over the next few weeks.”The new system, in addition to facilitating clearing, will allow BlackRock’s clients to novate trades, which is part of transferring obligations to clearing houses, and to allocate blocks of trades to individual accounts.Users of derivatives have traded almost entirely through dealers in the past, but that is changing as new rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank reform bill in the US, and equivalent regulations from the European Commission, are broadening access to the market and requiring that more derivatives be standardised to be cleared and traded on more transparent platforms.Dealers of derivatives have tried to capture some of the business that they will lose. That includes investing in clearing houses, such as ICE Trust, and trading platforms, such as Tradeweb.Several large dealers are also investors in Markit, which co-owns MarkitSERV with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.
797;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-10-05T08:16:57Z;Comment: No more ‘hot potatoes’ please;We must again regulate marketmaking in the US, says R.T. Leuchtkafer;"The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s final report on the May 6 flash crash ends the debate.High-frequency marketmaker firms are not “passive” liquidity providers, as they long claimed. They are very active and aggressive traders, committing fratricide when it suits them, or withdrawing altogether from volatile markets. When these marketmakers shoot their brothers and run – often at the first sign of trouble – prices crash and public confidence shatters.After a detailed four-month review of the flash crash, looking at market data streams tick-by-tick and down to the millisecond, the SEC concluded that a single order in the e-mini S&P 500 futures market ignited an inferno of panic selling. It was over in about seven minutes, and $1,000bn was up in smoke.Within hours of the SEC’s report, the CME Group, owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, issued a statement to point out that the suspect e-mini order was entirely legitimate, that it came from an institutional asset manager (that is, the public), and was little more than 1 per cent of the e-mini’s daily volume and less than 9 per cent of e-mini volume during and immediately after the crash.How did this small bit of total volume cause such a conflagration?You do it with computers. Specifically, you do it with unregulated computers. You pay rent so your machines sit inside the exchanges, minimising travel time for your electrons. You pay licence fees so your computers eat their fill of super-fast proprietary data feeds, data containing a shocking amount of information on everyone’s orders, not just on your own.And when your computers spot trouble, such as a larger than expected sell-off, they dump inventory and they shut down – because they can.No one knows what a “larger than expected sell-off” might be, but on May 6 a single hedge that added just an extra 9 per cent of selling pressure was enough to cause chaos.When that happened, the SEC’s report says, high-frequency traders “stopped providing liquidity and began to take liquidity”, starting a frenzied race for anyone willing to buy. The report likened the panic to a downward-spiralling game of “hot potato” where, as HFT firms bought beyond their risk limits, they pulled their own bids and frantically sold to anyone they could, which were often just other HFT firms, who themselves quickly reached their risk limits and tried to sell to anyone they could, and so on – into the abyss. Fratricide ruled the day. Firms then fled the market altogether, accelerating the sell-off.Punch drunk, markets rebounded when other market participants realised what had just happened and jumped into the market to buy.Fair enough, some might say. Markets do panic, and sometimes for no reason. But the larger HFT firms register as formal marketmakers, receiving a variety of regulatory advantages, including greater leverage. All of this extends their enormous reach and power. In the past, they fulfilled certain obligations and observed certain restraints as a quid pro quo for those advantages, a quid pro quo intended to keep them in the market when markets were under stress and to prevent them from adding to that stress. Over the past few years, however, decades-long obligations and restraints all but disappeared, while many advantages stayed.Computing power also opened marketmaking to a field of unregistered, or informal, high-frequency marketmakers, what investor and commentator Paul Kedrosky termed the “shadow liquidity system”. Exchanges will pay you to do it, too, just as they pay formal marketmakers, and require little in return.The result is a loose confederation of unregulated, or lightly regulated, high-frequency marketmakers. They feed on what many consider confidential order information, play hot potato in volatile markets, and then instantly change the game to hide-and-seek if even a single hedge hits an unseen and unknowable tipping point.They do it because they can; it does not happen because of a computer malfunction, it happens because it is designed to happen. It is not a bug, it is a feature.The flash crash was the most spectacular example of this feature of US markets, but it is not the only example. For years, there have been mini-flash crashes in individual stocks. Usually these episodes earned just a perplexed “oops” from participants and regulators.In the autumn of 2008, though, with the financial system on the brink, stocks whipsawed, foremost of because of fundamentals, but also – importantly – because of the machinations of the shadow liquidity system itself. Volatility reached record highs as high-frequency firms played hot potato and hide-and-seek, day after day, month after month, with the biggest listed companies in the world.We must again regulate marketmaking in the US. Critics of regulation point out that no regulator can ever force firms to stay in the market when a freight train comes charging down the tracks. That is obviously true, but the flash crash was a freight train of their own design and manufacture. These firms lobbied for deregulation and lobbied to keep their many advantages over everyone else.So it is ironic the freight train they ran from on May 6 was just another unregulated high-frequency marketmaker, one that fired off a thousand orders a microsecond earlier, playing hot potato because it can. The flash crash was high-frequency brother against brother, with the public and listed companies shredded in the crossfire. This is the very definition of systemic risk.As I wrote in a comment letter to the SEC on April 16, weeks before the flash crash, “in exchange for the short-term liquidity HFT firms provide, and provide only when they are in equilibrium (however they define it), the public pays the price of the volatility they create …please regulate them”.The author is a private investor based in the US"
798;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-09-29T13:58:39Z;Newedge handles $2bn notional on Eris;;Newedge, the world’s largest futures broker, has handled $2bn in notional value of interest rate swaps contracts traded on the recently-launched Eris Exchange and cleared through CME Group’s clearing house.The development is another sign that the derivatives industry is adopting measures mandated by G20 regulators to shift over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives onto formal trading platforms and that they be processed through clearing houses.It is also the first sign that Eris has started to attract business since it was launched in July by a group of market-making and high-frequency trading (HFT) firms: Getco, DRW Trading, Infinium Capital Management, Chicago Trading Company and Nico Trading.All are engaged in market-making in either equities and options and bonds. Some are the biggest names in HFT, a form of rapid, computerised trading that has made inroads into derivatives as well as equities.Eris offers trading in interest rate swaps designed as futures contracts, rather than as OTC interest rate swaps that are commonly traded between dealers and sold to end-users such as companies, asset managers and hedge funds. They are designed to mirror, or be “economically equivalent”, to OTC interest rate swaps.Newedge connected to Eris Exchange in August and acts as a broker, bringing so-called buyside OTC derivatives users to the exchange to transact deals, and handling the clearing services associated with the contracts being cleared at the clearing house.Nicolas Breteau, Newedge chief executive, said: “Private initiatives such as Eris Exchange can help create a safer environment for OTC interest rates swaps transactions and clearing.“The fact that we are involved in both the transaction and the clearing was an important factor in our decision to connect to the Eris Exchange platform. We are fervent supporters of both pricing and post-trade transparency, and view this as the best way to create value for our buy-side clients,” Mr Bretau said.According the Bank of International Settlements, globally, interest rate swaps notional amount outstanding was over $400,000,000bn as of December 2009.
799;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-09-27T16:38:49Z;US retail FX: War waged on cowboy practices;;The US retail foreign exchange market has long suffered a reputation as a place where unseemly operators took advantage of naive investors.So it was a bit surprising that when a regulator proposed rules to protect small FX investors this year, they responded with a torrent of criticism.Egged on by forex dealers, investors sent the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a record 9,100 letters. They focused on one aspect of the proposal: leverage. Borrowed money is the bread and butter of day-to-day FX trading, and the investors did not want it yanked away.“Putting a cap [on leverage] is interference with the free-market system and capitalism,” one commenter, Andres Hernandez, said in a widely shared sentiment. “You are telling the investor how to invest their money. The first steps toward communism.”The commission retreated from an initial proposal to cap leverage at 10 to one. Under a final rule to take effect on October 18, traders will be able to borrow up to 50 times collateral for the main currency pairs such as dollar/yen or euro/dollar, and 20 times collateral for others.The proposal and subsequent pushback illustrate a conundrum for regulators. As they seek to impose oversight on spot foreign exchange transactions, they risk repelling investors from a fledging marketplace.Aite Group, the consultancy, estimates retail forex traders fuel about $125bn in daily turnover, about 3 per cent of daily global volumes of $4,000bn. This share has grown from less than 1 per cent a decade ago, Aite says.This growth has taken place despite the market’s shady reputation. While forex brokers make up less than 1 per cent of the members of the National Futures Association, a self-regulatory body, they were the target of 43 per cent of the complaints from its business conduct committee in the year ended June 30.The CFTC, set up to police commodity futures and options markets, has long noted the prevalence of retail forex cheats. As far back as the late 1990s it was issuing fraud advisories to the public. Gary Gensler, chairman, calls foreign exchange “the largest area of retail fraud that the CFTC oversees”.But while the commission has had the ability to go after fraud artists in FX derivatives, it had no jurisdiction in spot retail FX after losing a court case on the issue in 2004. The US Congress closed the loophole in 2008 and reaffirmed the CFTC’s authority with the passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms in July.The CFTC’s resulting rules will do more than reduce leverage. They will require retail FX dealers to register with authorities and hold liquid assets covering their obligations to customers in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as meet the new leverage limits. They require registrants to maintain records of customer complaints and disclose the percentage of non-discretionary retail accounts that actually turned a profit.After fighting lower leverage, FX dealers appear resigned to the new regulations. Gain Capital, which operates Forex.com, says “increased investor protection will have a long- term positive effect on the industry”.Sang Lee, an Aite Group managing director, says: “With the creation of a regulatory framework, the idea is to help the business enter the mainstream.”Some smaller operators have already been forced out of business. After the National Futures Association last year issued its own rules raising FX dealers’ minimum capital requirements from $5m to $20m, the number of NFA-registered foreign exchange dealers fell from 41 to 17.Spot forex dealers are not the only way for small investors to trade forex. CME Group, the derivatives exchange operator, launched “micro” FX futures in March 2009 that are one-tenth the size of its benchmark FX futures contracts, making them accessible to individuals. Trading volume remains a fraction of the overall FX futures market.Small investors can also make bets on currency moves with exchange-traded funds that invest in currency futures on their behalf. (As a measure of retail sentiment, assets in the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index bullish fund outweigh its bearish counterpart by a ratio of six to one.)Wall Street banks offer forex trading platforms, though Finra, the regulator for broker-dealers, has proposed limiting leverage to four to one. “That level of leverage is far more consistent with the overall services and products provided by broker dealers,” a representative says. The Securities and Exchange Commission also has a mandate, under the Dodd-Frank act, to implement separate FX rules.
800;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-09-20T21:29:44Z;Fears over raw material hedging costs;;US and European companies fear higher costs for raw materials hedging programmes after the overhaul of US commodities regulation and the forthcoming changes in European legislation, according to a survey by Greenwich Associates, the consultancy.US regulators have yet to determine which “end users”, such as airlines, would be exempt from clearing their over-the-counter swaps in central facilities and from posting margin requirements.If companies are forced to clear and post margin on their OTC swaps, costs are likely to rise, lawyers for the companies said.The poll results, released on Monday, reveal that 76 of the companies responding said they anticipated their commodities hedging costs to “increase” or “significantly increase”, against 9 per cent that said the new regulations would have “no impact” and 12 per cent that said they anticipated a “decrease” in costs.Andrew Awad, a consultant at Greenwich Associates, said a cost increase was “inevitable”, even if the companies were finally exempted from clearing.“If banks are forced to lay off their own risks through centrally cleared transactions and are subject to a range of new capital, margin and record-keeping requirements, the additional costs will be passed through to their commercial clients,” he said.US companies feared more damaging consequences if regulators were to adopt a narrow definition of the “end-user” exemption that limited the type of user that could qualify, Greenwich Associates said.In addition to margin requirements for central clearing, commodity hedging users said the related standardisation of contracts would reduce sharply their flexibility.Nonetheless, the US and European companies polled said clearing the swaps would offer some advantages, including “mitigating counterparty credit risk” or “reduced documentation”.Greenwich said companies regarded just a few clearers as their central counterparty for derivatives clearing.“Generally, commodities market participants in the US favour CME Group, with ICE also receiving a meaningful number of votes,” the consultancy said. “In continental Europe, ICE receives the most votes but market participants are more fragmented, giving strong support to Eurex, CME Group and Euroclear.”In commodity markets on Monday, gold prices hit a nominal all-time high as investors continued to pile into precious metals markets ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates on Tuesday.In London, spot gold rose to $1,283.70 a troy ounce, up 0.8 per cent on the day. In real terms, adjusted for inflation, gold prices are a long way off their high above $2,300 set in 1980.The rally – gold has risen 17.1 per cent since January – was helped by signs that central banks, led by Russia, would this year be net buyers of gold after two decades of net selling, and by bullish comments from leading gold miners.AngloGold Ashanti said it planned to wind up its forwards sales, a bet that high prices are here to stay.In energy markets, crude oil surged, with Nymex October West Texas Intermediate up $1.20 to $74.86 a barrel. ICE November Brent rose $1.11 to $79.32.
801;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-09-16T18:22:36Z;CME says ‘sorry’ for dummy orders;World’s biggest futures exchange promises to pay for losses incurred;"CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, has said it is “deeply sorry” for mistakenly placing 30,000 fake orders it generated as part of a quality assurance test on its active energy and metals markets on Monday.In a letter to customers on Thursday, signed by its top executives, the exchange group issued a blanket apology, promising to pay for any losses incurred and pledging to work to retain confidence in its trading systems.The apology is an unusual step for a company that prides itself on its risk management.After customers grumbled in the days following the error, the CME’s letter took a different tone from its terse initial statement on Tuesday that it had “inadvertently” placed the test orders on the live market and was “working with affected customers” to address the situation.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures industry regulator, has said it is “actively reviewing” the incident.Gary Gensler, chairman of the CFTC, said in New York the regulator had quickly found out what had happened, and the orders placed in error by CME were from the market’s close on Friday.The error comes at a particularly awkward time for CME, as high-speed trading is under scrutiny by regulators in the wake of the May 6 “flash crash”, when markets plunged and rebounded within a 20-minute period.“We assure you that this is not reflective of the very high standards that we set for ourselves, and we are deeply sorry for the impacts that it had on you and your business.“While we maintain procedures designed to ensure that our testing is separate from the production environment and live trading, unfortunately, due to a human error that occurred Monday, these procedures were not followed,” the company wrote, in a letter signed by Craig Donohue, chief executive, Terry Duffy, chairman, and Phupinder Gill, president. “Rest assured that this is an extremely rare occurrence.”The mistaken order flow began at 3.38pm eastern time on Monday and lasted six minutes, during which the spread between heating oil contracts for October and December delivery suddenly widened 28 per cent, at a time when trading is normally slow.CME originally said the erroneous orders had had no impact on prices, but in the letter to customers it stated: “We acknowledge that this error has negatively impacted our clearing firms and customers in these markets.“Because it was not possible to cancel trades that resulted from errant orders, CME Group will work with all affected customers to neutralise the financial effect of these transactions, including making customers whole for net losses they incurred in exiting positions. We intend to work hard to ensure we maintain the trust and confidence that you historically have placed in us.”

802;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-09-15T23:20:02Z;Fears at CME compliance staff levels;;CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, may not have enough compliance staff to guard against wrongdoing in its markets, according to a report by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures industry watchdog.The report was released on Wednesday, a day after the exchange group revealed it had mistakenly placed orders on active energy and metals markets as it was undertaking a quality assurance test on Monday.The embarrassing admission came as high-speed electronic trading is being scrutinised by regulators in the wake of the May 6 “flash crash”, when markets plunged and rebounded in a 20-minute period.Although the CFTC report was not related to CME’s trading error, it focuses further unwelcome attention on the exchange group’s risk-management and oversight practices.The CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight said that a rule-enforcement review conducted during 2008 had found that the company maintained adequate audit trail, trade practice and disciplinary programmes.However, the division said it “had some concerns regarding compliance staff levels”. The review was undertaken as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was digesting the Chicago Board of Trade, which it bought in 2007 for $11.6bn, and the CFTC noted that as it sought to cut costs, CME reduced the size of its compliance team across both exchanges by 18 per cent.The CFTC noted that additional compliance staff had been hired after the review was completed, but urged CME to review the size of its compliance team “to ensure that the regulatory services provided . . . remain effective in enforcing compliance with the exchanges’ rules and Commission regulations”.The CFTC said CME should also increase its fines for incorrect record-keeping by traders operating on the traditional “open outcry” trading floor.A CME spokesman said the company was “pleased with the CFTC’s Rule Enforcement Review and their findings that we maintained an effective audit trail and trade practice and disciplinary programs”.The spokesman said CME has a market regulation and audit team of more than 200 people, including 17 new staff members who had been added since the CFTC completed its review.“We’ll continue to monitor our staffing levels based on workflow demands to ensure we have appropriate resources to maintain our industry-leading regulatory programmes,” he said.
803;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-09-15T02:01:29Z;CME mistakenly places test orders for trading;;CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, mistakenly placed orders on active energy and metals markets as it was undertaking a quality assurance procedure.CME declined to say which contracts were placed into the live market or how many orders were sent or executed, but a person familiar with the situation numbered them in the tens of thousands.The mistaken order flow began at 3:38pm Eastern time on Monday and lasted six minutes. CME said the erroneous orders had no impact on prices.Futures brokers said they observed anomalous price action, however.The spread between heating oil contracts for October and December delivery suddenly widened 28 per cent in the six minute period, when trading is normally slow.“Then we heard today that someone did have a fat finger. It was the exchange,” said Andy Lebow, a broker at MF Global.The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission is “actively reviewing” Monday’s events, its chairman, Gary Gensler, said.CME’s admission about the errant trades raises questions about its systems at a time when high-speed trading is under scrutiny by regulators in the wake of the May 6 “flash crash”, when markets plunged and rebounded in a 20-minute period.Errors can be amplified in an electronic trading environment, with a trader’s misprogrammed algorithm or extra computer keystroke able to rack up huge losses.But it is unusual and embarrassing for an exchange to place unintended orders in a market it oversees as a self-regulatory organisation.CME’s energy and metals contracts include crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, gold and silver.The company said it had “inadvertently” posted test orders intended for its quality assurance procedure on Globex, the electronic trading system introduced in energy and metal markets in 2006.CME said the company tests its systems as a matter of course and it had not determined whether human error or a computer glitch caused the mistake.CME said it was working with “affected customers” but pledged it would not “bust” any completed transactions. The exchange will follow rules for “phantom orders”, which the CME describes as “caused by a failure, malfunction or negligent operation” of exchange systems.
804;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-08-26T21:43:15Z;Quick View: Slow lessons in high-speed algo world;;How many more times will it take for an algorithm running wild for people to realise that we have a very serious problem here?First we had Credit Suisse being fined by NYSE Euronext in January for failing to control algorithms at a proprietary trading unit. Then Deutsche Bank’s wrists were slapped this month by the Osaka exchange for allowing an algo to run amok. Now Infinium Capital Management, the Chicago-based high-frequency trading firm, says it is co-operating fully with a CME Group probe after an “inadvertent error” the company made trading the exchange’s benchmark Nymex crude oil contract on February 3. And these are just the ones we know about.On Wednesday, someone in the trading community in Chicago I have known since I was based in the city five years ago – before the word “algo” was on anyone’s lips – tried to explain that algo errors are merely the modern equivalent of a pit trader wrongly filling out a ticket in the pit. Nice try. This is in a whole different league.Huge numbers of orders can be pinged into an exchange in a matter of milliseconds. Massive amounts of money can be involved. And in a world where real-time risk management, even at the level of clearing house, is not what it could and should be, the infrastructure around current electronic trading behaviour is simply not yet able to act as a safety catch to deal wit the fallout from massive market dislocations.As Scott O’Malia, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, put it on Thursday: “The risks posed by high speed and algorithmic trading must be handled with great care because when things go wrong, five seconds can generate a lifetime’s worth of trading, not to mention a toxic trail.”“We need to develop rules and regulations that are more appropriate to policing the high speed nature of today’s computer-aided trading styles, where computers can have a significant impact on the market in a matter of seconds, rather than trying to conform pit trading enforcement methods to today’s markets,” he said.What is so remarkable about this – and other failures like the ” flash crash” in US equities – is that they have been happening in “real time” as regulators have been studying issues in market structures anyway - notably the Securities and Exchange Commission with its “concept release” on equity market structures.It is almost as if the markets have obligingly been providing regulators with actual examples of some of the problems they had started to suspect were possible. I’m sure this was not the what Mr O’Malia had in mind when he appointed Infinium’s chief executive Chuck Whitman to his recently formed Technology Advisory Committee, set up to figure out how regulators should respond to issues thrown up by rapid technological developments in markets.But it is at least some comfort to know that some key market participants feel they have a vested interest in working with regulators to figure out how to stop the next catastrophe from happening.The central problem is that algorithms are proprietary – that is, they are developed by banks and brokers as their private intellectual property.On one level this is understandable. Banks and brokers invest a lot in developing algos that do whizzy things that they can sell to the buyside and which their competitors can’t provide.But on another level the performance of algos has become a public policy issue, as these algo malfunctions show. They may well affect pensioners with 401(k)s.This means that subjecting algos to some level of transparency test may make sense at the regulatory level. But we immediately bump up against the question of whether it makes sense to regulate technology.I suggest that if public harm is possible from doing nothing, something, at a minimum, must be done.

When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
806;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;Infinium in probe over trading error;;A high-frequency trading firm on Wednesday acknowledged that it was under scrutiny after a mistaken oil trade on a day when crude futures surged nearly $1 a barrel in less than a minute.Infinium Capital Management said that CME Group, the exchange operator, was investigating an “inadvertent error” the company made trading the exchange’s benchmark Nymex crude oil contract on February 3. The Chicago company has “co-operated fully” with the “routine inquiry”, Chuck Whitman, chief executive, said.Just before the market closed on that date, a burst of buying sent US crude futures nearly $1 higher to $77.60 a barrel in less than a minute. Oil then retreated as fast as it had risen, and proceeded to decline more than $5 over the next two days.The sudden moves puzzled traders.Mr Whitman said his company became aware of the error within seconds and immediately told CME.“This incident was a result of human error in a software test group and the parties associated with this error are no longer with the firm,” he said. “We have since made modifications to our software architecture to ensure that this type of error is never repeated.” Infinium, which was launched nine years ago and trades primarily futures and options on futures, declined further comment.Markets have come to be dominated by high-frequency traders who rely on a marriage of technology and speed. They use algorithms to make ultra-fast trades, seeking to profit from fleeting opportunities presented by minute price changes in markets.High-frequency trading firms have been in the spotlight since the May 6 “flash crash” struck financial markets. Mr Whitman was appointed to a committee the US futures markets regulator established after the crash to catch up with new technologies reshaping derivatives markets.At the committee’s inaugural meeting last month, he told attendees that “in the short run, it’s really hard to push a market hard in one direction because it ends up being absorbed by all the other correlated markets,” according to a transcript.The CME and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator, declined to comment on the Infinium probe.The Osaka Securities Exchange this month admonished Deutsche Bank for letting an algorithm run wild. Earlier this year the New York Stock Exchange fined Credit Suisse for failing adequately to supervise an algorithm that sent hundreds of thousands of “buy” and “sell” messages, signalling for orders to be made and simultaneously cancelled.Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie in New York
807;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-08-25T19:05:03Z;Dutch lift lid on a high-frequency universe;;"With its vaulted ceiling and vintage ticker boards, the old Amsterdam Stock Exchange is not the most obvious place to look for “high-frequency” traders.But the floor of the exchange, built in 1914, is where about 100 traders can be found at All Options, a Dutch options trading firm that engages in high-frequency trading strategies. The floor was last used in 2002 when the Amsterdam options exchange closed. Now its vast trading hall has been recycled, housing rows of trading “pods” used by All Options to trade options on electronic exchanges.All Options and a handful of other similar firms based in Amsterdam offer a window into the secretive world of high-frequency trading (HFT), a phenomenon that has shot to prominence as regulators investigate how technology has super-charged the way markets function.HFT refers to various styles of electronic trading that harness computer algorithms to trade automatically in and out of stocks, options and futures hundreds of times in the blink of a human eye.Such trading has come to account for more than half of all trades on share markets in the US and Europe, and is also common in options markets.But the practice has continued to court controversy since the “flash crash” of May 6, when US stocks plunged in a matter of minutes.Yesterday, algorithms were also in focus as it emerged that Infinium, a US company, was co-operating with an inquiry by CME Group after a mistaken oil trade on a day when crude futures surged nearly $1 a barrel in less than a minute.Yet in Amsterdam, home to the oldest HFT community in Europe, such groups say in rare interviews that HFT is a vague label that masks legitimate trading strategies that have helped investors by narrowing bid-ask spreads, adding liquidity and lowering transaction costs.They say that their role is mostly as market-makers, providing constant bid and ask quotes in the markets just like the old pit traders of Amsterdam. Remco Lenterman, managing director of IMC, one of the companies, says: “We believe that the existence of these predatory strategies is based on a myth rather than reality. We use the same publicly available data that is available to all, and we do not have insight in the intentions of other market participants.”London, not Amsterdam, may seem a more obvious location for HFTs. But the Dutch city has a trading tradition going back to the 17th century when the first derivatives contracts were written on the shares of the Dutch East and West India companies. The Dutch were also pioneers in options trading, launching the first European options exchange in Amsterdam in 1978.That produced a generation of traders, many of whom ended up forming their own HFTs such as All Options, IMC, Flow Traders and the biggest, Optiver.Jelle Elzinga, a former options pit trader, is a board member of Optiver. Speaking from the company’s glass-fronted office in Amsterdam’s Zuidas business district, he says: “There is a misperception that HFTs are speculators who move the markets to extremes.“In fact the vast majority of HFT involves looking for very small arbitrage opportunities …These actions do not create volatile markets; they close gaps across markets, increase market efficiency and ensure that there is always liquidity.”After the flash crash, many HFTs were blamed for quitting the markets, exacerbating the crisis. Optiver says it continued to provide liquidity “during and after the flash crash”.Inside its trading room, the layout is like many bank-dealing rooms: rows of desks with computer screens. Yet there are no telephones because Optiver has no clients and, like its rivals, trades using its own money.Optiver does not disclose how much money it makes but Mr Elzinga says the group has never had a lossmaking year. That has helped it grow from its Dutch base to employ 600 people across Amsterdam, Paris, Sydney, Hong Kong, Taipei and Chicago, the US city that is home to similar market-making firms that grew out of the trading pits there – such as Getco and Peak6, both Optiver rivals.Traders come straight out of university and candidates will not even be considered for interview unless they pass an eight-minute test designed to weed out those weak on split-second numeracy. “We might ask ‘What is 0.3 divided by 0.0005?’ – that sort of thing,” Mr Elzinga explains.He admits that Optiver “tends not to have views on, or a lot of knowledge about, stocks in terms of how companies are doing”.The company will hunt for tiny aberrations in the relationship between two assets. Or its traders may use algorithms to buy and sell similar financial instruments simultaneously to benefit from a discrepancy in their price relationship – for example, as between the shares of BP, the oil company listed in London, and the company’s American Depositary Receipts in New York. This is usually called “statistical arbitrage”.Mr Elzinga says this is a small part of the business. “It is not at the centre of Optiver’s strategy.”Yet there are some strategies that worry big asset managers. They include “quote stuffing”, whereby HFTs send thousands of orders into an exchange, only to cancel them microseconds later. Many suspect that this, far from being liquidity provision, is designed to confuse rival traders into thinking there is “real” activity in a certain stock.Mr Elzinga says: “We do think …that regulators should take a closer look at issues such as quote stuffing and flash orders.”Like its US rivals, Optiver has started to explain to regulators what the company does and doesn’t do, aware that the issue of HFT is at the top of regulators’ agendas. Asked to describe high-frequency trading, Mr Elzinga says: “It doesn’t make a big difference what you call it. We are still doing what we did 20 years ago. Then, we did it in the pit and had to yell out. Now we do it on a screen.”"
808;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-08-19T09:07:05Z;JPMorgan veteran hired as SwapClear CEO;;LCH.Clearnet has hired Michael Davie, a 20-year veteran of JPMorgan, as its first chief executive of SwapClear since the interest rate swaps clearing services was launched in 1999.The move is part of the London-based clearing house’s efforts to win so-called buy-side, or “client”, clearing of over-the-counter derivatives in the US.Legislation passed in June, known as the Dodd-Frank bill, mandates greater use of clearing of OTC derivatives, among them interest rate swaps – by far the largest part of that market.Large non-bank users of rates swaps – such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing lenders – are expected to start using cleared OTC derivatives, promising a wave of business for clearers.However, LCH.Clearnet faces stiff competition from International Derivatives Clearing Group, a rates swaps clearer set up by Nasdaq OMX, from CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange.LCH.Clearnet said that with Mr Davie’s appointment, SwapClear would “focus on ensuring the best possible products and services are delivered to the buy-side”.Roger Liddell, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet, said: “Clients represent a large proportion of the global interest rate swap market. Michael’s appointment reflects our commitment to delivering OTC derivative clearing services to the buy-side and of ensuring that SwapClear’s market leading offering evolves in line with their needs.”Joe Reilly, director of SwapClear, will remain in that post and report to Mr Davie.Mr Davie’s last job at JPMorgan was chief financial officer of its global fixed-income sales.
809;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-08-17T10:26:34Z;Trading group fined for driving up oil price;;The US futures regulator on Monday fined a commodity trading group $12m for artificially pushing crude oil prices to $100-a-barrel for the first time in 2008.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said a trader at a former unit of ConAgra Foods, bent on driving oil to triple-digit levels, caused a “non-bona fide price” to be reported for the benchmark US crude futures contract West Texas Intermediate. Gavilon, the commodity trading house, later bought the unit’s trading operations.The fine, which was agreed by the CFTC and the current owners of the trading unit, comes more than two years after crude oil futures surged to a record $147 a barrel.The settlement sheds light on one of the more mystifying moments in oil’s price rally.On the first day of trading in 2008, a single contract for $100 oil changed hands on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange even as the electronic market was trading at a substantial discount. The trade perplexed market participants at the time.The CFTC said ConAgra’s floor broker, whom it did not name, acted at the bidding of a trader at ConAgra Trade Group. Traders at the time identified the person handling the purchase as Richard Arens, a long-time floor broker at Nymex. A message left on Monday at Mr Arens’ home was not immediately returned.“The trader said that CTG had instructed its floor broker that CTG had wanted to get the $100 print for as long as three months prior to January 2, 2008, and that ‘we weren’t gonna let that one get away from us’,” the CFTC said.The US regulator quoted a CTG trader saying: “Within freakin’ 25 cents [of $100 a barrel], I’m just gonna be a madman”. The floor broker’s clerk, after reporting the deal a $100 a barrel, said there was going to be “fallout of iditos, idiocy somewhere.”According to the CFTC, a trader at CGT latter bragged on an email: “[S]ome people collect art prints, we collect price prints.” The same trader was quoted by the regulator as saying: “You know hey we not gonna miss this one your know. This is the big one.”The regulator added on its finding that several traders at CGT “celebrated the trade” at $100 a barrel and one of the traders said: “And now the sell off begins”.Gavilon, which is owned by investment firms General Atlantic, Ospraie Management and Soros Fund Management, will pay the majority of the fine. Gavilon said: “We are pleased that this matter has been resolved and believe that this agreement is in the best interests of our customers and suppliers.”James Newsome, a former CFTC chairman who was chief executive of exchange parent Nymex Holdings, now part of CME Group, at the time of the controversial oil trade, last year joined Gavilon’s board.ConAgra, based in Omaha, Nebraska, will pay Gavilon $4.3m to resolve potential liability in the case. “ConAgra Foods did have appropriate financial controls and exercised enterprise risk oversight over CTG, but we did not approve or exercise authority over individual trades executed by CTG,” the company said.
810;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-08-16T20:43:56Z;Blow to CME over futures trading;;CME Group, operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, has suffered a setback in its ability to maintain a virtual monopoly in trading of US futures contracts after regulators rebuffed its attempts to quash a challenge from a Wall Street-backed competitor.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures markets watchdog. on Monday rejected the CME’s claim that a futures contract offered by ELX, a smaller rival, was illegal.It also said it had asked its staff to start “a thorough analysis” of antitrust issues raised by both exchanges’ claims.The developments will be seen as signalling the start of a shift in the antitrust stance of US markets regulators to the dominance by Chicago of US Treasury bond futures contracts, among the most widely used exchange-traded derivatives.CME is expected to defend its business model vigorously against any attempt to open it up further to competition.The developments are the latest in a year-long tussle between the CFTC, CME Group and ELX, an upstart futures exchange launched last year and backed by banks including Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as Getco and Peak6, two large Chicago-based market-making firms.ELX wants to allow its customers to take out a position in contracts known as “exchange of futures for futures” (EFFs), and unwind them on the Chicago Board of Trade, a CME unit where interest rate futures are traded.The challenge raises the spectre of fungibility – the ability of traders to open a position at one exchange and close it at another. While this is a feature of equity markets, it is anathema to the CME, which has a clearing house for trades done on its exchange.The CME argued to the CFTC that EFFs were unlawful “wash or fictitious” trades and would never be accepted at the CME.However, the CFTC said in a letter to the CME that it supported an earlier conclusion by its staff saying the contracts were not illegal.“This is the nail in the coffin that these contracts are illegal,” said Neal Wolkoff, ELX chief executive.CME Group said the CFTC’s letter “does not change CBOT rules, which clearly prohibit EFFs”. It said CBOT would “continue to prohibit” EFFs, “which would reduce transparency and price discovery in CBOT Treasury futures markets”.The CFTC has yet to determine whether the CME should be forced to accept EFFs for unwinding on its platform. That will form part of its antitrust enquiry.However Scott Early, a partner at law firm Foley & Lardner in Chicago, said: “This [CFTC decision] is a clear signal that we are in a different world from a regulatory standpoint. What it demonstrates is that this CFTC is not bound by years of history and they are looking at this with a blank slate and are going to be breaking some taboos in the process.”Nonetheless Ed Ditmire, analyst at Macquarie Securities in New York, said there would be little impact on the CME of the CFTC decision for now. “The EFF rule on one hand challenges key competitive barriers (fungibility) to CME’s franchise, but on the other presents questions on practicality and appeal by users which can only be answered if it is implemented.”ELX has made barely a dent in the CME’s business, having managed only roughly 2 per cent market share in trading of US Treasury bond futures.John Lothian, editor of The John Lothian Newsletter, said he did not believe there was ”a big enough economic reason” for market participants to want to trade EFFs in the way that ELX was proposing.CME Group’s shares were up 1.3 per cent at $248.10 by early afternoon in New York. They have fallen by 26 per cent since the start of the year.
811;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-08-11T21:51:13Z;Financial markets: Derivative dilemmas;Reform seeks balance of rules and rewards;Ari Bergmann is putting the finishing touches to a course he will begin teaching at New York University in a few weeks. Yet, in spite of his best efforts, much of the curriculum cannot yet be written. That is because of a big battle that is about to explode, on Wall Street and in the deepest bowels of Washington.Mr Bergmann will teach people ranging from investors to corporate treasurers how to spot financial risks and how to manage them. The tools used to do this are derivatives, which he first traded in the 1980s – contracts whose value is linked to a financial instrument, from the rate of interest paid on US government bonds to the price of oil.The derivatives market is one of the biggest in the world. At the end of last year, contracts with a face value of $636,431bn were swirling around the world’s financial system, according to the Bank of International Settlements. Just 3.4 per cent of the total were traded on exchanges. The rest – $614,674bn worth, equivalent to nearly 10 years of global economic output – were agreed and traded in private markets, under terms struck directly between the buyers and sellers.Over the next year, an entirely new rulebook is to be drawn up for this privately traded part of the financial markets, also called over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. President Barack Obama’s signature on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on July 21 started the countdown. The legislation covers many parts of the financial system. Title seven – the part that deals with derivatives – is “among the most far-reaching and controversial sets of statutory changes” included in the new laws, according to lawyers at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.But whereas in theory the business is about to be revolutionised, in reality any changes will be preceded by bitter haggling over precisely what the rules prescribe– and proscribe. Crucially for banks, investors and the future health of world economies, just how far-reaching the outcome will be depends in large part on the decisions made by the two Washington regulators who will police a market that grew dramatically in recent decades without direct oversight.The two – the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – have increased their staff numbers in anticipation of the rule-writing and their huge extra enforcement duties. For the most part, the rules have to be written by July 2011. These are regulators that usually write just a handful of new rules every year but, thanks to the new legislation, there will be more than 100 definitions and rules to get through. “Many of the key terms in the derivatives legislation are either undefined or are left for the regulators to fill in,” says Cadwalader.The root cause of the financial crisis involved losses on risky US mortgages. The entire global financial system was exposed to these mortgages after hundreds of billions of dollars of complex securities linked to them were sold to investors from Illinois to Iceland. Derivatives were the building blocks for those securities.The degree to which derivatives had created a dangerously interconnected financial system became clear amid the collapse of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG in 2008. A default by one bank at the centre of a tangled web of derivatives contracts could paralyse the entire financial system, because the derivatives could become worthless if the bank writing the contract went under.“In the wake of the recent financial crisis, over-the-counter derivatives have been blamed for increasing systemic risk,” said Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff in a paper earlier this year. “OTC derivatives serve a vital role in financial markets but deficiencies in the market design and infrastructure allowed for misuse of these instruments, exacerbating the recent financial meltdown.”Regulators have swept in to restore confidence in markets before. After the crash of 1929, the SEC was set up to police the equity markets and create structures that would reassure investors the cards were not stacked against them. The CFTC, with its roots in commodity markets, has done the same for exchange-traded futures. Now, the regulators will try to do the same for derivatives markets.“The Wall Street reform bill will for the first time bring comprehensive regulation to the over-the-counter derivatives marketplace,” says Gary Gensler, chairman of the CFTC. The new rules will “lower risk, promote transparency and protect the American public”, he adds.Under the new regulations, the derivatives world will be divided in two. On one side will be those products that are widely used, simple in structure and actively traded: standardised derivatives. Those will be pushed on to clearing houses to make the financial system less vulnerable to the default of a big derivatives dealer.Clearing houses can reduce counterparty and systemic risks by standing in the middle of trades – though there of course remains a risk the clearing house itself may fail. The clearing house has a pool of capital and collects collateral and margin – up-front payments against possible losses. If these resources are not enough to cover a default by a member, the others are supposed to cough up.Cleared derivatives will also have to be traded on electronic systems – although exactly how those systems will be defined, and how quickly and frequently price information has to be made public remains to be resolved. Mr Bergmann, who advises investors on derivatives strategies, says public pricing would reduce the chances that buyers – such as municipalities or small pension funds – would overpay. Customers who pay banks too much would soon know if the value is lower than they thought. If the contracts are centrally cleared, they would have to come up with an extra margin to pay the clearing house as soon as the price falls. “Mispricing of derivatives has often not been discovered until it is a disaster,” says Mr Bergmann. “In theory, with widespread clearing people will know about it before it becomes a disaster.”Once regulators determine what part of the OTC derivatives or swaps markets has to be cleared, the remaining part will also be policed. No one knows what proportion will be uncleared, or what the targets are, although for all derivatives the more heavily regulated exchange-traded futures market provides the likely standard. “Look at the way futures have traded on exchanges,” says Viral Acharya, professor of finance at NYU’s Stern business school. “Similar practices, in one way or another, will be applied to OTC derivatives under new regulations. There will be more capital required, less leverage and less opacity.”How regulators decide the clearing houses should hold the collateral against trades, and the extent to which derivatives users can offset positions against each other, will also be key. Banks have built huge internal clearing systems in recent decades, divisions usually called “prime brokerage”. Through these, big institutional investors or hedge funds can buy and sell all kinds of financial instruments – from bonds to credit derivatives to currency swaps to commodity investments – and offset them against one other. If an investor has to pay for each part of the trade – usually called a “leg” – having to hand over cash for each piece could add up. If the positions are offset, the trade can be done much more cheaply.“We still don’t know what kinds of trades will be profitable or which of our customers will have to change their investment strategies,” says the head of prime brokerage at one big bank.These questions about the costs also mean that the risks of the clearing houses and the business model behind them cannot be properly worked out – leaving investors in limbo. “When we use a clearing house, we have to be able to make a case as to why we think they are financially sound,” says the head of trading at one of the biggest institutional investors. “We cannot determine this until we know what the new rules will be.”There is a lot to play for. According to Tabb Group, the biggest derivatives dealers generate revenues of $40bn a year from the OTC business.As the rules are rewritten there will be much behind-the-scenes jostling as current derivatives big-shots – which include all the Wall Street banks – try to hang on to market share and newcomers try to muscle in. “This is a big business opportunity,” says Larry Tabb, chief executive of Tabb Group.The cast of characters embraces not only big banks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank but exchanges such as CME Group, Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext and Intercontinental Exchange, which want clearing business. It also includes smaller banks and brokers that are trying to expand their derivatives business, for instance Nomura and Jefferies, as well as inter-dealer brokers including Icap, and other financial groups that want to get into clearing or trading, from Tradeweb to State Street to tiny start-up brokerage firms.The outcomes will affect investors, banks and companies that use derivatives extensively for hedging. The end result will also depend on what happens in Europe. “A lot of these things won’t work well if one centre applies rules that are not as strict,” says Mr Arachya.With the answers to the questions about the future shape of the derivatives markets now in the hands of staff and commissioners at the regulators, the CFTC’s Mr Gensler says CFTC and SEC teams have already met five or six times since the legislation was passed. A series of public hearings is expected to be held from September onwards.The potential for turf wars is of concern, as is the possibility of disruption to investment and trading activities. “The enormity of the proposed changes could result in both short-term pain for users of swaps and participants in the derivatives markets generally, and long-term unintended and undesirable changes in the marketplace,” say lawyers at Jones Day. “The extent to which the rulemaking process will provide the necessary clarity will depend in part on how well the CFTC and SEC are able to work together in areas of potentially overlapping jurisdictions.”Whatever the case, the coming months will determine what is ultimately discussed in Mr Bergmann’s course about risks and markets. Not for nothing is the biggest section in his course outline entitled: “Derivatives: weapons of mass destruction or weapons of mass protection?”
812;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;HKEx seeks same trading hours as mainland;;Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, the world’s largest exchange by market value, is positioning itself for the anticipated internationalisation of China’s currency and wants to align trading hours with rival exchanges on the mainland, its new chief executive said.“Renminbi-denominated products are the future, there’s no doubt about it,” said Charles Li, who predicted a “tug of war” between market demand for more renminbi investment products and cautious Chinese regulators.Chinese and Hong Kong companies have been allowed to issue renminbi bonds in Hong Kong. Exchange-traded funds linked to China’s A-share markets are traded on HKEx. But the Chinese authorities have not yet authorised the launch of renminbi-denominated products for trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange.Chinese companies account for almost 60 per cent of market capitalisation in Hong Kong, compared with 20 per cent a decade ago, and more than 80 per cent of funds raised by initial public offerings.They can only raise Hong Kong dollars on the local stock exchange and need government approval to remit the proceeds back to China for conversion into renminbi. “At present you can only use the renminbi in China. That is the bottleneck,” said Mr Li. “We are going to work with regulators and policymakers so we can get rid of all these restrictions.”The disclosure came as HKEx reported a 4 per cent year-on-year increase in first-half, pre-tax profit to HK$2.7bn (US$347.6m).It has overtaken CME Group, the US futures exchange and clearing house operator, to become the largest exchange in the world as measured by the market value of its listed shares. HKEx unveiled plans to upgrade its trading system, along with other Asian exchanges, as they gear up to attract the “high-frequency” and algorithmic trading community that makes up a significant portion of trading activity on western exchanges.Mr Li, a former JPMorgan banker, emphasised the need for a longer trading day more aligned with rival exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges currently trade for only four hours each day, with HKEx opening half an hour after its mainland rivals.The Singapore and London stock exchanges operate for more than six and eight hours respectively. HKEx’s board on Wednesday revived a decade-old initiative to lengthen the trading day, defying opposition from local traders wedded to their late start and long lunches.“Our market is no longer an isolated market,” Mr Li argued. “We will be able to align more with markets in China and volumes will increase.

813;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-08-05T08:42:07Z;Johannesburg to list rand copper, silver futures;;The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) on Thursday said it had extended its product licensing agreement with CME Group to list rand-denominated copper and silver futures contracts.The move is another sign of how the Chicago-based CME is using product licensing and “cross-listing” arrangements with other exchanges around the world to expand its product distribution.For the JSE, the move offers South African investors further exposure to the international metals market.Both products would be listed on the JSE’s Commodity Derivatives Market. They would reference benchmark settlement prices from Comex, part of the CME Group that offers trading futures on metals such as gold, silver and copper.Contracts will be priced and settled in rands with smaller contract sizes than standard Comex contracts to make them more accessible to South African investors, the JSE said.Rod Gravelet-Blondin, the JSE’s senior general manager of commodities, said: “The introduction of these foreign-referenced metals contracts forms part of the JSE’s continued drive to bring global markets closer to local traders in a way that is both cost-effective and accessible.”The latest listing follows from the JSE’s introduction of gold, platinum and sweet crude oil futures in October, also under a licensing agreement with CME Group.South African traders will not need to open accounts with international brokers or require local central bank clearance to transfer foreign exchange to meet margin requirements, as all trade takes place locally.
814;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-08-04T18:58:31Z;Trading chief guarding the options corner;;Bill Brodsky is not used to holding his tongue.The fast-talking chief executive of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options-trading platform, is a raconteur with an encyclopedic knowledge of the colourful characters of the financial trading world.But since the CBOE became a public company in June, Mr Brodsky has had to get used to saying less, lest he violate regulations by appearing to make market predictions.It is not a comfortable transition. At points during his interview with the Financial Times, he writhes uncomfortably in his new verbal straitjacket.“There are so many more restrictions on what you can say and when you can speak,” he says. “You also have a level of scrutiny that is much more intense and analytical than before.”Mr Brodsky may be more forthcoming on Thursday, when the CBOE holds its first public conference call after reporting second-quarter earnings.One thing he is not likely to announce is a merger.For years, while the CBOE was attempting to extricate itself from a legal wrangle that held up its flotation, rumour and speculation whirled about that the options exchange would be snapped up by the CME Group, the futures leviathan that sits across the street from the CBOE in downtown Chicago.But in recent months, the consensus has changed. The CME, which acquired the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 and the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) the following year, has said it is not looking at more purchases, while the CBOE has emphasised that it can flourish as an independent company.So is a takeover off the table? “Give us a chance to operate as a public company,” Mr Brodsky says. “I can’t predict the future. But one of the things that’s different between the CBOE and other exchanges is that we don’t need cash and we don’t have to do a deal in the same way that the CBOT and the Nymex had to do because they didn’t have the technology.”The CBOE could do a merger of equals with another exchange or acquire a non-exchange company such as a technology group, he says.Since initially surging after their launch at $29 a share, the CBOE’s shares have dipped, trading on Tuesday morning at $27.19. While most analysts have “neutral” or “hold” recommendations on the stock, Chris Allen of Ticonderoga Securities has it at “sell”. He points to the fierce competition in the US options market and the diminishing likelihood of a takeover.Mr Brodsky says the shares have been pulled down by the general bearishness towards the exchange sector. “Does it bother me? You cannot ignore it. You have to not be a normal person not to look at it. But ultimately the fundamentals will out.”The CBOE’s market share has slipped, in an industry in which eight exchanges jostle for position. It had 29.2 per cent of options trading last month, down from 31.1 per cent in July 2009.Mr Brodsky’s confidence, however, is based on securing quality trades.The CBOE’s proprietary products – principally S&P 500 index options and its Volatility Index – are what set it apart, he says.“The difference between us and all the other options exchanges is we actually create new products,” he says.“No one else is doing that – in spite of all the competition.”The argument is that intellectual property justifies the CBOE’s relatively high valuation.It gives the exchange the ability to give customers large discounts for big volumes that combine commoditised products such as single-stock options with proprietary products.“We have pricing power that others don’t have,” Mr Brodsky says.That power is under threat, however, from a Securities and Exchange Commission proposal to cap equity options trading fees at 30 cents per contract, which would bring the industry in line with the equities market.It is one of many issues that often pulls Mr Brodsky to Washington to talk to regulators on behalf of both the CBOE and the options industry.He supports financial regulatory reform and is effusive in his praise for Mary Schapiro, the SEC chairman. However, Mr Brodsky, who has commented in the past on the lack of financial literacy among junior SEC staffers, is sceptical about the agency’s plans to take on 1,174 new staff, suggesting what it really needs is a fundamental change in management practices.“The government has two things that make it very challenging to manage people,” he says. “First, it’s very hard to fire people for bad performance. Second, you don’t have the same incentives that you have in industry.“I’m very concerned that it isn’t just hiring people that’s the answer and it’s not just paying them better than they might have been paid previously. It’s a question of how these agencies manage themselves. It’s not easy.”www.ft.com/tradingroom

816;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-07-29T18:43:05Z;CME predicts OTC opacity will remain;;The world’s biggest banks will continue to trade over-the-counter derivatives in much the same way as they did before the financial crisis, in spite of the recently enacted legislation on US financial reform, the CME Group said on Thursday.The opacity of OTC derivatives such as credit default swaps – which offer insurance against banks, companies and governments defaulting on debt – was widely blamed for aggravating the financial crisis. An important impetus for financial regulatory reform was to bring transparency to the OTC markets.OTC contracts are deals struck privately between two parties, but the Dodd-Frank Act calls for most to be traded on exchanges or “swap execution facilities” (SEFs).However, Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, noted that the legislation allowed swap-dealers and interdealer brokers to build their own SEFs. This would enable them “to continue the business model and market structure which they’ve historically had. There’ll be some changes to that but it may not be very revolutionary or transformational … they’re going to want to continue doing business in the way they have been”.Mr Donohue made the comments as CME, the world’s biggest futures exchange, reported second-quarter earnings ahead of Wall Street’s average expectations, as traders looked to listed derivatives to protect themselves from volatile market conditions.The results reflected higher trading volumes across all of the company’s product lines, although the amount CME made per contract was down from the same period a year ago.CME earned net income of $271m or $4.11 per share (diluted), up from $222m or $3.33 per share in the same period a year ago.The results included a $20.5m writedown of goodwill in Credit Market Analysis, a wholly owned subsidiary that provides market data for the credit default swap sector. Excluding the CMA writedown, second-quarter diluted EPS would have been $4.43, ahead of the $4.33 per share analysts had been expecting. Revenues of $814m were also above Wall Street’s consensus forecast of about $804m.The company had previously reported its daily trading volume in the second quarter was up 31 per cent from last year to 13.5m contracts, its second-best quarterly average daily volume on record. The total average rate per contract, 79 cents, was 4 per cent lower than the same period last year.CME is focusing on clearing OTC contracts, however they are traded. It offers clearing for CDS contracts and is planning to roll out clearing for OTC interest-rate and foreign exchange contracts. CME shares were up 1.11 per cent at $286.65 by midday in New York.
817;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-07-27T18:57:41Z;Emerging markets lure big exchanges;;You scratch my back, and I’ll scratch yours. That, in essence, describes a new approach being taken by some of the world’s biggest exchanges and their smaller counterparts in emerging markets as both sides seek to expand their businesses.This week Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, and SGX, the Singapore exchange, said they would launch an Asian version of Euro Stoxx 50 index futures and options on futures – one of the German exchange’s flagship products.It is the latest in a flurry of “cross-listing” deals struck in the past few months by Eurex and its main global rival, US-based CME Group, with exchanges in Malaysia, India, South Korea, Mexico and Brazil.At the end of next month Eurex will start trading Kospi 200 options, making trading in the Korean KRX exchange’s main products possible after Asian trading hours.In March, CME and the National Stock Exchange of India signed a cross-listing agreement under which the “Nifty 50”, the Indian benchmark index, will be made available to CME for the listing of dollar-denominated futures contracts on CME.In return, the rights to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average will be made available to India’s NSE for the listing of rupee-denominated futures contracts.Cross-listings are designed to expand distribution of established exchanges’ core products beyond their time zones and to tap into communities of traders in other regions.Exchanges such as CME and Eurex are still heavily dependent on mature home markets and see Asia and Latin America as offering exciting growth prospects.That is because such markets are starting to be used by the same algorithmic and “high-frequency” traders that already trade the CME and Eurex. Such traders are piling in to these regions in search of new assets to trade, in turn prompting exchanges there to upgrade their creaky trading systems.Mexico’s stock exchange group, Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, will soon introduce technological changes aimed at attracting high-frequency traders and repatriating trading that has migrated overseas in recent years. It is no coincidence that CME in March struck a strategic partnership with the Bolsa and its MexDer derivative arm.For the bigger exchanges, cross-listings offer a way to expand distribution without having to set up a separate exchange in emerging market countries, or spending vast sums on marketing.For smaller regional exchanges, being able to piggyback on a larger exchange is a way to tap into a large, established pool of liquidity. In March, CME started offering trading of dollar-denominated crude palm oil futures under a cross-listing with Bursa Malaysia. Since then, the Malaysian bourse has seen a modest spike in its crude palm oil futures volumes.Herbie Skeete, managing director of Mondo Visione, a consultancy, says: “It’s also a good way for regional bourses which lack global reach to attract technical expertise to grow.”For the CME, increased distribution of its core products means generating more transaction fees because trading is done almost on a 24-hour basis. Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, says: “As emerging markets grow they will continue to be an important source of growth for us.”CME has gone further than any other exchange in expanding in this and other ways. It has also signed “order routing” agreements with other exchanges, where CME customers get access to foreign exchanges’ listed products, and vice-versa.Mr Donohue says that, since signing a strategic partnership with Brazil’s BM&F Bovespa exchange, the Brazilian bourse has seen a 4 per cent rise in the average daily volume of its main contract.In some cases, the larger exchanges have gone further, taking stakes in regional exchanges. Under its Brazilian partnership, CME has taken a 5 per cent stake in BM&F Bovespa, while the latter recently raised its 1.8 per cent stake in CME to 5 per cent.Mr Donohue says: “By becoming a strategic partner we are able to market our products and services much more broadly to their customer base.”
818;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-07-26T09:14:34Z;Eurex and SGX in cross-listing deal;;Eurex and SGX, the Singapore exchange, said on Monday they would launch an Asian version of Euro Stoxx 50 index futures and options on futures, highlighting how product cross-listing deals between exchanges in different regions are becoming increasingly popular.The move is the latest in a series of similar alliances involving Eurex, owned by Deutsche Börse, and its US rival CME Group, in Asia. All are designed to expand distribution of exchanges’ core products beyond their time zones and to tap into communities of traders in other regions.SGX will list dollar-denominated Euro Stoxx 50 Index futures and options on futures in the second half, subject to Singapore regulatory approval. SGX and Eurex would jointly market and promote the dollar-based contracts as part of the collaboration efforts between the two exchanges, they said.Chew Sutat, head of corporate and market strategy at SGX, said: “Customers also will have first-mover advantage to react to weekend or overnight European and US market news and manage their European exposures during Asian hours.”Michael Peters, member of the Eurex executive board, said the move would “extend the user base of Europe’s most liquid index derivatives contract”.“This will result in new trading and hedging opportunities globally and should further increase the liquidity of this benchmark product,” he said.The Eurex-SGX partnership is based on a licence agreement between the global index provider Stoxx Limited, owned by Eurex, and SGX.This month Eurex and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) said they would launch futures and options on the Sensex, the BSE’s blue-chip index, on Eurex in October.In a separate deal with between Eurex and KRX, the South Korean exchange, Eurex will at the end of next month start trading Kospi 200 options, making trading in Kospi products possible after Korean trading hours. CME Group will soon provide after-hours trading of Kospi 200 futures on the Chicago-based operator’s Globex electronic trading system.In March CME and the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) signed a cross-listing agreement under which the S&P CNX Nifty Index (the “Nifty 50”), the Indian benchmark index, would be made available to CME for the creation and listing of dollar-denominated futures contracts for trading on CME, while the rights to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average would also be made available to NSE for the listing of rupee-denominated futures contracts for trading on NSE
819;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-07-14T21:29:21Z;CME against stricter rules for high-speed traders;;CME Group warned on Wednesday against stricter rules for the rapid-fire computerised traders fuelling volume at the company’s derivatives exchanges.The company’s chief operating officer, Bryan Durkin, said high-speed traders improve the way futures markets function and urged the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to study their role before saddling them with regulations.“We believe that careful consideration should be given to any decision to impose restrictions or limitations on algorithmic and high-frequency trading that would be harmful to the marketplace and result in less efficient and less liquid markets,” Mr Durkin said in a written statement submitted as a CFTC technology committee convened for the first time since the May 6 “flash crash” unsettled investors.High-frequency trading has exploded as futures markets shift away from crowded trading pits to electronic screens. In the first quarter of 2010 nearly half CME’s volume came from proprietary trading firms, many of which use computers to dart in and out of markets in microseconds.About a quarter of major global futures volume comes from professional high-frequency traders, and the share is expected to increase, according to Aite Group. CME revenue depends heavily on trading volume.CME’s venues include the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange. Mr Durkin said high-speed traders have added volume and liquidity to these markets, resulting in narrower spreads and more transparent prices.CFTC staff are reviewing the roles of rapid electronic traders when US equity and stock-index futures markets plunged in minutes on May 6. Mr Durkin said there was no evidence that high-frequency firms made markets more volatile on the date. “Most continued to provide liquidity in the futures markets during extreme market conditions,” he said.At a committee meeting CFTC regulators acknowledged being behind the curve as computerised trading firms replaced floor-based market makers.Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, said: “While market participants have the technology to automate trading, we’re really just now moving towards 21st century technology to have automated surveillance looking at trade practices”.Scott O’Malia, who leads the CFTC’s technology advisory committee, also raised concerns about high-frequency firms executing “wash sales,” prohibited trades that do not change one’s market position. He called them a “totally unacceptable practice”.But Leslie Sutphen, a managing director at futures broker Newedge Group and board member of the Futures Industry Association’s information technology division, said in some cases traders running multiple algorithms make unintentional wash trades that are impossible to prevent.“There are instances that come up where a firm ends up trading with itself,” she said.
820;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-07-13T19:34:19Z;Chicago traders launch new derivatives exchange;;Five Chicago-based trading firms have joined forces with CME Group, the US futures exchange, to launch a new exchange that will offer trading in interest rate swap derivatives closely modelled on current over-the-counter (OTC) rate swaps, people familiar with the matter said.The new venture, called Eris Exchange, is designed to take advantage of the rapidly shifting competitive landscape in trading and clearing of derivatives amid sweeping financial regulatory reform of such markets.It is an attempt by Chicago, which pioneered exchange-traded financial derivatives in the 1970s, to seize the initiative from Wall Street dealers which are set to lose control of OTC derivatives trading under legislation that is being finalised in the US Congress.The legislation forces trading of swathes of OTC derivatives onto exchanges and “swap execution facilities” to boost transparency, and required that as many as possible be processed through clearing houses to reduce counterparty risk.The five firms are Getco, DRW Trading, Infinium Capital Management, Chicago Trading Company and Nico Trading. All are engaged in market-making in either equities and options and bonds. Some are the biggest names in so-called “high-frequency” trading, a form of rapid, computerised trading that has made inroads into derivatives as well as equities.Eris will offer trading in interest rate swaps that will designed as futures contracts, rather than as OTC interest rate swaps that are commonly traded between dealers and sold to end-users such as companies, asset managers and hedge funds. However one person said they would be “economically equivalent to OTC interest rate swaps”.In Greek mythology, Eris is the god of strife and discord. The name has been chosen to signal the reaction that Chicago anticipates from Wall Street dealers.The new product would be subject to the same rules that apply to traditional futures contracts, rather than rules contained in the legislation setting out how OTC derivatives will be traded on exchanges and “swap execution facilities”.“People can trade something that is called a swap pursuant to the new rules and regulations or they can trade something that’s economically equivalent,” the person said.The products will be cleared on CME’s clearing house, with the futures configuration allowing the instruments to be “cross-margined” with similar CME products, such as its flagship exchange-traded eurodollar interest rate futures contract.Cross-margining is a financial arrangement allowing market participants to save on the overall amount of money they need to post for clearing by using a smaller lump sum for multiple asset classes. Usually margin must be posted for each type of instrument traded.
821;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Lumber;Good for builders, but a creaking sound from the US economy;Timber! That crashing sound is the price of lumber falling through the floorboards as US housebuilding activity contracts to the lowest level since 1963. Framing lumber prices per 1,000 board feet have dropped from $335 in late April to as little as $182 recently on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the lowest prices since last autumn. This week a small rebound faltered as prices again tumbled, and it may get worse. Builders typically purchase lumber about two months after work begins on a new home and starts have sputtered since April 30 when an $8,000 homebuyer tax credit expired.It is not all bad news for builders, though, and encouraging for buyers who missed the deadline. The price drop of the past two months would shave about $4,000, or 2 per cent, off the cost of a typical new home of 2,400 sq ft, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Lower construction costs, in combination with the drop in bond yields since April and the ensuing half-century low in 30-year mortgage rates, more than make up for the loss of the tax credit. The 60 basis point drop in rates for a $150,000 loan would save a buyer $20,000, or $670 yearly.But these are merely silver linings in a fairly dark cloud. As with steel, electricity and cement, lumber demand is an important coincident economic indicator and suggests a slowdown. Lumber prices may stabilise this summer because of entirely industry-specific factors – the NAHB says low prices should trigger import duties on Canadian softwood by August, while new home inventories at 40-year lows should spur some uptick in demand soon. But a lasting residential construction recovery will have to wait for the large overhang of foreclosed homes to be whittled down, and that will take a while.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
822;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-07-07T13:58:25Z;BNY Mellon to become clearing member of IDCG;;Bank of New York Mellon said on Wednesday that it will become a clearing member of the International Derivatives Clearing Group (IDCG), which is focused on interest rate swaps, the largest sector of the over-the-counter derivatives market.The move comes at a time when the battleground for clearing derivatives is heating up as the pending US financial reform bill mandates that standardised swaps, such as those for interest rates, be cleared by a central counterparty, or CCP, which is designed to lower systemic risk.“With the rapid changes occurring in the clearing and settlement process for derivatives, our clients want a capable, stable partner that has membership in clearing organizations like IDCG to support their growing and evolving trading needs,” said Sanjay Kannambadi, chief executive officer of BNY Mellon Clearing.To date, IDCG has only shadow cleared swaps, and traders say it needs to attract support from established dealers in order to gain critical mass.Garry O’Connor, chief executive officer of IDCG, said: “The ascension of clearing members from the banking community is an important step forward for IDCG, and demonstrates the market’s broader movement towards our clearing solution.”IDCG is seeking to clear and settle swaps by converting them into economically equivalent futures contracts and has attracted the support of NewEdge and MF Global, two leading non-bank futures commission merchants or FCMs.IDCG is majority-owned by Nasdaq OMX and BNY Mellon holds a minority stake in the clearer.The main CCPs of interest rate derivatives are LCH.Clearnet, the CME, IDCG, Eurex in Germany and Brazil’s Bovespa.Seperately, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said on Wednesday that the cumulative gross notional value cleared by its credit default swap clearing houses surpassed $10,000bn during the week ending July 2.In the US, ICE said it had cleared $6,000bn of CDS indices (CDX) and $272bn in single-name CDS, resulting in open interest of $435 bn. ICE Clear Europe cleared €2,400bn in iTraxx indices and €379bn in single-name CDS, resulting in €371bn of open interest.

It remains unclear how ambitious the bank’s ambitions for OTC clearing are. Some executives said it appeared to be concentrating on commodity trades, while others said it was also looking at financial derivatives.However, several executives said MAS had approached a number of international clearing houses, including the US-based group IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), which has Asia ambitions.Other big international clearers such as LCH.Clearnet of the UK, the world’s largest clearer of OTC interest rate swaps, and Chicago-based CME Group may be approached as the plan progresses.Any new clearing operation would compete with two existing exchange and clearing operations run by SGX, the Singapore exchange, and Singapore Mercantile Exchange (SMX), owned by India’s Financial Technologies group, which has been licensed and is due to launch shortly.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, ensuring that deals are completed even of one party defaults. They have become central to the G20 financial reforms, versions of which the US and European Union are implementing separately.Industry experts say that any sign that the US and Europe may be unable to harmonise their approach to such reforms is likely to give Asian countries an opportunity to attract business unhappy with rules that emerge in the west. London and New York, which are home to the bulk of OTC derivatives trading and clearing, could lose out as a result.US and European concerns about potential clearing problems with OTC trades have been endorsed by most countries in Asia with significant financial sectors. Japan, India, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea and Taiwan have all created task forces to study setting up clearing operations for the opaque OTC markets.While Asia constitutes a small part of the global OTC markets – in which notional outstanding volumes total $600,000bn, according to the Bank for International Settlements – trading volumes are rising fast and most dealers have established footholds across in the region.None of the parties said to be involved in the talks would comment.

825;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-06-21T17:20:34Z;CME in move on iron ore swaps;;CME Group , the world’s largest derivatives exchange, has announced the launch of trading and clearing services for iron ore swaps, in a further sign of the rapid shift from traditional annual negotiations to spot pricing.The CME on Monday joined the Singapore Exchange, LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearing house, and Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange in the race to develop the iron ore derivatives market, which analysts expect will top $200bn by 2020. Today, the value of iron ore swaps hovers at $300m.The London Metal Exchange, the world’s largest base metals marketplace, has so far not launched any initiative on iron ore, although it has listed steel derivatives.The CME’s new trading and clearing service will be based on the benchmark Australian iron ore – with a 62 per cent ore content – delivered into China, as reported by The Steel Index. The contract will be 500 tonnes in size.“The ferrous industry is the second-largest commodity market by volume after crude oil,” said Joe Raia, CME managing director of energy and metals.This year, the global mining and steel industry ditched the 40-year-old benchmark system of annual contracts and lengthy price negotiations, replacing it with quarterly contracts linked to the spot market.The new pricing system could encourage companies to hedge. In particular, small iron ore miners are likely to use derivatives to lock in sale prices, while some steelmakers could hedge their input costs.As the importance of the spot physical market has grown, derivatives emerged, with Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse launching the first iron ore swaps in 2008.Since then, other banks have joined in, including Morgan Stanley, the commodities heavyweight, and brokers such as London Dry Bulk, Freight Investor Services and Icap.
826;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CBOE raises $339m in market debut;;Shares in the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options trading venue, soared on its market debut on Tuesday after being priced at the top end of the range.The CBOE raised $339m selling 11.7m shares at $29 each – compared to its previous guidance of a range of $27-$29 – valuing the exchange at $2.97bn. By the close the stock was up 12 per cent at $32.49.The initial public offering has been widely watched as a gauge of the appetite for flotations and a guide to current exchange valuations.Chris Brendler, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said other US exchange groups with equity options divisions – such as NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq – could benefit from the CBOE’s implied valuation, which represents a multiple of about 28 times its 2009 earnings per share.Jon Najarian, a CBOE member who runs Option-Monster, the trading consultancy, said: “The pricing coming in at the high end of the range was a good sign.” Mr Najarian said that in the longer term “the real catalyst for upside is financial reform, which could easily boost revenue if they get the multi-trillion dollar over-the-counter products on to exchanges”.He added: “Given the CBOE’s intellectual property as well as technological edge I think they could win a majority of that business, which would make them a takeover target.”The CME Group, NYSE Euronext and Intercontinental Exchange have been mentioned as possible acquirers.Bringing the CBOE to market is a personal triumph for Bill Brodsky, chief executive.The IPO was held up for several years due to a legal wrangle with members of the former Chicago Board of Trade, the futures exchange from which the CBOE was originally spun off in 1973 and which was bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2008.Some CBOT members retained trading rights in the CBOE that they claimed entitled them to a share of the CBOE upon demutualisation. The issue was finally settled in a $4.2m deal last year.
827;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Derivatives dealers clash over clearing access;;Small banks and brokers have told regulators that big derivatives dealers are blocking their access to clearing of over-the-counter derivatives, limiting the scope for new entrants into the derivatives market.In a letter sent to the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a group of 20 brokers that includes Jefferies and Newedge said the rules at clearing houses like Intercontinental Exchange and CME Group meant big dealers were able to determine who got access.“Rules and workflows at the clearing houses currently are working to restrict access to only the incumbent dealers,” the letter from the Swaps and Derivatives Market Association said.The brokers’ concerns add to the debate about derivatives clearing as new laws are close to being passed in the US, laws which will require that many of the over $600,000bn of over-the-counter derivatives contracts traded on a one-on-one basis with big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs be cleared and traded on electronic platforms.Already, regulators including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have pushed dealers and clearing houses to make more efforts to allow investors such as Pimco or BlackRock as well as large hedge funds direct access to clearing and remove the dominance of dealers as counterparties in the derivatives markets.Now, the calls for more access from brokers who do not yet trade derivatives due to their private nature, but will once these contracts are cleared, are likely to add further pressure on the current dealers that dominate the market. Regulators could be given powers to mandate that some widely used derivatives like interest rate swaps must be cleared.Derivatives dealers have agreed to give regulators more information about over-the-counter derivatives trades in the credit, interest rate and equity markets and have agreed to shift more trades towards central clearing.Extending clearing to large dealers as well as big investors is widely regarded as an important step toward reducing derivatives risks, but in practice it is complex to implement.“Remaining impediments to the expansion of buy-side access to clearing include legal and regulatory, risk management and operational issues,” said a group of large derivatives dealers and investors in a recent letter to the Fed. They said “a meaningful amount of open interest in buy-side transactions will be cleared”.
828;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
829;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:55:59+0000;LSE signals Europe derivatives foray;;The London Stock Exchange on Tuesday signalled a frontal assault on Europe’s two largest derivatives exchanges – Eurex and NYSE Liffe – saying it planned to build a pan-European derivatives business within nine months.The move underscores the UK bourse’s ambitions to enter the derivatives business at a time when most of its global peers have long had such businesses.Derivatives trading is a higher-margin business than cash equities trading, yet the LSE has relied on UK cash equities, a business that has come under threat from alternative platforms such as Chi-X Europe. Derivatives provide the LSE with 3 per cent of its revenues, with cash equities providing 16 per cent.The move also shows that the LSE intends to shake up a long-standing “gentleman’s agreement” between Europe’s exchanges that they do not compete on each other’s turf.Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, said the group would launch equity derivatives on a new trading system provided by TMX Group, the Canadian exchange operator.“Our ambition is to become a pan-European derivatives exchange within the next nine months,” Mr Rolet told the annual IDX derivatives exchanges conference in London.It was the first time that a chief executive of the LSE had addressed the conference, attended by Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, NYSE Liffe, the derivatives unit of NYSE Euronext, and CME Group, the largest US derivatives exchange.Eurex dominates trading in derivatives on indices such as the Euro Stoxx 50, Dax and SMI Swiss index, as well as German and eurozone equity options on single stocks. NYSE Liffe dominates the market for UK equity options and options on stocks offered on the Euronext markets.Mr Rolet declined to specify what product the LSE would launch. But, framing the plan as a “David versus Goliath fight” with much larger rivals, he said the new trading system would allow the fastest trading in equity options in Europe.There would also be “cross-margining” between equities and derivatives, a system that allows market participants to save on the overall amount of money they need to post for clearing.However, the plan was immediately ridiculed by NYSE Liffe, whose global head of derivatives, Garry Jones, questioned whether Mr Rolet had assessed the market sufficiently. “The LSE has a lot to be modest about,” Mr Jones said.LSE shares closed down 2.1 per cent at 598.6p.
830;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-06-08T11:48:29Z;CME and Dow Jones unveil new dollar index;;CME Group, the world’s biggest listed futures exchange, and Dow Jones Indexes, the index provider, announced the launch of a new FX dollar index on Tuesday.The Dow Jones CME FX$INDEX will serve as the basis of a new futures contract, which is expected to be launched in the third quarter of 2010.The index represents a basket of the six most frequently traded CME currency futures – the Australian dollar, sterling, the Canadian dollar, the euro, the Swiss franc and the yen – all traded against the dollar.“Market participants have long shown an interest in trading a basket of currencies against the dollar as a means of managing their risk,” said Derek Sammann, managing director of FX and interest rate products at CME Group.He said the new contract would provide an easier way for customers to lay off global currency risk with a single index.“Additionally, portfolio managers can dynamically hedge their positions against the index using the six most liquid currency contracts traded at CME.”
831;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;LCH.Clearnet to offer US solution for swaps clients;;LCH.Clearnet plans to offer prospective US-based clients of its over-the-counter derivatives clearing service the ability to access the service in America using a separate US legal structure aimed at offering them US protection in the event of bankruptcy.The US move appears designed to address concerns among some in the derivatives industry in the US that there may be disadvantages for US-based businesses to clear OTC interest rate swaps though a clearing house in the UK.That would put LCH.Clearnet at a disadvantage to US rivals when all are battling for a slice of the multi-billion dollar OTC interest rate swaps business that is anticipated to come from end-users of such derivatives, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big US mortgage lenders.This new business is expected amid a push by regulators to force as many OTC derivatives as possible into clearing houses to help safeguard the financial system against the potentially catastrophic effects of another Lehman-style default. A clearing house takes on the risk that a party to a trade defaults, spreading the risk among its members.LCH.Clearnet’s rivals are International Derivatives Clearing Corporation (IDCG), controlled by Nasdaq OMX, and CME Group. They all want a part of this new so-called “client clearing” business. Fannie and Freddie are each so big in interest rate swaps that IDCG has said they will be “ anybody’s biggest customer”.LCH.Clearnet has approached the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) about allowing US-based users of interest rate swaps the possibility of accessing LCH.Clearnet’s London-based SwapClear rates clearing facility through a “futures commission merchant” (FCM), or futures broker, in the US.Currently, any US-based user of such OTC derivatives would have to access SwapClear through a so-called clearing member, governed by UK law. That clearing member can be in any of seven jurisdictions approved by the Financial Services Authority.The regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac recently expressed concern over how defaults would be handled under UK law.That cast some doubt over LCH.Clearnet’s ability to attract much of the so-called “client” interest rate swap clearing business – as opposed to dealer-to-dealer interest rate swaps clearing, of which LCH.Clearnet already handles over 60 per cent through its London-based SwapClear unit.However Iona Levine, LCH.Clearnet chief counsel, said the new FCM arrangement would give clients access to SwapClear with the added protection of coming under US bankruptcy law. “We will hold all their collateral offshore in the US,” she told the FT.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, said the clearer planned to service US customers “predominantly from our US office”.While LCH.Clearnet has a full US clearing licence, it does not have a clearing house with fully paid-up clearing members. It has many US-based customers who are already members of its London-based operation.“What it [the proposed new arrangement] means, assuming it …gets the approvals, is that they [end-users] would get the same treatment that exists today for US customers of overseas exchanges who are operating under the same regime, which means that their margins are not part of the UK bankruptcy process and are instead handled under the US bankruptcy code.”“We’re keen to make sure that the clients in each region get the best protection that they can get under their local regime.”Asked how confident he was about attracting US-based interest rate swaps business, Mr Liddell said: “We are determined to compete aggressively. We know that we have people who are keen to compete with us and that’s not an unhealthy situation.”Separately, LCH.Clearnet revealed that its fledgling Paris-based credit default swaps business had cleared €12.3bn ($15.1bn) in notional value since launch in March.
832;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-05-28T00:48:22Z;CBOE sets IPO price;;The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options trading venue, said on Thursday that it will sell shares at a price between $27 and $29 in an initial public offering next month that is expected to raise up to $$339m and values the exchange at $2.87bn.The financial industry has long waited for the CBOE, the US’s last big member-owned exchange, to move forward with a demutualisation plan it first outlined in 2006. “We represent scarcity,” Mr Brodsky told the Financial Times in an interview last year.“There isn’t another exchange out there like CBOE that would be ready to come to market.”The CBOE is hoping that scarcity will buoy the offering in spite of the turbulent atmosphere on Wall Street.The CBOE’s flotation has been seen as an important guide to current exchange valuations. While many in the industry expect that the CBOE will ultimately be bought by a bigger group, the IPO allows the options exchange to secure a market valuation first.The CBOE expects 11.7m shares to be sold in the offering, 9.6m by the exchange, with the rest offered by exchange members.The IPO was held up for several years due to a cross-town legal wrangle with members of the former Chicago Board of Trade, the futures exchange from which the CBOE was originally spun off in 1973 and which was bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2008.Some CBOT members retained trading rights in the CBOE, which they claimed entitled them to a share of the CBOE upon demutualisation. The CBOE argued that the merger effectively eliminated the CBOT members’ eligibility to the exercise rights. The issue dragged on for several years, but was finally settled in a $4.2m deal last year.
833;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-05-20T15:51:39Z;Agri swaps face prospect of central clearing;;Agricultural swaps, largely ignored in the over-the-counter derivatives debate, could be sent to clearing houses in greater numbers under a plan floated by the US commodity regulator.The push by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission comes as Congress finalises legislation that would require most standard derivatives to be cleared in hopes of preventing the kinds of derivatives risks that forced the taxpayer bail-out of insurer AIG.The proposed legislation will not alter the rules for agricultural swaps, so Gary Gensler, chairman of the CFTC, is looking to conduct his own independent review of clearing rules for agri swaps and pave the way for greater clearing of these derivatives.In a speech last week, Mr Gensler proposed to “generally allow” agricultural swaps to be cleared, or processed and guaranteed by an exchange clearing house. At the moment, the commission authorises each new swap individually in a process that can take a year or even longer. CME Group started clearing corn, wheat and soyabeans swaps in April 2009, but is still awaiting CFTC approval on swaps tracking live cattle, lean hogs and other types of risks in grain markets. Fewer than 20,000 contracts have been cleared since this date.IntercontinentalExchange is approved to clear swaps based on sugar, coffee and cocoa, but volume has likewise been light.Clearing OTC commodity contracts gained momentum after the 2001 failure of Enron, which left energy traders exposed to a bankrupt counterparty. The 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy accelerated the clearing of private oil swap deals.At $2,944bn in notional value, OTC commodities are a fraction of broader derivatives markets and were not central to the global financial crisis. But worries about the risk of a counterparty default has stirred some interest in clearing. This year CME cleared commodity index swaps at the request of UBS, the investment bank.
834;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-05-17T10:01:21Z;CME changes plans on OTC clearing in Europe;;CME Group, the Chicago-based exchange and clearing house operator, has changed tack on its plans for launching over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearing in Europe, deciding to start with a new OTC energy derivatives initiative instead of credit default swaps as it had originally hoped.The move is a setback for CME Group’s efforts to crack CDS clearing at a time when its US rival, IntercontinentalExchange, has come to dominate CDS clearing on both sides of the Atlantic.It also highlights the difficulty some operators of clearing houses are having persuading dealers to sign up to industry initiatives.Eurex Clearing has all but given up on its planned credit default swaps (CDS) clearing service after a lukewarm response from key dealer banks after months of work.CME has applied to UK authorities to extend the scope of its planned London-based clearing business to over-the-counter (OTC) energy derivatives.Asked why CME had made the move, Jeremy Hughes, CME spokesman in Europe, said: “Following discussions with our European customers, we have augmented our FSA-regulated clearing house application to include energy products. Going forward, the service intends to include other asset types, including CDS.”It has yet to receive a UK clearing licence form the Financial Services Authority for the London clearer, after starting discussions on the plan with the UK watchdog in mid-2009.In a notice from the Office of Fair Trading, CME Clearing Europe said it had “now changed the type of contract it initially intends to clear” and was providing another opportunity for market participants to comment, in addition to an existing public comment opportunity still open on its pending UK clearing licence application.CME said: “It had originally been envisaged that [CME Europe’s] first activity would be to provide clearing services for OTC trading of CDSs. CME has now revised its plans and proposes to offer clearing services for OTC energy products in the first instance. It intends to introduce clearing services for CDSs at a later stage.”The only other existing CDS clearing service in Europe was launched in March by LCH.Clearnet SA, the Paris arm of LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearer.
835;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-05-14T19:49:48Z;Waddell & Reed denies role in market crash;;An investment firm that was a heavy seller of stock market futures during the sudden market plunge last week, said on Friday that it was a “‘bona fide hedger’ and not someone intending to disrupt the markets”.In a statement, Waddell & Reed Financial, a Kansas-based mutual fund company founded in 1937, said: “On May 6, as on many trading days, Waddell & Reed executed several trading strategies, including index futures contracts, as part of the normal operation of our flexible portfolio funds.”Since last Thursday, when the S&P 500 index plunged nearly 5 per cent over a 20-minute period in the late afternoon, regulators and exchanges have been scrutinising trading activity in the hopes of understanding how it occurred.Reuters on Friday earlier reported that documents identified the firm as the mystery market participant described by Gary Gensler, Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, in his testimony before the House Financial Services subcommittee on Tuesday.Mr Gensler said in testimony that his agency had identified unusual activity in E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the moments before the market’s sudden plunge. He pointed to one trade, at 2:32pm, consisting only of selling, that constituted 9 per cent of the contract’s volume.“The trader sold on the way down and continued to do so even as the price level recovered,” Mr Gensler said. He also said that some 250 market participants were trading the E-mini contract at that time, which Waddell noted.Waddell & Reed in its statement did not specifically state whether it made the trade in question. The company also noted that it had previously made trades of a similar size.“We use futures trading as part of this strategy, broadly known as hedging. This is a long-standing and well monitored practice in certain of our investment portfolios,” the firm said.Mutual funds are traditionally long-only buyers of equities and use futures to protect their portfolio from sharp falls in the overall index. The S&P 500 was down 4 per cent on May 6 and then subsequently fell 4.6 per cent over an eight-minute period before it recovered much of that drop.In testimony, both Mr Gensler and Mary Schapiro, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that the causes of the plunge were many, likely rooted in market structure issues rather than the actions of single trader or computer error.“CME noted that they identified no trading activity that contributed to the break in the equity market during this period. Like many market participants, Waddell & Reed was affected negatively by the market activity of May 6,” the company said.The CME refused to comment on customer activity, but a spokesperson noted that its own data “show the account referred to by Chairman Gensler sold more during the market recovery than in the market decline”, indicating that it does not believe the Waddell & Reed trades accounted for the market’s sudden drop.
836;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-05-12T21:38:29Z;Mexican exchange launches interest rate swaps;;The Mexican Derivatives Exchange on Wednesday began to offer exchange-traded and cleared interest-rate swaps for the first time in an attempt to capture part of a market estimated at billions of dollars a day.The new product comes as regulators around the world are looking at ways to move trades carried out in the so-called over-the-counter (OTC) market onto exchanges as part of efforts to give financial markets more transparency.For years, European exchanges have offered clearing-house facilities for interest-rate swaps but MexDer, as the Mexican derivatives market is called, is understood to be one of the first to offer participants exchange-traded swaps as well.“This is the whole enchilada,” Jorge Alegría, MexDer’s chief executive officer, told the FT on Wednesday.During the first day’s trading, the two-year swap for Mexico’s interbank interest rate, known as TIIE, closed at 6.17 per cent, while the 10-year TIIE swap closed at 7.7 per cent. There were a total of 360 contracts with a value to 360m pesos.Mr Alegría expressed confidence that that figure would rise to the equivalent of $500m a day, roughly 20 per cent of the current OTC market, as the more organised and transparent environment would lure an increasing number of participants.He added that the product would be available directly to clients of CME Group, the world’s leading derivatives marketplace, as of the first quarter of next year when a recent order-routing agreement between the two companies becomes operational.Mr Alegría said that one of the advantages of the new product was to provide participants with a more organised environment than the OTC market, in which they trade directly with each other, taking on significant counter-party risk in the process. “By carrying out the transaction through MexDer, you virtually eliminate that counter-party risk,” he said.A second advantage was to create a more efficient price discovery, which refers to the way two parties determine the price of a trade. “You have, at the same time, on a screen and in a centralised order book, more participants bidding and asking,” said Mr Alegría. “That makes the price formation much more complete.”He said that average commission costs would be one-quarter of a basis point, in line with what participants typically pay brokers in an OTC trade. “It’s cost-efficient,” said Mr Alegría.
837;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-05-11T23:30:31Z;Exemption sought to OTC derivatives rules;;Large US industrial and manufacturing groups have intensified their campaign to ensure they will be exempt from proposed rules to reform the over-the-counter derivatives market. They say the draft legislation does not ensure that they will be allowed to continue using the contracts to hedge against interest-rate and currency fluctuations.OTC derivatives have been blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis, and reforming the market is central to regulatory reforms being considered by the Senate. US lawmakers and regulators want most OTC deals – in which two parties privately agree a customised contract – to be traded and cleared centrally.But debate has intensified over who will be exempt from requirements to process OTC contracts through a clearing house, which would entail posting cash margins on every trade.“The fiercest part of the debate is over where exactly the line is drawn on exemptions,” Terry Duffy, chairman of the CME Group, the world’s biggest listed futures exchange, told the Financial Times.David Hall of Chatham Financial, the interest rate and foreign-exchange risk management advisers, said: “If you don’t get the exemption, you’re going to be forced to abide by all the most stringent clearing margin and trading provisions,”Although the bill on the Senate floor includes an exemption for industrial hedgers, the Coalition for Derivatives End-Users – a lobbying group that includes industry bodies such as the National Association of Manufacturers, the US Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute – warned on Tuesday that its members could still find themselves unable to qualify for the exemption.In a letter to senators, the coalition said under the current proposal, “many end-users of derivatives would be forced to divert precious working capital away from productive use to margin accounts, move their hedging practices overseas, or forgo hedging altogether – leaving them exposed to the volatility and price uncertainty that OTC derivatives have so effectively mitigated.”Dorothy Coleman of the NAM said that under the current version of the financial reform bill, the financing arms of big manufacturers, such as Boeing Capital Corporation or Caterpillar’s CAT Financial, were not eligible for the end-user exemption.Ms Coleman added that the current definition of “swap dealers”, who would not qualify for an exemption, was far too loose. “For example, it includes companies that regularly engage in the purchase and sale of swaps in the ordinary course of business. That causes a lot of concern – this is pretty broad.”The NAM also fears that regulators will raise capital and margin requirements on OTC derivatives.
838;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-05-11T23:27:24Z;NYSE Euronext to set up new clearing houses;;The battle between global exchanges enters a new phase on Tuesday as NYSE Euronext, the US-based operator, unveils an ambitious plan to push into equities and derivatives clearing in London and Paris.It said it would set up a cash equities clearing house in the French capital and sever ties that its derivatives exchange, NYSE Liffe, has with LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house.It would then operate a standalone clearer in the UK for listed interest rate, commodities and foreign exchange products. The move is likely to put pressure on the London Stock Exchange to follow suit by building a fully integrated clearing house in the UK.It is also a sign that a trend towards direct exchange control of a clearing houses – in a so-called “vertical silo” model – is intensifying as the lucrative business of clearing becomes an increasingly important part of market reforms in the wake of the financial crisis.A clearing house acts as buyer to every seller, and seller to every buyer in a transaction, stepping in to complete a trade if one party defaults. Market participants expect a new wave of business to shift to exchanges and clearing houses as a result of financial reforms designed to safeguard and boost the transparency of the opaque over-the-counter derivatives markets.Ownership of a clearing house has helped seal a dominant position in US futures markets by CME Group, the Chicago-based operator, and in European derivatives by Germany’s Deutsche Börse.NYSE Euronext already operates Liffe Clear, a London-based clearer of futures contracts traded on NYSE Liffe, the former London International Financial Futures Exchange. It outsources some functions to LCH.Clearnet.However, Garry Jones, global head of derivatives at NYSE Euronext, said contractual arrangements with LCH.Clearnet’s London and Paris units would cease and the group would start clearing its European securities and derivatives business independently in late 2012. Liffe Clear, launched last year, would become a standalone clearer, while the group would build its Paris clearer from scratch.The project would cost the group $60m until the end of that year, but NYSE Euronext estimated it would earn $100m in clearing revenues annually from 2013.Mr Jones said the move “allows us to invest in our clearing infrastructure technology, [and] make a return from that”. It would also allow NYSE Euronext “to look at [clearing] other markets like OTC [derivatives]”. Mr Jones said the group would “not rule out clearing for other people” as well.He added the move would unify the group’s clearing business on to one system, complementing a single global trading system that NYSE Euronext has been rolling out across its equities, options and futures markets.The LSE has a UK-licensed, Italy-based clearing house through its acquisition of Borsa Italiana. But it is unlikely to be large enough to be used as part of the LSE’s plans to build derivatives business, as well as a pan-European cash equities platform, based partly on its recent acquisition of Turquoise, a trading system formerly owned by banks.NYSE Euronext’s move will also be a blow to LCH.Clearnet, since NYSE Liffe and the Euronext cash equities markets were two of its biggest clients. LCH.Clearnet retains the LSE, the London Metal Exchange and others.The US-based operator said it that while the building of the two clearing houses would progress, NYSE Euronext was “open to discussions on any potential restructuring of LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd, and/or its subsidiary companies”.“Should any such discussions lead to a firm conclusion that such a restructuring route, in respect of clearing activities in London and/or Paris, could offer greater benefit to NYSE Euronext’s customers and shareholders than continuing de novo construction, this matter would be thoroughly reviewed by NYSE Euronext’s board and further announcements made as appropriate,” NYSE Euronext said.LCH.Clearnet chief executive Roger Liddell said in a statement: “We have enjoyed a long relationship with NYSE Euronext and are looking forward to continuing to work with them until the contracts end.“This is an important and exciting time for clearing with regulators and policymakers globally looking to clearing to reduce systemic risk. LCH.Clearnet is well placed to benefit from this. We shall seek to continue to diversify our revenues as we develop new exchange and OTC initiatives.”

Market participants say the implementation of an industry-wide circuit breaker designed to temporarily halt trading in a stock should its price deviate sharply from its last trading level, may be difficult across the fragmented US market.There are also questions about how private trading networks at banks and dark pools will operate under such curbs.Those participants say the SEC might also elect to allow an exchange where the company is specifically listed – for example, the NYSE or Nasdaq – to implement circuit breakers that the rest of the market will have to abide by.The SEC has been conducting a broad review of the equity market structure since January and said that last week’s turmoil “is inconsistent with the effective functioning of our capital markets and we will make whatever structural or other changes are needed.”Under the SEC’s directives for boosting competition and lowering commissions in recent years, equity trading in the US has fragmented across different venues and become highly automated raising concerns about the kind of plunge witnessed last week.An official at one exchange says the challenge will be for the industry to reach consensus on such matters as competition between them, other private networks and dark pools is intense.Among those testifying at Tuesday’s House hearing are: Mary Schapiro, chairman of the SEC accompanied by Robert Cook, director, division of trading and markets; Gary Gensler, chairman of CFTC; Lawrence Leibowitz, chief operating officer of NYSE Euronext; Eric Noll, executive vice president at Nasdaq; and Terrence Duffy, executive chairman, CME Group.Congressman Paul Kanjorski, chairman of the committe said on Monday that the hearing will “thoroughly examine this situation in a public forum to maintain the integrity of the markets and promote investor confidence”."
840;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-05-05T21:59:31Z;Former CFTC officials form derivatives consultancy;;"Three former officials at the US futures regulator have formed a derivatives consultancy in Washington DC, highlighting a growing need for trading firms, hedge funds and others to understand the effect of sweeping changes to derivatives legislation.James Newsome, former chairman the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Scott Parsons, his former chief of staff, have formed a practice called Delta Strategy Group. Graham Harper, formerly of the CFTC’s legislative affairs office, is an employee of the firm.Mr Parsons has run his own consultancy for the last four years, known as Parsons Strategies. Its clients, according to public lobbying disclosures, include MF Global, the futures broker; Florida Power & Light; Trading Technologies, a privately-held Chicago-based trading software company; and CME Group, owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and one of the biggest financial services lobbyists on Capitol Hill.The over-the-counter derivatives and on-exchange futures and options industry is braced for massive change as legislation makes its way through Congress aimed at reforming the sector in the wake of the financial crisis.That is expected to force far greater use of clearing in OTC derivatives, as well as resulting in more trading of such instruments on exchanges and other electronic trading platforms – moves affecting banks, brokers, hedge funds, clearing houses, as well as financial and non-financial users of OTC derivatives.Mr Newsome said: “There’s never been a greater need for Congress to understand derivatives than today. The flip side of that is you have many financial institutions that have never had to deal with Congress and they have the same issue: they need to understand how Congress and the regulatory issues work.”He said private equity firms and hedge funds had “always tried to keep a relatively low profile” yet many of them now “find themselves in the crosshairs of these issues [in Washington]”.“They’ve never had to spend time in Washington and never had to hire people to provide legislative affairs advice so our timing is actually quite good, we think,” Mr Newsome told FT Trading Room.Another Parsons Strategies client is the Managed Funds Association, the trade association for the hedge fund industry.Mr Parsons said: “The demand for us is coming from the private sector and understanding exactly what Congress or the regulators are contemplating, to work out what’s real and what’s just political fluff and what’s likely to happen.“What we’re trying to do is combine the political angle with more of a deeper understanding of how the markets work and all three of us have had seen it from a regulatory perspective as well as from on the Hill. With the addition of Jim [Newsome] we’ve added the business side. We just thought it was a good combination.”Mr Newsome left the CFTC in 2004 to become president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, which was acquired by CME Group in 2008. Mr Newsome then joined the CME board. He said he would remain there “for the time being”.He said the consultancy would “have to be cognizant of potential conflicts of interest” as it took on work.Mr Newsome is also “lead US director” of the Dubai Mercantile Exchange and is on the board of Gavilon, a grains and commodity trading groups spun out of ConAgra, the US food group, and now owned by General Atlantic, Osprey and a fund backed by George Soros, the billionaire investor.Delta Strategy Group would not confine itself to derivatives but would enter other areas over time, Mr Parsons said."
841;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;ICE chief backs financial reform;;Financial regulatory reform around the world would spur trading in over-the-counter derivatives by bringing certainty to the markets, the head of the US’s second-biggest futures market said on Wednesday.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), said that the push for market transparency and more use of centralised clearing – which regulators have promoted in response to the perceived role of OTC derivatives in exacerbating the financial crisis – would help his business.However, he added that the market itself was likely to be ahead of Congress in anticipating structural changes. The US Senate is currently debating financial regulatory reform.“Most of the technical issues that we had concerns about got fixed in the House bill and translated into the Senate bill,” Mr Sprecher said.“The drafts that are floating around today are a net positive for us.”ICE has emerged as the leading global clearing organisation for credit default swaps – the OTC contracts most often cited as having aggravated Wall Street’s financial problems – having cleared CDS contracts on both sides of the Atlantic with a face value of some $8,000bn. Centralised clearing removes the counter-party risk associated with privately negotiated contracts.Even so, the exchange group said on Wednesday that it was still in an “investment phase” with CDS clearing, betting that trading volumes will grow once Washington decides on rules for the market.Regulatory uncertainty has been weighing on both ICE and the CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange. As well as the debate over the OTC market, proposals to limit speculative energy trading and to require banks to spin off their OTC trading desks have added to the unclear outlook for exchange groups.Mr Sprecher said that the OTC credit derivatives market was in transition to a futures-style clearing model, where customers post margin payments with their brokers, from a traditional model, in which brokers lend against other customer assets, converting them into cash. “We’re going to end up with a hybrid,” he predicted.He made his remarks as the exchange group reported quarterly results ahead of Wall Street’s expectations as the company benefited from strong energy trading activity.The company made a net profit of $101m or $1.36 per share, up from $72m or 98 cents per share in the same period a year earlier, on revenue of $282m. Analysts had on average forecast earnings of about $1.31 per share and revenues of $279m.The results confirm a trend of renewed growth in the US futures market, coming a week after CME reported a 21 per cent rise in net income and its best quarterly results since 2008.ICE shares were trading up 5 per cent at $119.17 by mid-morning in New York on Wednesday.
842;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-05-05T17:40:47Z;CME to launch cheese futures;CME Group to launch cheese futures next month;Big food producers reliant on cheddar, mozzarella and gouda will be better able to manage the costs of future supplies after the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, said on Wednesday that it would launch cheese futures next month.The new contract reflects an apparent return of cheese-love in the US as well as a growing appetite for cheese in emerging markets such as Asia and Latin America, where demand has helped boost US food processors.The futures contract will bring longer-term pricing to a market that has traditionally been served only by a spot market.In the US, cheddar cheese has, since 1997, been priced in a daily 10-minute auction on the floor of the CME. Cheddar is a standard for the industry and other cheeses are priced in reference to the cheddar price.The market is a physically delivered spot contract, chiefly traded by large food companies such as Kraft, Sara Lee and McDonald’s. In contrast, the cheese futures market will be electronically traded and accessible for virtually 24 hours a day during the week.“Until now there’s been no way to lock in prices for cheese in the future,” said Mary Haffenberg, press spokeswoman at the CME.Instead, manufacturers have used the CME’s Class III Milk – from which cheese is made – and dry whey contracts as a substitute.The new contract will give them a more direct hedge against their exposure to fluctuations in cheese prices.Tim Andriesen, the CME’s managing director of agricultural commodities, said the futures contract had been “requested by our customers such as manufacturers and processors of cheese to better fit the needs of their risk profile”.Big food processors are looking for price stability as they increase their sales in emerging markets, such as China and Brazil, where diets are changing fast. The US’s dairy trade with China has tripled in the past three years, according to the International Dairy Foods Association, a US industry body. US dairy exports reached $3.8bn in 2008.The announcement comes as the pizza market in the US is showing signs of a post-downturn revival after a year of slumping sales.Domino’s, one of the US’s biggest pizza restaurant chains, reported this week that in the first quarter it saw a “historic” 14.3 per cent jump in sales at its outlets that have been open for at least one year, one of the largest quarterly same-store sales increases ever recorded by a big fast-food chain.
843;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-04-29T20:30:32Z;Bail-out hopes and earnings soothe debt irritation;Euro stabilises as traders take stock after two days of volatility;21:25 BST. Agitation subsided across bourses on Thursday as the promise of a fresh relief package for Greece and more good earnings provided some soothing balm to counteract the market’s sovereign debt irritant.The FTSE All-World equity index rose 1.2 per cent and the euro made ground as traders took stock following two days of volatility.“The risk trade returns cautiously as the Fed extends its policy accommodation and euro shorts scale down positioning in anticipation of EU/IMF deal,” said Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.The market’s latest wobble had been caused by the downgrading of the debt of Greece, Portugal and Spain by ratings agency Standard & Poor’s.S&P’s moves crystallised the concerns that have been intermittently roiling markets during recent months – namely the fear that fiscal problems in Greece represent a harbinger for sovereign debt crises elsewhere, rather than merely an outlier.But southern Europe produced good debt news during the session, with a multi-year loan deal of €30bn from governments plus €15bn from the IMF to be ready in a matter of days, according to the European Commission. Italy, the best-off economy of the sub-region, successfully sold €3bn in three-year bonds in an auction, a welcome signal that contagion risk had eased somewhat.Stock traders did not suffer for catalysts on the day, as they also had stronger-than-expected US job figures and earnings from Visa, the CME Group, and Hugo Boss. This helped Wall Street to a 1.3 per cent advance, its strongest since early March.The CBOE’s Vix volatility index dropped nearly 12 per cent, its steepest fall since way back in February 2009, when the market’s bull run was just beginning.However, the market was still signalling that global risk is at elevated levels by continuing to buy US Treasury bonds despite the myriad pressures, ranging from rising stocks and Fed funds rates to continuing massive auctions, against them.“It will still be a while before global investors put their toes back in Europe,” said John Brady, senior vice president of hedge fund sales at brokerage MF Global, “and so will allocate that marginal capital to US treasury markets, where there are still dis-inflationary pressures in the economy.”● The promise of a solid start in New York and a rebound in eurozone “peripheral” debt has helped European bourses rise for the first day in three. The FTSE 100 in London added 0.6 per cent and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 1.3 per cent, with banks having a better time. Greek banks also jumped, pushing Athens higher by 7.1 per cent. Lisbon gained 4.6 per cent and Madrid rose 2.7 per cent.Asia stabilised after Wednesday’s sharp fall, bolstered by US markets' confident reaction to the Federal Reserve’s steady rate outlook. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index was fractionally lower, receiving no support from Japan, which was closed for a public holiday.Mainland China continued to struggle, however, falling 1.1 per cent as the government’s moves to curb speculation weighed on sentiment. This is Shanghai’s sixth consecutive day of losses and leaves it at its worst closing level since October. Hong Kong fell 0.8 per cent.● A calmer mood prevailed in the “peripheral” eurozone sovereign bond complex as traders hoped that the proposed aid package for Greece could reduce the chance of a debt restructuring.Greek 10-year bond yields tumbled 91bp to 9.03 per cent, and 2-year bond yields dropped 302bp to 12.86 per cent. The cost of insuring Greek bonds against default – as measured via credit default swaps – fell 8 per cent.Portuguese 10-year notes fell 39bp to 5.43 per cent, and the nation’s CDS fell 6 per cent, as contagion fears receded.The yield on Spanish 10-year notes fell 9 basis points to 4.08 per cent, a lower level than before the S&P downgrade on Wednesday.The yield on US 10-year Treasuries fell 3bp to 3.73 after a record auction of $32bn of 7-year paper, part of a round of $129bn to be auctioned this week. There was good buyer demand at the auction, with bonds pricing at a yield 1bp below the market price. In later trading they were down 4bp to yield 3.17 per cent.● The euro climbed 0.1 per cent to $1.3238, as sentiment towards the eurozone improved following news that German engineering orders had risen for the year to March by 21 per cent. Moody’s confirmation of Ireland’s credit rating also provided support for the single currency.The dollar reversed an early advance to fall 0.4 per cent on a trade-weighted basis to 82.03.● Copper led the metals sector lower, with traders concerned about what the continued slide in the Shanghai stock market was saying about future demand from China. The red metal fell 0.7 per cent to $3.36 a pound.Oil tracked stock market moves, rising 2.5 per cent to $85.31 a barrel, its highest in a month. Gold rose 0.1 per cent to $1,167 an ounce.Follow Jamie Chisholm’s market comments on Twitter: @JamieAChisholm
844;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME profits lifted by high trading volumes;;Earnings at CME Group, the US’s largest futures exchange, jumped 21 per cent in the first quarter, its best since 2008, topping analyst expectations as interest-rate and currency derivatives trading saw high volumes.Investors view the CME as a potential winner in the US regulatory reform effort, as more derivatives products are cleared, but market anxiety about sovereign debt and currency prices is still the exchange’s top driver.“We’re in the very early stages of a great revenue opportunity [in clearing],” said Craig Donohue, chief executive. “But the immediate growth will come from a focus on international flows into our core products.”The exchange reported net income of $240m, or $3.62 per share, beating estimates of $3.55 per share, versus $199m in the first quarter of last year. Those targets had been lowered, however, from about $3.65, after March trading volume figures missed expectations.Average daily trading volume over the quarter was 11.5m contracts, in line with expectations, led by 5.1m contracts of interest-rate futures, for a 12.7 per cent increase over the previous quarter. Equity derivatives volume, meanwhile, was still 20 per cent lower than a year ago.The CME also reported yesterday that it was seeing a record week in foreign-exchange trading volume. On Wednesday alone – the day of the Greece and Portugal’s debt downgrades by S&P – 1.47m contracts with a notional value of $193bn were traded, led by a surge euro volatility.Currencies derivatives trading volume at the CME is up 75 per cent year-over-year.“Interest rate volatility, government debt issuance and uncertainty around central bank policy remained elevated,” said analysts at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, “which should be positive for the companies that derive a major portion of earnings from trading volume in interest rate cash and derivative products.”CME’s average rate per contract dropped 1.3 per cent, to $0.821, for the quarter. Revenues were $693m, an increase of 7 per cent from a year ago but less than the forecast of $702m.
845;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-04-27T19:00:38Z;CME opposes plan over limits;;CME Group is opposing a plan by the US commodity regulator to limit speculative energy trading by hedge funds, investment firms, banks and oil companies.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission in January proposed to limit traders’ holdings in US crude oil, natural gas, heating oil and gasoline futures and options.The proposed rule would make it very difficult for Wall Street swap dealers and energy companies both to hedge their commodity risks and to bet on price swings.CME, whose New York Mercantile Exchange hosts the most widely traded energy futures contracts, urged the CFTC not to approve the plan.“If implemented, the proposal would exacerbate further the shift away from transparent CFTC-regulated markets to less restrictive venues,” the Chicago-based company said in a letter to the regulator.“Moreover, market participants would necessarily remain uncertain of what further changes might quickly follow based on the results of legislative processes.”CME rival IntercontinentalExchange said in earlier comments that position limits were not necessary to prevent concentrated positions but might help to apply regulations fairly among competing exchanges.
846;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-04-27T18:16:05Z;Malaysia bourse plans derivatives boost;;Malaysia’s stock market is planning a fivefold increase in its derivatives business to about half its revenues following an equity participation deal with CME Group of the US.Yusli Mohamed Yusoff, chief executive of Bursa Malaysia, said the exchange was also considering expanding its derivatives platform to include financial instruments such as foreign exchange futures.“We expect the contribution from our derivatives business to grow substantially in the coming years,” said Mr Yusli.“At the moment, it is relatively small, about 5 or 10 per cent of our overall business, and I would like to see a more balanced contribution from derivatives compared to cash.”Mr Yusli expected the proportion of revenues from derivatives trading to rise to at least 30 per cent within three years, with the total rising eventually to “closer to 50 per cent”.He said the exchange was looking into the possibility of introducing financial futures alongside its commodity-based products. However, such a move would require approval from either the capital markets regulator or Bank Negara, the central bank.Mr Yusli said CME, which last year took a 25 per cent equity stake in the Malaysian bourse’s derivatives subsidiary, was on course to launch a US dollar-denominated, cash-settled crude palm oil futures contract next month. Bursa Malaysia expects to begin trading its existing range of derivatives on the US group’s Globex platform in the second half of this year.Mr Yusli said the exchange expected to benefit from a pipeline of initial public offerings of state-owned companies and share disposals by Khazanah, the state investment agency, under the government’s new economic model reforms announced last month.Najib Razak, prime minister, has given few details of the privatisation programme, although it has been made clear that two subsidiaries of Petronas, the state oil company, will be privatised.Mr Yusli said Bursa Malaysia was also building a significant pipeline of Chinese companies seeking to come to the market in Malaysia following a change of the rules in 2007 to allow foreign companies to list.“We have found a number of Chinese companies that have expressed an interest in doing this, and at the moment we have quite a few more in the pipeline,” he said.The exchange listed its first three Chinese companies in 2009. Three more have been approved and four are going through the pre-listing process.Mr Yusli said Bursa Malaysia was “hopeful” that it would be promoted this year by FTSE, the indices group, from the secondary emerging classification to the advanced emerging markets category.
847;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-04-22T10:59:26Z;High-frequency trading dubbed ‘opportunistic’;;High-frequency traders engage in “opportunistic and fleeting” trading that may make markets more volatile and are of little benefit to ordinary investors, according to one of the largest online brokers in the US.TD Ameritrade said the “significant and rapid increase” in high-frequency trading volume in US equity markets affected retail investors “in many ways, the majority of which are not to their benefit”.Its comments, in a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, are likely to reignite controversy over the recent rise of high-frequency trading in US equity and derivative markets.They are also the first sign – since debate over the role of high-frequency trading began last year – of a backlash from brokers that handle millions of share orders from average smaller investors.Yet the comments will be refuted by many in the markets who believe that high-frequency trading adds liquidity to the markets, especially in times of crisis when traditional investors flee.High-frequency trading, or HFT, refers to a variety of trading strategies that use ultra-fast systems and sophisticated computer program to generate, send and carry out orders all in a split-second.TD Ameritrade said that while high-frequency traders “may add needed liquidity into the markets, unlike specialists and OTC [over-the-counter] market makers who are required to maintain two-sided markets, HFT liquidity is far more opportunistic and fleeting and under no such two-sided requirement”.The broker added: “In fact, the speed at which HFT trading volumes fluctuate may add to volatility to overall liquidity in the markets.”TD Ameritrade’s letter came in response to requests for public comment by the SEC as part of a sweeping review of US equity market structures, partly prompted by the inroads HFT has made into US markets. Tabb Group, a consultancy, says more than half of US equity markets are made up of some sort of HFT.The SEC has said it wants to know whether these and other technological advances give traders an unfair advantage over longer-term investors. In an initial report in January, on which it asked for comment, the SEC said: “Does the fact that professional traders will likely always be able to trade faster than long-term investors render the quality of these markets unfair for these investors?”TD Ameritrade responded: “The current market structure has created incentives for proprietary trading firms to use high volume computer algorithms, pinging, co-location and other approaches to take advantage of retail order flow.”It said the “rapid order placement and high cancellation rates” used by high-frequency traders had “only exacerbated flickering quotations, which undermine retail investor confidence in the execution quality they obtain”.TD Ameritrade said: “Simply put, retail investors expect the best price they see and they do not accept the excuse that the quote they saw is not attainable.”The SEC, it added, should “strongly consider” the impact that excessive order cancellations have on the markets, market data and costs for retail investors.The broker backed up its claims by saying it had experimented with using high-frequency traders to carry out a “small portion of its client order flow”.“The result was inconsistent execution quality, partial mixed lot fills and no size enhancement,” TD Ameritrade said.High-frequency trading was “opportunistic liquidity, which generally does not serve the individual investor well”.The broker called on the SEC to implement a surveillance system to root out potential manipulation and market abuse. “There is the perception in the marketplace that HFTs are trading at the expense of retail investors, and this perception can only be countered by a dedicated surveillance effort.”However, defenders of rapid trading, such as large market-making firms Getco of Chicago and Optiver of the Netherlands, argue that the term high-frequency trading encompasses many types of trading that are being unfairly swept up in the controversy.The SEC has acknowledged that high-frequency trading is “not yet clearly defined”.In another letter to the US regulator CME Group, operator of the largest US futures exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, supported HFT.Craig Donohue, chief executive, said CME believed HFT was “an important part of daily trading activity in the marketplace and it has developed in response to technological and trading strategy advances”.“There is evidence that HFT increases liquidity and transparency in the marketplace and narrows spreads, which allows investors to buy and sell securities at better prices and at lower costs,” Mr Donohue said.He added that the use of HFT by proprietary trading firms, investment banks, hedge funds and index traders had made the market “more efficient and competitive for all market participants”.The rise of HFT and of technology that allows trading in microseconds poses a dilemma for regulators, who must decide whether it is feasible to impose rules on certain market participants who happen to be able to afford highly sophisticated trading technology that – some say – gives them an unfair advantage over those who can not.Mr Donohue warned that “any attempt to place significant restrictions or limitations on HFT would be harmful to the marketplace and result in less efficient and less liquid markets”.He said: “Efforts to place limits or impose regulatory burdens on HFT in the US may encourage HFT users to shift the trading they currently conduct in the US to Europe and other foreign jurisdictions that are already well-equipped to handle additional growth in both equities and futures.”The study comes at a time of unprecedented change in the way markets function, with increasing amounts of share trading taking place away from formal exchanges, involving what TD Ameritrade called “an explosion of growth in market centres, exchanges and proprietary trading firms”.The SEC study is also looking at the rise of “dark pools” – facilities that allow the anonymous matching of buy and sell orders – and the practice of traders placing their computer trading systems physically in data centres to be near exchanges’ matching engines.
848;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-04-16T10:39:00Z;Quick View: LCH.Clearnet versus IDCG;;It is the oldest trick in the book: accuse your competitors of price dumping.That was what LCH.Clearnet seemed to be doing this week when Roger Liddell, chief executive of Europe’s largest independent clearing house, criticised the risk management policies of his US rival, International Derivatives Clearing Group (IDCG), for being “much more lenient” with its margin policy than the London-based clearer.LCH.Clearnet was effectively accusing IDCG of using margin collateral as a competitive weapon in the battle to win as much clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps as possible.Tracy Alloway on FT Alphaville sums up the issue neatly.The big prize for these clearers – and CME Group and ICE in the US – is the huge amount of uncleared OTC interest rate swaps that are expected to be up for grabs when big users of such swaps start to move these contracts into clearing houses.That is distinct from the dealer-to-dealer interest rate swaps business, more than 60 per cent of which is already cleared by LCH at its SwapClear unit in London.All eyes are on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which like the idea of being able to clear their swaps portfolios. They say being able to use a clearing house – or central counterparty (CCP), to use the jargon – removes the tedium of monitoring the credit risk of each counterparty that they have bought their swaps from.Together they manage a $2,500bn-$3,000bn mortgage portfolio, and they use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate differential between that and their cost of borrowing.So it is not surprising that clearing houses are doing all they can to woo entities such as Fannie and Freddie.Except for one thing: clearing houses were never really supposed to behave as profit-seeking businesses, with all that implies in terms of aggressive price cutting and out-manoeuvring your rivals.Some would suggest clearing houses were supposed to remain quasi-utilities. They are still rather dull places, staffed by eggheads versed in the arcane but crucial tasks of calculating margin and worrying about the mathematics of default scenarios.There is a reason for that: managing the huge risks associated with billions of dollars worth of trades is a serious business. Clearing houses like LCH.Clearnet have long maintained capital buffers way above statutory requirements.Yet as regulators push for more clearing of OTC derivatives, it has become clear that clearers will compete with each other for business – and already are.ICE, the CME and Eurex spent much of last year racing to build the first credit default swap clearing facility, with ICE winning in the end. CME is trying to get a London-based CDS operation off the ground to compete with ICE’s London-based CDS offering. Meanwhile LCH.Clearnet SA, the Paris-based arm of LCH.Clearnet group, this month stole a march on CME by launching a new CDS clearing service out of France.LCH.Clearnet has an agenda of course when it comes to IDCG. Fannie and Freddie’s regulator recently cast doubt on whether it would channel any business to SwapClear, questioning UK bankruptcy laws in cases of a default. No such issue with IDCG, which is US-based and stands a good chance of mopping up quite a bit of Fannie and Freddie business.Amid all of this, regulators are nervous. The European Commission has said that the increasing use of CCPs “will inevitably increase their systemic . . . importance”. That is why Brussels and US authorities insist that there be robust regulatory requirements for CCPs to avoid a race to the bottom on risk management standards.The nightmare scenario is of course that in its zeal to attract customers – some all too happy to accept lower margin requirements – a clearer might take on too much risk and itself default, sparking a fresh financial crisis.IDCG is at pains to say it has perfectly robust risk management standards in place. But it cannot be forgotten that IDCG represents a huge bet by Nasdaq OMX to get into the OTC clearing business and a lot rides on its success or failure: Nasdaq OMX’s share price was the worst performing of any large exchange last year, and chief executive Bob Greifeld will not want a repeat of that this year.After the Lehman brothers collapse, there was an opportunity to insist that clearing houses readying themselves to clear the new wave of OTC derivatives be as far as possible built and maintained as quasi-utilities, perhaps with certain wiggle room allowed for competition.But it was an opportunity that regulators missed.Some are now calling for central banks to make clear that they be lenders of last resort for clearing houses, that they backstop such structures if they get into trouble.But that would merely compound the problem as it now stands: it would remove the incentive for clearers to beef up their risk margining, strengthen the robustness of their systems and prepare themselves for the new world of OTC clearing that is upon us.The trouble is, can we really trust clearing houses to do this when they are fighting each other for business?
849;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-04-15T18:45:59Z;LCH.Clearnet warns on loose standards;;LCH.Clearnet has accused some of its global rivals of using loose standards to assess the amount of insurance traders must take out against a catastrophic default, in an apparent attempt by Europe’s largest independent clearing house to win business.The development is a sign some clearing houses are trying to highlight the dangers of “competing on margin” – that is, lowering the minimum funds that must be posted by market participants to a clearing house to guard against failures.Regulators fear that clearing houses might start to use margin as a competitive weapon to attract business as they battle for a slice of the vast over-the-counter derivatives markets.They say this could lead to a “race to the bottom” on the financial strength of a clearing house, increasing the risk that a clearer could collapse, potentially triggering a financial crisis.Regulators have insisted clearers adopt the highest possible risk management and margin standards in the wake of the crisis to ensure the safety of clearing houses and the wider financial system. A clearing house acts as a buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer in transactions, using margin to ensure transactions are completed in case of default.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, said: “There seems to be a divergence from a risk management standpoint as to how CCPs [central counterparties or clearing houses] are operating.”He said IntercontinentalExchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange – two US exchanges with OTC derivatives clearing operations – “margin differently” from each other. Mr Liddell singled out International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearing house set up last year to clear OTC interest rate swaps, and controlled by Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator.“The most extreme case is between us and IDCG. Their approach to risk is much more lenient than ours,” Mr Liddell said.Michael Dundon, IDCG chief risk officer, said: “We do not have more lenient standards in that we recalculate our margins on a daily basis. We are very responsive to volatility on a daily basis.”CME said: “The group regards risk margining as essential to proper counterparty risk controls and does not calculate margins according to commercial considerations.”ICE said: “We’ve warned that competing on margin could create a race to the bottom.”
850;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
851;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;Judge reveals who took on Lehman book;;Goldman Sachs, Barclays and DRW Trading of Chicago took over the US futures and options trades of Lehman Brothers after the investment bank’s 2008 bankruptcy, it was revealed on Wednesday.The identity of the parties that assumed control of the Lehman book had been kept from public view at the request of US exchange operator CME Group.However, James Peck, US bankruptcy judge, on Wednesday agreed to allow previously undisclosed parts of the 2,200-page report by Anton Valukas, bankruptcy examiner in the case, to be unsealed.Lehman was a longtime clearing member at CME venues including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange.In that role, it had $4bn of the $95bn that the CME clearing house stockpiled to guarantee trades in cases of default, according to the report. Half of Lehman’s collateral backed its in-house proprietary trading positions.When Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, CME scrambled to liquidate the bank’s proprietary bets.Five companies submitted bids, all of which “involved substantial losses” to Lehman, as they demanded to be given collateral that in many cases exceeded the market value of the bank’s derivatives holdings, according to the examiner. The firesale cost Lehman more than $1.2bn, the examiner said.Barclays, which also took over Lehman’s North American investment bank, was transferred more than $700m in collateral as it assumed the energy positions, resulting in a paper loss to Lehman of $335m, according to the report.Goldman agreed to take over Lehman’s natural gas positions, at a $140m loss to Lehman, and its equity derivatives trades at a $450m loss to Lehman.Losses associated with DRW’s takeover of forex, interest rates and agricultural derivatives trades totalled $303m, the examiner said. DRW is a proprietary trading firm.Mr Valukas’s report said that, while an argument could be made challenging the auction, US law would probably pre-empt most suits against the recipients of the assets.“The law generally says that if you comply with the process for auctions, that’s all you have to do to determine fair value,” said Christopher Panos, a bankruptcy specialist with Craig and Macauley. “To argue against that, you’d have the difficulty of proving the process was impaired by collusion between Barclays and Goldman, or was fraudulently run by the CME in some way.”Goldman and Barclays declined to comment. DRW said it “is proud that in its role of liquidity provider we were able to assist the CME when it determined that an emergency auction was necessary to assure the stability and continuity of the markets”.CME had said releasing the trade details could have a “a chilling effect on potential bidders’ willingness to participate in any similar auctions”.
852;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-04-13T21:40:16Z;Former CFTC chief Lukken to head NYPC;;Walter Lukken, former acting-chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, was on Tuesday appointed as chief executive of New York Portfolio Clearing (NYPC).NYPC is a clearing house recently set up by NYSE Euronext and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the New York-based post-trade group. It has been set up to offer “cross-margining” between cash bonds and derivatives and will be a key part of NYSE Liffe’s attempt to win market share from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a range of US futures contracts.Mr Lukken joined NYSE Euronext as senior vice-president in the group’s office of the general counsel in July last year, not long after he left the CFTC when the US administration changed. he was the top regulator responsible for overseeing futures exchanges – mostly CME, which dominates US futures trading.His move to NYPC is the second high-profile appointment of a former government employee involved in regulation of the futures and clearing business in recent months. IntercontinentalExchange last month hired Peter Roberson, a key figure in drafting over-the-counter derivatives reform legislation in the House of Representatives financial services committee.Mr Lukken said: “I look forward to using my extensive knowledge and relationships within the derivatives industry to help NYPC bring new competition, efficiency and innovation to the marketplace.”At NYPC Mr Lukken would “lead NYPC’s drive to be the first clearing organisation to margin cash fixed income positions and their natural derivatives hedges together, in a way designed to substantially improve both operational and capital efficiency”, the company said.Donald Donahue, chief executive of DTCC, said NYPC would be “a catalyst for change in the US futures market by delivering capital efficiency to its members and by introducing a unique, horizontal clearing model”.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, said: “Walt is a respected voice in this industry with a unique and diverse set of experiences that will lend themselves well to this project.”NYPC is undergoing “regulatory review” and expected to be operational in the third quarter.
853;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-04-05T16:42:46Z;Quick View: Barney Frank’s revolving door problem;;Newsflash: congressional staffer quits to join a company affected by legislation he was working on.So far, so normal in the revolving door between Congress and business in Washington, DC.But that was not the reaction to news last week that Peter Roberson, a former top member of congressman Barney Frank’s staff on the House financial services committee had left to become a lobbyist for ICE, the US operator of futures exchanges over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets and clearing houses.Critics howled that it just didn’t look good that Mr Roberson, who was responsible for drafting Mr Frank’s OTC derivatives reform bill, was now on the payroll of an exchange that stands to benefit from such legislation. Worse, he is now free to lobby Senate staff on that chamber’s version of the bill.The aim of Mr Frank’s bill – and a draft working its way through the Senate – is to shift more OTC derivatives onto exchanges and clearing houses.A furious Mr Frank went so far as to issue a press release banning his staff from having any contact with Mr Roberson, as long as Mr Frank remained chairman. He said that when Mr Roberson was hired, “it never occurred to me that he would jump so quickly from the committee staff to an industry that was being affected by the committee’s legislation”.Hmm. This stuff happens in Washington. But it is relatively rare for a staffer to jump ship in the midst of a major piece of legislation like this. Congressional rules ban Mr Roberson from having any contact with House committee staff for a year, but he is free to contact Senate staff.Mr Frank’s reaction was needlessly petulant. He also may not have encouraged future recruitment to his committee by being quite so publicly heavy-handed in his response.But he was fundamentally right: it just doesn’t look good, especially as seen from Europe, where the revolving door is not quite as well-lubricated in Brussels.Europe has a big stake in how OTC derivatives reform plays out and is more than an interested bystander in how a US operator of clearing house is playing the field in Washington. Especially as ICE has a nascent OTC derivatives clearing operation in London. (ICE rival LCH.Clearnet, whose future business prospects may well be decided by the outcome of OTC derivatives legislation in Washington, will also have taken note.)The revolving door also doesn’t engender much public confidence in the integrity of a process whose outcome – we can only hope – is a balanced set of reforms designed to clean up after the biggest financial crisis in decades. Perhaps the rules need to be tightened on the timing of congressional staff defections to industry, or vice-versa.Yet there is another issue worth bearing in mind: the talent pool in the world of trading, exchanges and clearing is simply too small, a fact exposed by the Roberson episode.There just aren’t enough people around who know the business well. That explains why the moment a top executive leaves an exchange or clearing house he, or she, is never unemployed for long – witness the nanoseconds it took for ICE to snap up Chris Edmonds when he left International Derivatives Clearing Corporation, the Nasdaq-controlled OTC interest rate swaps clearer, last month.Indeed, where are businesses like ICE supposed to find people who are both versed in the arcane world of OTC derivatives and know which buttons to push on Capitol Hill?And from ICE’s perspective, there is an opportunity cost in failing to hire people like Mr Roberson. Its biggest US rival, CME Group, has reaped huge political rewards from having well-versed lobbyists on the Hill over the years. And having firepower in DC is becoming increasingly crucial for ICE, as the introduction of an amendment by senator Sherrod Brown limiting dealer ownership of clearing houses only re-inforces.So until the talent pool gets bigger, don’t be surprised if there are more Mr Robersons.
854;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Turning point in history of Mexico’s bourse;;"This month, the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV), Mexico’s stock market group, announced that it had formed an alliance with CME Group, the world’s largest drivatives marketplace.In terms of size, the deal is relatively small: CME bought only $17m of BMV’s stock, roughly equivalent to 1.9 per cent of the exchange’s outstanding shares. But for Luis Téllez, BMV’s executive chairman and chief executive officer, the deal marks a turning point in the Mexican bourse’s history.The main reason, says Mr Téllez, is that, in addition to the share purchase, the deal gives CME the right to elect one of BMV’s board members.“CME will be an active shareholder in the exchange,” says Mr Téllez. “And having them on our board will give us the experience of one of the main actors [in global derivatives].”As for CME Group, Craig Donohue, its chief executive officer, made clear how important it believed the alliance was during a visit to Mexico City: “We think that growth will be primarily in Mexico and other emerging markets over the next 15 years,” he says. “This is a very important part of our strategy for growth.”The deal comes at a particularly active time for the BMV. Mexican authorities recently changed the rules to allow local pension funds, known as Afores, to invest in individual stocks for the first time.The funds, which have an estimated $85bn under management, will now be able to invest in so-called structured instruments.These include individual stocks and a new product since the end of last year called certificates of capital and development or CKDs, which are designed to raise funds for specific infrastructure projects as well as for private equity investment.The increase has potentially huge significance for initial public offerings (IPOs), which pension funds were previously barred from investing in – a fact that most analysts agree helps explain why there have been so few IPOs in Mexico in recent years.So what can investors expect from the alliance with CME?The area of BMV’s operations most likely to be affected is MexDer, its wholly owned derivatives exchange.In an interview this month with the FT, Jorge Alegría, MexDer’s chief executive, explained that CME will become the sole exchange provider of so-called derivatives “order routing” services to BMV outside Latin America.Order routing technology, a way of sending orders to multiple exchanges, has grown rapidly in recent months because it improves the chances that the orders become filled.Meanwhile, BMV will perform the same role when it comes to routing orders to CME Group in Mexico. “It is essentially an alliance with the biggest exchange in the world,” says Mr Alegría.“It will enable us to connect our derivatives market with that exchange, and that will allow us to achieve much more liquidity and increase our capacity to distribute our products globally.”Previous to the alliance, CME’s clients wanting to gain access to MexDer’s products would have had to go to Mexico personally and open a local account – a cumbersome process to say the least. “CME members will now be able to access our products directly,” he said. “It is all about facilitating access.”At the same time, Mr Alegría said that the alliance would allow Mexican operators much easier access to CME products. “Through MexDer screens, we are now going to be able to offer Mexican operators access to a huge array of products through the CME,” he said. “The alliance connects two great markets.”In particular, Mr Alegría believes that the alliance could have a big impact on at least two of MexDer’s products: stock index futures, of which it trades about $90m a day; and futures contracts on Mexican government bonds.Overall, he says, the additional business is likely to double the exchange’s market in the medium term – an estimate that he describes as “conservative”. None of this will come overnight, however. According to the two sides’ calculations, integration of the necessary systems will probably only be completed in the first quarter of next year. As Mr Téllez puts it: “It will take time to make all the connections.”But when that happens, MexDer, for one, could suddenly be seeing a lot more trade."
855;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-03-28T22:05:17Z;LCH.Clearnet launches Paris clearing house;;The French arm of LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearing house, will on Monday launch clearing of credit default swaps – a victory for French efforts to ensure the processing of such off-exchange derivatives instruments is done in Paris.The development will be seen by some as a blow to London, which has long dominated the markets for over-the-counter derivatives such as CDS.Paris has long harboured ambitions to win a bigger slice of the financial services market in Europe. The credit crisis has given Christine Lagarde, French finance minister, new impetus to gain market share from London, especially in euro-denominated bonds, given France’s membership of the euro.The launch comes as German efforts to develop CDS clearing in Frankfurt, led by Eurex Clearing, part of Deutsche Börse, have failed to gain traction after months of effort. Eurex has two members: UniCredit and Nomura.The new LCH.Clearnet business will start clearing euro-denominated CDS on corporate indices, with four French banks: BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Natixis and Crédit Agricole.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, said the latest effort “was the outcome of a lot of work that is being done in Paris with French banks and LCH.Clearnet SA”.Asked if the French authorities’ lobbying for Paris had played a part, he said: “I’m sure there is an element of that”.But he said the initiative was “linked to a much broader effort working with a whole range of banks that are not based in Paris to start planning the next phase of the offering”.IntercontinentalExchange, a US operator of futures exchanges and clearing houses, is the only currently operating European CDS clearing business, and is London-based. CME Group is also working on a London-based offering.OTC derivatives have become central to the clean-up of the financial system. Regulators insist that as many as possible of such instruments should be traded on exchanges to boost the transparency of pricing information, and that they should be processed through clearing houses.In January 2009, a leaked Banque de France report revealed that French authorities were determined to ensure that any eurozone OTC derivatives clearer be based in Paris.
856;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-03-26T04:35:51Z;Dispute over curbs on metal futures;;US commodities regulators on Thursday poured cold water on complaints by gold, silver and copper traders urging limits on banks and investment funds trading in metal futures.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission hosted a rare public meeting on metals after years of complaints from small investors that banks unfairly depress gold and silver prices.Long dismissed by the CFTC, the investors were given a boost in January when the commission proposed hard caps on banks and speculators’ positions in energy markets.But while the US is the global capital of energy and grain futures trading, it plays a supporting role to London in metals markets. This raises the threat that a US futures crackdown would push trading away from those exchanges the CFTC regulates.“The United States and, more pointedly, the exchanges registered with the commission, are not the market’s epicentre,” said Scott O’Malia, one of five commissioners at the body.Commissioner Michael Dunn said new limits on futures trading without authority elsewhere “may result in less transparency in our markets.”The CFTC nonetheless gave witnesses hours to testify on US metal futures, predominantly traded on New York’s Comex exchange.Bill Murphy, chairman of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee, said JPMorgan and HSBC held “large manipulative short positions” in precious metals on the Comex, and said burgeoning bullion demand threatened to lead to a “price explosion”. Gold hit a record of more than $1,200 an ounce in December.Jeremy Charles, HSBC’s global head of precious metals, acknowledged that the bank held short, or selling, positions in US futures but said it did so to hedge the prices of gold and silver in its London vaults. JPMorgan declined to comment.The gold and silver investors were joined by others worried metals prices had been pushed too high, or at least distorted. The Copper and Brass Fabricators Council alleged investment funds were the “major driver” behind rising copper prices. Many industry analysts attribute the price levels to industrial demand in Asia.A high-frequency trader who locates his computers near the servers of CME, the exchange operator that owns Comex, said that concentrated selling positions could destroy the US silver futures market.Bart Chilton, another commissioner, sympathised with their concerns, saying the CFTC needed to “fast track” limits on metals.The CFTC released data showing that about half the world’s gold is traded in London, and a third on Comex. Comex absorbs about half the world’s silver volume.
857;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-03-23T19:43:20Z;Big clearing houses set for OTC boost;;While the shift of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives on to clearing houses may seem like a great business opportunity, it is one that is likely to benefit the incumbents.That is because clearing houses tend to be natural monopolies. Business is hard to prise away from a house that already controls clearing of certain products – as the exchange-traded futures markets show.CME Group clears virtually all US futures contracts, because they are traded on its Chicago Mercantile Exchange unit – and are cleared through CME’s in-house clearer.Being a “first mover” also helps, as IntercontinentalExchange has shown by quickly dominating clearing in credit default swaps.The start-up costs associated with establishing a clearing business are huge. A clearing house needs to attract clearing members, which lodge margin with it and contribute to a “default fund”, the ultimate financial backstop. The big clearing houses either owned by or servicing existing exchanges already have these in place, as well as well-developed risk management.None of this has deterred Nasdaq OMX, which controls International Derivatives Clearing Group, a new clearer for interest rate swaps. It recently signed up as clearing members Newedge and MF Global, two of the world’s largest publicly listed futures brokers.There are doubts over how much of the OTC derivatives markets it is feasible to clear beyond interest rate swaps, CDS and FX, where the incumbents, including LCH.Clearnet in Europe, have already made their intentions clear.Anthony Belchambers, chief executive of the Futures and Options Association, says:“In some cases the smaller, lower-volume OTC markets or ones that are highly volatile are going to be loss-leaders for clearing houses.”
858;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Lehman report raises derivatives clearing fears;;Details which have emerged about the scramble at CME, the world’s biggest futures exchange, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, have raised questions over how effectively clearing houses can process the growing volume of derivatives.A court-appointed examiner’s report into Lehman’s final hours released last week says CME convened an emergency committee that conducted a forced transfer of the bank’s positions, the only time this has been done by the exchange operator.Lehman, a clearing house member, had $4bn in margin accounts to back-stop commitments for customers as well as big proprietary bets on energy, interest rate and stock-index futures.CME’s clearing house withstood Lehman’s collapse, but observers say the events of September 2008, detailed in the 2,200-page report by Anton Valukas, show the risks of clearing less liquid contracts.“They handled it in the end, but it does demonstrate that somebody is on the hook for the implosion of a clearing member,” said Craig Pirrong, finance professor at Houston University. The blow-by-blow details of the challenges CME faced to ensure all Lehman’s cleared contracts were honoured comes amid growing pressure from regulators for more derivatives contracts to be shifted to centralised clearing as a way of spreading the risk of counterparties defaulting.Clearing houses serve as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer in a derivatives transaction, shifting the risk of default from individual counterparties to a broad and closely monitored pool of backers.CME and rival IntercontinentalExchange are competing to clear credit default swaps, which played a central role in the financial crisis.Lehman’s positions on CME’s four exchanges were in highly regulated futures and options contracts. As Lehman filed for bankruptcy, CME ordered the bank to liquidate bets made with its own money. But rather than sell off these positions, Lehman actually added to them for two days.“This continued trading activity was attributed to confusion and chaos” at Lehman, the report said.CME officials also worried that JPMorgan might stop acting as Lehman’s settlement bank. “Although it was technically possible to conduct transactions with the CME without a settlement bank, no CME clearing member had ever done so,” the report said. An exchange risk manager warned this “presented an unprecedented situation and additional risk to the CME”, says the report.CME twice sought to find bidders for Lehman’s positions, leading to a forced sale of a clearing member’s positions for “the first and only time”, and leading to substantial losses for the bank.CME has dealt with the failure of clearing members before, including the 2005 unravelling of broker Refco.CME had no comment to make on the report.Lehman’s collapse was not caused by its positions in exchange-traded futures and options, but rather by its overall debt load.However, the risks Lehman presented to CME prompted analysts to question how well clearing houses would withstand a major disruption in derivatives markets.“Just because something is centrally cleared, it does not mean that the work is done,” said John Jay, senior analyst at Aite Group.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently highlighted the risks of the growing push towards central counterparties (CCP) to clear derivatives.“If a CCP is successful in clearing a large quantity of derivatives trades, the CCP is itself a systemically important financial institution,” the Fed said in a January report. “The failure of a CCP could suddenly expose many major market participants to losses.”
859;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-03-14T22:50:36Z;Interest rate swaps new focus for OTC clearing;;"Looking out across his audience of Wall Street bankers, exchange and clearing house executives at a conference last week, Gary Gensler, the top US futures regulator, asked whether anyone disagreed with the need to reform the vast over-the-counter derivatives markets, which have been blamed by many for exacerbating the financial crisis.No hands went up, prompting Mr Gensler to quip: “I want to thank you for your unanimous support that something probably needs to happen.”A key aim is to shift more OTC derivatives on to exchanges and for them to be processed through clearing houses to safeguard the financial system against the potentially catastrophic effects of another Lehman-style default. A clearing house takes on the risk that a party to a trade defaults, spreading the risk among its members.While Republicans continue to frustrate attempts by Senate Democrats to finalise a financial reform bill, the industry is not waiting for Washington to act and is jockeying for the commercial spoils, knowing that more OTC clearing of some kind is not only inevitable but offers a lucrative new business.So far, that has involved launching clearing of OTC credit default swaps. IntercontinentalExchange, the US operator of OTC trading platforms and clearing houses, has taken the lead in clearing CDS negotiated between dealers – mainly Wall Street banks.But at last week’s Futures Industry Conference in Florida, it became clear that a far bigger opportunity probably lies not only in interest rate swaps – a market 10 times bigger than CDS – but with the huge entities that use them to manage interest rate risk.Top of that list are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the huge mortgage financiers. Together they manage a $2,500bn-$3,000bn mortgage portfolio. At the conference their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, announced that the two lenders would press ahead with using clearing houses for their swaps portfolios this year – whether or not legislation was passed.Susan Milligan, special counsel at the Options Clearing Corporation, says: “If they decide to move all their interest rate swaps into clearing, that will be a tipping point that could convince a whole lot of corporates, pension funds and other end-users that clearing is OK.”Three groups are vying for the business: CME Group, the Chicago-based futures exchange; International Derivatives Clearing Group, a recently formed clearing house controlled by Nasdaq OMX; and LCH.Clearnet, the European clearing house that already clears over 60 per cent of all dealer-to-dealer OTC interest rate swaps.Garry O’Connor, IDCG chief executive, says Fannie and Freddie are so big in swaps they “will be anybody’s biggest customer”.IDCG received a boost last week when Newedge, the world’s largest futures broker, said it had joined IDCG as a clearing member – an essential step for any clearer as members are the intermediaries that connect OTC derivatives users with a clearing house.Martha Tirinnanzi, chairwoman of FHFA’s clearing house working group, told the FT that clearing was “a watershed for interest rate hedging” because it would remove the need for Fannie and Freddie constantly to have to monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties of its OTC swaps contracts.Casting some doubt over LCH.Clearnet’s prospects, she said concern over how a default is handled under UK bankruptcy laws meant FHFA needed to study “what kinds of obstacles we would encounter in the event of a default [in the UK]”.Another complication for LCH.Clearnet is that it does not yet have a US-based OTC clearing house, which experts say would be needed if it had any prospect of clearing more dollar-denominated interest rate swaps. They say US regulators are also likely to insist that dollar-denominated swaps must be cleared in the US to ensure the activity falls under US bankruptcy rules.Ms Tirinnanzi hinted at a preference for more than one US clearing option, saying: “I think we’d like to see CME become operational sooner rather than later.”"
860;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Push for clearing houses fails to move oil traders;;Big oil traders are choosing to keep more derivatives deals private, in spite of a global regulatory campaign to steer such contracts to clearing houses.Their willingness to take on risks viewed as intolerable just a year ago reflects renewed faith in the strength of their trading counterparties, but also highlights a preference for opaque markets without a nudge from regulators. Regulators in the US and Europe want most derivatives trades to be settled and guaranteed by clearing houses.For years, energy companies, banks and hedge funds preferred to keep most over-the-counter oil trades amongst themselves, locking in bilateral deals to hedge or speculate on prices. This posture crumbled with the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, a big derivatives dealer. Traders flocked to clearing services run by exchange operators CME and Intercontinental­Exchange.While the clearing trend continues, brokers say clients are once again comfortable with leaving the risks of more specialised oil trades on the books of each counterparty. They say normalising credit markets and fears of a government crackdown on bank and corporate trading activities have convinced some traders to revisit one-to-one derivatives.A 90 per cent rise in crude prices to more than $80 a barrel in the past year has also unleashed furious hedging among oil producers, driving bilateral volume, a banker said.Michael Anderson, global head of oil at Tradition, the brokers, said the share of cleared oil trades surged from 10 to 80 per cent after the Lehman bankruptcy. “We’ve seen that percentage now fall back from the 80 per cent level to around 50 per cent of our business,” he said.“Because of potential regulation, we have seen an increase in bilateral business” between large oil companies, added Javier Loya, chairman of commodity brokers OTC Global Holdings.Another OTC broker said: “There is not the kind of risk there was two years ago. So we do direct deals.”Most market participants believe the majority of oil trades will remain cleared. CME and ICE have each introduced dozens of new oil contracts compatible with their clearing houses. Last year the volume of OTC energy contracts cleared by CME grew 16 per cent “due to market participants seeking to mitigate counterparty risk”, its annual report said. ICE saw OTC oil volumes triple.Brokers say more sophisticated derivatives, such as swaptions and swaps denominated in euros or Canadian dollars, are staying out of clearing houses.Michael Cosgrove, managing director at brokers GFI Group, said: “Time has elapsed since it looked like the world was going to fall apart. As we’ve gotten away from that, some of the more esoteric products have begun to trade again.”

The FIA re-elected Michael Dawley, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, as chairman.NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext, said it had sold a ”signficant minority stake” in NYSE Liffe US to six firms: Getco, Citadel Securities, DRW Ventures – an affiliate of DRW Trading – Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS.Exchanges are increasingly bringing in key participants in the derivatives markets as shareholders in new ventures. Such players, they believe, will bring trading liquidity and product ideas, as well as form a common front to tackle a wave of new regulation.Last month the London Stock Exchange absorbed Turquoise, the alternative trading platform founded by nine investment banks, in another sign of this ”re-mutualisation” trend.Don Wilson of DRW said his firm’s partnership with NYSE Liffe US was ”an exciting opportunity to influence the evolution of the futures industry in this time of unprecedented regulatory change”.
862;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;CME and Eurex in cross-listing deals;;Two of the world’s biggest derivatives exchanges in the US and Europe announced cross-listing agreements with their Asian counterparts on Wednesday in a sign that cross-listing represents an increasingly important part of their strategy to deepen ties with markets in the region.Two of three deals involved the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India as the country taps overseas traders to use its rapidly growing derivatives markets. The developments come as Asian exchanges are growing faster than many western rivals , which see them as an opportunity to access new market participants.The NSE signed an arrangement with CME Group, the largest US futures exchange, under which the Indian exchange’s S&P CNX Nifty index, the leading Indian benchmark index for large companies, will be made available to the Chicago operator for the creation and listing of US dollar-denominated futures contracts for trading on CME.CME will make the rights to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indices available to the Indian exchange for the creation and listing of rupee-denominated futures contracts for trading in India on the NSE.Ravi Narain, NSE chief executive, said: “We have aspirations to go global …This association with CME Group will make …products across various India-related asset classes, available to a much larger community of traders and investors. At the same time, investors in India will have access to new exchange traded products.”NSE agreed a similar deal with Singapore Exchange which will soon start offering trading of the Nifty index.Magnus Böcker, SGX chief executive, said: “As part of our Asian gateway strategy we will continue to work with like-minded partners to explore collaboration opportunities.”Separately, Eurex, the derivatives exchange owned by Deutsche Börse , said it would in August launch contracts based on the Korea Exchange’s Kospi 200 stock-index options – the world’s most actively traded derivatives contract, with average daily volumes of about 13m.The moves come the same week as the CME agreed a deal to take a small stake in the Mexican Bolsa that involved the Chicago operator taking a small stake in its Central American counterpart.It included an “order routing” agreement for derivatives, under which CME will become the exclusive exchange provider of order routing services to the Bolsa’s MexDer subsidiary outside Latin America, while the Bolsa will have the same role when it comes to routing orders to CME Group in Mexico.Both the Singapore Exchange, or SGX,and NSE said they had seen a surge in interest from “high-frequency” traders. The Indian exchange four weeks ago launched a ”colocation” service, common to western exchanges, that allows such traders to place their computer servers next to an exchange’s trading system to speed up trading times.Mr Narain said: “Most countries in Asia are just beginning to wake up to high-frequency traders.”
863;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-03-10T14:33:21Z;Eurex to start trading futures on Korean options;;Eurex, the European derivatives exchange, will start trading daily futures on Kospi 200 options on August 30 as South Korea is keen to lure more foreign investors into the country’s active derivatives market.Eurex will list, trade and clear daily futures on Kospi 200 options worldwide after Korean trading hours, providing round-the-clock trading opportunities for global investors. The extended market will also provide Korean investors hedging opportunities for their positions on the Korea Exchange.KRX is keen to widen its global reach by expanding its alliances with foreign exchanges. Kospi 200 index futures started trading on Globex, a trading platform operated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, in November.KRX expects Eurex trading to increase liquidity in the country’s derivatives market. Kospi 200 options are already the most liquid exchange-traded derivative product in the world. Foreign investors account for more than 40 per cent of Kospi 200 options trading.“The linked trading with Eurex is part of our strategy to broaden our customer base and it will allow round-the-clock trading for both Kospi 200 futures and options,” Kim In-soo, deputy head of KRX’s derivatives division.South Korea boasts the world’s largest market for equity derivatives by the number of contracts traded, with 2.7bn stock index options contracts traded in 2008, according to the World Federation of Exchanges. This compares with 514m traded on Eurex, the next biggest market by that measure.KRX is also considering launching volatility index futures, carbon emission trading, mini-gold futures and Chinese yuan futures to diversify its derivatives markets.
864;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-03-09T10:12:12Z;Palm oil futures to be launched in Chicago;;CME Group, the US derivatives marketplace, is to launch a US dollar-denominated, cash-settled crude palm oil futures contract on May 23.CME said in a joint announcement in Chicago and Kuala Lumpur that settlement prices on CME Globex, its electronic trading platform, would be based on the crude palm oil futures traded in ringgit on Bursa Malaysia.Tim Andriesen, CME Group managing director of agricultural products and services, said the new derivative would provide an alternative method of hedging risk for food processors and other multi-national companies that use crude palm oil and trade in the US currency.The use of the ringgit settlement prices is part of a strategic partnership agreement announced last year by CME Group and Bursa Malaysia under which the US group bought a 25 per cent stake in a derivatives subsidiary set up by the Kuala Lumpur bourse.The deal is expected to lead to the listing of all existing and future Bursa Malaysia Derivatives’ products on CME Globex from the second half of 2010.CME said the creation of its US dollar futures contract for palm oil would create opportunities for cross-trading with soybean oil, based on the historically strong correlation between these products.Together, crude palm oil and soybean oil account for about 61 per cent of all the edible oil in the world, with palm kernel oil an additional 4 per cent of oil consumed.Both production and consumption of palm oil are growing. The main producers of the oil are Malaysia and Indonesia, and the main consumers China and India.Crude palm oil is widely traded and used around the world. It serves primarily as cooking oil but is also used to make soap, washing powders, personal care products and biodiesel.CME said each futures contract contract would be equivalent to 25 tonnes of crude palm oil. Trading hours of the monthly contracts will be 5pm to 4pm Chicago time the following day, Sundays to Fridays inclusive, with a daily one-hour trading halt.
865;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-03-08T22:49:12Z;CME faces serious threat to its ascendancy;;"Since Chicago’s futures exchanges created Treasury futures in the 1970s, the world has always come to the city to hedge on US interest rates.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange developed contracts on short-term Treasuries, while the Chicago Board of Trade launched longer-term contracts. When the former bought the latter for $11bn in 2007, it created the CME Group, a company with a vice-like grip over the US Treasury futures industry, with market share of more than 95 per cent.This behemoth is being presented with the most serious challenge in its history. Under attack from two sides, it faces legal and market-based assaults, both backed by some of Wall Street’s biggest names. The ripples they have caused are sure to be fodder for much speculation when the industry gathers in Florida this week for the Futures Industry Association’s annual bash.The legal offensive comes from ELX, a fledgling exchange launched last year and supported by some of the most important Treasury futures trading houses including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan. The market-based challenge comes from a new clearing venture planned by NYSE Liffe US, NYSE Euronext’s US futures arm, whose backers include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UBS, Citadel Securities and Getco, a market-making firm.“The CME are definitely rattled,” says a former CME board member. “This is an important and interesting battle that could set the stage for what the next decade could look like.”ELX is trying to prise open a critical part of the CME’s business model. It accuses the CME of acting anti-competitively by refusing to accept futures contracts from other trading venues and to allow trades transacted at the CME to be cleared elsewhere.ELX secured approval last year from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, for “Exchange of Futures for Futures” (EFF) trades, in which traders can translate trades from one futures exchange to another through a private, off-exchange transaction.Beneath this jargon is an attempt to overturn the entire structure of the futures industry. The EFF case raises the spectre of fungibility – the ability of traders to open a position at one exchange and close it at another. While fungibility has long been a feature of the equity and options markets, it is anathema to the CME, whose clearing house handles all futures contracts traded at the CME.The CME’s exclusive right to clear its own contracts is a principal source of its value as a company. If the industry were to move from this “vertical” model to a “horizontal” structure, with a central utility clearing house for all exchanges, it would eliminate one of its
main revenue streams.Neal Wolkoff, ELX’s chief executive, has forced the CME and the CFTC into correspondence on the issue. In a letter in January, CFTC staff said the CME had “mischaracterised” the law by claiming EFF trades were illegal. Last month the CME responded, saying the trades would harm its liquidity and undermine price discovery, and asked the CFTC to dismiss the
matter.That seems unlikely, as Mr Wolkoff has kicked up a lot of dust on the issue. While it has largely remained a matter for CFTC staff up to now, it is likely to be taken up by the CFTC’s commissioners, who are swayed by politics as much as technical concerns.Perhaps the bigger long-term challenge to the CME’s franchise comes from NYSE Liffe, which expects in July to launch New York Portfolio Clearing, a new clearing house for Treasury futures in collaboration with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade services group that clears cash Treasuries.Dealers would be able to post margin for both kinds of products in a “single pot”, which would, in effect, mean that traders hedging their cash positions with futures would be able to save on margin costs.While ELX has been attacking the CME’s Treasury fortress head-on, NYSE Liffe has been quietly tunnelling underneath, preparing an application to regulators this month and betting that it will attract volume by appealing to traders’ desire for capital efficiency, through margin savings.“There’s a thirst for this,” says Chris Hehmeyer, chairman of Penson GHCO, a Chicago futures brokerage. “There’s been a need to clear Treasury securities and futures at the same place for a long time. The NYSE is right to address that need.”ELX has also been complaining about the NYSE’s plans, noting that it envisages an exclusivity period of up to two years before other exchanges would be invited in. As a low-cost “utility” clearing house created by statute, ELX says the DTCC should not be allowed to make an exclusive arrangement.Murray Pozmanter, DTCC’s managing director of fixed income clearing and settlement, says two years is the maximum. Clearing will be opened up to other trading platforms “as soon as practical”.Tom Callahan, chief executive of NYSE Liffe US, says that will introduce real competition to the market. “One of our primary missions is to bring an open, horizontal clearing model to the US futures business that doesn’t exist in the market right now,” he says. “All the debate about EFFs is a bit of a distraction.”The CME challenges the validity of fungibility, arguing that, unlike a security which exists apart from any securities exchange, a futures contract is designed by a futures exchange based on user requirements and is unique. It says no exchange would be willing to give that “intellectual property” away to rivals by allowing a contract to be cleared at another exchange clearer.Terry Duffy, CME chairman, adds: “We compete successfully in both cash and futures markets in all of our products. Our distribution – to all major US Treasury market users – results in a diverse customer base that provides a liquid market that can handle very large transactions and offers tight bid/ask spreads.”Chris Allen, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities, argues that US regulators would not break up the CME’s monopoly without seeking similar measures to overseas exchanges, so as not to disadvantage the US internationally. But few investors will bet on an outcome in an election year."
866;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-03-08T20:24:53Z;CME agrees Bolsa Mexicana alliance;;"CME Group, the largest US futures exchange, deepened ties with Central and Latin American derivatives markets on Monday by agreeing a partnership with Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, operator of Mexico’s MexDer futures exchange.The move comes weeks after CME expanded on an existing alliance with BM&FBovespa, the Brazilian exchange group, after the São Paolo-based company raised its stake in the Chicago operator to 5 per cent. The CME already owns 5 per cent of BM&FBovespa.Jorge Alegría, MexDer chief executive, told the Financial Times: “This is very important for us because it is essentially an alliance with the biggest exchange in the world. It will enable us to connect our derivatives market with that exchange, and that will allow us to achieve much more liquidity and increase our capacity to distribute our products globally.”For the CME, the move is another sign of how the group is building a business outside the US, where it has grown largely through acquisition – most recently of Nymex, the energy exchange, and in 2007 of the Chicago Board of Trade.It is waiting for UK regulatory clearance for a London-based over-the-counter derivatives clearing house.Before the deal with Bolsa, CME’s clients wanting to access MexDer’s products would have had to open a local account – a cumbersome process.The deal includes an “order routing” agreement for derivatives, under which CME will become the exclusive exchange provider of order routing services to the Bolsa’s MexDer subsidiary outside Latin America, while the Bolsa will have the same role when it comes to routing orders to CME Group in Mexico. Order routing technology is growing rapidly as a way of sending orders to multiple exchanges and other types of trading venue as a way of maximising the chance that they get filled and bringing liquidity to an exchange.Mr Alegría said two MexDer products would likely grow: stock index futures, of which MexDer trades about $90m a day; and futures contracts on Mexican government bonds. “The alliance will allow foreign operators great arbitration opportunities,” he said.CME Group has also bought shares in the Bolsa valued at $17m, or about 1.9 per cent of outstanding Bolsa shares, as part of the equity portion of the agreement. CME has also gained the right to nominate a member to the Bolsa board."
867;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;Investors and banks get back to FX basics;Participants shun more complex structures to mitigate risk;Investors and banks are increasing their use of simple currency derivatives even as they shun more complex structures in a sign that participants are still focused on mitigating their risks.The data, in a survey for the CME Group, showed that interest from all groups of participants had grown in “plain vanilla” products that are traditionally used for hedging and that all were showing less interest in so-called exotics.Currency markets functioned normally throughout the crisis but confidence was knocked by the wider turmoil and trading volumes dropped sharply.However, recent data from the Bank of England (see chart) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have shown that volumes in the US and UK – which account for nearly half the market – are picking up, leading industry insiders to believe the market is well on the road to recovery.Vanilla products include forwards and swaps, which allow participants to lock in future exchange rates to protect themselves from the risk of an unexpected swing in the spot rate.“People returning to basic products is healthy and good for the market,” said Derek Sammann, global head of foreign exchange at CME Group. “It shows people want to get comfortable and confident that they can mitigate risk and only then will they consider looking at more complex structures.”Mr Sammann noted that the number of survey respondents concerned about data latency – the speed at which they get prices and trade – almost doubled to nearly a third, which he said also suggested an improving market.“This to me signals a recovery for the market,” he said. “If people are looking to do business more quickly, it means they’re not just worried about liquidity but also looking perhaps to expand their business.”Once the preserve of the big banks, the FX market had been growing sharply before the crisis as electronic trading platforms opened the market to a wide variety of new participants, including fast-moving hedge funds.The CME survey, which was carried out by ClientKnowledge, the consultancy, also showed a shift in perceived industry dangers.Concerns about counterparty risk, which jumped sharply during the crisis, have eased.However, fears about settlement risk have jumped, with almost 70 per cent of respondents worried about this compared with 52 per cent in 2008.
868;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-02-17T17:23:33Z;Icap launches electronic oil trading;Service will allow choice of clearing between CME and ICE;"Icap, the inter-dealer broker, on Tuesday announced that it would launch a new electronic oil swap trading service.The move comes as big industry operators look to pre-empt regulations that will force over-the-counter derivatives on to exchanges and electronic trading platforms. Icap’s announcement came hours after Nasdaq OMX, the US-based exchange operator, said it had taken control of Agora-X, a fast-growing electronic OTC commodity platform that also trades oil derivatives.Regulators want as many OTC, or privately negotiated, derivatives to be moved on to exchanges or other electronic platforms to increase pricing transparency in such markets, parts of which were blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis.Trading on electronic exchanges means prices are posted publicly and made widely available, unlike the OTC markets where prices are negotiated bilaterally, meaning key market sensitive information often remains with the dealers doing those trades.Legislation is making its way through the US Congress that would require certain commonly traded OTC contracts to be traded on exchanges and electronic platforms.However operators of key market structures such as exchanges are not waiting for legislation to be finalised and are moving into businesses perceived to benefit from the new regulatory environment.Icap said its new service, known as Icap TrueQuote, combined traditional voice broking on the phone with electronic trading on screen for OTC crude, fuel oil and middle distillate swaps. Made available through Icap Energy, its energy division, the service would use technology provided by IntercontinentalExchange, the Atlanta-based operator of futures exchanges and OTC energy platforms.Paul Newman, managing director of Icap Energy, said: “Oil is the only one of the five major OTC energy-commodity markets where electronic trading is not widespread. The financial crisis has resulted in an increased focus on counterparty credit risk and understanding of the value added by electronic trading and post-trade services.”Icap’s customers can settle their trades bilaterally or have them cleared using several clearing options, including Clearport, the specialist energy clearing house owned by CME Group in the US; or at ICE Clear Europe, based in London. Agora-X also uses Clearport for certain products.Clearing has emerged as a key component of OTC derivatives reform, with regulators insisting that as many OTC products as possible be processed through clearing houses as well. A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, guaranteeing that the trade goes ahead even if one party defaults.Icap last week took a controlling stake in TriOptima, which operates a “trade repository”, or electronic database, for OTC interest rate swaps.Regulators also want more reporting of OTC trades to such repositories to make prices more widely available to the public."
869;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-02-14T23:51:07Z;Chi-X to push for inclusion in exchanges’ indices;;Chi-X Europe, Europe’s second-largest trading platform by turnover, plans to push for its prices to be included in the indices run by its main rivals, the region’s established exchanges, according to its new chief executive.The move is a sign that the platform, launched three years ago, believes it accounts for enough trading in key European shares that this should be used as a component of stock indices that have long been the preserve of the exchanges.This is likely to make data the next battleground between trading venues as exchanges tighten their control over the index business.Deutsche Börse recently bought control of the Stoxx index business from Dow Jones, while last week CME Group struck a deal with Dow Jones for a joint venture in which the Chicago exchange operator will take control of the Dow index business from News Corp.Chi-X was launched to take advantage of Mifid, the European Commission directive that broke the monopolies of national exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange. It offers trading in securities across 14 markets in Europe and has captured more than 25 per cent of the FTSE 100 in Britain and about 20 per cent of Germany’s Dax index.Alasdair Haynes, a former chief executive of the European arm of ITG, a US-listed broker, said he was writing a three-year plan for Chi-X that would be put to the board soon.“We think it’s right for Chi-X data to be included in indices as we are making a market impact in the market as a whole. Our argument is that we are the ‘price formation’ venue for many stocks already,” he told the Financial Times.A third of all trading in shares in Standard Life, Capita Group and Rolls-Royce takes place on Chi-X, according to Fidessa, a trading technology company.Mr Haynes said one of the next big areas for Chi-X was market data, the cost of which was “anything between five and 14 times [higher] than that in the US”.Chi-X would be offering “level one” data – such as bid and offer prices – to its clients for free. The LSE derives 18 per cent of its revenues from sales of market data.Mr Haynes said Chi-X was now profitable “at the ebitda [earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation] level”.Being profitable “is a key thing because I think many people believed that we weren’t sustainable”, Mr Haynes said.“We can become the number one exchange in Europe and I am very confident we can do that.”Mr Haynes is the second chief executive to take the helm at Chi-X. Peter Randall, the founding chief executive who left a year ago, was replaced by an interim figure.
870;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;São Paulo exchange raises CME stake;;"BM&FBovespa, the São Paulo equities and derivatives exchange, is to raise its stake in the CME Group of Chicago, the world’s biggest exchange group, to 5 per cent in an attempt to attract more institutional and retail investors to Brazil.“This is a historic day for our exchange and for Brazil,” said Edemir Pinto, chief executive.“By the end of next year we will be the second biggest exchange group in the world.”BM&FBovespa, currently the world’s third biggest exchange group by market capitalisation, already owns 1.8 per cent of the CME, which in turn owns 5 per cent of BM&FBovespa.This is the result of a deal between the CME and the BM&F, the São Paulo derivatives exchange, before it merged with the Bovespa in May 2008.BM&FBovespa will spend $620m to increase its shareholding in the CME, bringing the value of its stake to about $1bn. The CME said it would issue BM&F Bovespa stock at $275.12 a share and then buy back 2.35m shares in the open market to offset the dilution of the share issuance.BM&FBovespa will also take a seat on the CME board; the CME already has a seat on the BM&FBovespa board under the earlier deal.The two exchanges will become “global preferred strategic partners” and work together to develop a new multi-asset electronic trading platform based on the CME’s Globex system.Cicero Vieira, head of information technology at BM&FBovespa, said the derivatives section would be operational by the end of this year or early 2011 and the second section, for equities and government and private-sector fixed income instruments, by the end of 2011.The new platform will also be used to handle “over the counter” trades in derivatives and other assets not quoted on the exchanges and “block trades” involving large volumes of equities.BM&FBovespa said it would pay the CME $175m over 10 years for access to the Globex system. Mr Vieira said 150 people from both exchanges’ IT departments would work on developing the new platform.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, said BM&F Bovespa brought expertise in the cash equity market, while CME brought its knowledge of derivatives.He said the two exchanges had carved up territorial rights to commercialise the trading platform, with BM&F Bovespa having rights in Latin America and CME Group having rights in the rest of the world.Mr Pinto said the deal was part of broader efforts to attract overseas institutional and retail investors to Brazil. BM&FBovespa recently reached a commercial agreement with Nasdaq OMX Group to develop an order routing system to allow broker dealers in the US to send buy and sell orders for stocks traded on the Brazilian exchange, and vice-versa.CME shares were up 0.2 per cent to $285.56 by mid morning against a fall of 0.67 per cent in the Nasdaq Composite index. BM&FBovespa shares were down 1.62 per cent at R$12.10 by early afternoon in São Paulo, against a fall of 0.94 per cent for the Ibovespa index."
871;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;CME to take control of Dow index business;;CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, has struck a deal with Dow Jones for a joint venture in which the Chicago trading giant will take control of the Dow index business from News Corp.The deal, announced on Wednesday by CME, is the latest sign that international financial exchanges are looking to diversify their sources of revenue.CME will take 90 per cent of the joint venture and the Dow 10 per cent. The deal values the index business at $675m, towards the low end of expectations when News Corp began exploring a sale last summer.CME said it would contribute market data services valued at $607.5m and the new entity would issue about $613m in third-party debt, which it would use to pay the Dow $607.5m.News Corp has for months been looking to restructure the Dow, which it bought two years ago for $5.6bn. Proceeds from the sale will be timely for Rupert Murdoch, whose group has agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by Valassis, a distributor of advertisements in newspaper inserts, for $500m.The Dow Jones Index auction is understood to have been triggered last year by an expression of interest by MSCI, the rival index provider. MSCI, which has little debt on its balance sheet, is among several market data groups and private equity firms understood to be examining RiskMetrics, the $1.1bn risk analysis company also expected to be sold in the coming months.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, told the Financial Times the joint-venture structure would not only enable the exchange to create additional products but also tap the Dow’s expertise and brand recognition.CME was looking at developing more indices that span asset classes such as commodities, energy and other financial instruments as well as equities.Mr Donohue said CME could also build on its relationships with other international exchanges to develop financial indices around the world.The joint venture allows News Corp to hand over the cost of running the index business while retaining its historic link to the Wall Street Journal, whose managing editor chooses the Dow’s components.Les Hinton, Dow chief executive, said the deal “provides advantages the index business needs to grow and prosper” and gave Dow “the opportunity to tighten its focus on its news and business information products while preserving and protecting an iconic business brand”.The negotiations come in the wake of Dow Jones’s agreement in November to sell its one-third stake in Stoxx, the index company, to Deutsche Börse and SIX, its Swiss partner, for $309m.As trading volumes have fallen in the past two years, exchanges are increasingly looking for acquisition opportunities beyond their traditional businesses.The transaction is expected to close before the end of March, subject to regulatory approval.Barclays Capital advised CME and Goldman Sachs advised Dow Jones.
872;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-02-09T23:02:10Z;Euro hits back over Greece bail-out talk;;The euro pulled away from an eight-month low against the dollar on Tuesday as speculation of an imminent bail-out for Greece squeezed short positions that have been built up against the single currency.Concerns over Greece’s fiscal position have weighed heavily on the euro.It hit an eight-month low of $1.3583 against the dollar last Friday, while data from CME Group showed speculators had built the largest ever short position against the single currency.The euro rebounded on Tuesday on heightened speculation that officials would announce support measures for Greece at Wednesday's European Union leaders summit.The speculation was fuelled by an announcement that Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, would leave a meeting of central bankers in Sydney a day early to attend the EU gathering.Lee Hardman at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ said the potential for a near-term bounce in the euro if support measures for Greece came to fruition was evident from positioning data.“With the speculative market overwhelmingly positioned one way, the building blocks are in place for near-term euro bounce should European Union leaders stand behind Greece,” he said.The euro held its gains, even as the ECB said Mr Trichet had always planned to attend the EU meeting and his early departure from Sydney was prompted by “logistics”.The single currency received a further boost later in the session after Olli Rehn, who takes over as EU economic affairs commissioner today, said that support for Greece would be discussed in coming days.UBS advised clients to take profits on an earlier recommendation that they take a short position in the euro against the dollar.“Market positioning has become extremely short of late and sentiment towards the euro appears to be almost universally bearish,” said Gareth Berry at UBS.“The euro has stopped reacting to negative news, and near-term risk events are building against our position.”Late in New York, the euro was up 1 per cent at $1.3786 against the dollar, 0.3 per cent higher at £0.8782 against the pound and 1.5 per cent firmer at Y123.60 against the yen.The dollar lost ground, as demand for the US currency waned as concerns over Greece receded.The dollar fell 0.7 per cent to $1.5698 against the pound, lost 0.8 per cent to SFr1.0644 against the Swiss franc and dropped 1.4 per cent to $0.8768 against the Australian dollar.The yen fell 0.4 per cent to Y89.62 against the dollar.

Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
874;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-02-08T19:03:16Z;Traders make $8bn bet against euro;;Traders and hedge funds have bet nearly $8bn (€5.9bn) against the euro, amassing the biggest ever short position in the single currency on fears of a eurozone debt crisis.Figures from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which are often used as a proxy of hedge fund activity, showed investors had increased their positions against the euro to record levels in the week to February 2.The build-up in net short positions represents more than 40,000 contracts traded against the euro, equivalent to $7.6bn. It suggests investors are losing confidence in the single currency’s ability to withstand any contagion from Greece’s budget problems to other European countries.Amid growing nervousness in financial markets over whether countries including Spain and Portugal can repair their public finances, Madrid on Monday launched a PR offensive to try to assuage investors’ fears.Elena Salgado, Spanish finance minister, and José Manuel Campa, her deputy, flew to London to meet bondholders.They sought to allay doubts about Spain’s creditworthiness by repeating promises to cut its budget deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 2013 from 11.4 per cent last year. “We’ll make the adjustment that’s necessary,” Mr Campasaid. But their disclosure that the treasury planned to raise a net €76.8bn through debt issuance this year unsettled markets further. The projected sum to be raised was lower than the €116.7bn of 2009 but higher than many investors had expected.The news sent yields on Spanish government bonds, which have an inverse relationship with prices, sharply higher. The premium demanded by investors to hold the country’s debt over German bunds rose to 1 percentage point.The Spanish government is convinced it is being unfairly treated by foreign investors and the media. José Blanco, Spain’s public works minister, hit out at “financial speculators” for attacking the euro and criticised “apocalyptic commentaries” about Spain’s finances.Appealing for patriotism, Mr Blanco said in a radio interview: “Nothing that is happening in the world, including the editorials of foreign newspapers, is casual or innocent.”The single currency fell to an eight-month low of $1.3583 on Friday but recovered a little on Monday to $1.3683. Analysts said sentiment towards the euro had soured because of the increasing concern over Greece’s fiscal problems.Thomas Stolper, economist at Goldman Sachs, said: “Behind this intense focus on Greece obviously is the long-standing unresolved issue of how to enforce fiscal discipline in a currency union of sovereign states.”
875;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-02-04T20:52:11Z;CME plays down fears over trading reforms;;The CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, on Thursday calmed fears that the Obama administration’s financial reforms could cause a big dent in trading volumes.President Barack Obama last month backed a proposal by Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, under which big banks would be prohibited from engaging in proprietary trading. The US Senate Banking Committee continued hearings on the proposal on Thursday, with appearances from representatives of some of the big Wall Street banks.While details of the plan remain to be fleshed out, shares in the CME and other exchanges have been hit by worries that the measure would remove a significant source of trading business at a time when volumes have slumped in the wake of the financial crisis.Jamie Parisi, the CME’s chief financial officer, played down the role of proprietary traders from the big banks in the exchange’s business model. He emphasised that although such banks accounted for about 13 per cent of the CME’s trading volume, because they tended to pay the lowest fees, they made up only 8-9 per cent of revenues.“If you look again and say ‘of that trading that they’re doing, how much of it is true speculative trading versus how much of it is hedging their books?’ you haircut it again,” Mr Parisi said. “So you can see that the number is cut down pretty significantly as you start picking through it.”Separately, MF Global, one of the world’s biggest financial derivatives brokerages, said that if enacted, the “Volcker rule” and similar proposals in other countries would result in traders leaving banks and setting up their own smaller proprietary trading houses – a development that could provide new business for independent brokers.“That’s going to create a migration of talent away from those banks and these people will become new customers for MF Global, because they will be proprietary trading companies that sit outside the banks,” said Bernard Dan, chief executive.The comments came as both CME and MF Global unveiled quarterly earnings that missed analysts’ forecasts. Excluding extraordinary charges, CME made a net profit of $225m or $3.37 per share, down from $239m or $3.58 per share in the same period a year earlier and below analysts’ average forecasts of $3.44 per share.MF reported a net loss of $22.3m or 18 cents per share, according to GAP, compared with a net profit of $27.9m or 23 cents per share in the same period a year earlier. Excluding all extraordinary items, MF’s earnings were $28m or 1 cent per share, below the 2 cents analysts had been forecasting.Mr Dan also told the Financial Times he planned to write to futures regulators in Washington today to object to the CME’s recently launched clearing service for over-the-counter credit default swaps.Some brokers have complained about the CME’s mingling of CDS margins with exchange-traded futures margins, effectively backing CDS – which many argue exacerbated the financial crisis – with cash from more traditional transactions.The CME argues that its risk-management system ensures clearing CDS does not endanger collateral from futures traders.CME shares fell 5.6 per cent to $275.79 by mid-morning in New York. MF Global shares were trading 4.3 per cent lower at $6.53.
876;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;CME and MF Global hit by trading slowdown;;Two of the biggest companies in the global financial derivatives industry reported quarterly earnings results on Thursday that missed analysts’ forecasts, as trading volumes continued to grow slowly in the wake of the financial crisis.CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, made a net profit, excluding extraordinary charges, of $225m or $3.37 per share, down from $239m or $3.58 per share in the same period a year earlier and below analysts’ average forecasts of $3.44 per share. The company’s shares fell 3.73%, to $281.20, during the first hour of trading Thursday.Average daily trading volumes in the fourth quarter were 10.2m contracts, down 1 per cent from the same period a year earlier. Clearing and transaction fee revenue fell 3 per cent to $557m, while the average rate per contract was 2 per cent lower than the prior year at 85 cents.Terry Duffy, executive chairman, said the CME had performed strongly in spite of “lingering market stress and a cyclical year-end slowdown”.MF Global, one of the world’s biggest financial derivatives brokerages, also reported quarterly earnings below analysts’ expectations on Thursday, as low interest rates continued to take a toll on the company’s bottom line.MF reported a net loss of $22.3m or 18 cents per share, according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, compared with a net profit of $27.9m or 23 cents per share in the same period last year. Excluding all extraordinary items, MF’s earnings were $28m or 1 cent per share, below the 2 cents analysts had been forecasting. Shares were off $0.12, to $6.69, in early trading Thursday.The brokerage’s revenues slumped to $251m from $422m in the same period last year.“While macro conditions remain challenging, particularly in the fixed income business, shifts in government programmes, such as the closing of several liquidity facility programmes, could begin to normalise credit spreads in the near term,” said Randy MacDonald, chief financial officer.MF Global last month relocated its corporate domicile from Bermuda to Delaware, a move the company said “was designed to increase flexibility in responding to the current and anticipated regulatory landscape”.The move came a month after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, handed MF Global a $10m fine for risk-management failures that enabled one of its traders to rack up $141m in losses in unauthorised wheat trading in 2008, the largest rogue-trading scandal in agricultural markets.
877;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-02-02T01:56:39Z;CME in talks to buy Dow Jones index arm;;The CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, is in talks to buy Dow Jones’s index business from News Corp for as much as $700m (£438m), say people familiar with the matter.The move is a further sign that international financial exchanges are looking to diversify their sources of revenue.The negotiations come in the wake of Dow Jones’s agreement in November to sell its one-third stake in Stoxx, the index company, to Deutsche Börse and SIX, its Swiss partner, for $309m.The deals follow falls in trading volumes in the past two years as the financial crisis took hold. Exchanges are increasingly looking for acquisition opportunities beyond their traditional businesses.“The CME’s always looking for opportunities to diversify and this is one of those opportunities,” said a person familiar with the situation. A CME spokesman refused to comment.Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods wrote in a research note on Monday: “The strategic implications of a transaction would be horizontal integration and gives CME Group full control over the licensing rights of the index products and diversifies into more fee income away from volume-dependent revenue.”News Corp began exploring the sale of the indexes business last summer as part of a move to restructure Dow Jones, which the Rupert Murdoch-controlled company bought two years ago for $5.6bn. Proceeds from the sale of the business could be timely after News Corp agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by Valassis, a distributor of advertisements in newspaper inserts, for $500m.CME and News Corp were said on Monday to be locked in talks, with a final agreement unlikely before next week at least.A deal could also be upset by a rival bid from MCSI, the market index company. Intercontinental-Exchange, the CME’s main futures exchange rival in the US, bought exclusive trading rights for Russell Indexes – which formerly traded at the CME – in 2007 for $50m.In the same year, the CME renewed a deal with Dow Jones for exclusive use of a string of the company’s indices until 2014 for $73m.The exchange also pays a fee every time a futures contract based on a Dow Jones index is traded.Futures contracts based on equities are the second-most traded product line at the CME after interest-rate futures, although some 80 per cent are based on Standard & Poor’s indices.Additional reporting by Kenneth Li in New York
878;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-01-26T20:06:20Z;Regulation threat to CME dominance;;The CME Group is facing the first serious threat to its near-monopoly in the US Treasury futures market after Washington regulators rejected an attempt by the exchange to fend off a challenge to its dominance.Shares in the world’s biggest futures exchange were down 2.3 per cent by late morning in New York on Tuesday. This was after a January 22 letter to the CME came to light in which staff at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said the CME’s defence in the case was “unpersuasive” and depended on arguments that “mischaracterised” the law.The development thrusts into the spotlight the huge US exchange-traded futures markets, 98 per cent of which take place at CME Group.ELX, an upstart rival backed by some of Wall Street’s biggest names – including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan – accuses the CME of blocking competition by refusing to accept futures contracts from other venues and to allow trades done at the CME to be cleared elsewhere.The challenge raises the spectre of fungibility– the ability of traders to open a position at one exchange and close it at another. While this is a feature of equity markets, it is anathema to the CME, which has a clearing house for trades done on its exchange.“This could raise the possibility of fungibility in the futures markets …and consequently, an erosion of CME’s monopoly in the Treasury futures market,” said Pali Capital.ELX secured approval last year from the CFTC, the US futures watchdog, for “Exchange of Futures for Futures” (EFF) trades, in which traders can translate trades from one futures exchange to another through a private, off-exchange transaction.However, the CME argued that the CFTC’s ruling did not force it to accept such contracts.Accepting EFF trades would cut to the heart of the CME’s business model, raising the prospect that other clearers compete to clear the contracts transacted on the CME.The CME claimed that EFF trades were both illegal and against its rules. The CFTC staff letter rejected both those arguments.The CME, which is preparing a response to the CFTC, said on Tuesday it had been assured by the CFTC that its current rules remain in place. “We believe, that upon full consideration, the [CFTC] will agree that [CME] rules do not facilitate any anticompetitive activity. Antitrust laws do not require us to take action to enable new entrants to take advantage of our substantial investments in innovation and marketing,” it said.Neal Wolkoff, ELX chief executive, said: “Any further effort by the CME to thwart the EFF Rule will carry with it an unbearable weight of anti-competitive intent.”
879;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-01-25T23:06:56Z;Computer-driven trading raises meltdown fears;;An explosion in trading propelled by computers is raising fears that trading platforms could be knocked out by rogue trades triggered by systems running out of control.Trading in equities and derivatives is being driven increasingly by mathematical algorithms used in computer programs. They allow trading to take place automatically in response to market data and news, deciding when and how much to trade similar to the autopilot function in aircraft.Analysts estimate that up to 60 per cent of trading in equity markets is driven in this way.Concerns have been highlighted by news that NYSE Euronext, the transatlantic exchange operator, has fined Credit Suisse proprietary trading arm for the first time for failing to control its trading algorithms. In the Credit Suisse case, its system bombarded the NYSE’s systems with hundreds of thousands of “erroneous messages” in 2007, slowing down trading in 975 shares.The case was far from isolated, say traders. CME Group, the Chicago-based futures exchange, is investigating a case this month where a trader in “mini” S&P Index futures contracts “inadvertently traded approximately 200,000 contracts as both buyer and seller”.Last year, the London Stock Exchange suffered a three-hour outage after its trading system collapsed under the strain of a huge volume of orders. Some traders blamed the spike in volumes from algorithmic trading.Frederic Ponzo, managing partner at GreySpark Partners, a consultancy, said: “It is absolutely possible to bring an exchange to breaking point by having an ‘algo’ entering into a loop so that by sending them at such a rate the exchange can’t cope.”Regulators say it is unclear who is monitoring traders to ensure they do not take undue risks with their algorithms.The Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed new rules that would require brokers to establish procedures to prevent erroneous orders.Mark van Vugt, global head of sales at RTS Realtime Systems, a trading technology company, said: “If a position is blowing up so fast without the exchange or clearing firm able to react or reverse positions, the firm itself could be in danger as well.”
880;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-01-21T20:08:19Z;Exchanges face threat from loss of liquidity;;"While banks would be clear losers, the effects would also be immediately felt down the entire food chain of the trading world.Liquidity on stock and derivatives exchanges would shrink in the short term, meaning there would be a smaller pool of trading activity in which participants get deals done. The same would apply to the off-exchanges markets.That could hit the valuations of publicly listed exchanges that derive much of their volume from proprietary trading activity – such as the CME Group, the US options exchanges, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX. The same would apply to smaller platforms such as BATS Exchange and ELX Futures.Larry Tabb, founder of the Tabb Group, a New York-based consultancy, said: “It’s certainly going to harm liquidity. You have a series of players in the market who are no longer going to provide liquidity.”However, some believe that would not last long, as traders regrouped outside banks and set up their own “prop shops”. Christian Katz, chief executive of SIX Swiss Exchange, and a former Goldman Sachs banker, says: “The net effect, longer term, could be neutral; it doesn’t have to be a collapse.”However, any immediate exit could benefit hedge funds and independently operated proprietary trading firms – including “high-frequency” trading firms.Joe Gawronski, president of Rosenblatt Securities, said: “If this [ban] were to happen there would be less capital chasing the same finite number of trading opportunities, which would benefit any independently operated prop fund.”For high-frequency firms, there could even be added market-making opportunities, though banks would still be allowed to do proprietary trading if it was related to their customer business. Banks’ trading operations will often take on significant positions in certain financial instruments to provide clients with trading in those instruments if liquidity in them elsewhere – on exchanges, or in the over-the-counter markets – is lacking. That is seen as a form of market-making and appears to have survived the clampdown on proprietary trading.High-frequency and other proprietary traders are unlikely to feel comfortable with the intense pressure now being applied on banks over their trading activities. One trading platform executive said: “My fear is that this would be the first step. First the banks, then HFT [high frequency trading] firms.”"
881;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-01-13T11:20:43Z;LCH.Clearnet SA to launch CDS clearing in March;;LCH.Clearnet SA, the Paris-based arm of Europe’s largest independent clearing house, plans to start clearing credit default swaps (CDS) in March, becoming the third clearer to launch a service since European regulators insisted the industry build such structures.The launch is three months later than originally intended. Last May the company announced it would start clearing CDS instruments in the eurozone in December.The CME Group also plans to launch CDS clearing in the first half of the year for both interbank CDS activity and so-called “buyside” deals. The operator of the world’s biggest futures exchange expects to complete the staffing – of around a dozen people – in March. It is still waiting for approval to launch the service from the Financial Services Authority.Used as a form of insurance against the default of a company or bank, or to place bets on the direction of their creditworthiness, the credit default swaps market is worth an estimated $28,000bn. It was one of the fastest-growing parts of the financial markets during the past decade and has since been widely blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis.LCH.Clearnet had a “technical” launch in mid December and has since then been setting up clearing infrastructure with its members.A spokeswoman said: “LCH.Clearnet SA has targeted its business launch by end of March upon approval from direct authorities and additional approvals with UK and US regulators would help shortly after to strengthen the service offer[ing].”The service will start by covering iTraxx European indices only, and expand to “single name” equities and US indices at a later date.This is the company’s second attempt at setting up such a service. In December 2008 LCH.Clearnet, its UK arm, launched a joint venture with NYSE Liffe, a London-based derivatives exchange. It was abandoned eight months later after failing to clear a single contract.ICE Trust Europe, Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange’s (ICE) European clearing division and Frankfurt-based Eurex have cleared CDS contracts since last year.However, unlike ICE and Eurex, LCH.Clearnet SA will not offer revenue sharing with dealers – seen by many industry observers as essential to getting such a service off the ground.The spokeswoman said: “There is no revenue sharing arrangement as such with our members but our fee grid remains very competitive compared to competitors.”Eurex Credit Clear, the Eurex service, has two members – Nomura and Unicredit – and has cleared contracts with a total notional value of around €100m.It is dwarfed by ICE Clear Europe, which has cleared over $1,000bn (€690bn) since its launch in July.
882;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-01-07T22:26:27Z;Study backs WTI contract;;"Oil traders and policymakers have criticised the benchmark US oil contract during the last year, after its price diverged sharply from other oil yardsticks. But a new study suggests that its main rival was also distorted.West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures last year traded as much as $10 a barrel less than Brent, its rival from the North Sea.But a study, by Craig Pirrong, a respected economist at the University of Houston, challenges the notion that WTI is inferior to Brent. The study was commissioned by CME Group, whose WTI contract at New York Mercantile Exchange is threatened by a shift in market share to Brent.The study says WTI and Brent futures became less useful as hedging vehicles in the aftermath of the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. Front-month WTI futures, which at one point traded at an extraordinary $8-a-barrel discount to the same oil delivered a month later, suffered the most.While the correlation between WTI price spreads and overall US stockpiles weakened in the period, Prof Pirrong’s study found that the historic correlations between Brent spreads and US oil stockpiles became negative.Between late 2008 and early 2009 “the relation between Brent spreads and US stocks was opposite that predicted by economic theory; stocks and Brent spreads moved in opposite directions during this period”. The study further said: “This raises questions about whether Brent spreads reflected fundamentals,” as captured by inventories in the industrialised nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.The study’s finding contrasts with the view of the International Energy Agency, the western countries’ oil watchdog, which has been a strong critic of WTI. It said last year that “inherent logistical flaws” caused by the WTI contract delivery point at Cushing, Oklahoma, “frequently led to a disconnect from international markets”.The dislocation prompted Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, to drop WTI as its benchmark for sales in the US. The kingdom now prices its oil against the Argus Sour Crude index, a basket of crude streams produced in the US Gulf of Mexico.But CME suggested on Thursday that the study’s results buttressed its flagship oil contract. “It was very reassuring to know that even when the world oil market upended, overproduced, way overstocked . . . WTI reflected this,” said Bob Levin, managing director of energy research. Brent “was showing the wrong signals”.IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), home to Brent futures, declined to comment as officials there had not reviewed the study.Some oil analysts are unconvinced. Edward Morse, head of commodity research at Credit Suisse in New York, said it is more likely that Brent spreads reflected global market conditions than WTI, “because there are so many times in periods since 2007 when WTI has become divorced”.Nymex February WTI oil on Thursday fell 52 cents to $82.66 a barrel. Brent dropped 38 cents to $81.51.Base metals fell across the board after China tightened monetary policy. LME copper moved down 1.5 per cent to $7,550 a tonne."
883;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-01-06T09:24:47Z;CFTC set to propose caps on energy speculation;;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is expected soon to propose new rules to temper speculation in energy futures, a prospect that has drawn fire from banks and commodity investment funds.The US regulator would be directly involved in setting limits on oil, gas and other energy futures contracts, a task currently delegated to exchanges such as the New York Mercantile Exchange, according to people familiar with a draft plan.The caps would be set by a complex formula not unlike those that the CFTC uses in several agricultural markets, these people say. No such plans exist in Europe.CME Group, owner of Nymex, had asked for exchanges to set most limits as a percentage of open interest, or total number of outstanding contracts. The plan would address the system of exemptions from existing limits that many Wall Street banks enjoy, potentially differentiating them from so-called “bona fide hedgers” such as oil companies, people familiar with the matter say.Details are in flux and could change before public release, these people say. The proposal will seek public feedback on outstanding questions.Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, has since last July said the commission must consider strict new energy trading limits but a self-imposed autumn deadline for new rules passed without an announcement. He has faced resistance from some commissioners worried that the rules would drive trading overseas or away from regulated exchanges.A commission spokesman declined to say when a proposal would appear.While US crude prices this week regained the $80-a-barrel mark, oil market volatility has died down since the plan was first mooted.The agency remains under political pressure to act after oil topped $147 in July 2008. The financial reform bill passed by the US House last month would require the CFTC to establish hard limits on commodity trading both on and off exchanges. A Senate bill has yet to pass.
884;CME;CME Group Inc;2010-01-05T20:02:23Z;Cracks in transatlantic derivatives rules;;As US lawmakers and European bureaucrats return to work after the holidays, one of their top priorities will be to finalise new rules to deal with the derivatives instruments that proved so destabilising during the financial crisis.Yet seven months after the US kick-started sweeping reforms of the privately negotiated – or over-the-counter – derivatives markets, there are signs that the US and Europe are diverging in their approach.That matters because ever since policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic started to address the issue they have insisted that a streamlined, global approach is crucial to avoid market participants picking and choosing where to conduct their business in a process known as “regulatory arbitrage”.The OTC markets make up a huge part of the financial system, dwarfing exchange-traded futures and options markets. That gives them importance to the wider financial system, a point dramatically highlighted when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, leaving many OTC trades incomplete and causing panic.There is broad agreement between Washington and Brussels that OTC derivatives must be shifted from – in the words of a European Commission policy document produced in October – “predominantly OTC bilateral to more centralised clearing and trading”.The aim is to introduce safeguards should participants default, spreading “counterparty risk” throughout the financial system. A clearing house guarantees that trades are completed even if one party defaults.A bill finalised last month by the House of Representatives mandates the clearing of OTC derivatives that a clearing house will accept for clearing and which regulators believe should be cleared.The US is far from finalising a new regime for OTC derivatives since the Senate has yet to agree its own version of the House bill. But already the US is seen as taking a more “prescriptive” approach, where Europe is more “consultative”, according to Edmund Parker, head of the derivatives practice at law firm Mayer Brown in London.The Brussels proposals are more broad-brush and less specific, conceding that any new policy should “duly take into account the specificities of the asset class involved”.Mr Parker says: “They are looking at this as ‘this is the regulation we want to have in place’ rather than the EU approach which is ‘here are the sort of things we want to cover and we’ll look to implement only following wider consultation’.”One possibility for regulatory arbitrage centres on the issue of capital charges on OTC derivatives that end up not being cleared.David Clark, chairman of the Wholesale Market Brokers Association, representing inter-dealer brokers in the OTC markets, says: “Should there be a disparity between levels of capital charges, market participants will simply move to the business centre with lower capital charges.”Such issues will be highlighted on Wednesday when more than 160 European companies write to Brussels asking to be exempted from a requirement that OTC derivatives be cleared.Richard Raeburn, chairman of the European Association of Corporate Treasurers, which is leading the call, says companies are taking advantage of a more consultative approach by Brussels to secure concessions, fearful that the US could take a tough line.In the US, the Senate draft version is “largely based” on the Treasury and House versions, notes Davis Polk, a law firm, and “creates a strong presumption of clearing of all swaps”.Although the Senate banking committee is due to overhaul its first attempt at financial reform, led by Chris Dodd, banking committee chairman, there is little chance that the broad outlines will be altered dramatically.That has already led large end-users of derivatives and the banks that service them to look abroad for less prescriptive examples. Some derivatives industry lobbyists in Washington say they are hopeful that the Europeans will take a more deliberate thoughtful approach.The British approach to OTC derivatives reform, spelled out in a report by the Financial Services Authority and Treasury last month, is being seen as the first attempt to analyse the consequences of forcing OTC derivatives into clearing houses. It cautions against too much clearing given the systemic importance of clearing houses.One reason why the US is perceived as more prescriptive is that the US legislative process – involving more sophisticated lobbying by special interests than in Europe – means there is more scope for provisions to be inserted into legislation, often at the last minute.For example, a provision in the House bill limiting bank ownership of clearing houses to 20 per cent is not even under discussion in Brussels.If the US and Europe do end up diverging on key issues, another danger emerges. Other countries such as Japan, India and South Korea are embarking on their own OTC derivatives reforms. Yet regulation there is a wild card, especially if the US and Europe cannot agree a benchmark to follow.“An open question remains about what happens to regulation in newer markets in Asia,” says Joel Telpner, partner at Jones Day. “We are hopeful that new regulations will be consistent with efforts in the US and Europe, but we do not know that yet for sure.”

Hitherto, OTC derivatives cleared have been contracts between banks.LCH.Clearnet has for the past decade offered clearing of OTC interest rate swaps through its SwapClear unit. However, the service has been used mostly by banks negotiating interest rate swaps with each other.Buyside participants – asset managers and hedge funds – are collectively the biggest users of such OTC derivatives but did not feel the need, pre-Lehman, to use clearing since they generally trusted the creditworthiness of the banks with which they dealt.The collapse of Lehman was a blow to such trust and raised wider concerns about the creditworthiness in the financial system, sparking a push by authorities to use clearing to mitigate such concerns. A clearer stands between two parties to a trade, ensuring payment is made under a contract even if one party defaults.The new LCH.Clearnet service will allow institutional investors to access central clearing for OTC interest rate swaps via SwapClear.Joe Reilly, director of SwapClear, said: “In the bilateral world today the client is exposed to interest rate risk if their dealer defaults and they also then have to work out how to regain their asset back from the administrator in the event of a default, and that can take many months or years.“The clients can operate as per normal prior to the default, as opposed to having to scramble and refinance their positions with an alternative dealer,” Mr Reilly said.

A clearer stands between two parties to a trade, ensuring payment is made under a contract even if one party defaults.The new LCH.Clearnet service will allow institutional investors to access central clearing for OTC interest rate swaps via SwapClear. It had been designed “to offer a unique level of security to buy-side clients in the case of a bank default through margin segregation and portability of contracts”, LCH.Clearnet said.It said: “The extension of this proven service to customers of banks reflects a key pillar of the market changes being contemplated by regulators and legislators worldwide.”Portability of contracts refers to a new system that SwapClear has developed that allows the clearing system to move – or “port” – a buyside customer’s positions to a new dealer within 48 hours, if the existing dealer defaults.One of the main problems faced by such participants in the wake of the Lehman default was that their positions were tied up in administration as Lehman was wound down.Joe Reilly, director of SwapClear, said: “In the bilateral world today, the client is exposed to interest rate risk if their dealer defaults and they also then have to work out how to regain their asset back from the administrator in the event of a default, and that can take many months or years.“The clients can operate as per normal prior to the default, as opposed to having to scramble and refinance their positions with an alternative dealer,” Mr Reilly said.Pension funds are among the biggest users of interest rate swaps, which they use to hedge interest rate fluctuations.Dealers that have committed to using the service are: Banca IMI, Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas, BofA Merrill Lynch, Calyon, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Nomura, Royal Bank of Scotland, Société Générale and UBS.Nat Tyce, head of sterling swaps at Barclays Capital said: “This [buyside clearing] reduces market-wide counterparty risks and increases operational efficiency, allowing the buy-side to differentiate between banks on the strength of their pricing service.”
887;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Clearing houses;;Who will have to clear what, in the world of over-the-counter derivatives, is yet to become, well, clear. But clearing houses, which stand between two counterparties assuming the risk if either defaults, are central to US reform efforts. Last week’s House of Representatives reform bill passed with an amendment limiting banks’ ownership of clearing houses, making it more difficult for Europe’s LCH.Clearnet to do business stateside. The fear is that banks – eager to protect their lucrative OTC businesses – would keep products off clearing platforms.It is not that simple. Banks’ involvement in derivatives clearing has hitherto been essential. The CME Group spent a year negotiating with banks for its credit default swap platform, aiming to catch US leader ICE, which has already cleared $4,200bn of CDS. The competitors both this week cleared their first trades from buy-side customers. Publicly listed ICE itself offered founder banks special rates to win them over. Ownership, then, is not the only way for banks to exert an influence.True, regulation that mandates clearing could weaken banks’ hand. But it is not only banks that might resist extending clearing requirements. Clearing houses themselves have fought to retain control of which products can be cleared. They need to mark positions to market in order to collect margin which, in the case of CDS, must reflect the possible payout in the event of an underlying default. Illiquid products, then, are unsuitable.Whether clearing CDS, or other OTC products, becomes big business is yet to be seen – clearing is, after all, akin to a utility. But it therefore merits careful supervision. If multiple profit-driven clearing houses compete, this could muddy risk management. A seller of protection might appear moderately exposed within one platform but egregiously so across the system.Regulators, too, should take a dim view of competition that focuses on margin requirements or the type of collateral accepted. Clearing helps to reduce risk in the system – not eliminate it.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
888;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-12-15T18:09:18Z;Derivatives clearing push accelerates;;The push for clearing credit derivatives between dealers and their customers accelerated on Tuesday, as the CME Group’s platform began operating, one day after rival, ICE Trust rolled out its service for over-the-counter derivatives.The CME said in a statement that it cleared both dealer to customer and interdealer Credit Derivative Swaps (CDS) trades on its platform.Clearing trades that are executed between dealers and their ‘buy-side’ clients such as hedge funds and institutional investors, has been strongly pushed by regulators in the wake of the financial crisis.The massive growth of credit derivatives this decade has been blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis and regulators have highlighted the lack of transparency in the OTC market where two parties privately agree to a customised contract.By centrally clearing OTC trades, the counterparty risk between a dealer and their customer is transferred to the clearing house. This is seen mitigating systemic risks - including the risk of failure of a leading dealer - which was highlighted last year when Lehman Brothers collapsed.The CME Group is backed in its clearing efforts, by a number of large buy-side investors. They include: Citadel Investment Group, AllianceBernstein, BlueMountain Capital Management, D.E. Shaw & Co, Pimco and BlackRock. Their support has compelled dealers, who have been clearing trades through ICE, to recently reach agreement with the CME to start using its platform.The first bank involved with clearing a customer credit derivative trade through the CME on Tuesday was Barclays Capital.”Clearing trades through the CME has been customer driven, and many of our clients want to use their platform,” said Paul Hamill, director of credit trading at Barclays Capital.He said the bank has a pioneer group of customers looking at clearing trades through either the CME or ICE Trust, and that momentum should accelerate in the new year.”The heavy lifting has been done with the US clearing houses, but we are still working on legal documentation and compliance issues in order to facilitate more customers into clearing,” said Mr Hamill.On Monday, ICE Trust began clearing dealer to clients credit index trades, and has already cleared $4,300bn of dealer to dealer CDS trades this year.This week, ICE in Europe started clearing dealer to dealer trades for single name credit default swaps and is expected to start clearing those types of trades in the US next week.Over time, clearing dealer to client single name trades will begin, traders say.
889;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-12-14T18:02:59Z;Clearance of CDS passes milestone;;The trading of credit default swaps passed a key milestone on Monday as dealers started placing trades executed with their clients into ICE Trust, a central clearing house for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.A rival clearing service from the CME Group is expected to start clearing the customer trades of dealers this week, possibly beginning as soon as Tuesday.The clearing of trades between banks and their “buy-side” customers, such as hedge funds and institutional investors, comes after months of planning and a strong push from regulators to mitigate systemic risks – including the risk of failure of a leading dealer – associated with OTC derivatives, where two parties privately agree to a customised contract.The massive growth of credit derivatives this decade has been blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis.The lack of transparency in the OTC market has compelled regulators and lawmakers to demand that most derivative deals be centrally traded and cleared. Dave Olsen, head of OTC clearing at JPMorgan, which was the first bank to clear a client trade through ICE said: “We have pushed off from the dock and can now provide clients with the benefits of centralised clearing.”He added: “This marks the beginning of institutionalising and scaling the capability of central CDS clearing for clients who wish to use it.”One client involved with JPMorgan yesterday was Blue Crest Capital in London. Farid Amellal, portfolio manager at Blue Crest said it planned on clearing more trades from its multi-strategy credit master fund.“Clearing removes the counterparty risk associated with trades,” he said.Centralised clearing will reveal more information about trades but it will also impose margin requirements on traders, increasing their costs.For now, the size and number of transactions being cleared are not materially large, as dealers and the buy-side become accustomed to using the service. Volumes are expected to pick up in the new year.
890;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-12-10T20:10:32Z;Bullish Taiwan exchange rethinks IPO plan;;The Taiwan stock exchange has postponed its initial public offering indefinitely and is no longer exploring a merger with the island’s smaller exchanges and clearing institution, according to Schive Chi, its chairman.This means that a series of reforms initiated by Mr Schive’s predecessor have been put on the back burner, including the sale of up to a 25 per cent stake to a foreign exchange.Taiwan equities have made some of the most spectacular recoveries from last year’s doldrums, with the benchmark Taiwan weighted index rising 74 per cent from a year ago on signs that the local economy will benefit from warmer ties with mainland China.The Kuomintang government, which came into power last summer, is also backing a number of moves which will boost the size of the TWSE, as the exchange is known.“There is no rush to launch an IPO,” said Mr Schive, appointed last August to head Asia’s seventh largest exchange by value of shares traded.TWSE did not have to pursue its own listing to improve the size and liquidity of the market when there were reform measures and new products in the pipeline, he added, and a full merger of the exchanges had been replaced by technical and operational co-operation, which was sufficient.The market has been expecting TWSE to list this year. Wu Rong-I, the previous chairman, also held talks with Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq, NYSE/Euronext and the CME Group about the sale of a strategic stake. Mr Wu’s plans were made after a number of mergers and acquisitions created new global giants such as NYSE/Euronext while the arrival of alternative trading platforms also prompted reform at traditional exchanges.Asian stock exchanges have remained highly fragmented and relatively untouched by the wave of consolidation in the west. However, a recent joint venture between the Singapore stock exchange and Chi-X is expected to bring in a new level of competition to the region. It is the first exchange-backed “dark pool”, an arrangement that allows the trading of large orders with prices made public only after trades are completed to reduce market impact, and it covers shares listed in Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan.Mr Schive dismissed the potential impact of new overseas trading platforms, including the Singapore venture, on Taiwan. Instead, he said the prospect of the island’s market was brighter than most because of plans to launch new products with mainland Chinese markets.TWSE will start talks with exchanges in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong to create a greater China composite index. The four exchanges can then trade exchange-traded funds based on the index, allowing local investors to gain exposure to each market.Mr Schive said he would also focus on encouraging foreign and Taiwan-owned companies with listings elsewhere to issue Taiwan Depositary Receipts.

The new members will be Barclays Capital, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and UBS, each of whom has executed a non-binding term sheet with respect to the CDS initiative.The dealer founding members join the buy-side founding members, AllianceBernstein, BlackRock, BlueMountain Capital Management, Citadel, the D. E. Shaw Group and PIMCO, in supporting CME Group’s OTC CDS initiative. As part of that support, the dealer founding members, in addition to the buy-side founding members and other buy-side firms, are planning to participate in a pre-launch program scheduled to begin clearing CDS by December 15, 2009, subject to necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Nomura Group, and Royal Bank of Scotland will become CDS clearing member firms and intend to participate in the pre-launch program.”Thanks to the collaboration and committed effort of so many key buy-side and dealer founding members, we expect to begin clearing CDS contracts by December 15th,” said Terry Duffy, Executive Chairman, CME Group. ”We believe that between our product coverage and our strategic alliance with buy-side and dealer firms, CME Group will provide the most comprehensive CDS clearing solution.””Today’s announcement represents a landmark industry milestone in bringing together a broad range of prestigious buy and sell side participants to support our clearing solution for credit default swaps,” said Craig Donohue, Chief Executive Officer, CME Group. ”CME Group believes that our solution, which was jointly developed with both our buy and sell side founding members over many months of effort, will be the strongest and most effective CDS clearing solution. Our solution will provide a number of benefits including immediate processing of CDS trades submitted for clearing, an extensive range of products to clear including single names and indices, a comprehensive and transparent risk management framework, the security of an industry leading financial safeguards package, and the leveraging of an established regulatory framework to protect customer collateral and positions.”CME’s clearing solution is based upon cleared CDS products that will mirror OTC market conventions and practices, including the incorporation of ISDA Credit Derivatives definitions, adherence to decisions of the ISDA Determinations Committee and cash settlement to the ISDA auction settlement price, and incorporates the proven benefits of CME Group’s clearing model.Additional information can be found at www.cmegroup.com/cds.About CME GroupAs the world’s largest and most diverse derivatives marketplace, CME Group (www.cmegroup.com) is where the world comes to manage risk.

892;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-12-03T18:16:57Z;CME reaches agreement on CDS initiative;;The CME Group announced on Thursday that a group of dealers will support the exchange’s initiative to clear credit default swaps, a type of derivative widely blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis.As reported in the FT late on Wednesday, the CME has been holding talks with the main dealers in over-the-counter (OTC) credit derivatives for the past year and was close to a formal agreement.The CME has now confirmed that Barclays Capital, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Credit Suisse have executed a non-binding term sheet with respect to the CDS initiative.The CME also said that Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Nomura Group, and Royal Bank of Scotland will become CDS clearing member firms and intend to participate in the pre-launch program.”Thanks to the collaboration and committed effort of so many key buy-side and dealer founding members, we expect to begin clearing CDS contracts by December 15th,” said Terry Duffy, executive chairman, CME in a statement.The dealers have been under pressure from large investors to clear credit derivatives through the CME and not solely via the InterContinental Exchange, which is backed by major dealers, and has cleared contracts with a notional value of $4,000bn.The CME initiative for clearing credit derivatives has been supported by large so-called buy side investors such as AllianceBernstein, BlackRock, BlueMountain Capital Management, Citadel, the D. E. Shaw Group and PIMCO.Both dealers and these buy side firms are planning to participate in a pre-launch program scheduled to begin clearing CDS by December 15, 2009, subject to necessary regulatory approvals said the CME.
893;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-12-03T01:25:26Z;CME nears deal with banks on CDS clearing;;CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, is nearing a breakthrough deal with some of the world’s biggest banks to clear credit default swaps, according to people close to the negotiations.An agreement with some banks could be announced on Thursday, capping more than a year of discussions.The CME has been holding talks with the main dealers in over-the-counter (OTC) credit derivatives – Barclays Capital, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Credit Suisse.It was unclear how many of those banks would sign up with the CME.The agreement is understood to be likely to specify December 15 as the launch date for clearing the first trades, meeting a deadline set by the CME. The CME would not comment on the specifics, but a spokesman said: “We continue to make significant progress with dealer founding members.” The banks either declined to comment or did not return calls seeking comment.OTC derivatives have been blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis. US regulators and lawmakers want most OTC deals – in which two parties privately agree to a customised contract – to be centrally traded and cleared. This would impose margin requirements on traders and make information about prices more widely available.InterContinental Exchange, a CME rival, has gained a significant head-start in the race to clear CDS trades, collaborating with the dealers to establish clearing houses on both sides of the Atlantic that have cleared contracts with a notional value of $4,000bn.By contrast, exchange groups such as the CME and Eurex, the German derivatives exchange owned by Deutsche Börse, have made little progress in persuading CDS dealers to clear transactions through their clearing houses.The CME – the dominant institution in US-listed futures, with a 98 per cent market share – has had a fraught relationship with the dealers in recent years. The banks are wary of the exchange seeking a greater role in OTC markets.The CME originally proposed to trade and clear CDS in partnership with Citadel, the hedge fund. But when the dealers objected, it decided to focus instead on clearing.The banks have been prodded to co-operate with the CME under pressure from the hedge funds and investment-management firms that are the biggest users of CDS.Although the dealers have accepted that these “buy-side” firms want to support the CME’s clearing venture, they are understood to have been locked in protracted negotiations with the CME in recent months.“Discussions over the specific details have been taking place three to four times a week, often going on for four hours at a time,” one dealer told the FT.CDS dealers told the Financial Times they expected that volumes cleared at the CME would build more slowly than at ICE’s clearing houses, with the banks processing a limited number of trades through the CME at first. “There will take a ‘staged approach’ as more dealers use the system and get up to speed,” said a dealer.
894;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-12-01T14:11:21Z;CBOE on course to demutualise;;The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s primary options-trading venue and one of the world’s last big member-owned financial exchanges, has struck a deal to remove “within days or weeks” the last hurdle to demutualisation.The exchange made the announcement on Monday night after reaching a final settlement of a long-running legal battle with members of the Chicago Board of Trade.The settlement moves the company closer to an initial public offering or a bid from a larger exchange operator.The CBOE is likely to be an attractive target for a takeover by a company looking to expand in the US equity options sector, which had grown at a furious pace in the years before the financial crisis and whose trading volumes have held up relatively well even in the past year.The CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, could make a play for an all-Chicago tie-up, but it is likely to face competition from at least one other exchange group, with NYSE Euronext a possible rival. Estimates value the CBOE at $3bn-$5bn. The exchange’s status has been in limbo for years, while CBOT members who kept their trading rights argued that they were entitled to a share of the CBOE when it demutualised.The CBOT was taken over in 2007 by the CME Group, a development that the CBOE argued eliminated members’ eligibility. The two sides reached a deal last year under which the CBOT claimants will receive an 18 per cent stake in the CBOE and a cash payment of $300m.Those who appealed against that ruling will receive $4.2m under the latest deal, which will settle all claims. The CME is to reimburse the CBOE for half the settlement amount, the options exchange said on Monday night.“While we are quite comfortable that the appeals would not have been successful, we concluded that the settlement is in the best interest of CBOE and its seat owners because settlement of the appeals would eliminate all remaining litigation impediments to demutualisation within days or weeks instead of months, and would avoid further legal expenses related to the appeals,” the CBOE said in a letter to its members on Monday night.
895;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-11-12T17:45:32Z;IEA criticism is further blow to oil benchmark;;The reign of the West Texas Intermediate as the world’s top oil benchmark “looks increasingly precarious”, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday, after Saudi Arabia dropped last month the yardstick as its reference for US sales.“WTI has been the most important price benchmark for several decades but its fall from grace was long in the making,” the western countries’ watchdog said. The IEA added that “inherent logistical flaws” caused by the contract delivery point at the landlocked pipeline hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, “frequently led to a disconnect from international markets”.Riyadh last month said it will switch to a new index developed by Argus, the London-based oil pricing company. The Argus Sour Crude Index (Asci) tracks three varieties of crude produced in the US Gulf of Mexico. Other big oil exporters, including Venezuela, are also considering dropping the WTI contract.The benchmark rose to prominence after the New York Mercantile Exchange started using it in 1983 as the basis for its light, sweet crude futures contract. The Nymex WTI is currently the world’s most liquid oil futures contract.The IEA’s warning comes as the InterContinental Exchange, home of the rival Brent benchmark, said this week it will launch a new futures contract tracking the new Asci benchmark. CME Group, the owner of Nymex, said last month it will launch futures and swaps tracking the new Asci index.David Peniket, president of ICE Futures Europe, said that the availability of the US Gulf Coast benchmark Asci would enhance the ability of market participants “to effectively manage price risk in the global energy market”.The IEA said, nonetheless, that “for all its flaws, WTI still has an important role to play”, noting that Asci prices will remain linked to WTI quotes through differentials.Saudi Aramco, the state owned company, previously used WTI prices published by Platts, a unit of McGraw Hill companies. The Platts’ WTI price quote is closely linked with the Nymex WTI futures contract.Khalid al-Falih, chief executive at Saudi Aramco, last week told reporters that the company dropped the WTI after the benchmark “has really become disconnected” with the overall crude oil market. “We were finding out that increasingly either our customers or ourselves were out of the market,” Mr al-Falih said.Earlier this year, a surge in oil inventories in Cushing depressed the value of the WTI against other global benchmarks, throwing the global oil market into disarray.In January, WTI, which usually trades at a premium of $1-$2 a barrel to Brent, fell sharply, leaving it at a discount of almost $12 – a record gap. This dislocation in the market receded somewhat, but problems continued well into the summer.
896;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
897;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-11-05T21:44:54Z;Transcript: View from the Top with Terry Duffy and Craig Donohue of CME Group;;"Chrystia Freeland, US managing editor, interviewed Terry Duffy and Craig Donohue of CME Group about the draft legislation for regulatory reform and the industry’s move to address some of the systemic risk issues of derivatives through central counterparty clearing. This is a transcript of that interview.FT: Thank you for joining us, gentlemen. It’s just over a year since the most intense moment in the financial crisis and one of the things that people were talking about then was the need for new financial regulation. In your view, Terry, how far have we gotten, and what’s your view on the draft legislation so far?Terry Duffy: Well, I’m not so certain we’ve gone very far in regulatory reform and it’s for a couple of different reasons. One, I think healthcare has taken precedent in Washington for whatever reason, and that has taken longer than I think anybody’s anticipated, so healthcare’s been the topic of both the House and the Senate, and I think once they get through that potential vote, they’ll start to dig in more to regulatory reform. As you know, there’s been two bills coming out of the House, one in financial services and one in agriculture, both of which are CME group supports for the most part. There are a few things in there we dislike but that’s always the case with legislation so you’re not going to be completely happy with it.FT: What’s the big sticking point?TD: A lot of the sticking points where we were concerned about regulatory arbitrages that could be created by putting different controls on US companies without a way to say how our competition is going to adhere to those same policies, which they weren’t going to have to because obviously they’re in a different jurisdiction. So, Craig and I worked very hard in Washington to make sure that policy makers understand that and they realise that we’re not just competing just here in the United States. Our business truly is global in nature and when you’re competing global in nature you can’t have one set of rules that apply to you and not to others. So, our elected officials are starting to understand that more and more each day.FT: And what about credit derivatives, do you think the regulation of the trading and credit derivatives is going to go far enough with this legislation?Craig Donohue: Well, I think that remains to be seen. I would say what’s happening right now is, even apart from the legislation, you’re seeing a tremendous movement by the industry to really address some of the systemic risk issues through central counterparty clearing. We ourselves are about to launch over-the-counter clearing services for credit default swaps, and so the industry is responding. I think it’s too soon to know what the parameters of the legislation are going to be in that regard, but we’re going to get there without that.FT: It depends on which industry, though, doesn’t it, Craig?CD: Well, I think that like all things it’s complicated. There is more liquid and standardised products where I think there is general agreement in the industry that those can be facilitated through central counterparty clearing systems, perhaps even in the case of indexes traded on an exchange, but there is a range of more complex instruments that really probably won’t be best served by an exchange-trading mechanism, an electronic platform, just because of the dynamics of the products and the complexity involved. But I think generally, on the more liquid and standardised products, people are very supportive of central counterparty clearing for that.FT: Do you worry that that loophole could become the place where most of the trading happens, though?CD: It’s very difficult to legislatively describe the nature of things that fall within the net and that fall outside of the net, and that’s a real issue. You’ve seen people say that anything that’s standardised should be traded on an exchange or cleared, and they say it’s standardised…FT: And then we just find everybody suddenly is only trading non-standardised products?CD: Right. That’s one of the reasons why that’s not a useful definition because people will make changes and adjustments in the nature of these contracts so that they perhaps might fall outside of those definitions. So we prefer, and what we have articulated, is a system of incentives that encourage people to adopt central counterparty clearing. For example, higher regulatory capital requirements for bilateral non-cleared exposures. We think that’s a smarter way to help nurture the evolution toward what we think is a much safer central counterparty clearing environment for OTC swaps.FT: And how strong has the pushback been?TD: You know, I think what is interesting twhen you look at regulation in our industry, and it’s come up here at this conference which I think some of the speakers have really done a good job highlighting it, and it’s the leverage factor. Nobody’s really addressed the leverage issues in Washington about how we’re going to regulate leverage. That is basically what got us into the crisis over a year ago was having leverage go out 40, 50, 60 times to one, versus where it was just a few years ago at five, 10, 12 times to one, so nobody’s addressed that. I think a lot of the regulation has come around what are called credit default swaps or other derivative products which are the bad things in this world. They’re not the bad things in this world. It’s how people leverage out their positions. Mark to market is very important. There was such a thing called “mark to myth” where people were just making up a price and marking it to that even though it wasn’t a liquid price. So, to Craig’s point, central clearing could help alleviate a lot of these issues and we think that legislation should get more focused on what really caused the problems and it’s not credit default swaps or derivative products that caused the crisis in America or around the world. It is clearly not the case.FT: Warren Buffet is wrong?CD: Somebody yesterday called it “mark to hope” which I liked.TD: “Mark to hope”, I like that. That’s good, “mark to hope” is good.FT: Warren Buffet is wrong to call them weapons of mass destruction?TD: Well, Warren Buffet was referring to illiquid over the counter derivative products that didn’t have such a clearing associated with them. He was not talking about listed derivative products, so I think there is a complete difference. There’s a situation where you can get into a position but you can’t get out, so that can be potentially a problem; it’s illiquid. That’s what our solution offers.FT: I’d just like to come back to this notion that these products are not in and of themselves, at least some of them, dangerous. Haven’t we seen the contrary?CD: I think in fact not. I would take issue with that. I think most of the problems that we saw were not in fact in derivatives, they were in securities, complex-structured packaged securities involving both residential and commercial mortgage obligations and other kinds of asset-backed securities, and in fact those aren’t derivatives.FT: What about AIG?CD: So, in AIG’s case, I don’t think you can make the argument that fundamentally there was a problem with the product or the instrument. I think people knew what the purchaser or seller of credit protection was buying or selling. I don’t think they had any kind of confused outcomes about that. Where was the problem? The problem was that there was not margining of the obligations on both sides, so you had a liquidity problem that really affected the financial wherewithal of AIG and brought it down.FT: Would you be supportive of a legislative push to really try to regulate all of the products that are traded, or do you think that there is still room for non-standardised?CD: I think there clearly is. If you look at the range of products that are used by people to hedge complex risks, I don’t know that you can fit them all into one market structure.FT: Well, you clearly can’t, but maybe for us as a society it would be worth not letting people have so many bespoke solutions in order to have less systemic risk.CD: I think it depends on the nature of the framework and so on, and that’s the inherent complexity of the legislative process is that you can’t do things on a gross and general level when, in fact, what needs to happen over time is you need to figure out what’s the right regulatory regime for a broad spectrum of products and risks in the marketplace.TD: And you certainly can’t have oversight of these products without trading them on an exchange and without centrally clearing them. So, some of these non-standardised products can still exist today and still conduct their business the way they do today with oversight. It doesn’t mean they have to be without oversight.FT: How useful would it be to have more of this oversight concentrated in a single regulator? How harmful is the patchwork of regulators which it looks as if will continue in the United States?CD: My view on that is I think that there are areas of specialisation and expertise and I actually think that the so-called patchwork really hasn’t contributed very much to some of the problems that we’ve had. I think there are some –FT: You don’t think that people went shopping for their regulators?CD: No more so than, as you know, people can do that all around the world. Most of the large financial institutions in the world today are global institutions with trading capabilities emanating out of a multitude of jurisdictions and so I just don’t think that you can purport to fix that in the US and think that you’ve achieved very much in a world where people can trade out of London and Shanghai and Hong Kong and Dubai, and just about any place.FT: But surely it makes a difference if you can shop for an easier-touch regulator in your own home country rather than have to move your operations overseas? That has to have an impact.CD: Nobody’s suggesting that. We certainly support having strong prudential regulation and oversight of all financial markets activities, so don’t mistake us to be promoting a race to the bottom in terms of regulatory standards, but I think that you have to be respectful of the fact that there are people who have developed regulatory frameworks, market expertise and knowledge that reside in these different agencies and they’re very effective. We’ve been very strongly opposed to the idea of combining the SEC and the CFTC because the markets are inherently different, the products are different, the reasons they’re used are different, the customers are different, the risks are different, and so you can homogenise and standardise everything and merge and consolidate everything but there are, in fact, significant dis-synergies that come with that and most the most dis-synergy would be lack of expertise and knowledge about how to appropriately regulate.FT: Couldn’t the people who have the expertise move to whichever is the new merged agency? They don’t have to be fired. They could still have jobs.TD: You would think that that makes sense but the problem is the SEC is a much larger agency than the CFTC and Craig is right for bringing this up because this is really the important point here. We’re not opposed to a single regulator per se. If that’s the way we’re going to create the world today that would probably make some sense. It’s not the way we have the world created today. We have an agency that oversees the futures business since 1972 that has actually seen without any problems since 1972, so we think that’s a good model. Our concern with a single regulator today is it will take the SEC model and overlap it onto the futures business and it just won’t apply, it won’t work, and we won’t be able to compete globally, going back to our earlier conversation, so that’s the reason we’re totally opposed to it.FT: Why would that hurt your ability to compete globally? You think that a super agency led by the SEC would be less tolerant of futures trading? What would it do that would hurt you?TD: I think there are a couple of things that could hurt us. First of all the CFTC understands our business. It’s truly a global regulator today where the SEC is not a global regulator, and I think that is one of the bigger differences that we have. So, it’s really the fear of the unknown and why would we want to run that risk of harming our business and being put into a situation, as I said earlier, with a regulatory arbitrage to other exchanges competing around the world. It just doesn’t make any sense to us.FT: In the political debate about financial reform, how much of it, in Washington, is falling along partisan lines? How much of it is based on different interest groups?TD: I think that’s an interesting question and we actually had some evidence that we’re having some bipartisan votes in Washington. Two weeks ago, out of the financial services, there were some Republican amendments that were supported by the Democratically balanced committee in financial services, so that to me says there isn’t too much partisan politics going on in Washington when it comes to regulatory reform. I think there are differences of opinion on both sides about how we should shape it, but I don’t believe there’s partisan politics going on in Washington on this particular issue, only because of the evidence we’ve seen in the votes coming out of committees. Republicans amendments being supported by Democratic members, that’s not partisan politics. That’s actually taking this very seriously and coming up with what is the best policy for regulatory reform.FT: Are you worried that the tremendous lobbying muscle of the banks will mean that they have undue influence on the shape of some of this legislation?TD: No I don’t. I think that the banks lobby like everybody else does and that’s the right we have in this country, and thank God we have that right.CD: I would say also that I think you can call it lobbying but you can also call it education and creating awareness about real substantive issues that relate to these proposals to require central counterparty clearing of over-the-counter swaps, and I think they’ve done, frankly, a good job of raising people’s awareness of the accounting issues, the cash flow and capital issues that end-user clients, who hedge risk using over-the-counter swaps, will actually have in a central counterparty clearing environment. I think those things can be overcome, so please don’t misunderstand us. We very much are proponents of central counterparty clearing for the over-the-counter swaps market, but it’s that infusion of education and creating an awareness that is actually helpful to the process because it helps to refine the language of the bills to a point where actually what gets done works and isn’t highly disruptive to the function end of the market. So, I think there’s actually a lot of value in what they’re doing.FT: Maybe financial services was disproportionately large in the economy in recent decades and maybe actually it would be a healthy thing for the economy overall for financial services to relatively be a little bit smaller.TD: I disagree with that but that’s just my opinion. I think the growth of financial services needs to continue. You look at manufacturing that’s going on in the United States, say, compared to what manufacturing there is around the rest of the world. It’s so small here today. We have some great natural resources here between agricultural products and others, but financial services is really a strong suit of the United States and I would hope it only gets bigger.FT: Thank you very much.TD: Thank you.CD: Thank you.

898;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-11-04T16:29:54Z;Capital markets: Strong growth after slight dip;;From the perspective of Brazil’s capital markets, it is almost as if the global financial crisis never happened. The country’s main equity index has gained more than 140 per cent in dollar terms this year. Both stocks and the currency are back to their levels before the collapse of Lehman Brothers.“Brazil has been a great story,” says Alvise Marino of IDEAglobal, a New York research firm. “It may have slower growth than China, but it’s a lot easier to invest in.”Such has been the pace of recovery since the downturn at the end of last year that some have started talking about a bubble. Most analysts think it is too soon to say, but the government is taking no chances.Last month, it imposed a 2 per cent tax on foreign investments in equities and fixed income instruments. Guido Mantega, finance minister, said the tax was designed to slow the exaggerated appreciation of the real, which had gained 36 per cent against the US dollar this year before the tax was introduced.The move is unlikely to have much impact on the long-term movement of stock prices or the exchange rate. But it could reduce volatility, limiting the impact of an increase in Brazilian interest rates, for example, widely expected during the first half of next year.Modern financial engineering should have little trouble sidestepping the tax. Derivatives that deliver earnings on Brazilian assets without bringing money to Brazil can be bought for about 0.5 per cent more than buying the underlying assets – much better than 2 per cent.But one area where the tax is likely to bite is among investors in equities traded both at home and overseas. Many of Brazil’s biggest companies have shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange as American Depository Receipts, which have suddenly become more attractive.“We are under friendly fire,” says Edemir Pinto, chief executive of the BM&FBovespa, the multi-asset exchange formed by the merger of the São Paulo futures and stock exchanges.The BM&FBovespa has been working hard over the past two years to attract business from other exchanges. In terms of market capitalisation, it is already the fourth largest exchange in the world, bigger than NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX combined. It has invested heavily to facilitate direct market access – or DMA, by which big traders execute trades directly on the exchange rather than through brokers – and co-location, in which big customers may install servers inside the exchange’s premises.Brazil is also seeing a surge of algorithmic trading facilitated by “complex event processing” or CEP platforms. Software companies such as Progress Apama and StreamBase, both of the US, have sold systems to at least 15 customers in São Paulo.These platforms, which quickly became standard instruments in the US and European markets over the past couple of years, help find arbitrage opportunities between assets traded in Brazil and overseas and increase the speed and therefore competitiveness with which operators can identify and execute trades.Such advances have helped create deep and liquid markets in São Paulo, encouraging some companies to issue shares even during the crisis. In June, VisaNet, the Brazilian arm of Visa, the credit card network, raised $4.3bn, in what was Brazil’s biggest initial public offering. It was topped last month when Santander, the Spanish bank, sold 14 per cent of its Brazilian operation for $8.1bn.Abundant liquidity in São Paulo was a boon to investors during the early stages of the global crisis, enabling them to withdraw funds needed to cover losses elsewhere. It has been an important factor in attracting their return.The government’s 2 per cent tax threatens to reduce liquidity, undoing much of the BM&FBovespa’s good work, Mr Pinto says. “We didn’t need to have suffered this,” he says. “Our market was one of the first in the world to recover this year and we had the promise of more IPOs this year and spectacular growth in the first half of next year. We didn’t expect such a drastic measure.”Nevertheless, the exchange continues to work on attracting foreign business. It will soon open an office in London, adding to its presence in Shanghai and New York.Before last year’s merger, the BM&F reached an order routing agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange so traders on either exchange can access products on the other. Last month the BM&FBovespa said it was discussing a similar deal on the equities side with Nasdaq OMX.
899;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-10-30T11:48:19Z;NYSE Euronext signs up investors for US futures unit;;"NYSE Euronext, the transatlantic exchange, on Friday said it had signed up five banks and proprietary traders in the futures markets as shareholders in the US unit of its NYSE Liffe futures exchange, after a year-long search for co-investors.The move gives a boost to NYSE Euronext’s effort to build a US futures exchange in competition with CME Group, which has about 98 per cent of the US futures market.NYSE Euronext said it had agreed to sell a “significant” equity stake in NYSE Liffe US to Citadel Securities, based in Chicago; Getco, a high-frequency trading firm also based in Chicago; Goldman Sachs; Morgan Stanley; and UBS.The exchange would remain the largest shareholder in the business and would continue to manage it. However Garry Jones, global head of derivatives, said NYSE Liffe would be prepared to sell up to 49 per cent of the equity. He declined to say how much the five new shareholders would have.The move is also a sign that exchanges increasingly are “re-mutualising”, with some of the biggest providers of orders in their markets as they set aside years of enmity in joint effort to make new ventures work.Mr Jones said: “Everyone realises that the OTC [over-the-counter] and listed [derivatives] worlds are getting closer together and there are some areas where financial institutions and exchanges can work together for the common good.”He said NYSE Liffe still had “a mountain to climb” in terms of its market share in US listed futures “given the size of the incumbent, but given the size of these new shareholders people may start to take us more seriously now”.“In British footballing terms, this takes it from the championship to the premier league now,” he said.The day-to-day operations of NYSE Liffe’s US business will operate under the supervision of a separate board of directors, chaired by Jim McNulty, a former chief executive of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.NYSE Liffe US launched trading in September last year with gold and silver futures contracts that NYSE Liffe bought from the CME, which had been forced to divest them after its acquisition of the Chicago Board of Trade.The exchange expanded into equity index futures with the launch of futures on MSCI Emerging Markets and other MSCI indices last month.NYSE Liffe US intends to clear its US interest rate futures at New York Portfolio Clearing, a joint venture with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.This will allow market participants to pool margin collateral for bonds and derivatives in one place for the first time, reducing the amount of margin collateral that is usually required to trade multiple assets."
900;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-10-29T12:34:08Z;CME profits fall on lower trading volumes;;CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, reported on Thursday that its profits in the third quarter fell by one-fifth, as the hangover from the financial crisis continued to impact trading volumes and regulatory uncertainty weighs on the industry.The company said that, excluding extraordinary charges, its net income in the quarter was $223m or $3.35 per share, down from $278m or $4.13 per share in the same period last year but in line with analysts’ expectations.The CME dominates the US listed futures sector, with a market share of about 98 per cent. The sector has seen trading volumes fall by about one-quarter from last year, both as a result of deleveraging by big financial institutions and because trading houses have adopted a “wait and see” approach as Washington debates how it will overhaul the regulation of the US financial sector in the wake of the crisis.The company’s reported results included a $19m writedown related to its 15 per cent stake in Imarex, a Norwegian-based freight and energy exchange and interdealer broker, which the CME acquired last year as part of its $7.6bn purchase of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Nymex had bought the Imarex stake the previous year for $52m.As with many other companies that have reported earnings in recent weeks, the results also reflected cost-cutting, with expenses down to $244m from $272m last year.Terry Duffy, CME chairman, said volumes this month had grown strongly, particularly for foreign exchange and energy products. “As the economy continues to stabilise, there is room for further organic growth in our core business,” he said.Mr Duffy has argued in recent weeks that politicians on Capitol Hill need to make quick progress in passing financial regulation legislation so as to give clarity to the futures industry. “We are actively working to ensure that the benefits our business model brings to the financial system are communicated to the legislators and regulators who are charged with regulatory reform,” he said.The CME hopes to benefit from the sentiment in Washington to push private over-the-counter derivatives through central clearing counterparties, such as the CME’s clearing house, that will guarantee both sides of the trade. The CME aims to establish a clearing platform for credit default swaps by December.Craig Donohue, chief executive, said the company was also focused on global growth and had hired marketing and sales staff with that aim in mind.
901;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-10-29T00:51:52Z;Futures rivalry set to intensify;;A dispute between two new US futures exchanges that want to break open the CME Group’s near-monopoly on US Treasury futures will intensify on Thursday, when a company backed by some of Wall Street’s biggest names will urge Washington regulators to reject a proposal by NYSE Euronext for a new clearing venture.NYSE Euronext announced this month that it had struck a deal with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade services group, to create a clearing house that would clear both cash Treasuries and Treasury futures.By offering customers portfolio margining across both products, the companies expect the new venture to attract traders looking to make more efficient use of their capital.But even before the joint venture has been submitted to US regulators for approval, it has been attacked by ELX, a fledgling exchange backed by a consortium including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan that competes with the CME on listed US Treasury futures and has garnered 3 per cent of the market.ELX claims the arrangement is anti-competitive, since it is likely to be exclusive for at least two years, preventing ELX from setting up a similar arrangement with the DTCC. As a low-cost “utility” clearing house created by statute, the DTCC should not be allowed to strike such a deal, ELX argues.NYSE Euronext says the exclusive period is necessary to establish the new venture – dubbed New York Portfolio Clearing – and make sure it is operating as planned. After that time, it plans to open the clearing house to other organisations such as ELX.Neal Wolkoff, ELX’s chief executive, is developing a reputation for being something of a mosquito in the futures world: small but unafraid to sting bigger beasts in the industry such as NYSE and the CME.In recent weeks, he has spearheaded a legal challenge to the CME, the world’s biggest futures exchange, securing approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, for “Exchange of Futures for Futures” (EFF) trades, in which traders can translate trades from one futures exchange to another through a private, off-exchange transaction.The EFF issue raises the spectre of fungibility: the ability of traders to open a position at one exchange and close it at another. Fungibility is anathema to the CME, which completely dominates the US listed futures sector and has a powerful clearing house that processes trades transacted on its exchange and collects margins.At the same time, Mr Wolkoff is taking on the NYSE. In a letter to be delivered to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, ELX claims that NYSE is attempting to prevent it from making an official complaint about the proposal by proposing to submit a “draft amendment” to change the DTCC’s rules.“The acceptance of draft amendments would harm ELX because it would delay its ability to object to a proposal that is anti-competitive,” the letter states. “We assume that such a filing would not be publicly available [and] would not permit ELX or anyone else to object.”The letter asks the SEC to refuse any “draft filing” and instead require the DTCC to submit the proposal in a more formal, public way that would enable objections.NYSE Euronext would not comment directly on the ELX letter.
902;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-10-27T22:09:35Z;LSE to ring changes to rival NYSE bell;;The world’s share trading pits may be emptying but the London Stock Exchange plans to revive the glamour of the “opening bell” that marks the start of daily trading to boost its brand amid fierce competition from rivals.The exchange closed its pits in 1986 and now marks the start of trading by activating balls on a mobile sculpture in the lobby of its headquarters.But the sculpture – known as “The Source” – is to be dumped in favour of something else that aims to match the branding power of the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.John Wallace, LSE spokesman, said: “We are looking at ways to spruce up our ‘market open’ event. We want to give clients who come to the exchange something to remember the occasion by.” He declined to say what was being planned.With electronic trading a common feature across all trading facilities, exchanges need to recreate the rituals associated with a bygone era to help distinguish themselves from upstart rivals.In the US, BATS Exchange and Direct Edge have helped drive the NYSE’s share of trading in NYSE-listed shares below 30 per cent in recent years.The NYSE is in the midst of overhauling its trading floor, still home to 1,100 brokers and market-makers.Daily business television broadcasts from the floor are part of maintaining a distinct image.Rich Adamonis, a NYSE spokesman, said the exchange started inviting companies doing IPOs to ring the opening bell in the 1990s, when business television started taking off. “It’s part of the brand and what people expect to see.”Nasdaq has a daily opening bell ceremony in a special studio for the purpose.CME Group, the Chicago-based futures exchange, also hosts daily network television broadcasts from its dwindling pits.In Europe, Chi-X and Turquoise have taken a toll on incumbent exchanges as well, with the LSE’s share of trading in FTSE 100 stocks yesterday at 56 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters.In a nod to the same traditions, Turquoise commissioned the creation of a brass bell in London to mark its launch a year ago.
903;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-10-26T02:12:39Z;Postcard from Chicago: when will Congress act?;;When three Irish-Americans head off for a steak dinner in Chicago, you know there is serious business being done.Last week, the city’s mayor Richard M. Daley slipped out of a charity event that rounded off this year’s Futures Industry Association “Expo” with Terry Duffy, chairman of CME Group and vice-chairman Charlie Carey.Chicago’s failed Olympic bid was probably not on the agenda. Best not to mention it in front of the mayor at all. More likely, they discussed the effect of the Obama administration’s plans to tighten regulation of derivatives.The subject is close to the mayor’s heart, as futures generate considerable employment for the Midwestern capital. The new generation of “high-frequency” traders, springing up in the city, are the latest manifestation of that, and are driving the emergence of scores of previously unheard-of trading technology companies, such as IDC Global, a data centre and colocation company, headquartered in the suburbs.As far as the CME is concerned, regulatory reform cannot happen soon enough. So far, two bills mandating greater clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) swaps and tighter oversight of dealers in such markets have emerged from the House of Representatives. But the Senate has yet to take up the issue.Mr Duffy believes that as long as there is “regulatory uncertainty”, trading volumes will remain constrained as traders hold back. He complained at the FIA event that “a lot of the long-dated forward stuff” – futures contracts – was not being traded as a result.Another sudden market downturn could drive Congress into irrational decisions, he argued. Also, looming US midterm elections could start to act as a drag on legislative progress.John Damgard, FIA president, argued that the legislative process should be allowed to take its own time, which as he knows as a veteran of Washington, can be a very long time.The industry stood a better chance, he said, of getting “sensible legislation” the more time was allowed for dissipation of public anger against the banks. “My sense is that rather than rush through we need more time.”CME Group – and other exchanges and clearing houses – have taken a look at the two House bills and, while there are things they do not like, the industry has already banked a few certainties: more clearing and more on-exchange trading of OTC products.And the sooner the new regulatory regime is set in stone, the fewer chances there can be for special interest lobbying – like the lobbying that saw a last-minute amendment to the House financial services committee’s OTC derivatives bill that (had it not eventually been struck out) would have limited banks’ voting rights in clearing houses to 20 per cent.For the banks, the longer Congress takes over legislation the more opportunities there are for pushback against the more – to them – irksome provisions in bills. The idea that regulators, not clearing houses and their members, should decide what OTC products can and should be cleared is a non-starter, for example.Patrice Blanc, chief executive of Newedge, the world’s largest futures broker, told the conference he was also alarmed by how little discussion there had been of the potential for concentration of risk in a clearing house if more OTC products are forced onto clearers. He was also skeptical whether clearers would benefit monetarily.Few dare predict with confidence whether Congress will produce anything concrete before the year-end. The key job of chairman of the senate agriculture committee recently switched hands, and all eyes are on Arkansas senator Blanche Lincoln to see how soon she takes up OTC derivatives legislation. In the meantime, plenty of time for more steak dinners.
904;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Watchdog warns over traders’ limits;;The US must not unilaterally impose limits on the trading positions that traders may take in oil and commodity futures and should enlist the support of the G20 group of industrialised nations to crack down on speculation, a leading regulator warned on Thursday.The comments by Michael Dunn, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), are a sign that efforts by the US futures regulator to tackle “excessive speculation” in derivatives and commodity markets by capping holdings are running into trouble.Mr Dunn carries a “swing” vote at the CFTC, whose other four commissioners – including the chairman, Gary Gensler – appear split on the issue.The futures industry is lobbying against any imposition of position limits, with the CME – the largest US futures exchange operator – arguing that the move would send trading to rival financial centres overseas.Mr Dunn said he would be opposed to unilateral position limits by the US if similar international moves were not pursued.“I just believe that for us to take unilateral action is detrimental to our ability to regulate the market place if the trades migrate overseas. It has to be something for the G20 working with the FSB [Financial Stability Board] and Iosco [International Organisation of Securities Commissions]“They have to get involved. All of these countries should be concerned. I think it is something they need to bring up and talk about,” Mr Dunn told the Financial Times at a Futures Industry Association conference.The UK’s Financial Services Authority sees no need to impose position limits in London’s vast oil markets. However, this week the European Commission proposed rules giving regulators the authority to set limits to counter “excessive price movements or excessive concentration of speculative positions”.US lawmakers may force the CFTC’s hand. The House agriculture committee on Wednesday approved an amendment to derivatives legislation that would require CFTC to impose position limits on commodities concurrently across markets, including US exchanges, over-the-counter swap markets and foreign trading over which it has jurisdiction.“The reason for that is to mitigate any regulatory arbitrage between those platforms and prevent a loss of trading on US exchanges,” said a spokesman for co-sponsor Debbie Halvorson, the Illinois Democrat.CME Group, headquartered in Chicago, seeks to keep its existing authority to set limits on trading most commodities. But if CFTC gains the power to police over-the-counter trading, CME has said the commission should adopt an aggregate limit for the total positions held in all of the markets.CFTC Commissioner Bart Chilton, a Democratic appointee, reiterated in a speech in Houston on Wednesday that the agency should set limits at a high level to keep traders from fleeing US exchanges. “I think at first we need to ensure we do no harm, yet establish a system to guard against excessive speculation,” he said in a statement.
905;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Wavering CFTC;;Though it is one of America’s chief market regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has shown a shaky grasp of the basic forces that determine prices – supply and demand. In recent days though, key commissioners have softened their tone on limiting “excessive speculation” as it became clear proposed rules would drive business to unregulated products or foreign exchanges with little effect on prices.Consider the impact of suggestions over the summer that the CFTC would more strictly interpret futures position limits. A leading natural gas exchange traded fund suspended share issuance in early August. Pent-up demand then sent existing shares to a highly unusual 20 per cent premium over its underlying futures contracts. The fund fixed the distortion by backing new shares with lightly-regulated swaps. Gas futures have since rallied by 45 per cent anyway. Or how about a month ago when the CME Group issued a warning on position limits, sending crude oil futures skidding? In the next month crude surged by nearly $10 a barrel.The idea of position limits was discouraged by a 2008 multi-agency report led by the CFTC itself that concluded speculation was not a key factor in energy price spikes. But this summer, a commissioner with deep agribusiness ties promised a “new and better report” concluding otherwise. The facts had not changed, and the price of oil had meanwhile halved, but emasculated financial services firms were less able to lobby against the farm-state politicians who help oversee the CFTC.The CFTC’s proper role is to be a watchdog, limiting dangerous bets and ferreting-out market manipulation. It is not equipped to distinguish good from bad speculation and should resist political pressure from people who crave, say, cheap diesel for tractors and pricey corn. Markets cannot function that way.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
906;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-10-20T15:57:48Z;Carbon trading: Greenhouse gases offer growth prospects;;Traditionally, the words “carbon trading” have been accompanied by the word “potential” – as in the prediction by its proponents that carbon dioxide emissions have the potential to become the world’s biggest commodity within the next few decades.Emissions trading has grown rapidly since the introduction of the Kyoto Protocol, with healthy markets in United Nations and European Union credits.However, the lack of a national mandatory carbon regime in the US has meant that what should be the world’s biggest carbon market has developed as a relatively small-scale patchwork of voluntary and regional trading schemes.Now, however, with the US poised to come on board, carbon trading may finally fulfil its potential.The House of Representatives passed cap-and-trade legislation in June.The Senate is debating its own version of the bill, and the Obama administration is keen to see signi­ficant progress before December’s UN climate conference takes place in Copenhagen.While that may prove too ambitious a deadline, many US companies are already operating under the supposition that carbon trading under a federally mandated programme is inevitable.At a time when derivatives trading has fallen in the wake of the financial crisis, volumes for trading greenhouse-gas emissions futures have exploded on the Chicago Climate Futures Exchange (CCFE), the US’s biggest platform.CCFE had a record month in September, with 203,794 contracts traded – 16 per above the previous record set in June this year.However, at the same time, trading volumes have fallen markedly for the voluntary carbon-emission permits traded at the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), which along with CCFE and the European Climate Exchange is part of the Climate Exchange group. Volumes are down more than 40 per cent since last year.In part, that reflects concerns about how the carbon financial instruments traded on CCX will be accommodated within any federal regime, says Jim Kharouf, editor of the Environmental Markets Newsletter, part of John Lothian & Co, an online financial media firm in Chicago.Mr Kharouf says: “The futures market is arguably the safer market to be in, because you can just close out the position – you’re not actually holding the physical contract.”Richard Sandor, who founded CCX and serves as its chairman and chief executive, concedes that “legislative uncertainty is clearly a factor in our markets”.However, the House bill embraces CCX credits and Mr Sandor – who counts President Barack Obama and Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff, among his backers – says he is “continuing to work with Congress and policymakers in Washington”.Ultimately, Congress may not pass any legislation at all. A climate change bill failed to make it through the Senate last year.The House version passed by just 219 votes to 212. There could be further resistance when it comes to reconciling the two versions, fuelled by fears that cap-and-trade could kill jobs in the industrial heartland and raise electricity prices.Experts say the market will continue to develop even if the US fails to pass federal legislation.There is already one mandatory regional cap-and-trade programme – the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which includes 10 US states and applies to power producers.Other regional efforts – such as the Western Climate Initiative (made up of seven US states and four Canadian provinces) and the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (six US states and one Canadian province) – may become mandatory if efforts in Washington stumble. The US Environmental Protection Agency could also create a carbon market.That seemingly inexorable growth is prompting competition. CCX and CCFE are braced for a renewed challenge from the Green Exchange, a venture backed by the CME Group, the world’s biggest commodities exchange, and some of the biggest emissions traders, including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, ICAP and Evolution Markets.Tom Lewis, chief executive of Green Exchange, thinks that, with federal legislation, the US carbon market could soon be worth $600bn, dwarf­ing the European market.Green Exchange’s challenge should not be underestimated, says Mr Kharouf. “Once we have a national market they’ll be in a good spot.“They have all the big players, who would love to have a second carbon market here. So we could see two or more liquid carbon markets in the US.”Mr Sandor says he welcomes competition. “We see it as raising awareness and helping develop carbon markets,” he says, but adds: “We’ve had a great start and are confident in our ability to prevail in these markets.”
907;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-10-16T14:43:11Z;US futures row reopens fungibility debate;;The CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, is under fire from a fledgling rival that accuses it of blocking competition by refusing to accept futures contracts from other trading venues and to allow trades transacted at the CME to be cleared elsewhere.ELX – which is backed by some of Wall Street’s biggest names, including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan – this week received approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, for “Exchange of Futures for Futures” (EFF) trades, in which traders can translate trades from one futures exchange to another through a private, off-exchange transaction.Since futures exchanges are permitted to deny what they deem “non-competitive” contracts into their clearing houses, the CME maintains that the CFTC’s ruling does not force it to accept such contracts.“The CFTC has told us we don’t have to accept the trades,” Allan Schoenberg, a CME spokesman, told the FT. “They’re not going to enforce it.”ELX, which had touted the CFTC ruling as a victory and which disputes the CME’s justification for denying the transactions, reacted angrily. “The CME is a self-regulatory organisation and is granted rule enforcement authority to enforce rules in the public interest,” the exchange said in a release on Thursday. “Rule enforcement powers cannot be used arbitrarily to protect competitive position or share price.”ELX’s challenge raises the spectre of fungibility – the ability of traders to open a position at one exchange and close it at another. While fungibility has long been a feature of the equity and options markets, it is anathema to the CME, which has a near-monopoly in the US futures sector and a powerful clearing house that processes trades transacted on its exchange and collects margins.Accepting EFF trades would cut to the heart of the CME’s business model, raising the prospect that other clearing houses could compete to clear the contracts transacted on the CME.The dispute revives a long-simmering issue within the industry. As far back as 2003, an attempt by Eurex, the German derivatives exchange group, to compete with the Treasury futures traded at the Chicago Board of Trade (now part of the CME) foundered, in part because the CFTC ruled that “open interest” – trades left open at the end of a trading day – must be shifted from Eurex’s clearer to the CME’s clearing house.The CME’s tight control over clearing also helped scupper an attempt the following year by Euronext-Liffe (now part of NYSE Euronext) to break into the market for eurodollar interest-rate futures.Last year, the CME’s share price plunged after staff at the US Department of Justice recommended in a letter to the Treasury that clearing houses should be separated from the futures exchanges that own them.Gary Gensler, the CFTC’s current chairman, has also indicated that he wants fungibility in the over-the-counter swap market – an area that CME is hoping to enter by offering clearing for credit derivatives, foreign exchange and interest-rate contracts. Although Mr Gensler has clarified that he does not intend to extend this to listed futures, it has raised again what remains for CME an uncomfortable issue.Rich Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill in New York, suggested that the CFTC’s ruling was vague enough to allow both exchanges to interpret it in their own way. “We’ve reviewed the CFTC’s final EFF approval letter and in our interpretation at best, it is unclear on this issue,” he wrote in a research note.
908;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-10-14T09:41:36Z;Signs of recovery as Mondo Visione exchange index rises;;The share values of the world’s main listed exchanges grew by 6.4 per cent in September compared with the previous month, signalling “further signs that the sector is returning to buoyancy”, according to the FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index.Sixteen of the 18 exchanges listed on the index saw growth in the past month, with BM&F Bovespa leading the charge. Its share price rose by 17.6 per cent last month, and by 65.7 per cent over the past year.Herbie Skeete, managing director of Mondo Visione, said: “It looks as though the exchange sector is beginning to return to health. Listed exchanges have been forced to engage in some significant cost cutting in order to improve performance and remain competitive.“Year to date, we are, however, seeing the recovery continue and the exchanges sector persist in outpacing the rest of the market.”The index’s worst performer was Nasdaq OMX, whose shares fell 4.1 per cent in September.Compared with September 2008, the share price of CME Group fell 17 per cent last month, that of Deutsche Börse fell by 9 per cent and the London Stock Exchange by 11 per cent.
909;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-10-08T23:27:26Z;CME head backs derivatives reform;;A powerful exchange chief has brushed aside concerns in the US and Europe over the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, in comments likely to bolster support for the proposed reforms.Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are insisting that most OTC derivatives be shifted onto formal exchanges and processed through clearing houses, a move that would require companies to post cash margins against all hedging transactions.Terry Duffy, chairman of CME Group, the largest US futures exchange, said he had “no sympathy” for companies that wanted to escape the requirement to post collateral, because the cost of failed trades frequently fell to the taxpayer.“I understand business and the cost of capital is expensive, but at the same time, maybe some of these transactions shouldn’t be done if people can’t afford to collateralise them,” he said.Several large US and European industrial companies fear they could have to raise tens of billions of dollars because of a proposed regulatory crackdown on OTC derivatives, and have stepped up opposition to the plans.Eon, Europe’s largest utility, said it might have to raise about €7.5bn (£6.9bn) in new credit lines or extra cash reserves if the proposals from the European Commission were passed.Clearing OTC derivatives through a clearing house would oblige companies to set aside extra cash – “margin” – to guarantee the trades.Many large non-financial companies do not have to post margin on trades when they deal directly with banks.Mr Duffy said tighter regulations would help eliminate some of the risks in the system that resulted in taxpayers in the US and Europe bailing out financial institutions in the wake of the financial crisis. “The taxpayer should not have to bear that burden,” he said.The crisis would have been less severe if all derivatives had been cleared by a central counterparty, he said.“No customer has ever lost a penny as the result of a clearing member default at CME Group. That includes the Great Depression and up through this most recent economic failure. Our system works because we operate a zero debt or twice daily mark-to-market system.”Mr Duffy was speaking at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong during a three-day trip to Asia.The CME, which has strategic partnerships with exchanges in South Korea and Malaysia, was looking to forge relationships in India and China, Mr Duffy said.
910;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;First steps towards clearing for FX;;"Scarcely a week goes by without regulators and politicians in the US and Europe insisting that the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets need to be made safer by expanding the use of central clearing houses.The foreign exchange markets are increasingly caught up in this debate, even though – unlike certain other parts of the OTC markets – they did not contribute to the financial
crisis.Unlike other OTC markets, the main post-trade worry in FX is settlement risk – the chance that one party to a trade pays out the currency it sold but does not receive the currency it bought. This is particularly of concern in the spot FX market where settlement takes place quickly.The other worry is counterparty risk, which refers to the risk that one side in a deal defaults. In the case of FX – and other OTC – derivatives, this is of particular concern because parties engaged in long-term contracts can find themselves faced with additional credit risks if one party defaults before a contract matures. This is also known as market replacement risk.Counterparty credit risk in the FX market tends to be more of a factor in
longer-dated FX derivatives like forwards, FX options and in cross currency swaps – not the spot FX market.Until recently there has been little demand for the extension of clearing into FX derivatives, as counterparty risk has not been seen as a major threat. But in a report published last month, the Bank of England highlighted a recent revival of interest in FX clearing for the sector.It said: “Overall, existing bilateral collateral agreements were successful in mitigating credit risk exposures between FX market counterparties following the default of both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers last year.“However, liquidity in certain market segments, and in particular FX forwards, was impaired during the second half of 2008, perhaps suggesting that market participants remained concerned about their counterparty exposures despite the bilateral arrangements already in place.”That helps explain why there is a series of initiatives underway among some of the world’s largest clearing houses to come up with new FX post-trade mechanisms.In 2006, CME Group unveiled a joint venture with Reuters in the shape of a trading platform for FX called FXMarketSpace, with clearing coming later. But the venture was closed down in October last year as participants did not feel the need for clearing services.However, in recent weeks CME Group has said it will take a second run at clearing FX. It plans to launch a service through its Clearport clearing system covering all products within FX, including FX spot, forwards, swaps, all at five-year maturities, with FX options to follow later.Craig Donohue, chief executive of CME Group, says: “As the events of the past 12 months attest, structural risks such as counterparty risk and regulatory reform are creating yet another wave of change in global FX markets. We see these changes as excellent opportunities to continue to innovate our products.”LCH.Clearnet is also working on FX clearing of FX swaps and futures, which will involve CLS Group, the FX settlement system, and key dealers.Yet as the Bank of England report pointed out, the FX markets have specific characteristics that mean any clearing solutions will have to be well thought-out.The Bank said that while clearing would be suitable for longer-dated products like FX forwards, FX options and cross-currency swaps, these products are sometimes less standardised, “possibly making them less suitable for clearing”.“Moreover, a [clearer] that focuses solely on a sub-set of FX products (such as spot or forwards) might have an adverse impact on FX hedging strategies and inadvertently increase individual credit exposures,” it said.In addition, it is not yet clear what added costs would be involved for FX market participants if clearing was expanded.Rachael Hoey, director of business development at CLS, says: “You have another layer of up-front investment costs as well as ongoing operational costs that come to clearing and the question is, does the industry bear it?”She says that as clearers come up with mechanisms, the industry will evaluate their models, “but I think the evaluation has to be on the basis ‘is this good business?’ – and I don’t think the industry knows the answer”.CLS already processes trades in real time for settlement for most of the main banks today, handling about 50 per cent of global FX trading volumes. The system matches both sides of a trade – it does not stand as a central counterparty – and then nets each member bank’s total obligation.The organisation says that FX liquidity was “impaired” in the second half of last year – especially for FX forwards and swaps – “perhaps suggesting that market participants remained concerned about their counterparty exposures”.But CLS believes that a major priority for the industry must be to further eliminate settlement risk, not focus on reducing replacement risk that may not be as serious an issue.The Bank for International Settlements last year warned that more action was needed to reduce settlement risk in the FX market, which has an estimated daily turnover of $3,200bn, to avoid a serious meltdown in the global financial systemIn a letter to the European Commission in response to its proposed reforms of the OTC derivatives markets in general, CLS said: “Unlike longer dated OTC markets such as interest rate swaps, FX trades tend to be (very) short dated.“Excluding spot trades, from our data repository, 75 per cent of the total value for FX forwards and FX swaps mature within four months. It is hard to argue that the replacement risk on FX poses a systemic risk to the financial markets.”The Bank of England says there is “broad consensus” that more discussion is needed on the possibility of introducing clearing in FX “to ensure that they
take into account the specific characteristics of the…market”."
911;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-09-28T11:34:41Z;Banks and service providers prepare for return of hedge funds;;"What is fast, trades around the clock and across borders – and in huge size? It is of course the FX market but the description also fits hedge funds, which were the fastest-growing power in the market before the crisis.Then, banks and other service providers were queuing up to provide services to the sector but in the last year, the funds have pulled back for a variety of reasons.Now those same banks and service providers are readying for the return of the funds and say the signs are there that the recovery is beginning.“Funds now have a handle on what they have and can now go back into the market. They didn’t pull back out of choice, it was forced on them. Now interest in FX is picking up again,” says Derek Samman, global head of foreign exchange at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.Hedge funds’ interest grew as the technology improved; between 2004 and 2007, transactions between banks and other non-bank financial institutions such as hedge funds, more than doubled.The funds were intrigued by the ability to trade different strategies and ideas in a genuinely round-the-clock market. It is these qualities that participants believe are bringing the hedge fund sector back to the currency market.“Throughout the crisis, FX demonstrated how liquid a market it is. You can access the market for hedging and for investment purposes. You can invest to express macro views, short-term views, you can play correlations region by region,” says Frederic Boillereau, global head of FX at HSBC, which will shortly extend its prime brokerage offering to cover FX.Although Mr Boillereau does not believe the funds will enjoy the same sort of easy conditions and extreme leverage seen before the crisis, he is confident the sector will return in some force.“This is a growing asset class – the range of participants is wider than just hedge funds,” he adds.“People – even some hedge funds – used to think FX was just part of the process of investing overseas. Now they’re saying: ‘Let’s learn to use this properly’.”The volatility seen during the crisis – which pushed volumes to records but crushed some funds – in fact helped pull the survivors back in, bankers believe.“It’s very difficult to ignore the effect of FX volatility on your portfolio. You can see FX as a source of administrative problems, of opportunity or a source of risk and it’s this point that has now become abundantly clear to everyone,” says Chris Hansen, head of global macro services and clearing at Deutsche Bank.Paul Houston, head of FX prime services at Credit Suisse, says hedge funds are now reconsidering their choice of prime broker.“The choice is no longer purely driven by operational and cost considerations. Hedge funds are placing greater emphasis upon their prime broker’s credit standing and balance sheet. This means there have been clear winners and losers over the last year.”"
912;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;CME, Citadel abandon plan for CDS trading platform;;The CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, and Citadel, the hedge fund, on Friday abandoned efforts to establish a trading platform for the $27,000bn credit default swap market.The move came after a year-long effort by the groups, which conceded on Friday that they could not attract any interest from the Wall Street banks that are the main dealers in the contracts.The move is an embarrassing setback for two of the US’s most powerful financial institutions, which touted their solution as a transparent and efficient alternative to the structural risks in the market for agreements such as credit default swaps.That pitch was made as financial regulators in the US and Europe pushed for reform to help safeguard the financial system against the catastrophic effects of defaults.The opacity of CDS contracts – which offer insurance against banks, companies and governments defaulting on debt – has been blamed for aggravating the financial crisis. Currently, CDS contracts are private bilateral deals, which raises the potential problem that one side will not pay out in the event of default. The near-collapse of Bear Stearns and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers last year highlighted the counterparty risks associated with the contracts.The failure of the venture by the two Chicago-based companies indicates the strength of the opposition to overhauling the market among the Wall Street powerhouses that collectively deal about 80 per cent of all CDS trades.Terry Duffy, the CME’s chairman, admitted that neither the CDS dealers nor their customers had warmed to the notion of trading on an exchange rather than bilaterally. “Both buy-side and sell-side participants have expressed an interest in continuing to execute their CDS transactions the same as they do today,” he said.However, the CME said it would refocus its efforts on offering clearing services for CDS contracts. The exchange said that, as well as Citadel, it had signed up a string of customers to be founding members of the clearing initiative – including AllianceBernstein, BlackRock, BlueMountain Capital Management, DE Shaw and Pimco – and said it would launch a pilot programme in the coming weeks with leading dealers.That effort faces an uphill struggle because IntercontinentalExchange, the CME’s Atlanta-based rival, has been making headway in its CDS clearing ventures on both sides of the Atlantic. In contrast to the CME, ICE formed a consortium with banks such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which dominate CDS trading.ICE’s US clearing house for CDS has cleared more than 24,000 contracts with a notional value of more than $2,000bn since its launch in March, while its European venture has cleared €313bn since it began processing European CDS indices in July.
913;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-09-17T17:55:34Z;ASX chief hits at US regulatory shake-up;;The chief executive of the Australian Securities Exchange has criticised the Obama administration’s planned regulatory reforms of the US financial system, arguing they are “draconian” and out of touch with market developments.Robert Elstone, head of the ASX, said the reforms were too broad, targeting parts of the securities markets – such as the over-the-counter swaps market – that had not been big contributors to the global financial crisis.Washington’s efforts to co-ordinate oversight of the securities and futures markets have come under fire in the US, with exchanges there arguing that a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation would be damaging.The CME, the world’s biggest derivatives exchange, this month warned against removing differences in the way securities and futures are overseen, arguing the two markets served different purposes and different types of customers.Mr Elstone said in an interview with the Financial Times that the proposed reforms in the US were extremely comprehensive.“It is probably addressing issues that have not been particularly problematic and by inference it’s saying we don’t really care. But instead of addressing the areas that have been clearly problematic, like the credit default swap market, we will endeavour to bring in a transparency regime for the entire suite of over-the-counter derivative markets.”He said it was not a question of “bashing the US,” adding that regulators around the world were struggling to keep pace with either product innovation or market structure evolution.“I think that the notion that any corporate or government regulatory agencies are always going to be one or two steps ahead of the market is a flawed notion.”The best hope for regulators and governments, he said, was to develop market-oriented people and market-oriented skills to stay abreast of developments in the securities industries.The OTC swaps market was already transparent, he said, adding that to compel that market to come “on exchange and be centrally cleared” was “overkill”.He also highlighted the growth around the world of so-called dark pools, which promote the trading of large blocks of shares away from the public order book of an exchange.“It’s ironic isn’t it that when the Obama-Geithner package is pushing for more transparency, particularly in wholesale financial markets, we’re seeing the early signs of movements for the reverse,” he said in a reference to dark pools.“That’s clearly an untenable situation, where you are seeing through one prism a push for more and more transparency and yet a movement towards more dark pools and off market activity,” he said.
914;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CFTC finds regulators hostile to position limits;;A senior official at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission said foreign counterparts did not share his agency’s views on limiting energy speculation, underscoring the risks of traders migrating overseas to avoid a crackdown.“I find no other regulator in the world that is sympathetic to setting position limits,” Michael Dunn, one of four CFTC commissioners, said. He raised concerns about impacts “this will have on our markets here in the United States if we do this unilaterally”.Mr Dunn was speaking on Wednesday at the third meeting of the commission’s energy and environmental markets committee, established after oil soared above $100 a barrel last year.The session focused on the CFTC’s proposal to cap large traders’ presence in energy markets by taking direct control of position limits now set by self-regulated organisations such as the New York Mercantile Exchange.Nymex parent CME Group wants to retain the power to set and police these limits.It expanded on this position in a paper on Wednesday, offering to add new limits on energy products with any delivery date. The exchange operator said rival markets should submit to the same limits.CME recommended that the CFTC be given authority to enforce similar limits in bilateral energy derivatives markets, where participants from energy companies to pension funds strike customised over-the-counter deals.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of energy markets operator IntercontinentalExchange, instead wants the CFTC to take charge of any new trading limits and exemptions from them. Giving individual exchanges the right to set exemptions is “rife with potential for anticompetitive behaviour”, he said.The CFTC in July started regulating ICE’s main natural gas swap, subjecting it to the same rules as a key Nymex gas futures product.
915;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-09-06T08:24:46Z;Regulators could ruin ETF game;;"Experienced parents are familiar with the situation. There is a happy silence and an absence of small children from the immediate area. One parent looks at the other and says: “Go see what they’re doing and tell them to stop it.”In the same way, the US regulators and other authorities seem to be threatening the happy playtime of commodity-linked exchange traded products, which till very recently had been busily putting together new vehicles to offer investors exposure to oil, natural gas, agricultural commodities and the like.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has gone to find out what exactly commodity investors are up to.“In the CFTC’s eyes, ETFs fall under the heading of a speculator, which it defines as a market player who invests in commodities for financial reasons and does not take physical delivery of the commodities underlying a futures contract,” according to commentary from John Keogh, managing director of Susquehanna International Securities, an ETF market maker. ETPs are products similar to exchange traded funds in the way they trade and settle, but they do not have a mutual fund
structure.Global assets in commodity ETPs and ETFs have soared from $6bn (£3.7bn, €4.2bn) in December 2005 to $95bn in August 2009, according to figures from Barclays Global Investors. The majority of this is in the US, which boasts $65bn in the products, compared to Europe which has just $25bn.The CFTC, which regulates both commodity futures and the ETPs that use such futures in the US, has imposed stringent limits on the positions they can take, leading to the effective closure to new capital of a number of
products.In Europe, where commodity ETFs and ETPs have also been building assets at an astounding rate, industry participants are gazing nervously across the pond.“It’s business as usual here, but we’re watching it [developments in the US] closely,” says Hector McNeil, chief executive of ETF Securities, which manages $13bn in exchange traded commodities.The iShares S&P GSCI Commodity Index Trust; the iPath Dow Jones-AIG Natural Gas ETN and the United States Natural Gas Fund have all announced they will not issue any new shares, while one exchange traded note, the Powershares DB Crude Oil Double Long ETN, is to be withdrawn entirely.Interested commentators are quick to point out there are significant differences between the European and US markets. Most importantly, according to Jan Altmann of 4assetmanagement, a Frankfurt-based ETF consultancy, the European products are largely swap-based.“The risk and all the processes are outsourced to an investment bank, or multiple investment banks,” says Mr Altmann. Even a swap-based ETF, however, implies the underlying futures must be bought at some point, but both Mr Altmann and Mr McNeil say there are mitigating factors that make the swap-based structure more robust. “With swaps you can net off exposures so only the net ends up on the futures exchange,” says Mr McNeil, whose company runs both long and short ETPs. “You aggregate, which lessens the demand for actual futures.”In theory, the counterparty to the swap does not absolutely need to buy the underlying futures, since it could decide it would find the income stream needed to meet the swap obligation in some other way.However, in practice most investment banks will hedge their exposure through the futures market.Even with netting shorts against longs, this can lead to large positions in the futures market.Until recently, US ETFs had letters of exemption from the CFTC allowing them to exceed the standard limits for financial investors, but a number of these have been withdrawn recently amid concern the ETFs are distorting futures markets.This followed a July report from a US Senate committee on the impact of “excessive speculation” on futures markets, particularly in wheat. The committee concluded the presence of ETP investors had distorted the market and recommended the CFTC reinstate the limits.Although the withdrawal of exemptions on position limits has led to a number of affected ETFs declaring they will not issue any more shares, that was not the only development for US commodity ETPs.As the US Natural Gas fund found recently, Nymex, the exchange on which the futures are traded, has started to pay more attention to breaches of its “accountability limits”. These are not binding limits in regulatory terms, but the exchange can use them to prevent positions becoming disruptively large. “There’s a lot of fear” regulators will make the US too tightly governed for commodity investors, says Mr McNeil, “but they’re not daft. They don’t want that to happen.”"
916;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-09-02T23:37:58Z;US regulators try to avert turf wars;;US regulators seeking to co-ordinate oversight of the securities and futures markets were told on Wednesday by the head of one leading exchange that a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation would do more harm than good.Craig Donohue, chief executive of the CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, cautioned against removing key differences in the way securities and futures are now overseen, saying the two markets served different purposes and different types of customers.“Although there is room for harmonisation . . . merger of the existing regulatory structures into a single set of one-size-fits-all rules administered by separate agencies will do substantially more harm than good,” he said.His comments came during an unprecedented joint hearing of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates securities, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees commodity and financial futures.The two agencies are trying to close gaps exposed by the financial crisis as they prepare to share oversight of the vast over-the-counter derivatives market.The effort at “harmonisation” is part of a broad revamp of financial regulation by the Obama administration, which has abandoned the politically difficult task of merging the two agencies.But the difficulty of overcoming the deep divisions in approaches were underscored on Wednesday by testimony from regulators, industry leaders, academics and other market participants.William Brodsky, chairman and chief executive of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, was among the industry executives who said the SEC – which operates on a rules-based system – should move towards the CFTC’s more flexible, principles-based approach, which gives exchanges more discretion over how they operate.He said the disparity between the two approaches had imposed “severe competitive disadvantages” on exchanges and stifled innovation.“The SEC’s rules-based approach leads to substantial and unnecessary delays in introducing new products and in making operational changes.”Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, said there were times when differences in approach were appropriate, but said they could sometimes stifle competition, increase costs or limit investor protection. He said that “all options” would be on the table. “The American people are not interested in bureaucratic turf battles . . . There should be no sacred cows.”Mary Schapiro, who chairs the SEC, said “many benefits could be achieved through greater co-ordination and harmonisation . . . for regulation and oversight of similar types of financial instruments”.The two agencies are expected to submit a report to Congress identifying existing conflicts and recommending how to resolve them by the end of the month. Kathleen Casey, a Republican SEC commissioner, said: “Even in the best spirit of co-operation, we are necessarily limited in what we can achieve.”
917;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-09-02T15:21:19Z;It is time for true competition in US futures markets;;"This week’s joint regulatory hearings in Washington, DC by the two main US financial market regulators on “harmonisation of market regulation” are a much needed step to effect change in the futures markets and eliminate the differences between the regulation of securities and futures products. President Barack Obama was the impetus for these hearings, recommending change to US statutes and regulations that would eliminate differences governing similar types of financial instruments.What I find remarkable about the current state of the securities markets is how it contrasts so sharply with the current state of the futures markets. Following a spate of consolidation between futures exchanges, led by the CME Group, government policies that continue to allow vertical integration of trading and clearing in futures markets essentially stifle competition.In the US futures markets, the CME Group controls about 96 per cent of market share in futures contracts. No other exchange that offers trading in any financial instrument enjoys such a stronghold in market share. Put in perspective, NYSE Euronext captures about 29 per cent of US equities market share and the Chicago Board Options Exchange controls about 31 per cent of US options market share.The fundamental difference between the futures markets and the securities markets that supports the incumbent’s overwhelming dominance is a factor called “fungibility:” the ability to buy on one marketplace, sell the same product on another, and have a central, not-for-profit independent clearing house treat the trades as if they were done on the same marketplace.For equities, that would be the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and for options, the Options Clearing Corporation. The separation of the exchange function from the clearing house is the centerpiece of competition, and in the equities markets this has been demanded by Congress and implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, taking that clear direction on behalf of the investing public for years.In a Department of Justice comment letter addressed to the Department of the Treasury, the justice department commented on competitive differences between securities and commodities marketplaces:“In contrast to futures exchanges, equity and options exchanges do not control open interest, fungibility, or margin offsets in the clearing process. This lack of control appears to have facilitated head-to-head competition between exchanges for equities and options, resulting in low execution fees, narrow spreads, and high trading volume. Equities and options execution systems are also very sophisticated and feature-rich, more so than futures contract execution systems. Although characteristics of the equities and options markets differ from those of financial futures markets, the clearing processes and related regulatory framework in equities and options markets appear to provide useful lessons in the futures arena. In light of the potential competitive benefits that could flow from regulatory changes that would facilitate competition in financial futures exchange markets, the Department recommends that Treasury propose a thorough review of futures clearing and its alternatives”.Unlike securities markets, futures exchanges are allowed to own the clearing house for their respective products. By owning the clearing house, the exchange locks out competing products if they were executed on a different exchange from the one owning the clearing house. The vertical integration of trading and clearing greatly reduces the incentive to provide competitive products or pricing. The established futures marketplaces also maintain a compliance and enforcement staff which can punish violators of rules that are intended to further this hold on non-competitive conduct. The securities markets, by contrast, have independent regulatory arms, and do not control the right to punish participants who conduct business in ways that do not comport with the views of the for-profit marketplace.With serious obstacles to competition, it is not surprising that some firms doing business under the securities market structure would try to take advantage of an anti-competitive environment on the futures side of the street. Recently, DTCC, the not-for-profit central clearing house for many types of securities, including equities and US Treasury securities, signed an agreement with NYSE’s fledgling futures market to create a joint venture to clear US interest-rate futures in the second quarter of 2010. This agreement gives the new venture an “exclusive” right to offer its customers significant savings from cross-margining futures traded on NYSE’s platform with US Treasurys held by the DTCC under securities laws as a not-for-profit utility. Other futures exchanges that offer trading in futures on US Treasuries are locked out of this arrangement and cannot offer the same benefit to their customers, although most of the Treasurys held by DTCC belong to those customers.Clearly, there are chasms in governmental policies between the futures markets and securities markets that need to be addressed. Recently there appears to be some hope that real change can take place in the futures world. Gary Gensler, current chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has been public about the need for fungibility in over-the-counter derivatives; a recognition of the benefits of competition in the markets. Chairman Gensler is the first chairman of the CFTC to address the competitive issues directly.I welcome a fresh approach to the market structure in the futures markets, one that supports competition. Competition is - and needs to remain - the cornerstone of American business. Healthy competition sparks innovation in products and services, improves quality and pricing power, reduces market arrogance and brings choice to the marketplace. We all benefit when there is competition in financial markets.In what has been touted as a new era of reform in the financial markets following the aftermath of last year’s financial crisis, a new competitive philosophy should not neglect the futures world; a marketplace that has been long overdue for an overhaul.Neal Wolkoff is chief executive of ELX Futures, an electronic futures exchange launched last month. It competes with CME Group, and clearing is carried out by the Options Clearing Corporation."
918;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
919;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-09-01T22:45:34Z;Deutsche Bank scraps oil notes;;Deutsche Bank is scrapping a product that lets investors bet on oil prices, making it the first exchange-traded commodity product to go under as Wall Street braces for a potential regulatory crackdown on energy speculation.The bank said it will redeem all of its PowerShares DB Crude Oil Double Long exchange-traded notes, which uses leverage to double returns from price moves in crude oil. As of Tuesday, there were $425m of such notes.This will effectively buy out existing investors before Deutsche does away with the product. The Deutsche move could set a precedent for similar actions by other investment managers.“It’s ominous,” said Matt Hougan, director of exchange-traded fund analysis at IndexUniverse.com. “It’s the first shoe to drop, and won’t be the last.”The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission is contemplating placing speculative caps on energy futures trading, and its chairman has questioned the current system of limits run by exchanges.The Deutsche Bank product’s prospectus says its value is tied to prices of West Texas Intermediate crude, which is chiefly traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission has, meantime, raised questions about leveraged exchange-traded products, which amplify both risks and returns and are freely sold to retail investors.In explaining its action, Deutsche said: “Limitations imposed by the exchange on which Deutsche Bank manages the exposure of the notes have resulted in a ‘regulatory event’ as defined in the terms of the notes.”Nymex parent CME Group declined to comment. The CFTC said it did not take action with regard to the Deutsche Bank oil notes.Managers of several exchange-traded funds and notes have said they have stopped creating new shares as the CFTC deliberates, skewing their new asset value from the underlying commodity indexes they were established to track. Two weeks before, Deutsche Bank said it was halting the creation of new notes for the investment, at the time calling it a temporary suspension.Separately, the CFTC last month withdrew an exemption from speculative limits in corn and wheat given to two Deutsche Bank exchange-traded funds.It was not clear whether Deutsche Bank breached any limits on oil holdings in the course of managing its risk. Nymex imposes firm limits on holdings only in futures contracts that are set to expire, not the later-dated contracts that commodity index funds typically hold. But the double-long oil notes were hedged with futures for delivery in July 2010, a person familiar with its holdings said.
920;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-08-30T20:07:04Z;Nymex defers gas trade limits;;The New York Mercantile Exchange has backed off imposing limits on natural gas trading that has drawn protests from one of its largest customers, leaving federal regulators to take the next step towards implementing the move.The world’s leading energy futures venue said in a notice to traders that it was deferring changes to rules that would have set firm caps on holdings in seven cash-settled natural gas futures contracts.A new date was not set for the amendments, which would have taken effect in late September.One of the exchange’s biggest gas traders, $5bn hedge fund Centaurus Energy, made a rare public criticism.John Arnold, the founder, testified in early August that likely consequences included “pushing trading from the exchanges to the less efficient and less transparent over-the-counter markets, increasing volatility, reducing liquidity …and increasing costs for commercial hedgers”.News of the deferral of the proposed changes comes as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US market regulator, examines whether large speculators are distorting markets for oil and gas. The watchdog is contemplating revoking Nymex’s power to set limits on futures trading and imposing federal limits of its own.Nymex parent CME Group and rival IntercontinentalExchange are also jockeying for advantage ahead of any new federal rules. Nymex offers a benchmark gas futures contract that results in physical delivery of the fuel at a large US pipeline hub and ICE has a similar gas swap.In July, the CFTC extended its oversight to the ICE gas swap, imposing the same limits on the size of traders’ positions as with the Nymex physical gas contract. The regulator’s move addressed what critics complained was a loophole that allowed speculators to amass large, risky positions on ICE without regulators’ knowledge.Citing new oversight of its competitor’s gas contract, Nymex announced the proposed caps on trading in the seven financially settled gas futures, which result in cash payment instead of delivery.Traditionally these contracts do not have such limits on positions, only guideposts to alert market monitors. Volumes in some of the affected gas futures contracts plunged in July.Nymex suggested the deferral of its proposed changes was linked to the CFTC’s pending move to apply blanket trading limits in all energy markets.A CFTC representative could not be reached.
921;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-08-27T00:52:04Z;Nasdaq and Brazilian exchange to discuss partnership;;"BM&F Bovespa, Brazil’s futures and equities exchange, and the Nasdaq OMX Group of the US are discussing a “strategic, commercial and technological partnership”, the Brazilian exchange said in a statement on Wednesday evening.If completed, the partnership would mark a further expansion of BM&F Bovespa’s international activities, which have expanded quickly since it was formed by the merger of Brazil’s derivatives and stock exchanges in May 2008.It recently opened an office in London, adding to its overseas presence in Shanghai and New York. Shortly before the merger, the BM&F segment swapped 10 per cent of its shares for 2 per cent of shares in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Customers of the two exchanges can trade directly on both, and access to the CME’s Globex system has been a powerful driver of new business for the exchange this year.Brazil has been quick to emerge from a short recession caused by the global economic crisis and its equities and the currency have recovered their levels before the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September. Analysts say portfolio investors have been attracted to Brazil because of its large and healthy domestic market and because, as a big producer of food and industrial commodities, it offers a natural hedge against rising global inflation.This has attracted growing interest from some of the world’s biggest market players. ICAP and BGC Partners, two of the world’s biggest inter-dealer brokers, have recently brought leading Brazilian brokerages. They will take advantage of increasing electronification – open outcry trading ended this year – and “co-location”, in which big customers can install computer servers inside the exchange’s premises to enact high-speed automated trades that seek out arbitrage opportunities between different asset classes.BM&F Bovespa is already the world’s fourth largest exchange by market value, bigger than better-known exchanges such as NYSE Euronext, the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq OMX. Its market value combined with that of Nasdaq OMX would put it in second place behind the CME.The statement issued on Wednesday contained no suggestion that the two exchanges would merge. It said they would examine the development of an order routing system similar to that between BM&F Bovespa and the CME; commercial agreements to offer Brazilian companies services developed by Nasdaq OMX such as investor relations and communications; distribution of price data on the two exchanges; and technological cooperation."
922;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-08-24T19:07:02Z;India’s oldest exchange gets new blood;;In his first 100 days at the Bombay Stock Exchange, Madhu Kannan has not wasted time in stamping his mark on India’s oldest bourse.Mr Kannan, who at 37 is the exchange’s youngest chief executive, has been doing the rounds of the BSE’s headquarters in the Fort district of Mumbai to try to gauge how best to approach turning round the fortunes of the BSE.“I’ve spent the last three months understanding the challenges …Now we are trying to put together a strategy that addresses the problems,” he says.Hiring such a young chief executive – he was 36 when he took over – marked something of a bold move for the BSE, but also highlights how much the bourse needed to reform.Founded in 1875, the exchange had a near monopoly for more than a century until the National Stock Exchange launched in the mid-1990s. Better execution of transactions, better client contact and, most importantly, technology enabled the upstart NSE to grab market share.The volume of trades on Bombay’s benchmark Sensex index on Friday stood at 21.5m, while volumes on NSE’s Nifty hit 186m on the same day.More recently, start-ups such as MCX-SX, the exchange platform controlled by Indian entrepreneur Jignesh Shah, have outlined plans to encroach on the BSE’s territory.Mr Kannan – who was brought up in India but spent much of his career in the US – insists that competition is good for business. He worked for a decade at the New York Stock Exchange before following John Thain to Merrill Lynch.He calls himself a salesman. Certainly he has the rapid-fire patter and “don’t call me sir” charm of one, but with the weight of responsibility on his shoulders, he is clearly mindful that he has to deliver. “Just because we have been here a long time doesn’t mean we can’t address change …I’m in a 135-year old start-up.”He says that while at the NYSE he had the opportunity to look at the BSE from the outside. “I saw some issues and challenges but I also saw potential.”Mr Kannan says that with India in transition – last year the economy grew by 6.7 per cent – he thinks that the Indian stock market is ripe for the next stage of development. The BSE’s benchmark Sensex index has risen more than 60 per cent so far this year.One of his first moves was to switch to quarterly financial reporting.Another was to boost the ranks of the BSE’s senior leadership team. In June the BSE announced that Sayee Srinivasan, who formerly worked at the NSE, would join from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to become head of product strategy.Nehal Vora, who previously worked for DSP Merrill Lynch and who also spent 10 years working for the Securities Exchange Board of India, joined in July to head up planning and policy. Meanwhile, James Shapiro, who worked at the NYSE and the boutique investment bank Galileo Global Advisors, joined as head of market development of the exchange.The appointees, all of whom have expertise in product development, say something about the direction the BSE wants to go.Mr Kannan says his priorities for now are to improve technology, which he sees as crucial to innovate and to place greater focus on the client relationship.He also hopes to leverage the BSE’s existing relationships with the Singapore stock exchange and Deutsche Börse, both of which bought stakes in the Indian exchange in 2007.The BSE recently said that it would take a 15 per cent stake in the United Stock Exchange, an exchange that will focus on developing currency and interest rate derivatives markets – which are still nascent in India.Mr Kannan is realistic about how fast the BSE can grow. He emphasises that it will be a while before the exchange looks for bigger overseas tie-ups or tries to list itself, as many have suggested will happen.First, he says, the company needs to improve on its “home turf”.
923;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;CME and Bursa Malaysia to launch palm oil contract;;CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, on Tuesday said it would develop a US dollar-denominated contract for palm oil after reaching an agreement with Bursa Malaysia to use its ringgit-denominated contract as a benchmark.The announcement comes days after neighbouring Indonesia, the world’s largest producer or crude palm oil, said it will launch the Indonesia Commodity & Derivatives Exchange in October to create a new palm oil benchmark contract.Until now, Indonesia’s attempts to create a palm oil benchmark had failed and those efforts will be jeopardised even further by the globalisation of the Malaysia’s contract after the CME agreement, analysts said. Trading of palm oil futures at the Jakarta Futures Exchange, which was launched in 2000, never took off.CME Group said that the new palm oil cash-settled contract will use Bursa Malaysia settlements as its reference, with the new dollar contract trading at the Globex electronic platform.“This initiative, when implemented, will enable our customers from other markets to access Bursa Malaysia’s derivatives markets and products,” said Terry Duffy, executive chairman of CME Group in Chicago. Dato’ Yusli Mohamed Yusoff, chief executive of Bursa Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur, added that the agreement was “aimed at globalising the Malaysian crude palm oil futures market.”The two exchanges will also explore product licensing and a minor cross-equity investment, which it is still subject to regulatory approval, they said in a statement. Bursa Malaysia already launched a dollar palm oil contract earlier this year.Palm oil is in great demand as consumption of vegetable oil in Asia, particularly in China and India, rockets. Prices have been volatile so far this year.On the Bursa Malaysia, crude palm oil prices futures have surged almost 37 per cent this year to about ringgit 2,394 a tonne ($681 a tonne), on the back of strong consumption, higher oil prices and the arrival of the El Niño weather phenomenon.The agreement between the CME Group and Bursa Malaysia comes amid renewed interest in Asia to create local commodities exchanges, including planned launches in Singapore and Hong Kong, or revamping established markets, such as in the case of the Tocom commodities exchange in Tokyo.China is also building up its commodities exchanges, offering new products from its Shanghai Futures Exchange. But in India, an initial push has suffered setbacks in the last couple of years as the government severely restricts the trading of agricultural futures, from sugar to rice, amid rising food prices.
924;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-08-09T23:01:30Z;ICE extends lead in CDS clearing;;IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the US-based electronic exchange group, is extending its lead in the race to clear credit default swap contracts on both sides of the Atlantic by announcing on Monday that its European CDS clearing house cleared 840 transactions worth €37.8bn in its first two weeks.The parent company ramped up the operations of ICE Clear Europe in its second week, clearing 699 CDS index contracts with a notional value of €31.9bn, up from 141 transactions totalling €5.9bn in the prior week. Open interest reached €1.5bn, up from €382m a week earlier.ICE Trust, the company’s North American CDS clearing house, has cleared contracts with notional value more than $1,700bn since its launch in March.The figures indicate that ICE is pulling ahead of its rivals in CDS clearing in both the US and Europe, thanks to its close co-operation with the biggest CDS dealers. In the US, a joint venture between the CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, and Citadel, the hedge fund, has yet to launch, while in Europe, Eurex Credit Clear has lagged behind ICE Clear Europe’s progress.ICE’s rivals say they are engaged in a marathon rather than a sprint. They emphasise that the amount ICE has cleared is only a small fraction of the $26,000bn global CDS market and point out that the entire “over-the-counter” market for bilaterally-negotiated derivatives contracts is far bigger.US and European regulators are keen to see as many OTC contracts as possible processed by clearing houses to help safeguard the financial system against the catastrophic effects of defaults.
925;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-08-02T23:41:44Z;ICE Clear Europe clears €382m in CDS in first week;;ICE Trust Europe, the European clearing house, cleared €382m worth of CDS contracts in its first week of operations last week, according to its parent, the IntercontinentalExchange.The number dwarves the amount of CDS contracts also cleared last week by rival Eurex Credit Clear, a similar CDS clearing house launched by Deutsche Börse.The development confirms that ICE is emerging as the leading clearer for OTC credit derivatives on both sides of the Atlantic.Although ICE and rival CME Group started work towards clearing CDS in the US around the same time last year, ICE quickly pulled ahead of its Chicago-based rival, launching clearing in March. CME has yet to clear any trades.In Europe, both ICE and Eurex started clearing CDS contracts last week as part of a push by the European Commission to ensure Europe has at least one clearer of OTC credit derivatives.Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic want OTC, or bilaterally negotiated, derivatives to be processed as far as possible through clearing houses to help safeguard the financial system against the catastrophic effects of defaults, such as that which led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year.After initial resistance to the idea, dealers in the OTC derivatives markets have accepted that there are likely to be OTC credit derivatives clearing operations on both sides of the Atlantic, not just in the US, where the Federal Reserve first insisted on such clearing mechanisms for OTC derivatives.The idea of having multiple clearers is likely to become more palatable if it becomes clear that both are operated by the same company, which could allow for cost savings, especially on margin payments, industry experts have said. ICE has said it is “bringing a common infrastructure to global CDS market participants within their respective regulatory jurisdictions”.ICE said that last week the notional value of iTraxx index contracts cleared through ICE Clear Europe was €5.9bn, involving 141 transactions. Open interest was €382m.Eurex said last week it had cleared €25m worth of CDS contracts. It is still working on bringing in joint venture partners for Eurex Credit Clear.The European Commission last week welcomed the inaugural clearing of CDS contracts in Europe. But the total amounts cleared were still modest, reflecting what industry experts said was the difficulty of meeting a Brussels-mandated deadline of July 31 for the first contracts to be traded.The commission said that, with the groundwork established it “expects that …dealers will live up to their commitment and will start using all available [clearers] for all eligible trades”.The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether there is significant appetite for CDS clearing in Europe, especially of so-called single name contracts written on companies.One industry expert said: “There is no discernable rush towards clearing on a voluntary basis. It was a date picked to suit the EC and not practical for the market.”
926;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;HKEx takes top position from CME;;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing has toppled CME Group, the US futures exchange, from its position as the world’s largest exchange by the company’s own market capitalisation.The development underscores how exchanges outside the biggest financial centres are benefiting as those in more mature markets grapple with the new regulatory agenda being pushed by the Obama administration.Exchanges such as CME and ICE in the US are building new businesses in response to regulators’ demands that more over-the-counter derivatives be cleared.However, the issue has become complicated for the CME, which has struggled to get a planned clearing mechanism for OTC credit default swaps off the ground.The recent rise in the value of HKEx’s own shares has been fuelled by a belief that it is likely to remain a growth exchange amid continuing demand for Chinese company listings.On Wednesday shares in BBMG, a Chinese construction material maker, rose almost 60 per cent in the first hour of trading on the Hong Kong exchange. The company raised HK$6.8bn ($877m) last week in the territory’s second biggest initial public offering this year.The Hong Kong exchange’s value as a company on Thursday was $19.7bn, with Chicago-based CME Group at $17.7bn. Third-ranked was Deutsche Börse at $15.4bn.BM&F Bovespa, the Brazilian exchange, was fourth largest. It has been building its business by closing down its “open outcry” pits and expanding its electronic trading capacity, allowing easier access to its markets for traders outside Brazil.HKEx’s valuation overtook the CME’s on July 22. However, Herbie Skeete, managing director of Mondo Visione, a UK-based exchanges research company, said the CME would likely regain its crown again once it had “sorted out its local difficulties”.“There are quite a few uncertainties in derivatives but they should surpass Hong Kong again as their engine of growth returns,” he said.The launch of a rival futures exchange, ELX, has also weighed slightly on CME sentiment. However analysts do not believe ELX – backed by banks and Getco, an electronic liquidity provider – is likely to make significant inroads on CME’s dominant Treasury bond futures contract.CME’s euro-dollar interest rate futures contract is expected to benefit from rising inflation expectations.This week, CME’s profits fell less than analysts had expected in the second quarter, although the effect of deleveraging by the financial sector continued to take its toll on the company.
927;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-07-29T16:16:23Z;ICE launches CDS clearing in Europe;;IntercontinentalExchange, the US futures exchange, on Wednesday moved to strengthen its foothold in the $26,000bn credit derivatives market by introducing clearing for European credit default swap contracts, after being given approval by UK regulators.ICE’s European CDS clearing venture is backed by 10 of the world’s biggest dealers in the contracts. The exchange group is looking to capitalise on the success of ICE Trust, its US CDS clearing house, which has cleared $1,600bn in contracts since its launch in March.The initiative comes a day ahead of the launch of Eurex’s CDS clearing house. While ICE Clear Europe will initially clear only iTraxx index trades, Eurex Credit Clear is starting with 17 single-name contracts alongside the iTraxx indices.ICE said that each clearing member - Bank of America, Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS – had made “a significant contribution to establish the European CDS guaranty fund”.Analysts at Barclays Capital in New York said that “suggests that the clearing house is the de facto solution chosen by the dealer community. While competitor Eurex announced its own launch recently, no details around client participation were disclosed.”ICE said the UK’s Financial Services Authority had completed a regulatory review of its CDS clearing house.CME Group and LCH.Clearnet also plan to launch European CDS clearing platforms, while NYSE Liffe, through its Bclear facility, introduced CDS clearing in December in conjunction with LCH.Clearnet. It has since been shelved after failing to attract any trades.ends
928;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-07-28T22:31:29Z;Exchange rivalry spills into oil trading debate;;Competition between the world’s two top energy exchanges on Tuesday spilled into the regulatory arena in a vital US hearing on limiting the size of speculators’ market footprint.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US regulator, is considering how to curb speculators’ influence in energy markets after last year’s rise in oil prices brought accusations that a bubble had been created.Concessions to the regulator were agreed on Tuesday. CME Group, owner of the New York Mercantile Exchange, offered for the first time to put “hard” limits on certain kinds of energy speculators’ positions, while arch-rival IntercontinentalExchange said the CFTC regulator should have power over position limits.Gary Gensler, the CFTC chairman, praised the chief executives of both companies for making “tangible, real steps” towards addressing public concerns.However, both exchanges also included caveats that could dilute the strength of the CFTC’s proposals.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, said stiff limits should apply only to those commodity contracts that were about to be delivered, not those pegged for delivery months or years into the future.Craig Donohue, chief executive of the CME, said Wall Street banks and investors in commodity indices should remain eligible for exemptions from position limits.Existing trading limits in most US energy futures are mostly used to alert exchange operators to the possibility of unwieldy positions. Mr Gensler said in US crude, heating oil, gasoline and natural gas futures markets, 69 parties exceeded these levels over the past year.The bulk of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures is traded on Nymex. Intercontinental’s UK-based ICE Futures Europe exchange offers a lookalike WTI contract with about 15 per cent of global trading.Under an agreement with the regulators last year, ICE follows trading limits in WTI that are set by Nymex.The CFTC proposes to tighten these trading limits aggressively in a crack-down on “excessive speculation”, applying them both to oil traded on exchanges and in over-the-counter markets.Mr Sprecher said that the CFTC, not Nymex, should set and manage any new position limits. Letting one large exchange administer position limits across its market and other venues would be “rife with potential conflicts of interest”, said Mr Sprecher.Mr Donohue, said that the CME was ready to adopt hard limits on energy futures but insisted that the exchange operator was best suited to set and manage them.Crude oil prices dropped by more than $1 a barrel on Tuesday as the dollar strengthened. Nymex September West Texas Intermediate fell $1.15 to $67.23 a barrel, while ICE September Brent retreated $0.93 to $69.88 a barrel.Gold sank below $940, falling 1.7 per cent to $936 a troy ounce as the dollar recovered. Traders said that bullion had been driven mainly by fluctuations in the dollar as interest from jewellery makers and inflows into exchange-traded funds remained quiet.
929;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-07-23T19:01:23Z;The pricing-clearing link;;The regulatory drive to shine a light on the complex and opaque world of credit derivatives has brought into focus the links between pricing and clearing.Regulators have expressed a clear desire to push credit derivatives on to central clearing houses as a way of bringing transparency to the market in the wake of the financial crisis.But pricing is crucial – particularly in the credit default swaps market, one of the fastest-growing segments of the derivatives universe and an engine for Wall Street profits in the last decade.If you have the right price for a CDS, you can assess the risks properly. If you have the wrong price, there could be a loss once the “real” price comes to light. Importantly, companies that own the best pricing data can sell it.The start last week of an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the credit derivatives market by the US Department of Justice has highlighted these issues. Hence an intensified effort to establish “closing prices” in a CDS market now worth about $26,000bn in outstanding contracts.“In the past 12 months risk managers have really started focusing on the accuracy of end-of-day pricing data,” says Laurent Paulhac, chief executive officer at Credit Markets Analysis. “It is a bit surprising that it took people so long to start challenging the accuracy of pricing data received for risk management or valuation purposes, but the fact that people are looking at this now is good news .”In order for a clearing house to assess the risks it is bearing–- and to charge its members enough margins to cover those risks – it needs to assess the prices of the securities. Many markets that are cleared, from US Treasury futures to interest rate swaps, are based on highly liquid markets where the prices can be easily worked out.But CDS prices, where numerous entities have been seeking to sell accurate prices by either getting feeds from dealers or by scanning trading screens and “scraping” them off, have proved to be inadequate for assessing risks.Changes are afoot to fix this. In the process, providers of this data will end up holding a lot of power and regulators are trying to work out how to mitigate this. For example, a group of global regulators is working on setting out rules about how much data clearing houses for CDS have to make public, for free, and how much they can sell.A number of entities are looking at setting up clearing services for CDS and other over-the-counter derivatives. ICE Trust, a clearing house set up by the Intercontinental Exchange, is backed by big dealers and has made the most progress. CME, the derivatives exchange group, is also developing a clearing house but has yet to get the backing of big dealers. It owns CMA.ICE has introduced a method to make sure it has proper market prices, which, once single credits and indices are included, can span thousands of securities. Specifically, ICE has a system that it operates with Markit where dealers submit prices at the end of the day. Some of these prices are then traded on but dealers do not know which ones will be traded. This ensures that all prices that are submitted are tradeable.“Clearing is very dependent on having good pricing,” says Dirk Pruis, chief executive of ICE. “The process of introducing clearing forces more discipline on pricing. The pricing is needed to clear, and traders have to submit prices at which they are willing to trade.”Mr Pruis says other forms of price collection offered good prices in many cases but not necessarily across the entire range of credits or for different maturities, as more trading is concentrated on the most liquid five-year maturities. For the purposes of assessing risks for a clearing house, prices are needed across all cleared products.Regulators say privately that the move to clearing has made them realise that CDS prices are not always reliable, especially as it is not easy to know whether actual trading has taken place. The clearing houses could, in theory, fix that problem too.Although the CDS market itself functions around a relatively small group of dealers and investors, the prices are often referred to by many other segments of the market as a measure of creditworthiness, from equities to loans. It is this role of CDS prices that has regulators fired up, and is one reason – beyond reducing systemic risks – that regulators want “good” prices to be easily available and for prices to reflect actual trading activity.Markit has a high profile since it receives prices on a range of credit derivatives from dealers and distributes these to the broader market. It also manages the array of indices based on credit, loan, mortgage and asset-backed market risks, all of which have become highly popular with investors.Yet because some of the biggest dealers are also Markit’s shareholders, it and the dealers are being scrutinised by the DoJ.“Valuation is a big part of our business, but we also make our data available to third-party valuation services,” says Kevin Gould, president of Markit North America.“Cleaning” data is not easy, however, especially once a range of maturities are included.“We take data from multiple sources, including 40 banks’ books of record, buy-side institutions and inter-dealer brokers. We then aggregate and clean the data, and in many cases discard up to 60 per cent of it in order to publish a comprehensive, high-quality dataset,” Mr Gould says.
930;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-07-23T12:21:02Z;CME’s profit falls less than expected;;Profits at the CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, fell less than analysts had expected in the second quarter, although the effect of deleveraging by the financial sector continued to take its toll on the company.On a pro-forma basis - which accounts for the CME’s purchase of Nymex, the New York energy exchange, last year - the CME’s profit dropped to $224m or $3.37 per share, down from $264m or $3.93 per share in the same period a year earlier but ahead of average Wall Street forecasts of about $3.23 per share.Revenues were $648m, down 14 per cent from last year and in line with analysts’ expectations.CME said expense-cutting – down 13 per cent – had helped in the quarter and said it had detected an uptick in volumes as the economy stabilised. “Improvements in the economy and continued rigor in expense discipline contributed to CME Group’s solid results in the second quarter,” said Craig Donohue, chief executive.Terry Duffy, chairman, said the exchange “saw increased volumes in June, particularly in interest rates, foreign exchange and agricultural markets”. However, his remarks refer to month-on-month volume rises: compared to last year, average daily volumes fell by 20 per cent in June, with interest-rate trading down 24 per cent from the prior year.
931;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-07-22T20:47:28Z;CFTC chief urges competition in derivatives clearing;;The US futures regulator on Wednesday insisted traders should be able to choose between exchanges that offer trading and clearing of over-the-counter derivatives, signalling that the Obama administration may be starting to address barriers to competition in exchange-traded derivatives markets.Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said in congressional testimony that as OTC derivatives became standardised and moved onto exchanges and other electronic platforms, open positions between the various platforms should be “fungible”.“In contrast to long-established on-exchange futures and securities markets, there is a need to encourage the further development of exchanges and electronic trading systems for OTC derivatives.“In order to promote this goal and achieve market efficiency through competition, there should be sufficient product standardisation so OTC derivative trades and open positions are fungible and can be transferred between one exchange or electronic trading system to another,” Mr Gensler told the House of Representatives financial services committee.In effect Mr Gensler was calling for clearing houses to accept OTC trades from multiple exchanges and other trading platforms, rather than just from their own, as is currently the case.Fungibility is a controversial issue in US derivatives exchanges and has repeatedly thwarted efforts by other exchanges and bank-led platforms to compete against the CME Group in Chicago.It refers to the ability of traders to open a position at one exchange and close it at another. Central to their ability to do this is either that both exchanges use the same clearing house, or that there are links between the two clearing houses.Fungibility has been a feature of the stock and options markets for years. But it does not exist in futures markets, where the CME Group has a market share of roughly 98 per cent in US futures contracts.It has been able to fend off competition largely thanks to owning its own clearer – and lack of fungibility. With ownership of a clearing house, there is no competition to get the best price and traders are locked into a monopoly clearing fee.Mr Gensler’s call for fungibility was limited to cases where OTC derivatives had shifted on-exchange. People familiar with the CFTC's thinking said Mr Gensler was not aiming to challenge the current model of exchange clearing ownership. However, they said it was possible his insistence on clearing choice in on-exchange OTC derivatives might prompt a review of on-exchange futures and clearing eventually.Craig Donohue, CME Group chief executive, said his understanding of Mr Gensler’s remark was that “[counterparties] have the ability to establish and extinguish positions through a multiplicity of platforms or execution environments if those platforms and participants clear through the same clearing platform”.Chris Allen, an analyst at Pali Research in New York, wrote in a blog: “While he [Gensler] was clearly referring to the OTC derivatives markets, it does not take much imagination to see him extending this view to the current futures marketplace, where there is little competition from a domestic basis.”He added that any move to fungibility as outlined by the CFTC “could dampen the profit potential for the exchanges and/or clearinghouses relative to the OTC opportunity, which has been a key catalyst for ICE and CME [Group] in recent months.”The CME is facing competition from ELX, a futures small futures exchange backed by large banks that launched this month. However, ELX has so far made little impact on the CME’s market share in US Treasury futures.Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the Bauer College of Business at the University of Houston, said: “Access to clearing is a barrier to entry. If you allow fungibility or ‘socialise’ the CME’s clearing house then other execution venues can crop up and compete with CME.“The CME’s going to fight like a tiger for [the status quo] and will use every lever available to protect it, so I wouldn’t be surprised if this leads to a pretty big effort by the CME and a lot of political heat on Gensler,” Mr Pirrong said.The Bush administration showed no appetite for tackling lack of fungibility in futures markets, with the Department of Justice approving the CME’s takeover of both the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 and of the New York Mercantile Exchange the next year.However the CME’s shares plunged 18 per cent in one day in February last year after justice department staff wrote to the US Treasury calling for clearing houses to be broken off from the futures exchanges that own them.The move was interpreted as a sign that the department’s antitrust staff were in favour of introducing competition in clearing, even though the department had approved the CME’s two acquisitions unconditionallyMr Pirrong said Mr Gensler’s remarks could represent “a definite change of philosophy at the CFTC”.
932;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-07-18T17:45:20Z;Morgan Stanley says clearing revenues to be lower;;Clearing revenues are unlikely to be as significant as many expect for the world’s biggest exchanges, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, who put annual revenues from such post-trade business at $200m-$400m.Clearing has come into sharp focus amid a “re-regulatory” agenda emerging in Washington and Brussels as part of the clean-up of global market infrastructure.Regulators have called for as many bilaterally negotiated, or over-the-counter, derivatives as possible to be processed through clearing houses, which step in when one party defaults to ensure a trade is completed.That has led many to believe that exchanges with clearing houses, as well as independent clearers, stand to benefit handsomely.However Morgan Stanley said: “Revenue opportunity for clearing is smaller than many think.”Its analysts, led by Bruce Hamilton, said that while the shift to clearing should benefit ICE - or the Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange – as well as LCH.Clearnet and “plausibly” Deutsche Börse and CME Group, “our view is that it is likely to be helpful rather than transformational”.The bank estimated that clearing equated to “perhaps 2-5 per cent profit enhancement” for Deutsche Börse.Morgan Stanley also said that those OTC derivatives clearing initiatives most likely to succeed would be those where exchanges and inter-dealer brokers (IDBs) worked co-operatively with dealer-banks already involved in the business.“Winning strategies for exchanges and IDBs are consortia: sharing economics with dealer banks will be critical to success,” the analysts said.Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing unit is trying to build a joint venture credit default swaps clearing business with some of the banks involved in the CDS business. It has offered them a 90 per cent stake.ICE already operates a CDS clearer, ICE Trust, also a joint venture with some of the same banks.“While this improves chances of success, it also lowers the profit outcome for the successful platform,” Morgan Stanley said.The bank said electronic trading of CDS and [interest] rates derivatives – also a key aim of regulators – would likely be “evolutionary not revolutionary”.“A key risk to our evolutionary view is whether regulators impose dislocation – whether insisting on rapid exchange trading, which could affect liquidity and riskiness of trading, or regulatory moves such as investigations of market structure, which would dislocate banks’ ability to earn a return on their risk capital,” Morgan Stanley said.Last week, it emerged that the US Department of Justice had started investigating Markit, a data provider, and dealers in the credit derivatives market for potential violations of the US Sherman Act, which prohibits abuses of monopoly power or other forms of collusion.Separately, consultancy Tabb Group said most CDS would “never” be cleared in the US or Europe due to technical difficulties like daily risk management, and because CDS agreements can be outstanding for years and need to be risk-managed daily.“CDS clearing is more about managing risk, margin and workflow than transferring securities title and facilitating payment,” said Larry Tabb, founder and chief executive. “The clearing of CDS is not all homogenous and has different complexity levels. Index-based CDS clearing is much more straightforward than clearing single-name CDS or CDS tranche products. We believe the most significant CDS clearing challenges come from five major issues: product complexity, valuation, liquidity, interoperability and counterparty-risk.”The consultancy added that the global nature of CDS markets was another hurdle.“Most clearinghouses are local, as members, products and regulators typically are regulated nationally,” Tabb Group said. “For clearing of OTC products to succeed, all of the participants must adopt standard contract language, structure, trade matching, affirmation and communication timeframes. But one of the primary challenges for effective global OTC trade clearance is the lack of consistent access to clearing corporations by potential participants, because scale and critical mass maximise the value of clearing.”
933;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-07-14T17:38:06Z;CME to clear gold forward contracts;;CME, the world’s largest derivatives exchange group, on Tuesday announced plans to launch clearing services for over-the-counter London gold forward contracts.Gold market participants currently trade with each other on a principal-to-principal basis, so all risks, including credit risks, are between the two parties. This OTC market allows flexibility over the size of contracts, settlement dates and delivery specifications, unlike a futures exchange where trading is based on standard contracts.However, it also exposes market participants to counterparty risk – the possibility that one party or another could default on an agreement.“Launching CME clearing services for London gold forwards is in direct response to customers’ need for a secure way to manage counterparty credit exposure,” said Joe Raia, CME managing director of energy and metals products.“This service allows trades to be privately negotiated and executed off-exchange and then submitted for clearing through CME ClearPort.“This allows counterparties to continue to trade while transferring credit risk to CME Group.”The service will be launched on August 23.“Investment demand for gold has been strong and anything that helps make the market more liquid and reduces counterparty risk is a positive,” said James Steel, precious metals analyst at HSBC.
934;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-07-09T23:53:34Z;New exchange seeks to rival CME;;In some areas the CME Group is not used to competition.The world’s largest derivatives exchange extended its dominance in US listed futures last year by buying Nymex, the New York energy exchange, for $7.6bn, a deal that gave it control of 98 per cent of the sector.That fuelled fears about the CME’s pricing power, spurring the launch on Friday of a challenge to its pre-eminence in financial futures. ELX Futures, an exchange owned by a consortium that includes some of Wall Street’s biggest names, will try to break the CME’s hold on US Treasury futures.The launch will pit the biggest futures traders against the biggest futures exchange in a battle that parallels the struggle to control the over-the-counter credit derivatives sector.While the dealers have so far triumphed in that business, winning a share of the listed futures market will be more tough.Three earlier attempts to set up rivals to Chicago’s supremacy failed. Listed derivatives, unlike shares, are proprietary to exchanges, so a contract bought in one venue cannot be cleared elsewhere.That has given the CME a captive marketplace, since traders have to go where the liquidity is.The timing of the launch is not propitious. The financial crisis has hit futures trading hard, with interest rate volumes down at least 25 per cent from last year.On the other hand, government bail-outs have ensured that the US Treasury will be issuing plenty of debt this year, which could offset some of the fall in trading.ELX has crawled slowly to the starting line. Announced 18 months ago, it hoped to launch last year but was delayed as it waited for regulatory approval. That confirmed the suspicion among many industry observers that it is more of an attempt to force the CME to lower prices than a long-term project.It seemed to take an age to find a chief executive. ELX’s Wall Street backers were preoccupied with their own problems. Citadel, the hedge fund that was one of its founding members, withdrew its participation.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, has poked fun at the new venture, referring to it as “ex-lax” – a well-known laxative.But ELX is a serious competitor. For a start, its founders – including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan – can guarantee some liquidity from the start.“Our founders have both the incentive and a high motivation to provide liquidity from the beginning,” said Neal Wolkoff, ELX chief executive. “There’ll be liquidity from the opening, so the business will start in a positive way.”ELX has offered fees of 9 cents per cleared contract for big traders – undercutting the CME. As an introductory gambit, it is offering free trading for July, with billing to begin next month.Mr Wolkoff, its chief executive, is well respected in the industry. He has previously served as chairman and chief executive of the American Stock Exchange.The Options Clearing Corporation, the world’s largest derivatives clearing house, will provide ELX with clearing and delivery services.As it launch has drawn closer, more market participants seem keen to be involved. Goldman Sachs joined as a founding member last month. MF Global and Newedge, two of the world’s biggest futures brokers, have become exchange members, saying they were responding to customer demand.“This is definitely a threat to CME, since everyone’s looking to cut costs now,” said Mike Wong, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago. He points to BATS, the upstart share-trading rival to NYSE and Nasdaq, as an example of what electronic exchanges can achieve. “ELX may not gain a huge market share but it will put pressure on CME to lower prices.”
935;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-06-24T17:45:48Z;CFTC chief: hedge fund oversight needed;;Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US derivatives regulator, on Wednesday signalled the Obama administration’s desire to extend oversight of hedge funds, saying they had “destabilised” the financial system by causing “runs on liquidity”.His comments come as Washington is preparing for an overhaul of financial regulation, with the White House proposing an enhanced role for the Federal Reserve and the creation of a ”council of regulators” to monitor systemic risk.President Barack Obama said last week that US funds would be required to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Speaking in his first big policy address to the derivatives industry – at the Managed Funds Association forum in Chicago – Mr Gensler said: “This financial crisis gave new meaning to the term, ‘run on the bank’.“Upon hearing those words, most of us would conjure up the image of the citizens of Bedford Falls standing outside George Bailey’s Savings and Loan in the movie, It’s a Wonderful Life. Last year, we witnessed the modern version of this in a number of ways.“A harsh lesson of the crisis occurred when a significant number of hedge funds sought to pull securities and funds from their prime brokers, contributing to uncertainty and the destabilisation of the financial system.”The CFTC chief backed international proposals for detailed scrutiny of hedge fund positions and working practices.“You may be aware of proposals being discussed by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions regarding the relationship between hedge funds and their prime brokerages and banks, which will require new oversight and rules of the road,” he said. “Here at home, we should seriously consider similar principles to best guard against runs on liquidity by hedge funds.”Mr Gensler also praised a US Senate report released yesterday that accused commodity index traders of causing a bubble in wheat futures prices last year.The report, issued by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, argued that big wheat purchases on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange pushed up futures prices, disrupting convergence between futures and cash prices and increasing costs for farmers and consumers.Carl Levin, the Senator who released the report, said the CFTC must “change course, rein in commodity index traders and clamp down on excessive speculation that is disrupting commodity prices”.
936;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-06-18T21:00:18Z;NYSE and DTCC in derivatives clearing launch;;NYSE Euronext and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation on Thursday said they would launch the first clearing service for US fixed income derivatives, setting the stage for a battle between New York and Chicago for control of derivatives trading and clearing.The move is another sign of how the push by US regulators to increase transparency and reduce risks in the financial system has prompted a wave of clearing initiatives by exchanges and providers of post-trade services.SecFinex, a securities lending trading platform owned by NYSE Euronext, said on Wednesday it would launch central clearing for stock borrowing and lending.NYSE Euronext and DTCC have agreed an equally-owned joint venture to set up a clearing house, New York Portfolio Clearing, that will offer risk management and clearing for US fixed income derivatives. It would be operating by the second quarter of next year.It will be headed by Dennis Dutterer, a veteran of the clearing industry who was chief executive of Chicago-based The Clearing Corporation, whose forerunner used to clear trades for the former Chicago Board of Trade.NYPC would provide a “more comprehensive view of participants’ overall risk exposure” and would increase “capital efficiency” through a cross-asset class risk management programme, the two groups said.To do this, NYPC will operate a “single pot” margining system, addressing a long-standing desire of market participants to do away with the need to post separate margin for each asset class they want to have cleared, such as cash securities like bonds, and derivatives. Pooling margin in a single pot – also known as providing “margin offsets” – means traders need to post less margin overall, reducing costs.Other exchanges – notably Eurex of Frankfurt, owned by Deutsche Börse – have tried to challenge Chicago’s grip on US futures contracts. ELX, another challenger to the CME, said on Thursday it would launch its new derivatives exchange on July 10, and would start with interest rate futures.NYSE Euronext appears to believe that by offering margin offsets – and therefore cheaper clearing – this will boost its chances of success.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, told the Financial Times the group would initially offer interest rate futures, which would be traded on NYSE Liffe, the group’s US futures arm. The CME’s flagship product is the eurodollar interest rate derivative.“These are products we could have listed [without the clearing joint venture] but we think this gives us a better chance of success because there’s an [added] value proposition in that you can offset against your cash bonds in a way that you won’t be able to get in the other place,” Mr Niederauer said, in an apparent reference to the CME. “We think this is a pretty creative idea.”He said “recent market dislocation” had underscored the need “to improve market efficiencies and provide more thorough and timely information about the positions of participants across asset classes”.“In uniting NYSE Euronext’s proven strength and expertise in execution with DTCC’s market-leading clearing capabilities, we will help to lower the traditional barriers between the cash and derivatives markets,” Mr Niederaurer said.Donald Donahue, chief executive of DTCC, said that one of the benefits of the “single pot” system would be that it would allow regulators to monitor market participants’ total exposure across multiple interest rate asset classes in real-time.Mr Donahue has said he believes that central securities depositories – such as DTCC – could play a role in helping regulators see what is going on in the financial system more clearly because they store vast amounts of information, electronically, on trades that have been done.Central securities depositories, like clearing houses, are the systems that underpin trading of equities on stock exchanges, as well as bonds and derivatives.
937;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Clearing momentum gathers pace;;"When two giants of the New York financial scene teamed up on Thursday to form a new clearing venture, it was not only a sign of a looming battle between New York and Chicago over exchange-traded derivatives.It was another example of a wave of clearing initiatives sweeping the globe as exchanges and clearing houses capitalised on regulatory pressure to put in place mechanisms to safeguard the financial system against systemic catastrophes.NYSE Euronext and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, the US clearing and settlement system, will by the second quarter of next year offer a new clearing service for fixed-income derivatives, pitting NYSE Euronext against the CME Group in Chicago.Clearing shot to prominence after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The bank’s default raised concerns about the creditworthiness in the system, sparking a push by authorities to insist on greater use of clearing traded financial instruments to mitigate such concerns. A clearer stands between two parties to a trade, ensuring payment is made even if one party defaults.US and European policymakers want over-the-counter – or privately negotiated – derivatives shifted into clearing houses. Some of the more opaque, risky OTC derivatives have been blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis.Market participants, keen to reduce the risks of trading with parties whose creditworthiness they can not reliably assess, are driving more products into clearing houses as well.The volume of OTC energy derivatives cleared through the CME’s Clearport clearing system jumped by 24 per cent in April, even as the US futures exchange’s overall volume fell by 23 per cent.In Europe, the emergence of new trading platforms – known as “multilateral trading facilities” (MTFs) – like Chi-X, Turquoise and BATS Europe has been accompanied by new clearers to support them.Mark Hemsley, chief executive of BATS Europe, says: “We are going to see more changes in the clearing space than we have seen in the last 10 years, and that’s being driven by the MTFs.”Clearing is lucrative because exchanges not only charge clearing fees on top of what they levy for trading. They also make money on the margin posted with them by lending the funds out overnight in the repo market – or earning interest on it.At the London Stock Exchange, post-trade services contribute 16 per cent of revenues compared with 41 per cent for trading.While the number of trades cleared through its Borsa Italiana clearing house fell in the past financial year, clearing still delivered a 7 per cent rise in revenues on an increase in the interest-earning margin posted by traders.However, the explosion of clearing has also prompted words of caution.The US Congress is working on legislation that would force “standardised” OTC derivatives on to clearing platforms. Exchanges warn against going too far because some derivatives may not be suitable for clearing and could jeopardise a clearing house.Roger Liddell, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearer, says: “Clearing houses manage risk; they don’t work miracles. In this headlong rush to clearing, we must take care that clearing does not become an end in itself. If it does, there is a danger that we simply transfer, rather than reduce, systemic risk.”"
938;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Brazil and HK bourses soar in global rankings;;Two of the biggest bourses in Asia and Latin America have for the first time overtaken rivals in New York and London by market capitalisation in a sign of how the economic crisis and tough competition in mature markets is reshaping the global exchange landscape.Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) and Brazil’s BM&F Bovespa have vaulted ahead of NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange in the value of shares in the exchange companies themselves.HKEx is now the world’s second-largest exchange by market value, behind CME Group, the largest US futures exchange. BM&F Bovespa is in fourth place, after Deutsche Börse, the German exchange. The LSE has slipped to 10th place.The recent stock market rally has boosted volumes at most exchanges. The monthly FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index, released Monday, shows the the market value of listed exchanges rose by 27 per cent last month. That built on the previous two months’ rallies.Herbie Skeete, managing director of Mondo Visione, said: “Shares of listed exchanges are up across the board from their lows of 2008. Derivatives markets are leading the pack, in part on hopes that US and European regulators plan to regulate over-the-counter derivatives, which could help exchanges.”But the benefits of renewed market confidence have been felt less at the more established exchanges of New York and London. They face stiff competition from alternative trading platforms such as BATS and Direct Edge in the US and Chi-X and Turquoise in Europe.The Brazilian and Hong Kong exchanges also benefit from ownership of their own houses for clearing trades, which generates added revenues. NYSE Euronext does not own a clearer. Nasdaq OMX will soon launch US equities clearing. The LSE owns an Italian clearing house but its contribution to group revenues is modest.BM&F Bovespa has been closing down its trading pits and expanding into electronic trading to make it easier for overseas traders to access the exchange. Next month, the Brazilian bourse opens a London office.Trading volume on HKEx has surged in recent months on the back of strong inflows from investors shifting to equities as they seek higher returns. HKEx shares have risen nearly 70 per cent since the start of the year.
939;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-06-11T08:29:51Z;Geithner’s OTC plans alarm exchanges;;The word “standardised” sounds innocuous enough. But its use in a US policy document on the future of over-the-counter derivatives has set alarm bells ringing at derivatives exchanges.Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, has said that to contain systemic risks he wants US laws to be changed to require clearing of “all standardised OTC derivatives through regulated central counterparties [CCPs]”.This marks a sweeping change to the way OTC derivatives are handled, implying a shift away from the dealers at banks who brokered such contracts to the formal exchanges that have long jealously eyed the huge OTC markets.But what does “standardised” mean? How much of the OTC markets can and should be shifted on-exchange, whether cleared or – as Mr Geithner also wants – traded?Nobody has a clear answer, since OTC derivatives come in many shapes and sizes, ranging from straightforward interest rate swaps to more tailored products such as “average price options” used by grain processors to hedge against movements in crop prices.Exchanges, many of which own their own clearing houses, might be expected wholeheartedly to welcome the Geithner proposals. But they are warning against a strict definition of “standardisation”.Craig Donohue, chief executive of CME Group, the largest US futures exchange, which owns a clearing house, says: “Standardised is not the right way to do it.”He and others are concerned that lawmakers in the US Congress may come up with a strict definition that would force a shift of OTC contracts into clearing houses that are ill-equipped for the task.They warn that such a move could expose clearing houses to unnecessary risks that could even damage the financial system at a time when regulators are looking at ways to protect it against future crises.Kim Taylor, president of CME clearing, says: “There is a danger in having regulatory mandates that are too broad, that would require clearing of products that clearing houses don’t feel comfortable risk managing.”Declan Ward, executive director at NYSE Liffe in charge of clearing, says the danger is that certain OTC products with unique specifications negotiated to deal with particular risks are relatively illiquid. Coupled with lack of transparency in pricing “you are adding risk to a CCP”.The Futures and Options Association is concerned by wording in Mr Geithner’s document- wording echoed in Congressional testimony by Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator. It said that an OTC derivative “is accepted for clearing by one or more fully regulated CCPs, it should create a presumption that it is a standardised contract and thus required to be cleared”, he says.Anthony Belchambers, FOA chief executive, says that defining standardisation in this way “could well have significant implications not only for the cost of hedging but could lead to a significant reduction in the number of contracts available for hedging complex underlying risks”.Others worry that any definition of standardisation would soon be out of date given the tendency of the OTC markets to invent products at a rapid clip.Mr Donohue says: “I worry that those kinds of definitions wouldn’t have all that much durability given the level of innovation.” Like other exchange heads, he argues that the market must have a role in deciding which OTC products should be cleared. A recent jump in the number of OTC energy derivatives being cleared through the CME’s Clearport clearer has been driven purely by market demand, he points out.Robert Paul, a lawyer at DLA Piper, says of US lawmakers grappling with the issue: “They will have difficulty defining ‘standardised’. The less ambitious they are, the more realistic it is that they will get something done.”Additional reporting by Tom Braithwaite and Sarah O’Connor in Washington
940;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Derivatives brokers hit at FSA policing;;Some of the world’s largest derivatives brokers on Wednesday hit out at the way the Financial Services Authority was implementing its toughened approach to policing the industry, warning that intrusive questioning of their business could cause “a standoff” with the watchdog.The criticism offers an early glimpse into how the FSA’s radical new style of overseeing financial markets in the wake of the crisis is being received by one of their most influential participants.Derivatives brokers act as intermediaries between clients – such as asset managers – and exchanges. They negotiate futures and options business done on exchanges such as the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) and CME Group in the US.Their operations have come under closer scrutiny as the FSA rolls out stricter compliance standards.Firms speaking at the annual IDX derivatives conference in London warned the FSA was starting for the first time to question brokers’ corporate strategy, an area hitherto untouched by regulators and left to management as a matter of business judgment.Nigel Avey, director of compliance and legal at MF Global, said: “The FSA is on the cusp of being a great organisation but they could well blow it.” He said there was a risk of a “lack of proportionality” in the watchdog’s dealings with those it regulated.Mr Avey said that the FSA had been asking for documentary evidence to back up the broker’s answers on strategy, “which can be quite difficult as a lot of strategy is conducted behind closed doors”.“I think there could be a dangerous point where the FSA could start to insist on governance structures of their own making,” Mr Avey said.Alexander Justham, director of the FSA’s market division, said the industry must understand that the idea that watchdogs should not be involved with those they regulated “at the early stages” – rather than letting firms largely self-regulate – was “just not acceptable” any longer.“This is where society wants us to be. You should do the right thing and if you don’t you run the risk of having your head put on a spike. We are not intending to go to war with the industry but, equally, we and the industry are going to have to change,” Mr Justham said.Simon Jackson, compliance officer in global markets at Deutsche Bank, said his “big worry” was that FSA staff were under pressure “to be seen to be asking as many questions as possible”.Questions for his firm had been “pretty vague, which suggests that the people asking are not that familiar with the products”. Mr Jackson said he feared the result would be that firms would end up in “a standoff” with regulators. “We may end up becoming quite defensive in the way we react to regulatory enquiries,” he said.
941;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-06-04T08:55:56Z;Brazilian exchange to open London office;;BM&F Bovespa, the Brazilian exchange, plans to open a London office next month as part of a push to encourage greater foreign participation in its rapidly-growing electronically-driven equities and derivatives markets.The exchange, like Brazil itself, has weathered the financial crisis better than most of its global rivals, with rising volumes that have helped make the Latin American bourse the world’s fourth largest by market capitalisation.That puts it ahead of NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange.Paulo de Sousa Oliveira, chief business development officer, said the opening of the London office would build on the opening of another in Shanghai in 2004, and an existing office in New York.It was aimed at increasing the share of foreign participation in the exchange’s derivatives markets from a current level of around 20 per cent. Foreign participation in its equities markets stands at around 35 per cent.BM&F Bovespa is the product of the merger in 2007 of the Bovespa equities exchange and the BM&F derivatives exchange. Since then, the group has been rapidly shifting from “open outcry” trading to electronic. Its shares have risen by 90 per cent since the start of the year, compared with a 56 rise in the FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index.The expansion into electronic trading, combined with the installation of “direct market access” (DMA) systems for foreign traders, has allowed BM&F Bovespa to tap a growing number of traders globally that want exposure to Brazilian derivatives such as stock index futures and a commodity futures such as soyabeans.Previously, foreign traders would have to call a broker in Brazil on the telephone. The broker would then place the order on the exchange.DMA allows traders outside the host country of an exchange - particularly those using trading algorithms increasingly common in electronic trading - to access BM&F Bovespa products electronically without using an intermediary.Mr Oliveira said about 60 per cent of derivatives volume on the exchange was the result of DMA trading, compared with almost zero last year. DMA accounted for 54 per cent of equities volume, and was “ really growing” he said.The only remaining open outcry pit, where “Ibovespa” stock index futures are traded by around 200 traders, will be closed next month. “It’s the end of an era,” Mr Oliveira told the Financial Times at the Mondo Visione Exchange Forum.To further improve access by foreign traders, BM&F Bovespa will on June 15 launch a “co-location” service. Co-location is increasingly common among exchanges and allows traders to physically locate the computer servers in exchange data centres, right next to – or metres from – the exchange’s matching engine itself. This helps cut the time it takes for trades to be executed.BM&F Bovespa also has a cross-shareholding arrangement with CME Group, the Chicago-based derivatives exchange. This includes an “order routing agreement” enabling customers in more than 80 countries using CME’s Globex electronic trading platform to trade BM&F Bovespa products directly, via the Brazilian exchange’s electronic trading platform.

It was created by the CBOT in 1973, a legacy that left many CBOT members holding trading rights in the CBOE.Members who kept their trading rights argued that they were entitled to a share of the CBOE when it demutualised. The CBOT was taken over in 2007 by the CME Group, a development that the CBOE argued eliminated members’ eligibility. The two sides reached a deal last year under which the CBOT claimants will receive an 18 per cent stake in the CBOE and a cash payment of $300m.Bill Brodsky, CBOE chairman and chief executive, said he was “extremely gratified to have reached this important milestone on the path to CBOE’s demutualisation.” Though exchange valuations have plummeted, the CBOE could be worth more than $3bn.
944;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-06-03T17:01:49Z;Exchanges warn on OTC clearing;;Three of the world’s largest exchanges have warned regulators and lawmakers not to force too much of the over-the-counter derivatives markets into clearing houses, saying that market participants should have a role in deciding how far such products are shifted away from the opaque privately negotiated markets.The comments on Wednesday, by executives at NYSE Liffe, Intercontinental Ex­change and London Stock Exchange, come from businesses that are likely to be the main beneficiaries of a push by the Obama administration to ensure more OTC derivatives are cleared and traded on exchanges and other regulated trading platforms.Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, has called for more OTC derivatives to be processed through clearing houses to reduce the counterparty risks associated with defaults, and for “standardised” OTC contracts to be traded on-exchange.But exchanges, many of which own their own clearers, are concerned that legislation written by the US Congress should not go so far as to force the more complex, tailored OTC derivatives into clearing houses that are ill-equipped to deal with the risks associated with them.In particular, they are concerned about how the unwinding of positions would be handled with such products, many of which are illiquid compared with standardised products.Mark Ibbotson, chief operating officer at NYSE Liffe, the futures arm of NYSE Euronext, said: “The plea we’d have is mandates are kept to a minimum. Is it right that every [OTC derivatives] product should be put in a straitjacket on an exchange?“It could damage the security of a clearing house to force products on to a clearing house that shouldn’t be there. We don’t want mandated solutions, let’s have us working with the market,” Mr Ibbotson said at the Mondo Visione Exchanges Forum.David Peniket, chief operations officer of ICE Europe, part of the US-based Intercontinental Exchange, said it was important to involve market participants in how far clearing is extended to the OTC markets.He cited the gradual adoption by market participants of clearing in OTC energy markets after Enron’s collapse.ICE started offering clearing of OTC energy products in the early 2000s. The New York Mercantile Exchange, now owned by CME, launched Clearport, a similar service, in 2002.“Regulators will certainly have markets that they want to encourage into clearing but I think it’s very important to let markets develop their solutions,” he told the Financial Times. “There is certainly a concern around mandatory solutions, that you damage liquidity.”Adam Kinsley, head of regulation at LSE, said: “The onus is on exchanges to develop commercial offerings that people want to use, and I don’t think it’s the right way for regulators to force inappropriate products on-exchange.”
945;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-06-02T19:05:21Z;Derivatives sector wakes up to the new reality;Industry understands need for changes;Dealers in the credit derivatives market are facing up to the fact that one of the biggest sources of their profits for years is going to change dramatically.Regulatory pressure is no longer focused on the $27,000bn market for credit default swaps (CDS) – used to take positions on whether or not a company or country will default on its debts. The entire $600,000bn of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market is under the spotlight.“All new products eventually stop being high-margin and become standardised, low-margin, and hopefully high-volume, businesses,” said an executive at one of the biggest derivatives dealers. “Credit derivatives are at this stage, and there is no point in resisting this any longer.”The widespread support for making derivatives “safer” – a move that the industry has to embrace in order to avoid regulations, which could put them out of business – was made clear on Tuesday in a letter from the derivatives industry to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In it, the industry shows it has got the message: the structure of the derivatives markets for credit, interest rates and equity derivatives has to change.“We understand the need to act quickly and decisively to implement these important measures,” said the letter to Bill Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. “These commitments address key concerns raised by supervisors and legislators globally.”All the measures are potentially costly to the industry, both in terms of the need to invest in technology and the need to put up more capital. But in the long run, these investments may pay off if volumes grow.This “understanding” is being highlighted in light of the reforms of the derivatives industry proposed by Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, which are still being fleshed out. Some regulators want more restrictions than those proposed by Mr Geithner.Just on Tuesday, the new chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions (CFTC) told senators that broad US regulatory reform is necessary. “We must urgently move to regulate the over-the-counter derivatives market and address excessive speculation through aggregated position limits,” said Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman.Many of the proposed regulatory changes are being driven by the experiences of the financial crisis.First, the billions of dollars of derivatives contracts struck between banks made the financial system susceptible to a domino effect of defaults if one large derivatives counterparty in the chain went under. Second, the potential for derivatives dealers and investors to switch business from a counterparty considered to be weak – a modern version of a run on the bank – has formed regulator views on how the OTC market has to change.To address the first problem, the industry says it will report all trades, whether centrally cleared or not.To address the second problem, regulators want dealers to cede some control of the OTC derivatives markets and allow investors, such as hedge funds and asset managers, to be direct participants in a clearing house. The industry says it will do this.It is here that tensions continue. A solution remains complex, not least because including a vast range of entities in a clearing house creates legal questions about their status in the event of bankruptcy and how their assets will be shared out.Indeed, a glimpse into the tensions has been revealed in an e-mail from hedge fund BlueMountain to dealers. Samuel Cole, chief operating officer, accused the banks of acting like an “oligopoly” and said that they were not working in good faith with their customers to develop choice in clearing.Some of Wall Street’s biggest names this year formed ICE Trust, a consortium with the InterContinental Exchange, Atlanta-based exchange group, to clear CDS contracts in the US.In its three months of operation, ICE Trust has cleared more than 8,000 CDS transactions with a notional value of more than $730bn. That has given it a significant head-start on the CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, which has plans to launch CMDX, its own CDS trading and clearing solution in collaboration with Citadel, the hedge fund.In the e-mail, Mr Cole said that BlueMountain is one of six buy-side firms that have agreed to be founding members of CMDX. The CME would only say it is “still talking” to buy- and sell-side firms.However, it is understood that CMDX has not been able to persuade any dealers to sign up as members. Without any sell-side interest, the venture cannot get off the ground. Mr Cole said that buy-side firms have come to the “disquieting realisation that the dealer community may be filibustering to protect its oligopoly and [is] not seriously engaged in working with the buy-side to develop a clearing solution”.The battle does not simply pit investors against dealers: some banks are more opposed to giving investors a stake than others. Indeed, there are also other interests. Exchanges, such as the CME, are seeking a greater role in the vast OTC markets. Electronic systems run by entities ranging from ICAP to Tradeweb are also offering services similar to those offered by exchanges.As the BlueMountain e-mail puts it, the industry needs to overcome its divisions if it wants to avoid the tough regulation that is proposed by some members of Congress. “Treasury has come forth with a “bid” – viable clearing. Congress is moving forward with its “offer” – no CDS market,” it says.
946;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;NYSE Liffe to launch equity index futures;;NYSE Liffe on Tuesday said it would launch a suite of US and European stock index futures products based on MSCI Equity Indices, in the first expansion of its product base since the US futures arm of NYSE Euronext launched eight months ago.The move comes after NYSE Liffe started operations in the US with gold and silver contracts, a portfolio of derivatives NYSE Euronext bought from CME Group after the Chicago-based exchange was forced to divest the products by antitrust authorities as part of its acquisition of the Chicago Board of Trade.Observers have been sceptical of NYSE Liffe’s ability to build a futures business given the difficulty that previous new entrants into the US futures markets have had competing against the CME Group, which controls about 98 per cent of volume traded in exchange-traded US financial futures.However, NYSE Liffe is betting that recent buoyancy in equity index derivatives – compared with relatively weak markets for interest rate futures, the CME’s flagship product – may signal an unexpected opportunity in the wake of the financial crisis.Tom Callahan, NYSE Euronext’s head of US futures, told the Financial Times: “Equity index volumes have stayed remarkably strong in the face of the deleveraging that we’ve seen. That’s a good thing in terms of the overall health of the market and we see no reason why index volumes will be dropping off any time soon.”NYSE Euronext is hoping that its strength in equity products generally – and relations with end-users of such products, including exchange-traded funds – will help it spin off futures based on equity products more easily.About 30 per cent of participation in European equity index markets on Liffe, the original European operation of NYSE Liffe, comes from US investors.John Lothian, founder of MarketsWiki, an online information resource for global markets sponsored by NYSE Euronext and its competitors, said: “NYSE Liffe US bridges markets from New York to London and with these new futures indices they are wrapping their arms around stock markets all around the world. With the dollar under siege, these products present a great way for investors and traders to diversify into other equity markets.”NYSE Liffe has signed a licence agreement with MSCI, which will allow the trading of 44 equity index products, including those based on markets in Brazil, Russia, India and China.Asked what products NYSE Liffe was considering next, Mr Callahan said: “We are going to be a global multi-asset class exchange so I think you should see products launched in the interest rate and commodity complex.”
947;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-05-19T19:36:49Z;Let battle commence;;Last Wednesday night, David Clark, a London-based banker, received a nasty shock. Reports from Washington suggested the US government would soon impose restrictive new regulation on the derivatives world – a move Mr Clark believes could severely damage financial business in London and New York.He duly prepared a furious statement on behalf of the Wholesale Market Brokers’ Association, a lobbying group he leads. But when, a few hours later, he saw the proposals from Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, Mr Clark had second thoughts. “What Geithner has written may not be so bad,” he says, adding there is now “uncertainty” about what will happen next.No wonder. Until recently, the technical detail of derivatives excited only financial geeks. Now it is turning into a political hot potato with potentially big implications for bank profits. After the first wave of policy reforms unleashed by the administration of Barack Obama in response to the financial crisis, focused on short-term crisis measures, such as the “stress tests” of the health of banks, the next frontier is a fight about how the financial industry is structured – and run.And what makes the once arcane issue so emotive is that they are not just central to the banks’ modern business model but also raise questions about the degree to which financial players should be free to innovate, without state control.A public debate about derivatives is long overdue. For while politicians – and consumers – largely ignored this sector during the first seven years of the decade, an extraordinary revolution has quietly unfolded in recent years.When the trading of “derivatives” – instruments whose value “derives” from something else – took off on a large scale three decades ago, it was a marginal corner of finance. By the start of this decade, the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements estimated there were about $100,000bn of outstanding deals. By late 2008 there were nearly $600,000bn, 16 times global equity market capitalisation (and 10 times global gross domestic product).Bankers insist that these astonishing numbers are misleading, since many outstanding contracts offset each other in economic terms. Indeed, the BIS estimates that, after such netting, the “real” net market value of derivatives deals was “only” $34,000bn last year.Nevertheless, the presence of those $600,000bn overlapping deals is important, since banks typically collect a fee on every (gross) contract written. Moreover, these deals have trapped banks and other financial players in a complex web of counterparty risk.In the equity market, most trading occurs on a regulated exchange where deals can be publicly monitored by every­one. Trades are then “cleared” on a central platform, which completes a deal even if one counterparty collapses. Some derivatives deals – such as government bond futures – are traded on similar exchanges in Chicago and London. However, BIS data suggests four-fifths of outstanding derivatives trades have been cut in the so-called “over-the-counter” world, via private deals.That means in many cases there is no centralised system to monitor prices or deals nor any third party to ensure a trade is completed if a counterparty fails. And while the industry has tried to mitigate this “counterparty risk” by encouraging traders to post collateral when they cut deals, these arrangements are not always seen as robust.When Lehman Brothers collapsed last autumn, for example, markets froze because investors were unsure whether their deals would be completed. Worse, because trades were private, neither regulators nor investors knew where the risks lay. As a result, the US government was convinced the insurance group AIG – which had credit derivatives deals with dozens of other banks – could not be allowed to collapse.As Mary Schapiro, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, says: “OTC derivatives, particularly credit derivatives …contributed to the financial mess we are cleaning up today.”The proposals Mr Geithner, Ms Schapiro and others have unveiled try to tackle these problems in four ways. First, they demand all “standardised” derivatives are centrally cleared to remove counterparty risk, even if they are not traded on an exchange.Second, they “encourage” the industry to use regulated exchanges in addition to clearing platforms (because it is only on exchanges that investors get equal access to trading and price data, rather than being forced to rely on a small club of dominant banks).Third, the Obama administration wants all institutions to record every derivatives trade to enable supervisors to prevent market abuse. Fourth, it wants to tighten rules on capital and collateral provision to ensure all derivatives players have buffers to absorb any losses. That is a radical step because, while banks already face such rules, hedge funds, companies and insurance groups such as AIG do not.More striking still, the administration wants to impose a sliding scale of capital charges to “steer” behaviour. Derivatives deals conducted on regulated exchanges will attract lower charges than OTC deals.To some, the measures look timid. Christopher Whalen, a US financial analystsays the way to remove systemic risk is to force all trades on to transparent exchanges. Banks, he says, will fight this as OTC activity is a dominant source of profits for some. Deals cut on exchanges typically produce a few basis points of commission but OTC trades can produce revenue of several percentage points.“Despite the appearance of reform, the Treasury proposal …still leaves the OTC market firmly in the hands of the large derivatives-dealer banks,” says Mr Whalen. “Without the excessive rents earned by JPMorgan Chase and the remaining legacy OTC dealers, the largest banks cannot survive.”Frank Partnoy, a former derivatives trader, now an academic, thinks the proposals fall short because they cover only “standardised” deals – not the complex contracts that wreaked havoc at AIG and elsewhere. “By bifurcating the market into some derivatives that are standardised and disclosed, and some that are not, there is a [loop] hole that can only get bigger,” he says.Although the administration has not defined “standardised”, a narrow definition may capture less than half of all recent deals. In credit derivatives most index trades and deals on single company bonds can be considered standardised by some measures. Bundles of derivatives, such as collateralised debt obligations, cannot.The banking industry, by contrast, complains the reforms go too far. Most senior financiers are willing to move some activity on to a clearing platform. Indeed, this shift was under way before last week’s announcement – ventures offering clearing functions for credit derivatives started operating this year. Some large brokers, such asIcap, also accept the idea of limited exchange trading – not least because Icap runs an electronic exchange.However, bankers oppose the idea that all activity should be channelled to an exchange, claiming it would crush innovation and reduce liquidity, because banks would no longer have a profit incentive to cut deals.“Forcing OTC products on to exchanges …would result in increased risks and costs for end users,” says Mr Clark of the WMBA, which says British pension funds have saved themselves £40bn recently by hedging with derivatives. Or as Anthony Belchambers, head of the Futures and Options Association, says: “This kind of regulatory pressure will distort free-market competition and restrict product diversity.”In reality, it is unclear how far the administration plans to drive activity on to exchanges. Washington is still trying to steer a careful line between populist politicians who can sense public anger and the powerful financial lobby. Senior US officials hope a sliding scale of charges will be less controversial than a ban. After all, they point out, market-based “incentives” sit more easily with US free-market ideals than government diktat.But nobody in Washington expects the debate to be won fast. And what makes Mr Geithner’s plan doubly controversial is that its implications go way beyond Washington itself.When he met reporters last week Mr Geithner paid lip service to the “very important process” of global co-ordination. However, Washington appears to have engaged in scant consultation with Europe before last week’s announcement. The European Commission is now preparing measures to impose centralised clearing on credit derivatives, which it may extend to OTC derivatives. US finance officials assume European measures will ape US moves but this is not guaranteed.In the meantime, bankers in London are preparing to exploit any transatlantic regulatory gaps. “Only 25 per cent of all OTC trading actually happens in America,” one senior London-based banker says. “So we don’t think what Geithner says is going to change anything for us …and even if [Brussels] does the same, activity will just go to Singapore or Switzerland instead.”Sentiments like that explain why US politicians distrust the derivatives world. They also illustrate the nightmarish difficulty reformers face. After all, several times in the past three decades, US politicians have tried to clamp down on derivatives – and each time the Wall Street lobby has fought back.Some observers, such as Willa Bruckner, a partner at Alston & Bird law firm and veteran of earlier battles, hope this time will be different. In the past the industry convinced regulators it was able to regulate itself. “But because of the magnitude and the breadth of this crisis, these arguments are not so convincing now,” she says.Not everybody agrees Mr Geithner truly has the stomach for change. The one thing that is crystal clear is that “the [banking] industry is girding for battle, [hiring] armies of lobbyists and lawyers,” as Mr Whalen says. Stand by for a long – and potentially bitter – derivatives war.‘ALL THE ARROWS POINTED IN THIS DIRECTION’Written off by many when the alternative trading platforms arrived, big exchanges now find they are again places of value“Thank you Tim Geithner and friends” was the gushing endorsement from one exchanges analyst when the US Treasury secretary unveiled plans for sweeping changes to the over-the-counter derivatives markets last week, writes Jeremy Grant.For years, a tug-of-war has raged between the big derivatives exchanges, from their home turf in Chicago, and the OTC markets, represented by dealers at the Wall Street banks. The inventors of financial futures in the Windy City in the 1970s were appalled at the emergence a decade later of products developed by the banks that looked suspiciously like copies of their own inventions. They wanted all derivatives traded on-exchange.The two sides reached a deal in 2000 with the Commodity Futures Modernisation Act. The exchanges agreed not to oppose an exemption of the OTC markets from oversight by the US futures regulator, while the OTC players would not oppose a “light touch” regulatory regime that the exchanges had been seeking for their part of the markets. But rivalry persisted, especially as OTC derivatives overtook the size of exchange-traded markets at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, now CME Group.Fast forward to the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September. Things started to go the exchanges’ way when Mr Geithner – then chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York – insisted that OTC contracts should be processed as far as possible through a clearing house, to safeguard the financial system against the fallout from another catastrophic default.Now, with a stipulation by the administration of President Barack Obama not only that OTC derivatives should be cleared but also that “standardised” OTC derivatives should be moved on to exchanges, the exchanges appear to have won a victory in that battle – hence the ringing endorsement from the analyst, who covers CME.A sense that the exchanges have been unexpected beneficiaries from the financial crisis has been heightened elsewhere. A mere 18 months ago in Europe, analysts were predicting that competition unleashed by the European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directivewould leave exchanges badly damaged by upstart trading platforms such as Chi-X and Turquoise. Yet this week, as the London Stock Exchange introduces Xavier Rolet, a former Lehman banker, as its chief executive, the rivals have yet to hole the exchange below the water line.None of the five platforms in existence is making money, even as they collectively claim more than 20 per cent of trading in the shares of companies that make up the FTSE 100 index. In addition, the LSE says many users of the OTC equity markets have started shifting orders on to the exchange, where trades are cleared through LCH.Clearnet.However, it is too soon to write off important players in the OTC markets. Susan Milligan of The Options Clearing Corporation, which clears for all seven US options exchanges, says the exchange-traded and OTC derivatives markets have long had a symbiotic relationship as traders use them to arbitrage one against the other. That means one market’s gain is not necessarily the other’s loss, making it hard to conclude that a regulatory push to shift contracts on to more formal structures is wholly damaging to the OTC markets. “There has been a long-standing push and pull between the [OTC] dealers and the exchanges but if you look at the CME’s volumes, one of the reasons that’s down is there aren’t as many OTC contracts being traded,” she says.The inter-dealer brokerages that act as intermediaries in the OTC derivatives markets, negotiating contracts on the phone or electronically on screens, will find their phone broking businesses hurt by the new regulatory environment. But those with large electronic businesses – Icap, Tullett Prebon, GFI Group and BGC Partners with its eSpeed platform – could benefit. The US administration wants “standardised” OTC contracts to be traded not only on “regulated exchanges” but on “regulated transparent electronic trade execution systems”. That could be taken to mean the brokers’ systems, although the detail will have to be thrashed out in Congress.Icap has not wasted time in developing post-trade services for OTC markets – making it more “exchange-like”. It has also joined a 12-member bank consortium that is bidding for LCH.Clearnet, a move that would give the broker an interest in an operation that already clears swaths of the interest rate swaps markets.Michael Spencer, Icap’s chief executive, says: “All the arrows have pointed in this direction for some time. We had anticipated that there would be a push to clear certain [OTC] products.”Yet the non-exchange side cannot rest easy as long as the regulatory pressure to make markets “safer” persists. The big fear among inter-dealer brokers is of a blind rush to push everything on-exchange even though non-exchange venues could fulfil the Geithner requirements – such as more clearing through LCH.Clearnet, which is not exchange-owned.
948;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-05-14T20:47:33Z;Financial stocks boost Wall Street;;US equities broke their losing streak on Thursday following three consecutive days of selling as investors shrugged off negative unemployment data and took encouragement from the retail sector.Figures showed that many more people claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week than analysts had projected.But financial stocks managed to gain headway in the face of this data, in part as a result of the falling interbank lending rate, which saw its biggest drop in two months to a record low of 0.85 per cent.Citigroup gained 4.1 per cent to $3.55, Bank of America picked up 2.7 per cent to $11.31 and JPMorgan rose 4.4 per cent to $35.54.MBIA, the bond insurer, fell in early trade after a group of the world’s biggest banks filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming that it reduced its ability to pay policyholders by splitting its business into a “good bank” and “bad bank”.Its shares then recovered after the company said that the claim lacked merit and that the New York State Insurance Department approved the split “after a “thorough examination”. They closed 6.5 per cent up at $6.06.The impact of the figures on the broader market was tempered by several retailers’ reporting encouraging profits. This relieved some of the gloom surrounding consumer behaviour after the release of data on Wednesday that showed retail sales unexpectedly fell in April.Wal-Mart, the supermarket chain, reported profits that were in line with Wall Street’s expectations. But investors were concerned about lower-than-expected revenues and its shares lost 1.9 per cent to $49.10.Kohl’s, the chain of family department stores, opened higher after its profits beat analysts’ earnings estimates and the company raised its full-year profit forecast. But they fell back during the day while directors spoke to shareholders and closed down 1.7 per cent at $41.24.At the higher end of the market, Whole Foods, the organic food retailer, announced higher profits than expected after keeping costs low. Its comparable sales fell but not as far as predicted and the shares gained 2.8 per cent to $20.55.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent up at 893.07 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 8,331.32.The gains came as a surprise to many, who had expected the jobless figures to trigger a sell-off.“As people look for a bottoming process, they are focusing on retail sales as a leading indicator, rather than jobless claims, which people think of as a lagging indicator,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.The Nasdaq Composite index outperformed, picking up 1.5 per cent to 1,689.21.It was helped by results from CA, the business software maker, whose profit beat expectations on the back of a long-running effort to cut costs. Its shares rose 5.5 per cent to $18.27.There was more turbulence in the automotive sector as shares in General Motors dropped close to the historic lows set on Tuesday after Fritz Henderson, chief executive, said that bankruptcy was now “probable”, and its shares lost 5 per cent to $1.15.Shares in its rival Fordjumped 4 per cent to $5.16, however, after Alan Mulally, chief executive, told shareholders at the annual meeting it was making “tremendous progress” on restructuring its balance sheet.Car parts makers also had a volatile day as the market digested news that Chrysler would terminate contracts with a quarter of its dealers.Shares in Lear swung over 38 per cent during the day. The company reported a quarterly loss, but its shares rose on hope it could renegotiate its debt. They fell back after the announcement from Chrysler and closed 5.7 per cent down at $1.32.Its competitor Johnson Controls has completed 70 per cent of its restructuring programme, according to Wachovia, which upgraded its shares, sending them up 5.5 per cent to $18.68.Exchanges were some of the day’s biggest winners as they stand to benefit from the government’s plan to move over-the-counter ­derivatives trading on to electronic platforms.CME, the Chicago-based exchange where futures are traded, gained 3.8 per cent to $284.37. Its rival Intercontinental Exchangerose 4.3 per cent to $100.76.
949;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-04-23T21:09:25Z;US shares struggle on economic news;;US stocks struggled for direction before ending higher on Thursday as investors reacted to quarterly earnings reports from companies including Apple and United Parcel Service and digested more disappointing economic news.UPS reported quarterly profits that missed analysts’ estimates and forecast no quick turnaround as the global economic downturn continued to take its toll on the world’s largest package delivery group.Its quarterly net income fell by 56 per cent, from $906m a year earlier to $401m. Its shares fell 2.6 per cent to $53.33. Shares in its main competitor, FedEx, which like UPS has been on a cost-cutting drive, rose 3.4 per cent to $55.04.In contrast, Apple said after the market closed on Wednesday that its profit had risen 15 per cent to $1.21bn, or $1.33 a share, compared with forecasts of $1.08. Its shares closed 3.2 per cent higher at $125.40 in spite of a relatively downbeat forecast for the current quarter, with revenues estimated at $7.7bn-$7.9bn and earnings at $0.95-$1 a share.The previous session had ended lower with leading indices giving up an earlier rally, leaving some analysts to express doubt about the sustainability of the rebound. A late sell-off in the financial sector had erased gains made during a choppy trading day on Wall Street.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was 1 per cent higher at 851.92 points while the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,652.21 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 7.957.06 points.The CBOE’s Vix index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, was down 2.5 per cent at 37.15 and remains significantly below highs of approaching 90 reached last year, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Disappointing economic news also weighed on stocks with a weekly report on jobless claims saying the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance in the week ending April 18 rose by 27,000 to a higher than expected 640,000, while continuing claims crept up again to a new record high.The pace of sales of existing homes in the US fell 3 per cent in March to a sharply lower-than-expected 4.57m unit annual rate, according to the National Association of Realtors.Shares ended higher led by late gains for banks and companies involved in the credit card business. These moved higher after senior executives from the industry met with President Barack Obama. Representatives from banks including Wells Fargo, Visa, JPMorgan, MasterCard and Visa, were among those at the meetings. Wells Fargo shares rose 10.5 per cent to $20.09 while Capital One shares rose 17.7 per cent to $16.93.The earnings season is in full swing with many reports issued before the bell on Thursday and several more due after the close. Before the open, Hershey and Raytheon posted better-than-expected results. Shares in Hershey rose 3.9 per cent to $37.45 while Raytheon rose 5.9 per cent to $43.72.Fifth Third Bancorp shares rose 3.5 per cent to $3.82 after it also beat analyst expectations, posting a smaller than expected loss.Boutique investment bank KBW swung to a first-quarter profit on lower costs that offset declines in commissions and investment-banking revenue.Shares in the company advanced 2.6 per cent to $24.87.SunTrust Banks shares fell 3.3 per cent to $14.89 after it swung to a $714.8m first-quarter loss, hurt by real-estate and mortgage investments and ”recession-related costs” as it boosted reserves for bad loans. PNC Financial Services’ shares rose 7.5 per cent to $40.93 as first-quarter profits came in well ahead of expectations. Microsoft, American Express and Amgen were due to report after the closing bell last night. Microsoft shares moved 1.2 per cent lower to $18.54.The exchange sector was in focus as profits at the CME Group operator of the world’s largest futures exchange, plunged by 30 per cent in the first three months of the year from the same period in 2008.But in spite of this, CME shares rose 9.4 per cent, to $239 leading other exchanges groups higher.Shares in NYSE Euronext were up 13.7 per cent at $23.37 while Nasdaq OMXshares rose 3.3 per cent.
950;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;CME banks on US government debt hedging;;The CME Group is pinning its hopes for a recovery in financial trading volumes on hedging of US government-issued debt.The operator of the world’s largest futures exchange insisted on Thursday that deleveraging by crisis-ridden Wall Street financial institutions had caused “a cyclical downturn and not a secular shift” in trading volumes.Profits at the company plunged by 30 per cent in the first three months of the year from the same period in 2008, as the effect of deleveraging continued to echo through the financial trading industry.Banks and other dealers have cut their derivatives trading desks as they struggle through the crisis.The CME – formed from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s $11bn takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 – last year bought Nymex, the New York energy exchange, for $7.6bn.Excluding extraordinary items relating to that deal, net income for the first quarter was $213m, or $3.20 per share, down from $302m, or $4.54 per share, a year earlier.Revenues dropped by 27 per cent, to $252m, from $277m in 2008.The results were in line with analysts’ expectations and mirror a hefty pull-back in trading volumes. Average daily volumes at the company’s exchanges fell to 10.4m in the quarter, down from 15.5m a year ago.One of the weakest performing areas was interest-rate products, where average daily volumes declined to 3.8m from 8.3m last year.Interest-rate contracts – once the backbone of the CME’s business – have diminished in importance for the company as other product lines, such as equity index futures, have grown. In the first three months of this year, interest-rate contracts represented 45 per cent of average daily volume at the CME’s Chicago exchanges, down from 60 per cent last year.However, the group says it expects that as the US government issues large amounts of debt to cover bail-outs and stimulus packages, trading volumes will increase.“Treasury issuance of about $2,000bn will be very positive for our market,” Terry Duffy, CME chairman, said. “People will need to manage that risk.“It depends on the question of when rates start to move.“If rates continue to stay static, people may be comfortable not laying off some of that risk, but if rates start to tick one way or another we’ll see a lot of activity in our marketplace,” Mr Duffy said.
951;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-04-17T15:46:54Z;The financial sector: Cinderella at last takes her rightful place in spotlight;;News that a bank in Asia has enlisted the services of a company called SuperDerivatives to provide risk management for its currency options sales teams would not normally generate much interest beyond a specialist audience.Last month, Hong Kong-listed ICBC said it had hired the London-based company to help its currency and interest-rates derivatives sales teams obtain access to more accurate pricing in what are typically illiquid markets, which make this difficult.Getting a proper handle on the pricing of seemingly-esoteric derivatives contracts is part of a wider phenomenon gripping the financial services industry in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis.Banks, brokers, other traders in financial instruments, asset managers and hedge funds are all focused as never before on making sure they know – as far as possible in “real time” – how to value the financial instruments they are trading.They are also scrambling to adopt mechanisms to tell them their exposures to the parties with which they are trading, and whether they are creditworthy.This has come about because the collapse last September of Lehman Brothers, the former investment bank, exposed the lack of such risk management mechanisms across the financial system.Within hours of the bank’s default, banks and other counterparties that had traded with Lehman were trying to figure out what their exposures were to the stricken entity. They were largely unable to, as risk management systems were not set up to provide sufficiently accurate and “real time” information to compliance departments and to management.The result is playing out across the financial system now: a scramble to adopt measures that should help prevent shocks to the wider financial system were a Lehman-like event to recur.Keith Todd, executive chairman at FFastfill, a provider of risk management software in the trading and exchanges sector, says: “It [risk management] is probably the top topic people talk about – ahead even of cost reductions. Boards and management teams are running scared of what’s happened.”Nowhere is this more apparent than in moves to expand the use of clearing in the trading of certain financial instruments.When Lehman collapsed, hundreds of counterparties to Lehman in the privately negotiated, or over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets were left hanging, as the counterparty with which they had traded these instruments effectively disappeared off the map.That could have been avoided if such OTC contracts had been put through a clearing house.Clearers stand between parties to a trade, becoming a buyer to every seller, and a seller to every buyer. They take on the counterparty risk associated with each participant, guaranteeing a trade, should one party fail to deliver on its commitment.Since many such OTC contracts were not cleared, counterparties were unpaid, and contracts left open. As a result, trust evaporated from the financial system – and markets and business are still dealing with the consequences.Policymakers have moved swiftly. In the six months since the Lehman debacle, US regulators have insisted that certain OTC credit derivatives – credit default swaps – be cleared in future.IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), an operator of futures exchanges and OTC platforms, last month started clearing CDS contracts in tandem with some of the largest users of such contracts. CME Group, the largest US futures exchange, is working on its own plan for OTC CDS clearing.In Europe, the European Commission has agreed with the biggest users of CDS contracts that a clearing mechanism – or mechanisms – be in place by the end of July.ICE and CME are working on setting up a European CDS clearing service, as are Eurex Clearing, a unit of Deutsche Börse, the Frankfurt-based exchange group.LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest clearer independent of an exchange, already offers CDS clearing with NYSE Liffe, the futures arm of NYSE Euronext, the transatlantic exchange group.In Asia, the Japan Securities Clearing Corporation is considering a CDS clearing initiative of its own.Last month, the G20 re-affirmed the need to “promote the standardisation and resilience of credit derivatives markets, in particular through the establishment of central clearing counterparties subject to effective regulation and supervision”.There are already signs the regulatory push on clearing is having an effect on market behaviour.LCH.Clearnet has seen a surge in throughput of interest rate swaps on its SwapClear OTC interest rate swaps clearing service.Isabella Kurek-Smith, head of energy and freight, says: “LCH is receiving an increasing amount of requests to act as the clearing house for organisations launching new markets that perhaps didn’t consider they needed clearing before. Exposure to counterparty risk has grown tremendously in the past few months.”ClearPort, the CME’s OTC energy derivatives clearing service, is one of the fastest-growing businesses within the CME Group. Credit Suisse attributes the rise to “increased bilateral counterparty credit worries post financial crisis”.Cubillas Ding, analyst at Celent, a consultancy, says: “We are heading into an increasingly stringent post-reformation era in financial markets. There is significant rebuilding work to be done, and firms need to be smart in choosing their routes to recovering confidence and stature.“With the weight of scrutiny, the issue is no longer if, when, or what we need to do, but how to best think about the issue of pricing transparency, independence, and accountability in an aligned manner,” he adds.Elsewhere, risk management is making its presence felt in a renewed focus on bank liquidity management.Diamond, a management and technology consultancy says: “We believe firms will fall into one of two groups.There will be those that simply maintain their footing by implementing the bare minimum FSA, US Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission liquidity risk management requirements, and those more strategic-minded firms that turn regulatory compliance into…a substantial competitive advantage.”
952;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-03-30T19:54:03Z;Exchanges to suffer from fall in trading;;"The global financial crisis will exert negative pressure on the profitability of equities and derivatives exchanges this year, as lower issuance and volumes hit a sector that has, so far, weathered the global financial crisis relatively well, according to a report from Moody’s.Exchange revenues and profits have held up well in spite of – and to a degree, thanks to – the turmoil affecting the financial sector. Volumes have often approached record levels during the crisis as traders moved to exit positions; piled into perceived safe havens or hedged their exposure to stocks or sectors.But the combined effects of falling asset prices, lower issuance volumes, and deleveraging by market participants, will curtail trading volumes, resulting in lower transaction revenues and company-wide earnings, according to the Moody’s study.However, the report points out that because of the differences in their respective business models, some exchanges are likely to fare better than others.Taking into account the competitiveness of the exchanges’ trading platforms; revenue diversification and sources of recurring revenue; pricing power; expense flexibility and balance sheet quality, the Moody’s report suggests that Nasdaq OMX may be best positioned to cope among the four exchanges it rates.The Nasdaq carries a positive outlook, while its larger rival in the equities market, NYSE Euronext, has its rating on review for possible downgrade. The other two exchanges – the CME Group and the London Stock Exchange – have stable outlooks.The ratings are based on “important differences in the pricing power, expense ­flexibility, and revenue diversification among the four exchanges that will determine their operating performance”.Longer-term, most analysts agree that trading volumes are likely to resume an upward path, although growth rates might struggle to reach pre-recession levels when monthly volume records became almost the norm."
953;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-03-16T19:59:37Z;Battle for credit derivatives clearing;;"Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of IntercontinentalExchange, has conquered months of tortuous negotiations to reach the point this week where the futures exchange can put its efforts to lead credit derivatives clearing into high gear.However, the best laid plans are no guarantee that anything is going to work out in what is an entirely new initiative for the near-$30,000bn market for credit default swaps.As Mr Sprecher told the Futures Industry Association’s annual conference in Florida last week: “We don’t know exactly what we will find when we get to the end of the thread we’ve started pulling here.”ICE is far from alone in its uncertain push towards a clearing house for over-the-counter credit derivatives. Its rival futures exchange and OTC trading platform operator, Chicago-based CME Group, is also moving ahead with its initiative, having received the regulatory go-ahead on Friday.US and European regulators have made centralised credit derivatives clearing a key part of their demands for a financial clean-up in the wake of the global financial crisis.The battle shaping up in this area is only one part of a much bigger competition among banks, exchanges and other providers of services and infrastructure to the trading of all kinds of financial assets.Regulators believe a centralised clearer for CDS markets should reduce risks to the wider financial system. A clearer stands between all parties who wish to trade and bears all the risk that a counterparty might be unable to pay its debts.For the exchanges, a lot is riding on the project. Bread-and-butter trading revenues are down amid deteriorating equity and derivatives markets. They see clearing as a new source of revenues.ICE spent $625m buying Creditex, a specialist broker central to its clearing effort, while the CME teamed up with hedge fund Citadel.Yet in the US, no-one is clear who even regulates CDS clearing – ICE’s clearing business comes under the New York Fed, while the CME is overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures regulator.For the big dealer banks involved in the market, there are costs of hooking up with each at a time of severely constrained budgets. Some question the need for multiple providers, but acknowledge that the market, not regulators, will decide how many survive.A further complication is the determination of European policymakers to have a separate clearer for the region, both to ensure risks are not concentrated in a single US clearer as well as to allow them to have a window on market activity.But many argue such a demand is at odds with the global nature of the market. David Clark, chairman of the Wholesale Market Brokers Association, which represents the interests in Europe of inter-dealer brokers, supports moves to increase clearing of all OTC products. But he says: “An American or Australian bank might trade in a CDS out of its London office with an underlying risk that is with a European borrower.”Some – including the French central bank – insist European CDS clearing solutions be based specifically in the eurozone, effectively cutting London out of the picture. This is tricky for NYSE Liffe, the futures arm of NYSE Euronext, which has operated CDS clearing in the city since December.Garry Jones, head of NYSE Liffe’s global derivatives, says: “The eurozone argument is a politically-driven process and we don’t think it has any merit.”However, participants and the lead global trade body for the derivatives industry, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, have agreed with the European Commission and exchanges to create a European CDS clearer by July.For the two US-based exchanges, this means they will have to offer CDS clearing in Europe as well – which has big implications for their European rivals: NYSE Liffe, in conjunction with LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearer; and Eurex Clearing, part of Deutsche Börse.LCH.Clearnet has no US CDS clearer, but last week opened a New York office to pursue opportunities. The Eurex CDS clearing offering will be ready by the end of this month, but Andreas Preuss, chief executive, declines to say whether Eurex will also have to make a push into the US.He says: “We would never rule out anything. We are interested in providing a solution for the global market that is as powerful as it can be. We will certainly not accept a situation of competitive disadvantage.”A further big complication is standardising contracts, which is necessary to make clearing truly viable. For CDSs based on the popular indices, this is relatively simple and these are the first being cleared. But contracts on individual companies are much more variegated.Yet for all the focus on the CDS market, other OTC markets, such as interest rate and currencies, which are much larger than the credit markets in terms of notional volumes, could prove more promising in the long run. Nasdaq OMX, the exchange group, is focusing on clearing interest rate swaps. It recently bought an 80 per cent stake in the International Derivatives Clearing Group, a new clearer that started up in December. LCH.Clearnet already clears such swaps.Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, says these are “a more enduring asset class in the ‘re-regulated’ world”.But Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, compares the changes in clearing with the shift from floor-based to electronic, screen-based trading in derivatives on exchanges. “This is a secular shift that will take years to accomplish,” he says. “It is a marathon, not a sprint.”"
954;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;LCH.Clearnet awaits potential consortium offer;;A turning point could come for LCH.Clearnet as the clearing house finds out this week whether a consortium comprising eight banks and Icap, the inter-dealer broker led by Michael Spencer, will make an offer.The clearer, led by Roger Liddell, is at the centre of a tussle for control of what has become one of the world’s more desirable pieces of financial market infrastructure.The LCH board met last week, anticipating a bid. None came as the consortium has yet to agree on terms. Strategists at the clearer are now working on due diligence associated with an existing offer from The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US-based user-owned group. It has ambitions to expand into Europe and sees acquiring LCH.Clearnet as the best way to do so.LCH.Clearnet has recently started work on a “third way” proposal of its own. This involves buying out its existing 123 shareholders and inviting those that wish to to buy back in on different ownership terms, to create a user-owned utility along the lines of the DTCC. It would use unexpectedly high clearing revenues generated last year – more than double an estimate of €100m (£93m, $129m) – to fund the move.The idea is to ensure that Europe has a user-owned clearer at a time when most clearers are owned by exchanges with their own profit motives. There are doubts over whether the market’s best interests would be served if clearing services were controlled by a consortium whose commercial interests might not be aligned with all market users. There is a wider concern that LCH.Clearnet does not fall into the hands of a US-regulated entity such as the DTCC.The tussle comes as regulators focus on clearing as a way to help reduce the risk of future crises such as the default of Lehman Brothers.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, stepping in to guarantee performance on a transaction if either party defaults. Clearers hold collateral posted by every market participant, and can dig into further default funds if necessary to provide capital. LCH.Clearnet – and the DTCC – successfully managed down and closed all of the open positions left when Lehman collapsed.Regulators are pushing for over-the-counter (OTC), or privately negotiated credit derivatives – to be processd through a clearing house.As a result, the world’s largest exchanges, such as Chicago-based CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange, Frankfurt-based Eurex and NYSE Euronext (in conjunction with LCH.Clearnet) are rushing to set up clearing mechanisms for OTC credit default swaps.Mr Liddell says clearing’s profile has risen as banks’ trust in each other evaporated post-Lehman. “It’s just become a much higher priority,” he said at the Futures Industry Association’s conference in Florida last week.Mr Liddell will not say which of the three options on the table for the clearer is most likely to succeed. But he does argue that a utility structure is “efficient for the markets”.
955;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-03-11T14:32:05Z;ELX sets June start date;;Electronic Liquidity Exchange (ELX), a new US futures exchange backed by a group of banks, dealers and electronic market makers, said on Wednesday it would start operations in June, marking the latest effort to break the near-monopoly that the CME Group has on US futures markets.ELX was set up in December 2007 by Bank of America, Barclays Capital, inter-dealer broker BGC Partners, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank Securities, Getco and Peak6 (two Chicago-based market making firms), JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, RBS and Breakwater, a Chicago trading technology firm.The launch comes at the most challenging time for derivatives markets since the stock market listing of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2002 heralded a period of stellar growth in US futures markets.Since then CME has acquired the Chicago Board of Trade and New York Mercantile Exchange, giving it 98 per cent of the market for financial and commodity futures.However ,trading volumes have fallen sharply amid the financial crisis. Citi said on Wednesday global derivative volumes fell by 10 per cent in February, with year-to-date volumes down by 21 per cent.ELX said it would start operating in May with “comprehensive testing” of its high-speed electronic system, with live futures trading in Treasury securities to begin in June, subject to approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator.Neal Wolkoff, ELX chief executive and a former head of the American Stock Exchange, said: “ELX is poised in the next few months to deliver a high-velocity, cost-effective electronic platform with a modern rule set that will benefit all market participants.“This combination offers a highly competitive alternative for today’s technology-empowered market participants seeking to access a broad range of exchanges and pools of liquidity,” he said at the Futures Industry Association annual conference in Florida.The CFTC appeared likely to complete its review of ELX’s application to become a US futures exchange “in early spring”, Mr Wolkoff said.ELX has been built on BGC Partners’ eSpeed electronic trading platform, long in use by leading financial institutions for trading multiple assets, including US Treasury cash markets and European government bonds. Current users of the eSpeed system will have direct access to futures trading on ELX.
956;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Worries remain even after CDS clean-up;;The near-collapse of Bear Stearns a year ago caused shudders throughout the credit derivatives sector. Now the industry is set to experience another big bang.On Thursday, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) introduces changes to credit default swaps (CDS), the most common type of credit derivative.Among other measures, these rules will create procedures that determine payouts in the event of a default, avoiding potential lengthy legal disputes. In the US, new CDS will include features such as standard coupons which will make them more similar to bonds.All these moves will make clearing easier in the US, although European regulators still have to decide on clearing rules there.“The corporate CDS market is going through one of its most important structural shifts since its inception over a dozen years ago,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley.The demise of Bear Stearns could have made billions of dollars of derivatives contracts it had written worthless, and knocked out other banks exposed to such losses. A catastrophic chain reaction could have unfolded, particularly through the credit derivatives market ,which had grown in a decade from nothing to a little-understood sector with more than $60,000bn of outstanding contracts.In spite of repeated efforts by New York’s Federal Reserve bank to push dealers to tackle the lax settlement and documentation practices associated with credit derivatives, it was not until the near-collapse of Bear Stearns that these calls were taken seriously.The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers six months later finally made reducing systemic risks in credit derivatives a priority for Wall Street.“Since then, the industry has pushed through 10 years worth of changes in just a few months,” said Athanassios Diplas, managing director at Deutsche Bank. “This is a complete transformation of the CDS industry.”To address “counterparty risks” numerous steps have been taken.Outstanding contracts offsetting each other were cancelled, a process called “compression”. This has reduced the face value of outstanding CDS contracts to an estimated $30,000bn.In the months after Bear Stearn’s collapse, banks adopted changes to the way contracts were closed out when the bank backing the contract disappears. These rules, introduced in 2002 but only adopted last year, allowed similar contracts to be settled all at once, rather than case by case.“Some changes, such as the more efficient close-out rules, were adopted just in time to cope with the Lehman default,” said Mr Diplas.This week, the process to transfer the bulk of outstanding credit default swaps on banks and companies – contracts which pay out in the event of the default of the underlying entity – to a central clearing counterparty has begun in the US.The first clearing efforts will focus on indices of US corporate credits. Later this year, efforts will move onto clearing CDS for individual companies.“CDS clearing and transparency will instill confidence with regulators, banks, investors and taxpayers,” said Sunil Hirani, president of Creditex, a subsidiary of ICE, which started clearing through ICE Trust this week. Other clearers, such as CME Group, are also vying to enter the sector.There is already more information available about the size of the market and the risks outstanding, information which is made public via the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC).A few months ago, not even regulators were able to get some of this data. CDS remain widely used to take positions on risk and also to hedge positions, with trading continuing in recent months even as liquidity in many markets has disappeared.Yet, in spite of all these efforts – and investments by banks – there are questions hanging over credit derivatives which are not just technical and logistical.There are concerns about the role complex financial instruments, including credit derivatives, played in the financial crisis.The most visible symbol of this is AIG, which has already needed about $160bn of government backing to avoid default due to CDS positions.Divisions of insurance companies like AIG – which Fed chairman Ben Bernanke last week described as a hedge fund attached to an insurance company – used CDS to insure complex debt instruments whose value plunged after defaults on the risky mortgages backing them soared. Such tailormade and complex contracts are different to the more widely used credit default swaps market for corporates, and are not part of the clearing efforts.The way most CDS are traded is based on the participants’ posting collateral against the trades. AIG, due to its high credit ratings, did not have to post collateral until it was downgraded. At that point, the collateral calls were so massive that they effectively made the insurance giant insolvent.“Most counterparties are subject to collateral postings and these are adjusted daily on a mark-to-market basis. The clearing house is an even more efficient mechanism to do this,” said René Canezin, managing director at Barclays Capital.Yet the industry could not now be planning a new phase without government backing of AIG and banks like Citigroup, which are part of the ICE Trust clearing venture.“The government’s support …certainly inspired confidence that another large counterparty default was unlikely,” said Bradley Rogoff, analyst at Barclays Capital.In the meantime, regulators might still push for legislation which could curb CDS – ranging from mandatory exchange trading to requiring traders to hold underlying positions in bonds or loans.“There are some people who still believe the market should not exist at all”, said Brian Yelvington, analyst at Creditsights. “Despite the huge clean-up that has taken place in the CDS industry there are discussions as to the usefulness of the market versus what some perceive as its destructive nature.”Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie
957;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-03-07T00:42:27Z;ICE to begin clearing credit default swaps;;The clearing of the first credit default swaps by a central counterparty will begin next week – months later than originally intended – after regulators finally approved one of the plans on Friday.ICE Trust, a subsidiary of IntercontinentalExchange and a central clearing counterparty backed by the biggest dealers in the $28,000bn credit default swaps market, got the go-ahead from the Securities and Exchange Commission. It received approval from the Federal Reserve earlier in the week.Used as a form of insurance against the default of a company or bank or to place bets on the direction of their creditworthiness, credit default swaps were one of the fastest-growing parts of the financial markets during the past decade.The mispricing of complex credit derivatives used to hedge risky bonds backed by mortgages has resulted in losses at large financial institutions and brought some, such as AIG, close to collapse.In addition, the widespread use of such credit derivatives has exposed the largest financial institutions to potential knock-on losses if one of them should go under.Curbing such counterparty risks is a key goal of introducing a central counterparty, such as that proposed by ICE. Other exchanges, including Chicago’s CME Group, are also developing such clearing services and are expecting imminent approval from the SEC.“It is critical that we bring increased transparency to credit default swaps by developing efficient and effective oversight of credit default swap clearing agencies,” said Mary Schapiro, SEC chairman, in a statement.ICE Trust will begin processing and clearing credit default swaps of indices based on a range of different corporate credits. At a later stage, credit default swaps on individual entities will be cleared. It is likely to take at least six months to transfer substantial amounts of risks to the central counterparty, people involved said.The near-collapse of Bear Stearns nearly a year ago emphasised the need to reduce the counterparty risks embedded in the financial system. With heightened concerns about the creditworthiness of banks such as Citigroup, the need for centralised clearing remains important.Additional reporting by Anuj Gangahar
958;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-02-27T18:19:53Z;CME in talks to launch clearing service in London;;CME Group, the Chicago-based futures exchange, plans to set up a clearing service for over-the-counter credit default swaps in Europe in addition to its existing offering in the US, the exchange said on Friday.The disclosure is a sign that exchanges are racing to provide clearing of CDSs on a transatlantic basis after it became clear last week that European regulators had persuaded the industry to establish a Europe-based CDS clearer to complement initiatives in the US.Any move by the CME to set up a clearer in London would also signal a broader threat to Europe’s exchanges, since control of a clearing house offers an exchange a way of expanding into new products and geographical areas.The CME currently only clears derivatives in the US.Craig Donohue, chief executive, said: ”We are doing very well in terms of our regulatory approvals regarding our CDS platform and are also at a high level of internal preparedness.“We are undertaking a review with the FSA [Financial Services Authority] in the UK and the discussions are proceeding well, particularly because we are already recognised as a clearing agency in the UK.”He added that the CME’s US CDS clearing proposal was in the final stages of approval with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic want bilaterally-negotiated CDS contracts to be processed through a clearing house to reduce counterparty risk – that is the risk that parties to a trade default.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, guaranteeing performance of contracts if either side defaults.In recent months, efforts to establish such a clearing mechanism have been dominated by players in the US, where the CME is one of four exchange-led groups vying to provide the service.The others are NYSE Euronext and LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearer, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and Chicago-based clearer The Clearing Corporation, and Eurex Clearing, part of Deutsche Börse.CME rival ICE last week revealed it was also in talks with the FSA about setting up a European clearer for CDS contracts. It already operates ICE Clear Europe, a clearing house for ICE’s London-based energy exchange.Kim Taylor, the CME’s head of clearing, said that it had become clear to the exchange that providing a CDS clearing service in Europe would require building “an onshore presence” in London. That would involve FSA approval for a clearing house.In a sign of the CME’s increasing interest in expanding into OTC markets, CME this week appointed its first executive, David Boberski, to be in charge of developing new OTC products.Additional reporting by Anuj Gangahar in New York
959;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-02-12T20:12:32Z;Insight: Wall Street and Chicago set to resume turf wars;;The derivatives and futures industries gave a collective sigh of relief this month after the US House Agriculture committee’s hearing into its draft bill to expand derivatives regulation..The proposed legislation drawn up by the Democratic chairman of the committee, Collin Peterson, caught the headlines because of its implicit threat to shut down credit derivatives trading. But it was also an attempt to give the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission greater powers to stamp out perceived speculation across futures and derivatives.Most of those testifying before the committee, while “respectfully supporting” its broad aims of improving transparency and accountability in the markets, roundly panned its biggest ideas.Even those exchange-traded derivatives industry representatives who might be expected to have most to gain from looking to squash elements of the over-the-counter markets slammed the proposal on credit default swaps as, variously, anti-competitive, a danger to broader market liquidity and likely only to send business off-shore.One-nil to the industries, then. But this will be a long game and there is a school of thought that this episode was an early skirmish in a bigger renewal of hosilities between Wall Street and Chicago.In this view, the declaration of war came from Tim Geithner in his previous role when he proposed a clearing house for credit derivatives to be set up as a bank and regulated by the New York Fed. One industry campaigner on the Wall St side said: “The agriculture sector was enraged that the financial sector and banking in particular was taking a run at agriculture’s turf.”Such people see echoes of 1998 and the attempt by some at the CFTC under Brooksley Born to bring derivatives under the Chicago regulator’s control, which almost broke 6 years of entente between Wall Street and Chicago.They mutter darkly about the Chicago connections among Democrats not only on the agriculture committee, but also right to the top of the administration, including President Barack Obama himself and Rahm Emmanuel, his chief of staff.If campaign contributions are any sign at all, Wall Street should have few worries. The President’s are too vast and numerous to mention, but Mr Emmanuel’s are easier to read. According to the Centre for Responsive Politics’ website OpenSecrets.org, which tracks political cash for the public interest, Chicago’s CME Group was a sizeable donor last year, but came in at number eleven behind banks such as UBS, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Lehman Brothers. (Incidentally, the CME gave less to Mr Peterson, but was fourth-equal among his donors, according to OpenSecrets.)Terrence Duffy, executive chairman of the CME Group, was scathing of the CDS proposals, saying: “We are opposed to this provision as an unwarranted restriction on . . . free markets.”His non-Chicago rivals at NYSE Euronext and Eurex were similarly appalled by the threat to in effect ban most CDS trading – though all of course were in strong agreement with the need to establish a central clearing house for CDS and made note of their own efforts in this field. They are not pursuing such efforts for some global financial civic good, but because clearing can be highly profitable.The ICAP-led consortium’s tilt at LCH.Clearnet, which has agreed to a bid from the non-profit DTCC of the US, is testament to this – many of the banks in the ICAP consortium are also co-owners of DTCC, so in effect they are bidding against themselves.An old-fashioned conception of Chicago muscle versus Wall Street suits seems short-sighted. Really, a much bigger and wilder Battle Royale had already begun before the financial crisis and its repurcussions arrived.Banks, exchanges, inter-dealer brokers and infrastructure providers are all scrapping with each other to protect the old businesses and to attack the new. Exchanges play off against dark liquidity pools. Alliances for new clearing and other infrastructure projects are formed and reformed.The fact that regulatory frameworks and institutions in many countries are potentially all up for refashioning at the same time just gives the finance industry more to play for – and the politicians more cause to be wary.Paul.J.Davies@ft.com
960;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-02-12T19:34:10Z;Price of crude mixed as gold edges higher;;Gold nudged towards the $950 level as investors sought a haven while oil prices were mixed as dealers pondered the deteriorating outlook for global demand.Gold rose 1.2 per cent to a session peak of $949.70 a troy ounce, just short of the $953.30 high reached on Wednesday, as inflows into gold exchange traded funds testified to the strength of investor demand.Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest exchange-traded fund, rose to a record 935.09 tonnes on Wednesday, while gold held in exchange-traded funds managed by ETF Securities advanced to a record 2.29m ounces.In supply news, South Africa, the world’s second largest gold producer, reported a dramatic fall in output in December, down 17.6 per cent year-on-year.In energy markets, ICE March Brent, expiring on Thursday, rose 27 cents to $44.55 a barrel while the April contract added 38 cents at $45.70. Nymex March West Texas Intermediate extended its falls, down 64 cents to $35.30 a barrel.The front-month WTI contract has come under pressure because of weak US demand, increasing supplies from Canada and rising crude stocks at Cushing, Oklahoma, the most important hub in the US distribution network.The discount between WTI and Brent widened to more than $9 a barrel.The New York Mercantile Exchange vigorously defended the WTI futures contract, which was criticised on Wednesday by the International Energy Agency for “sending mixed and misleading price signals”.Bob Levin, CME Group managing director of energy and metals research, said WTI was the world’s best oil benchmark because the Nymex contract had greater transparency, liquidity and regulatory oversight.In its monthly report, the IEA warned that the WTI contract was in danger of becoming a “broken benchmark”.It also suggested that Nymex could alleviate problems with the contract by designating a second delivery point in the US Gulf coast and by increasing the number of crudes that were deliverable.However, Mr Levin said there was little appetite from market participants for either of the IEA’s suggestions. No industry users had indicated a need for a delivery point in the Gulf and previous attempts by Nymex to offer other grades of crude as deliverable alternatives had attracted negligible interest“The attributes that should support a benchmark for the global oil market are superior for WTI than Brent,” said Mr Levin. “We would not want to add uncertainty to the existing WTI contract as to where delivery could take place and what crude grades would be deliverable under the contract.”Mr Levin pointed out that description of WTI as a “landlocked” crude was incorrect because about 1m barrels a day of imported crude flowed directly into the US mid-continent market, which linked the WTI market directly with the seaborne market.The widely reported perception that Cushing’s storage capacity was full was incorrect, Mr Levin said.“The US presents very detailed information about stocks at Cushing on a real-time basis and so our market is more responsive to fundamentals than Brent where there is a six-week delay before the inventory situation becomes clear,” he said.
961;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-02-08T17:20:16Z;Case for change heard loud and clear;;When Chris Concannon, an executive at Nasdaq OMX, testified at a congressional hearing in early February on credit default swaps and clearing, he knew US lawmakers would wonder why an exchange famous for trading technology stocks had anything to say on the subject.So he pointed out that Nasdaq OMX operated eight clearing houses round the world. That week, the group bought a 22 per cent stake in EMCF, a clearer that acts for Chi-X, one of the new entrants in European share trading.Nasdaq’s push into clearing is a sign of the changes sweeping the world’s exchanges as trading volumes fall, competition intensifies and as regulators promote clearing as a way of reducing the risks to the financial system exposed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers.A clearing house acts as buyer for every seller, and also as seller for every buyer in a transaction, helping virtually to eliminate counterparty risk – the chance of a party to a transaction ending up defaulting.The exchanges realise now that, after successive years of record trading volumes, they can no longer rely on trading revenues to sustain their businesses and are looking elsewhere for growth.Benn Steil, an exchange expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York said: “The exchange gold rush is officially over .“The market for marketplaces has been brought to earth by deleveraging and we may never again see the cost of debt capital for financial institutions, which underpinned soaring [volumes], as low as it was from 2002-2007.”Last week CME Group, the futures exchange, reported a 41 per cent fall in trading volume amid an exodus of hedge funds from derivatives markets. Yet the volume of off-exchange energy trades processed through its Clearport clearing system jumped by 50 per cent.Celent, a consultancy, says the exchanges’ role in such post-trade services will only increase “in an environment where new regulations are expected and new risk management programmes and clearing initiatives are put into place”.The big opportunity is in over-the-counter derivatives, which is why the four largest exchanges – NYSE Euronext, CME, Deutsche Börse and IntercontinentalExchange – are finalising plans to clear OTC credit default swaps. Citi estimates that the pool of clearing revenue available here is $300m-$400m.Nasdaq recently bought a majority stake in International Derivatives Clearing Group, a new clearer for OTC interest rate swaps. Mr Concannon remarked to lawmakers candidly: “I will admit that we have self-interest in the reform of these markets.”At the same time, exchanges are trying to attract new users. NYSE Euronext launched SmartPool last week, a dark pool allowing the trading of large blocks of shares anonymously.CME, NYSE Euronext and Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, have all introduced fee rebates recently to attract high-frequency traders.They are also targeting investors not hurt by the collapse in prime brokerage funding, such as Chicago-based Getco, and Optiver, based in Amsterdam, which use their own risk capital to trade.Exchanges may go even further in their hunt for customers. Last month, the Börse came close to acquiring Neonet, Scandinavia’s largest broker, highlighting how exchanges want access to brokers’ order routing technology to increase order flow.Miranda Mizen, senior consultant at Tabb Group, says: “Whether this particular deal comes to fruition or not, there will be deals this year that break the mould.”As tough as life will be for exchanges, Citi analysts say that some asset classes will do well, including equity derivatives and interest rate swaps. Miserable equity markets could squeeze out some new equities trading platforms that have emergedIn 2008, so-called multilateral trading facilities, such as Turquoise, Chi-X, Nasdaq OMX and BATS Europe, captured a share of the most liquid European stocks. In January, their combined share was 15-17 per cent, according to Citi.MTFs are engaged in a price war that will delay their break-even points. Some may even be snapped up by exchanges.Peter Randall, chief executive of Chi-X, said consolidation was inevitable.He said: “Dealing with this market is going to need strong nerves and deep pockets”.
962;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-02-03T23:59:18Z;CME hit by trading slowdown;;Profits at CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, fell 69 per cent in the fourth quarter as trading houses cut back on futures operations and the exchange group wrote down $275m on a 2007 cross-equity deal.Separately, CME said trading volumes plummeted by more than 40 per cent last month compared with January 2008, with interest-rate trading down nearly 60 per cent. That suggests the pace of deleveraging by financial institutions is quickening: in December, CME’s trading volumes fell by 22 per cent, while interest-rate volumes were down by 49 per cent.“Across all our customer segments we’re seeing people reducing their activity levels in Treasury futures and the short-term interest rate market,” Craig Donohue, chief executive, told the FT. “It’s mostly attributable to the extreme dislocation in those markets in the last six months.” Mr Donohue said the fall in volumes was not solely related to a pull-back by battle-scarred hedge funds.“I hear people talking about hedge fund redemptions, but I’m a lot less certain that has much of an impact for us right now,” he said. “It’s more across-the-board cutting back by customers in the fixed-income interest rate area. I expect those problems will begin to abate now as we see some recovery in the credit and lending markets over the course of 2009.”CME said it was halting the share buy-back programme it announced last June to focus on paying down its $3.2bn debt burden, most of which relates to its 2008 purchase of Nymex.The company has repurchased about $250m of the $1.1bn of shares it originally said it wanted to buy back.Excluding extraordinary items such as the $275m write-down, profits for the fourth quarter were essentially flat at $239m, from $236m last year, while earnings per share were unchanged at $3.58.The group said it was taking a pre-tax charge of $275m on a $700m cross-equity deal it struck in 2007 with the Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange because of the decline in the share price of BM&F, which merged last year with the Bovespa stock exchange.One bright spot in the fourth quarter was a 40 per cent increase in daily trading on Clearport, an electronic system for clearing over-the-counter energy contracts CME acquired through its purchase of Nymex.●From the beginning of March, the NYSE will introduce a new fee schedule for customers and floor brokers, writes Anuj Gangahar in New York. The new measures will include the introduction of a customer rebate for adding liquidity of $0.0010 per share.
963;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-02-02T20:14:35Z;Icap looks to LCH Clearnet;;Michael Spencer, chief executive of interdealer Icap, is not known for waiting until industry developments get ahead of him.Three years ago, he discussed a merger with the London Stock Exchange, before it was clear that the lines were blurring between exchanges and interdealer brokers.Now, Icap is again trying to get ahead of the curve by joining a consortium that is considering making an offer to buy LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest clearing house. The deal challenges a preliminary agreement LCH.Clearnet signed three months ago for it to be absorbed by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation of the US.The rationale may not be obvious. What does Icap, the world’s leading broker of bilaterally negotiated – or over the counter – interest rate swaps, foreign exchange, credit derivatives and commodities, have in common with a clearing house?The answer lies in the financial crisis, which exposed the risks to the wider financial system when financial products are not cleared through a central counterparty.Regulators, cheered on by politicians, have seized the issue. There are increasing calls to move swathes of the OTC markets on to a cleared platform. Today, Congress will debate a draft bill that would mandate such a move in the US.At the same time, exchanges, which have long been jealous of the much larger OTC markets, have seized on the chance to grab a slice of the OTC action by touting their clearing systems. That explains why CME Group, Deutsche Börse, NYSE Euronext/Liffe and IntercontinentalExchange are vying to set up OTC clearing mechanisms for the $30,000bn credit default swaps market.Yet the interdealer brokers and the banks, which are among the biggest users of OTC products, do not want to be left behind, especially because revenues from pure trading will remain mixed given depressed markets.Clive Furness, managing director of Contango Markets, a consultancy, says: “You need to control the flow of business into clearing somehow. That is fundamental for anyone at this point.”Icap said in a recent study on the OTC markets there were limits to the extent to which OTC products could and should be moved into a cleared environment.But Icap and its rivals recognise that some shift is inevitable.David Clark, chairman of the Wholesale Market Brokers’ Association, says: “The interdealer brokers are well aware of the commercial and regulatory pressures to move some OTC products, particularly those that are credit-related, towards a clearing counterparty, as evidenced by this possible transaction.”Equally, the banks and interdealer brokers are partly motivated by wariness of exchanges. Axel Pierron, vice-president at Celent, a consultancy, says: “They clearly see that clearing houses could be the Trojan horse of exchanges to capture market share from OTC business if the regulator were to impose the use of clearing houses in OTC markets.“Therefore, it seems now crucial for market participants operating in the OTC world to operate their own clearing house.”A purchase of LCH.Clearnet makes sense for two reasons. First, it would give Icap and others some control over Swapclear, its interest rate swap clearing unit. Interest rate swaps dwarf the CDS market, currently the focus of the shift into clearing. The banks and Icap may also want to expand its business beyond the interbank interest rate swaps market.Second, prising LCH.Clearnet from the hands of the DTCC would satisfy some who dislike the prospect of Europe’s last free-standing clearer falling into the hands of an entity regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
964;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Credit derivatives drive hits a wall;;"In early April last year a group of leading investment banks blew the dust off their ownership of a near forgotten company with no chief executive, just 40 staff and Chicago offices that were dominated by unoccupied cubicles.Their plan for this atrophied asset was to confront directly regulators’ fears over the systemic risks posed by the huge over-the-counter credit derivatives market – fears heightened weeks earlier by the failure of Bear Stearns, which had been a huge player in the field.The Clearing Corporation, jointly owned by 11 leading banks including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and some other trading platform providers, became the focal point for the first efforts to create some form of clearing house in the market.A clearing house provides the certainty that if a big player fails, everyone will know immediately what their exposure to that party is and there will be a central deposit of collateral that should cover money owed on outstanding contracts. For individual banks, a clearing house gives them one main counterparty, rather than the hundreds of different counterparties they have in an OTC market.The credit derivatives industry has grown and evolved as a purely bilateral market, without any central clearing mechanism and has fiercely resisted suggestions that banks should move their private or OTC trading activity on to regulated exchanges.But if the dealers were hoping to stitch up the issue neatly, they would have soon been disappointed as other groups rushed to get in on the act.The New York Federal Reserve is leading the push for a US solution and four groups have now come up with offerings: CME Group and Citadel, the Chicago-based hedge fund; Eurex Clearing; NYSE Euronext/Liffe/LCH.Clearnet; and The Clearing Corporation, which the banks sold a stake in to IntercontinentalExchange late last year.The pressure to get something up and running only increased following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which the CDS market nonetheless dealt with in an orderly fashion after having been told to prepare for such an event in the wake of Bear Stearns.However, the last time the NY Fed met the hopefuls, their proposals were far from satisfactory and work is still ongoing to settle many tricky issues such as who will be able to join, what the costs of use will be and what kinds of contracts will be included.The simplest, most liquid contracts based on popular indices of corporate debt exposures, such as the iTraxx in Europe or the CDX in the US, are the likely main and early candidates for clearing.But even with these, there is a big issue over how far dealers will be prepared to go in standardising contracts. Every move towards standardisation removes some potential profitability and makes it easier to trade the contracts on exchanges.Some senior derivatives professionals insist that banks do not care about standardisation – or even whether contracts do eventually move on to exchanges.“We are happy to trade equities and futures contracts, we do good business there and make money – so where’s the issue?” says one.As the trading arms of investment banks this year increasingly look to safe, high-volume business conducted on behalf of clients rather than taking big positions themselves, such an attitude might become much more broadly discernible.There remains great uncertainty over which or how many of the four US proposals will get off the ground, but the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US clearer and settlement system, this month said it would support all those proposed solutions. The DTCC is central to the effort since its “trade information warehouse” is the central registry for confirmed CDS trades.Within the industry, the idea was always that the US solution would be the de facto global solution. However, the European Commission threw a spanner in the works late last year when it called for Europe to have its own clearing house for the CDS markets.Officials are concerned that European regulators might be unable to touch a US clearing house that ran into difficulties, given that the clearing house would be subject to US jurisdiction.Brussels demanded a tight deadline of the end of December for concrete proposals and in order that a clear timetable could be drawn up to fit in with European political deadlines.However, the efforts failed to achieve a commitment from a sufficient number of dealers to get a European clearing solution off the ground by June – and the effort has hit a roadblock."
965;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-02-01T07:40:13Z;Post-trade services come into their own;;"In the traumatic weeks surrounding the collapse of Lehman Brothers, news headlines were dominated by the failure of one of the world’s best known investment banks and the collateral damage inflicted on the global financial sector as the default rippled through the system.Yet missing from the narrative was the work of a group of players in the financial services industry who make it their business to deal with the possibility of such events – albeit not, up to that point, on such a scale. Clearing houses and settlement systems set to work to establish who owed what to whom, and how positions could be safely unwound to avoid the damage spreading.These post-trade services businesses have for years functioned below the radar. A description of what they do makes for dry reading: a clearing house acts as buyer for every seller and seller for every buyer in a transaction, helping to virtually eliminate counterparty risk – that is, the risk that a party to a transaction ends up defaulting. Settlement is the process by which a security in a transaction is exchanged for cash, irrevocably.Even the European Commission, on its website, recognises the unglamorous nature of the business, saying: “[Financial markets] infrastructure has often been compared to the plumbing in the building . . . vital but unglamorous and forgotten until something goes wrong”.When something did go wrong – badly wrong – in September last year, the business of clearing and settlement quietly worked through billions of dollars worth of exposures between Lehman and its various counterparties.Don Donahue, chairman and chief executive of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US clearer and settlement group, summed up the result in the deadpan way that is typical of many in the sector, saying: “The industry’s infrastructure did not buckle in the face of the storm. There were no headlines in the press about settlement failures. There were no bulletins about system collapses in the face of torrential volumes . . . no reports about risk management breakdowns or under-collateralised clearing obligations.”Notably, neither DTCC nor LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearer that is Europe’s largest independent clearing house, needed to draw on any of the default funds that typically sit with a clearing house as the ultimate resort in case of catastrophic default.The way the post-trade business worked through the Lehman crisis reinforced to regulators what they had started to realise: clearing and settlement infrastructures would be crucial to avoiding the next big financial blow-up and containing systemic risk.In August, a group of financial experts led by former New York Federal Reserve bank chairman Gerald Corrigan produced a report for the US Treasury and the Financial Stability Forum recommending reforms to the financial system in response to the credit crisis. Among the recommendations by The Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group were strengthening safeguards around the bilaterally-negotiated, uncleared, over-the-counter derivatives markets that would see OTC credit default swaps moved into a centralised, counterparty clearing arrangement (CCP) – or clearing house.Roger Liddell, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet, says: “People have become alerted to the dangers of the bilateral risks they face.”Exchanges, sensing a new business opportunity, have seized apon the new regulatory focus on ensuring transparency and market certainty through a more widespread use of CCPs.Four groups are busy preparing clearing solutions for the OTC credit markets: CME Group and Citadel, a Chicago hedge fund; NYSE Euronext in conjunction with LCH.Clearnet; IntercontinentalExchange, the futures exchange, with The Clearing Corporation; and Eurex Clearing, the clearing arm of Deutsche Börse.John Trundle, head of risk at Euroclear, says the trend, even in markets beyond OTC products, is clear. “I think where there are very large markets that have not been organised through well organised central reliable infrastructures there will be strong pressure to get those markets organised in a standardised way.“There will be emphasis on commoditisation of transactions and on harmonisation of the rules and doing everything in a predictable, standardised, robust way. ‘Boring’ is the new exciting at the moment,” he says.Clearing initiatives have proliferated in recent months. Nasdaq OMX, the US-based exchange group, has announced plans to set up a US equities clearing operation that would compete with DTCC; invested in a new OTC derivatives clearing business for interest rate swaps; and recently acquired Nord Pool Clearing, a Norwegian commodity andpower clearer that will soon clear for the UK’s first electricity exchange.Eurex will in the second quarter launch a CCP service for securities lending, in conjunction with Clearstream, Deutsche Börse’s settlement arm.The same trend is evident in the energy markets. Sara Stahl, business development manager at the European Energy Exchange, says: “In the carbon market, credit is certainly an issue as many counterparties are new to each other and as such are trying to minimise counterparty risk.”LCH.Clearnet and DTCC are busy expanding their business, with the London clearer set in the second quarter to launch Synapse, the world’s first multi-asset derivatives clearing platform, and the only one capable of supporting all exchange traded and most OTC contracts.At the same time, there is an increased focus on risk management at broker-dealers and custodians. Lee Waite, global head of Citi’s global custody and clearing intermediaries business, says: “People are very on top of their game, monitoring their systems and making sure they are right up to snuff and if they are not there is a very quick escalation in the urgency of dealing with the issue.”Yet the push by exchanges into clearing has met with some suspicion by dealers at the banks, and at inter-dealer brokers that have long specialised in tailor-made OTC contracts which, they contend, do not lend themselves to clearing. That is likely to lead to an intense debate.The inter-dealer brokers are also concerned that the exchanges’ ultimate ambition is to migrate as many OTC contracts on-exchange for trading as well. The Wholesale Markets Brokers’ Association, which represents the interests of the inter-dealer brokers such as Icap, Tullett-Prebon, GFI and BGC, says that while its industry has to accept that more clearing is “inevitable”, more tailored products will not be cleared through exchanges.The focus on clearing and settlement comes as reforms have been underway in Europe to harmonise cross-border settlement and spur competition between clearers, and increase the opportunities for market participants to choose where their trades are cleared.Such initiatives, being led by Brussels and the European Central Bank, are taking place as part of an effort to reduce post-trade costs in the region, levelling the playing field with the US, where post-trade services are far less fragmented. In Europe, for example, there are still 17 nationally based Central Securities Depositories handling settlement, while in the US this is handled by the DTCC.Hugh Cumberland, strategic business development manager at BT Global Services, says: “The world has changed, and one would imagine regulators need to look at things through fresh spectacles.“The priorities would seem to be better global regulation and more centralisation of clearing functions along business lines.”"
966;CME;CME Group Inc;2009-01-06T04:14:21Z;Seasonal slump hits futures exchanges;;Trading volumes at two of the world’s largest financial futures exchanges took a hit at the end of last year as a seasonal slowdown and the economic crisis caused a pullback in activity, highlighting the end of multiple years of record-breaking runs.Figures released on Monday, showed that December volumes at US-based CME Group fell by 22 per cent, while they were marginally lower at rival Eurex, the futures arm of Deutsche Borse.Among the worst-hit contracts at CME were interest rate contracts, which fell by 49 per cent.Shares in Intercontinental-Exchange (ICE), a CME rival, fell by more than 7 per cent after the exchange reported a 4.6 per cent fall in commissions from its over-the-counter energy products for the month.However, energy and commodity futures helped ICE to a 36 per cent rise in overall December volumes, boosted by a 21 per cent rise in volume at ICE Europe, its London based energy futures exchange.Commodities also helped December trading volumes at the London Metal Exchange, which reported a 28 per cent rise in the number of contracts traded.Aluminium futures, the LME’s largest contract, saw a 20 per cent rise in volume, while copper futures were up by 24 per cent year-on-year.Investors are watching to see how deep the impact of the financial crisis will be on exchanges.Derivatives exchanges started to see volumes fall in November amid deleveraging by hedge funds, among the largest users of on-exchange derivatives.Stock exchanges are suffering worse. Deutsche Börse, reporting figures for all seven of Germany’s stock exchanges, said the value of trades done had fallen by 27 per cent in December.On Xetra, Deutsche Börse’s own electronic trading platform, the number of trades done rose sharply by 29 in December compared with the previous year as algorithmic trading continued to reduce the size of trades. But value traded fell by 34 per cent.In spite of the gloomy figures at CME and Eurex, there were signs that futures exchanges managed to earn more per contract traded – the so-called rate per contract – offering a glimmer of hope that falling volumes may not damage their businesses as much as feared.Howard Chen, analyst at Credit Suisse, said: “Revenue capture trends improved more than we had expected [on CME] and should offer some offset to lower activity levels.”ICE said that the rolling three month average rate per contract on two of its product lines – energy and agricultural futures – was up, while the rate was down in ICE’s US financial futures contracts – primarily the Russell Index.Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said: “Amid a year of recession and global market downturns, ICE accomplished its aggressive strategic objectives.”Separately on Monday, the exchange said it would launch clearing in London of over-the-counter agricultural swaps on its ICE Clear clearing house on January 30. Rival Liffe, the futures arm of NYSE Euronext, has said it plans to start clearing OTC coffee, sugar and cocoa contracts in the first quarter. Both CME and ICE are competing to offer clearing of OTC credit default swaps contracts in the US.………………………………………….Expansion firstDeutsche Börse was on Monday night poised to acquire Neonet, one of Scandinavia’s largest brokers, in what is believed to be the first move by an exchange in Europe to expand into the broking business.The move highlights how the lines between exchanges, brokers and alterative trading platforms is being blurred by the competitive forces unleashed by Mifid, the Brussels directive enacted a year ago.Mifid has prompted fragmentation of liquidity across Europe, with shares in the same company available on multiple platforms.Exchanges and alternative platforms are battling to keep and grow a share of that liquidity and are finding increasingly creative ways of linking to different liquidity pools.By acquiring Neonet, Deutsche Börse would be able to on-route orders that can not be filled on its Xetra platform to others across Europe.Last month Neonet, based in Sweden, started offering its clients access to NYSE Euronext’s planned new alternative trading platform, known as NYSE Arca Europe, which will compete with incumbent alternative platforms such as ChiX, Turquoise and BATS Europe.
967;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-12-24T00:36:36Z;Citadel and CME win CDS clearing consent;;The CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, and Citadel, the hedge fund, were Tuesday given the green light by Washington regulators to launch a clearing house for credit default swaps.The CME’s clearing solution was given the go-ahead by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while the exchange said it had had “extensive discussions” with the Securities and Exchange Commission and was “well along in the SEC review process”.The approval comes ahead of that for a rival US plan by a consortium of some of Wall Street’s biggest names and the InterContinental Exchange, the Atlanta-based electronic exchange.Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have been pushing for a central clearing counterparty to be established for credit default swaps, which offer insurance against the default of banks, companies and government debt.The near-collapse of Bear Stearns in March and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September highlighted the counterparty risks associated with these types of derivatives. Regulators remain concerned about the effects that further counterparty failures could have on the financial system – but centralised clearing would reduce those risks.Liffe, the futures exchange, and LCH.Clearnet, the London clearer, was this week the first team to offer clearing. Another European group, Eurex, the derivatives unit of Deutsche Börse, is also planning to offer clearing.Many observers expect that the CME and Citadel may struggle to build volumes as fast as its main rival, since the ICE proposal is backed by the main CDS dealers. However, the CME has been actively courting both buy- and sell-side institutions, offering equity to founding members of its CDS clearing operation.The rival consortium says its proposal is different from that of the CME, which plans to clear CDS contracts using its existing clearing house. Instead, ICE has established a separate New York state-regulated bank, which will serve as its clearing facility.The CME and Citadel could launch the CDS clearing operation soon. “There’s nothing more we need to do for them to start it up,” the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, said.Additional reporting by Aline van Duyn in New York
968;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-12-21T17:40:08Z;First group emerges to offer CDS clearing;;"Liffe, the futures exchange, and LCH.Clearnet, the London clearer, will on Monday become the first group to offer clearing of credit default swaps, financial instruments that are central to regulatory worries over the risks posed by defaults in the credit derivatives markets.The development comes as efforts by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to get such bilaterally negotiated, or over-the-counter (OTC), contracts shifted on to centrally cleared platforms are coming to a head.Regulators want the CDS market to be centrally cleared because they fear that without such safeguards any future defaults could wreak the same kind of havoc on the financial system as September’s default by Lehman Brothers, which affected about $400bn (£267bn) in credit default swaps linked to the failed bank.The European Commission last week received commitments from dealers and exchanges to shift CDSs, which are currently not cleared, into a cleared environment by early next year.US authorities, led by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, have for months been pushing for a centrally cleared mechanism for CDSs.Four groups are working on such systems: CME Group, the Chicago derivatives exchange, with hedge fund Citadel; IntercontinentalExchange, another US futures exchange, with The Clearing Corporation and dealer banks; NYSE Euronext; and Eurex, the derivatives unit of Deutsche Börse.Although some over-the-counter derivatives have been centrally cleared for some time – such as US Treasury bonds, European interest rate swaps and carbon emissions – regulators want CDSs cleared to reduce counterparty risk – that is, the risk that parties to a trade default.A clearing house acts as the buyer for every seller and as seller for every buyer in a transaction, helping to virtually eliminate counterparty risk.Liffe, owned by exchange group NYSE Euronext, will launch clearing for three CDS index contracts through Bclear, its trade registration service, prior to sending to LCH.Clearnet for clearing. They will be Markit iTraxx Europe, Market iTraxx Crossover and Markit iTraxx Hi-Vol.Ade Cordell, head of wholesale services at Liffe, said the exchange expected a slow start so close to Christmas and that the timing was to allow participants to test the system before any meaningful volumes were achieved.“We are expecting volumes really to come through in the second and third week of January once a critical mass of market participants has done that work,” he said.Dealers in the CDS market have warned against there being too many clearing solutions, partly because of the cost of posting margin collateral at multiple clearing houses. Some are also uneasy about splitting the market into two pools of liquidity in dollars and euros.However, last week the governing council of the European Central Bank re­iterated its belief that there was a need for “at least one” European clearing solution, and that “given the potential systemic importance of securities clearing and settlement systems, this infrastructure should be located within the euro area”.Eurex aims to start offering CDS clearing in March. It is in talks with unnamed entities about setting up a joint venture that would control a separate clearer for CDSs, distinct from Eurex Clearing, its existing clearing operation for exchange-traded derivatives."
969;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-12-07T19:48:55Z;Talks highlight frailty of global exchanges;;It was a brief – but revealing – encounter. The mere fact that German exchange group Deutsche Börse held talks with one of its biggest rivals, NYSE Euronext, speaks volumes about the increasingly fragile state of the global exchange business.Trading volumes in equities have taken a battering as the bear market has tightened its grip. Derivatives, which usually thrive on volatility, had been holding up well. But in the past month there have been signs that this is no longer the case.For exchanges such as Deutsche Börse that have relied on reasonably robust derivatives volumes to offset a deteriorating cash equities business, this is a worrying development.Herbie Skeete, managing director of Mondo Viseone, a UK-based exchanges consultancy, says: “Things are getting even worse than we thought for exchanges. Derivatives were meant to be a safe port, a natural hedge.”Trading volume at Eurex, Deutsche Börse’s derivatives unit, fell by 17.6 per cent last month, compared to the same period a year before. Volume in the key eurodollar interest rate futures contract at its US rival, CME Group, fell by 53 per cent last month.This week, volume on NYSE Euronext fell by 16 per cent on lower European cash equities and derivatives trading. And in US options, volume across all seven of the US options markets fell by 21 per cent last month.One reason is that markets are now so volatile that investors are wary of committing to the kinds of bets that can – if timed right – make the investor a lot of money.Options marketmakers say they have been forced to charge high premiums to customers amid such volatility, making options a more expensive proposition.Neither Deutsche Börse nor NYSE Euronext, which owns the Liffe futures business and the Arca options unit, have said what prompted the talks.But with the downturn further exposing exchanges’ high overhead costs relative to smaller, technology-focused rivals the possibility of sharing infrastructure and cutting costs must have been high on the list. NYSE Euronext is already cutting 15 per cent of its European workforce.Deutsche Börse’s supervisory board meets Monday to discuss the group’s “cost programme” for next year, as well as to elect a new chairman.For investors, a deal between the two exchanges would still make sense, industry observers say.By combining Deutsche Börse’s Xetra cash equities business with the four continental European markets under the umbrella of Euronext, the two parties would have created a unified pool of liquidity in pan-European stocks that would have left the London Stock Exchange isolated in UK and Italian equities markets.In clearing, there was also a strong case to be made for pooling resources of the US and European exchange groups to build a transatlantic clearing mechanism for over-the-counter credit derivatives.With any deal likely to be structured as a takeover by the German group, given Deutsche Börse’s greater market capitalisation, US authorities might have taken a dim view of the NYSE, the jewel in the crown of American capital markets, being sold to European interests.
970;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Deutsche Börse pitches merger with NYSE Euronext;;Deutsche Börse has approached NYSE Euronext about a possible combination of the two exchange groups, people familiar with the development said on Saturday.However they cautioned that the move had not resulted in any formal talks at this stage and the concept was “tentative”. “They are certainly not locked in discussions,” one said.If any deal were eventually reached, it would create by far the largest operator of stock and derivatives trading at a time when there is renewed pressure on global exchange consolidation amid a worrying drop in trading volumes.Any deal would also create a powerhouse in transatlantic clearing at a time when US regulators are pressing for the creation of a central clearing mechanism for over-the-counter credit derivatives.In response to the report Deutsche Börse in a statement said: “We have nothing to announce and, as a general policy, do not comment on speculation. Deutsche Börse Group is constantly evaluating a multitude of options to enhance the value of the company. This includes frequent contacts with almost every major market participant.”NYSE Euronext declined to comment.The plan was first reported in an advance copy of an article to be published in Monday’s edition of Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine.It is the most far-reaching of a series of ideas that Deutsche Börse has been working on for about two months. They include co-operating with the US-based exchange group, rather than pursuing an outright combination of the businesses.Citing an “internal paper”, Der Speigel said the two groups would set up a holding company in the Netherlands, which would make a takeover offer to the German company’s shareholders. NYSE would then merge with a US unit of the holding company.However any combination of the two exchange groups could face formidable anti-trust and governance hurdles. NYSE Euronext is also tied up with the integration of Euronext, the European stock exchange business, and Liffe, with the US business of the former New York Stock Exchange group.Frankfurt-based Deutsche Börse’s board is due to meet on Monday to elect a new chairman, widely expected to be former DaimlerChrysler finance chief Manfred Gentz.Trading volume at Eurex, the Böse’s derivatives unit, fell by 17.6 per cent last month, compared to the same period a year before. Volume in the key eurodollar interest rate futures contract at its US rival, CME Group, fell by 53 per cent last month. This week, volume on NYSE Euronext fell by 16 per cent on lower European cash equities and derivatives trading.Diego Perfumo of Equity Research Desk, a trading and exchanges consultancy in New York, said: “There are increasing concerns among investors on further volume declines.”European authorities have said they want a European clearer for OTC credit derivatives in addition to any US solution that emerges. Both NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse - through its Eurex Clearing unit - are working on separate US and European clearing houses. A congressional hearing takes place into the issue in Washington on Monday.A combination of the Börse and NYSE Euronext would pave the way for the creation of a seamless clearing mechanism on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr Perfumo said any deal “would position the combined entity as the likely winner of the OTC market as regulators force it onto exchange”.If Deutsche Börse were to pursue a deal with NYSE Euronext, it would also gain a foothold in the US futures business, currently dominated by CME Group in Chicago. NYSE Euronext’s Liffe futures arm, based in London, recently launched a futures operation in the US.
971;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;US call for credit trades harmony;;"Regulators and clearing providers on both sides of the Atlantic should work together to build a central clearing mechanism for over-the-counter (OTC) credit derivatives markets, a leading US congressman said on Tuesday.Collin Peterson, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives’ agriculture committee, also indicated the frustration felt in Congress over Wall Street’s role in the financial crisis, saying he “wouldn’t trust [Wall Street financiers] as far as I could throw them”.Regulators in the US and Europe hope to establish at least one clearing house that would act as a counterparty in the opaque credit default swaps market, in which investors make bets on the likelihood that institutions will default on their debt.Derivatives exchanges already act as counterparties for trades carried out through them, taking on market participants’ trading and settlement risks. But there are no such safeguards for OTC trades, which are negotiated bilaterally between two parties.Four groups are vying to set up a central counterparty for credit default swaps in the US, which would help reduce the risk of default in some such contracts. They are the Clearing Corporation, which is being taken over by Intercontinental Exchange, the futures exchange; the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, together with the hedge fund Citadel; Liffe, NYSE Euronext’s derivatives arm; and Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse.The issue has become complicated amid disagreements over which US regulator should oversee any eventual clearing solution: the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve or the Commodity Future Trading Commission – the futures watchdog over which Mr Peterson’s committee has congressional jurisdiction.There are also questions over how many clearing houses would be feasible, while the European Commission and European Central Bank want at least one European clearing house, no matter how many are established in the US.Mr Peterson was on a fact-finding mission in Brussels and London on Tuesday, seeing officials at the Commission and Britain’s Financial Services Authority, before travelling to Frankfurt for meetings with the ECB. “Everybody seems to be very focused on co-ordinating what we do here,” he said.It was important for regulators to co-ordinate to avoid participants in the OTC credit derivatives markets using “regulatory arbitrage” to shift OTC business to jurisdictions that were perceived as having weaker regulations, he said. His committee plans a third hearing on the issue next Monday."
972;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-11-18T21:14:21Z;Central CDS clearing houses poised for approval;;"US regulators are moving to approve centralised clearing houses for credit derivatives in a matter of weeks as the debate about the oversight of the vast unregulated sector gathers pace.Groups competing to set up a central counterparty for credit default swaps, the most popular type of credit ­derivatives, are awaiting approval from the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which are currently conducting detailed risk reviews of candidates on site.“Regulators expect to proceed toward regulatory approvals and/or exemptions expeditiously and anticipate that one or more CDS central counterparties will commence operations before the end of 2008,” the regulators said last week.In an effort to show a united front the three agencies signed a memorandum of understanding to share information on this issue. This agreement is likely to be discussed at the latest US congressional hearing into the sector on Wednesday.“The decision by US ­regulators to work together makes the process easier and eliminates regulatory ­arbitrage,” said Athanassios Diplas, managing director at Deutsche Bank.The collapse of Lehman Brothers, a counterparty to many credit derivative trades, has made reducing counterparty risks a top priority among regulators.“As it is now, it is often impossible even to know who stands on the other side of a swap contract, and this increases the risk involved,” said Christopher Cox, SEC chairman, in a speech.However, there remain a number of concerns among dealers and users of over-the-counter derivatives. For instance, creating a robust legal framework that will allow the inclusion of CDS buyers such as hedge funds as counterparties is complex because they operate in different jurisdictions.Regulators are aware of the concerns and are committed to finding a way to include them; however, the details are still unclear.There are also questions about how officials in the US – where efforts to create a CDS clearing system are more advanced – and in Europe may differ in their approaches.Four groups are trying to set up a central counterparty in the US: the Clearing Corporation which is being taken over by IntercontinentalExchange; the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange; Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext; and Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse.European regulators have thrown their support behind “at least one European solution” for the creation of a central CDS clearing house, with authorities uneasy with the prospect of a solely US clearing solution.Officials are meeting to discuss the issues in Brussels on Wednesday.But even among US regulators, there are rifts forming on how and who is best to oversee aspects of the credit derivatives market.Bart Chilton, a CFTC commissioner, objected to the recent memorandum of understanding. “I am concerned that…we are sending the message that other regulatory bodies have the same or similar ­levels of expertise in this area. That is simply not the case.”"
973;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-11-03T20:33:22Z;ECB supports central clearance for CDS;;"The European Central Bank and eurozone central banks on Monday threw their support behind “at least one European solution” for the creation of a central clearing house for over-the-counter credit default swaps.The statement came after the ECB held a meeting with exchanges and clearers, including Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse and LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearer.“Participants at the meeting underlined the merits of multiple solutions in general and of at least one European solution. The Eurosystem stands ready, in co-operation with the other authorities, to facilitate the effective collective action of the private sector in this regard,” an ECB statement said.Efforts to come up with a solution for providing a clearing system for the CDS market are more advanced in the US. They involve four groups: the Intercontinental Exchange, the US-based electronic futures exchange; the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange; Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext; and Eurex.On Friday, US regulators said they were “hopeful” that at least one of the groups vying to provide centralised clearing for the credit derivatives market will begin operations before the end of the year.European regulators and policymakers have recently grown concerned that there should also be centralised clearing in Europe so that the market is not left with one solution in the US.That is because they are not convinced that European regulators would have the ability to intervene in a situation where a US clearing house ran into difficulties, given that the clearing house would be subject to US jurisdiction.The ECB said its meeting “complemented initiatives” by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and European Commission.Thomas Book, member of Eurex’s executive board responsible for clearing, said: “We welcome the expressed need for at least one European solution because of the importance of European credit derivatives markets.”"
974;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-10-31T18:25:50Z;Regulators ‘hopeful’ on derivatives clearing plan;;"US regulators are “hopeful” that at least one of the groups vying to provide centralised clearing for the thus-far unregulated credit derivatives market will begin operations before the end of the year.The comments from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York came as dealers and users of over-the-counter derivatives, which include credit derivatives, said they would further strengthen the market’s operational infrastructure.In a letter to Tim Geithner, president of the Fed, 16 banks and several industry bodies said turbulent market conditions “brought into even sharper focus the systemic risk concerns the industry faces”.The Fed, which has been working closely with other US financial regulators including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, emphasised in response that a central counterparty for credit default swaps, the most common type of credit derivatives, was top of its list of priorities.“We are hopeful that one or more central counterparties can begin operations in November or December 2008, enabling market participants to rapidly move trades on to a central counterparty,” the letter said.The collapse of Lehman Brothers, a counterparty to many credit derivative trades, and continued concerns of further bank failures have gummed up the workings of the credit markets.Reducing such “counterparty risks” through the introduction of a central counterparty is considered to be an important step to reducing the systemic risks to the global financial markets.Four groups are vying to set up a central counterparty: the IntercontinentalExchange, the US-based electronic futures exchange; the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange; Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext; and Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Borse.Other concerns for the over-the-counter derivatives markets centre on whether trades are recorded and settled quickly enough. The market has grown so fast in the last decade that its supporting infrastructure failed to keep pace.The Fed and other regulators have been pressing dealers to tackle these issues for several years but it is only in recent months that much progress has been made.There has been little transparency on credit derivative volumes. Starting next week, however, the DTCC – which records all derivative trades – will make public the weekly total value of trades on the 1,000 most-used credit derivatives, the Fed said.In recent months, dealers have made significant progress in reducing the notional value of outstanding credit derivatives. Efforts to “tear up” offsetting contracts have gathered pace, and about $25,000bn have been eliminated."
975;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-10-30T15:51:46Z;ICE in takeover of Clearing Corporation;;IntercontinentalExchange, the electronic futures exchange based in Atlanta, raised the stakes on Thursday in its effort to expand its foothold in the $54,000bn credit-default swap market by announcing a deal to take over The Clearing Corporation (TCC), the bank-operated clearing house.The move is the latest salvo in an emerging struggle between ICE and the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, to develop central counterparty clearing infrastructure for the CDS market.US regulators are keen to see a clearing house established for the opaque over-the-counter contracts as soon as possible, since the absence of a central counterparty – which would guarantee pay-outs should a trading party be unable to do so – has exposed the risk of massive market disruption.Last month CME struck a deal with Citadel, the hedge fund, to form an electronic marketplace with central counterparty clearing for CDSs.ICE first signalled its intention to move into CDSs in June, when it paid $625m for Creditex, an inter-dealer credit derivatives broker. This month, the company agreed with TCC to create a “global clearing solution” for CDSs, although there has been a question mark over the proposal, since its principal backers are the very financial institutions most affected by the financial crisis.ICE’s takeover demonstrates both the seriousness of its plan and the extent to which Jeff Sprecher, chief executive, wants to work closely with the Federal Reserve to develop his solution. The company will form a limited-purpose bank, ICE US Trust, which will be a member of the Fed system and will serve as its OTC derivatives clearing house.Mr Sprecher said building a separate clearing entity was an important difference between his proposal and that of CME, which is planning to clear CDSs through its existing futures clearing house.“We concluded that the [CDS] contract design and the risk profile differed too significantly from that of futures,” said Mr Sprecher. “The existing collateral and liquidation provisions of futures-style clearing would not be sufficient, nor would combining CDS with futures positions be prudent in terms of adding systemic risk.”Mr Sprecher said he had signed memorandums of understanding with nine of the biggest traders in the CDS market – Bank of America, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Merril Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS – to clear their global CDSs.
976;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-10-29T21:06:02Z;Financial crisis takes toll on CME;;The CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, said on Wednesday that profits in the third quarter were up slightly from the same period last year as growth in the derivatives trade was hit by deleveraging from financial institutions damaged by the financial crisis.Excluding extraordinary items, CME’s net income was $278m or $4.13 per share, up 3 per cent from $269m or $4 per share a year ago, on revenues of $787m, up 6 per cent from last year’s figure of $744m.The company has enjoyed extraordinary growth in recent years, fuelled by a string of high-profile acquisitions such as that of the Chicago Board of Trade last year and Nymex this year. Without the cost-cutting that has followed such purchases, CME would be struggling to make a profit: most of the profit for the third quarter was accounted for by a $7m decrease in expenses.CME – which controls 98 per cent of listed futures in the US – has suffered from a pullback in derivatives trading by the big Wall Street houses. Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday that as a result of economic turbulence, financial exchanges should brace themselves for a continuing fall in trading volumes next year.“We believe [the] post-crisis landscape will exert significant pressure on growth and forecast a decline in most key products in 2009, the broadest decline since 1988,” said Patrick Pinschmidt, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “CME enjoys dominant market shares across its core products, but we worry this will be insufficient to overcome weaker volume trends.”CME’s share price has fallen from $686 at the start of the year to $265 by the close of trading in New York on Wednesday. The company released the results after the market had closed.As it seeks new revenue streams, CME is attempting to position itself to benefit from the turmoil, in particular, regulators’ wish to reduce risk in the over-the-counter credit derivatives market.Last month CME announced a deal with Citadel, the hedge fund, to form an electronic marketplace with central counterparty clearing for credit-default swaps. US regulators are keen to see a clearing house established for the OTC contracts as soon as possible, and the exchange has long wanted to establish itself in the $54,000bn CDS market.“As customers in the over-the-counter derivative markets move increasingly toward more regulated, transparent and centrally cleared markets, CME Group is extremely well positioned to benefit,” said Craig Donohue, chief executive.
977;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-10-19T22:58:45Z;European OTC solution sought;;"When Charlie McCreevy, European Union internal markets commissioner, spoke of “nasty surprises when things go wrong” in the credit derivatives markets, it was not merely a sign of increasing concern over the role that these financial instruments could play in a systemic shock.It also revealed that Europe had realised it risked being left behind in how the vast over-the-counter markets were to be reshaped and regulated. In recent weeks, US banking regulators have been pushing aggressively for the creation of a safety valve, in the form of a clearing mechanism, for OTC credit default swaps – financial instruments at the epicentre of the financial crisis that offer a form of insurance when corporate defaults happen.Authorities and market participants in Europe, especially in the City of London, are growing uneasy with the prospect of a solely US clearing solution emerging, when London – not New York – is where most activity in the CDS and interest rate swaps markets takes place.Mr McCreevy called on the main players concerned to produce “concrete proposals” by the end of the year on “how the risks from credit derivatives can be mitigated”.He said there was a “pressing need” for a central clearing counterparty (CCP) in such markets. The message appeared to be: we think we need a European solution as well.Tony Freeman, director of European industry relations at Omgeo, a company specialising in the automation and confirmation of trades, says: “I think what’s happening here is clearly transatlantic competition. The argument about the need for a CCP is now over and who gets the job and who runs it is the question that’s being discussed.”In the US, two groups are vying to set up a CCP for credit default swaps: CME Group, the futures exchange, and Citadel, a Chicago-based hedge fund; and a second group made up of The Clearing Corporation – a consortium of investment banks and interdealer brokers – the Intercontinental Exchange, a futures exchange and OTC trading platform, Creditex, a credit derivatives broker and post-trade processor, and market data provider Markit Group.The New York Federal Reserve held meetings last week with the protagonists and wanted a solution in place as soon as possible.In Europe, two exchanges are working on a CCP for credit default swaps. Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext, is collaborating with LCH.Clearnet, its clearer, on the launch of a service called Bclear in the fourth quarter.Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, was in New York earlier this month explaining to the Federal Reserve Bank its plans for a credit derivatives clearing solution. Brussels is concerned that the risk associated with OTC credit derivatives is not concentrated in one clearing house based in the US. If there are to be more than one CCP for credit derivatives, the feeling is that a second one should be based in Europe.Roger Liddell, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet, says the clearer would be interested in offering credit derivatives clearing for Europe, but also for the US. He argues that the industry would be better served having one global clearer for CDS.But he concedes there is “some slight logic” to having regionally based operations, because “the underlying basket of CDS indices are a little different” in the US and Europe."
978;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Leo Melamed: Legend in his own futures is neither shy nor retiring;;Leo Melamed protests a little too much when asked about his early career as an actor in Yiddish-language theatre.“As an actor, I kind of stunk,” says the former chairman (and now chairman emeritus) of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. “I was too much of an amateur to consider myself really worthwhile.”In fact, the 76-year-old is a talented performer, one who plays the role of Leo Melamed – founding father of financial futures, spiritual leader of the CME Group and oracle of the derivatives world – so faultlessly, that it is impossible to sift myth from reality.Other futures traders used to tell Mr Melamed that he was a legend in his own mind, but he has always been attentive to the need to cultivate his status more widely. “I used to joke that I had to come on the floor every day to show the crowd that the legend really existed,” he wrote in Escape to the Futures, his autobiography.Certainly his arrival in the US and at the CME is the stuff of legend. Born Leibl Melamdovich in Bialystok, Poland, his Jewish family fled the Nazis to Lithuania, across Siberia to Vladivostok, on to Japan and finally to the US, outwitting both the Gestapo and the KGB on the way.Another legendary chapter came when he was at law school and a friend pointed him to an advertisement for jobs at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Beane. They both thought the investment house was a law firm.After working for two years as a messenger on the trading floor, when he turned 21 he borrowed the $3,000 CME membership fee from his father – whose total savings at the time were $5,000. For six years, he worked as a lawyer and a trader “running between court and the Merc and trying to juggle both”, before taking up trading full time.Becoming chairman of the exchange aged 37 was remarkable for someone who, on first arriving in the US, had struggled to be accepted, hampered by his small stature, lack of English and inability to play baseball.Without doubt, Mr Melamed’s achievements in the world of derivatives are considerable – and he is neither modest nor shy about them.In 1972, as CME chairman, he spearheaded the introduction of financial futures through the creation of the International Money Market, launching first currency futures and later contracts on US Treasuries, Eurodollars and stock indices.While there is a debate over who originally conceived of financial futures (the idea had already been tried, albeit on a smaller scale), there can be no doubt about their impact. “In all humility, I can say I changed the nature of futures markets,” he observes.At the time, there was much scepticism about Chicago’s ambitions, as there was in the early years of Globex, the CME’s electronic trading system that, alongside financial futures, is Mr Melamed’s proudest achievement.Intriguingly, he claims the idea sprung out of The Tenth Planet, a science-fiction novel he wrote in the mid-1980s, set in an advanced civilisation controlled by a central computer called PUTRAL.Mr Melamed says that one day, while he was writing the book, he was standing at his trading desk watching runners taking orders to the floor. “I thought: ‘If I could invent a computer that could run five planetary systems, couldn’t the world invent a mini PUTRAL that could run orders between the bids and execute them?’”He also claims credit for several other chapters in the CME’s history. In 1975, for example, he says he persuaded legendary Chicago Mayor, Richard J. Daley, to override the city’s building regulations to allow the architects of the CME’s headquarters to cantilever over the street.He says the 2007 purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade only became a practical goal after the idea came to him, one sleepless night when he was thinking about how the CME should respond to the NYSE’s acquisition of Euronext. And he claims to have paved the way for this year’s acquisition of Nymex, by persuading the CME board to allow the New York energy exchange to use the CME’s electronic trading platform.When it comes to the CME’s plans, Mr Melamed is more coy, but he is a strong believer in strengthening ties with Asian exchanges.“This century will be the Asian century. But China will never reach its potential until they take the handcuffs off the population and let them speak.”Still an active trader, Mr Melamed says retirement is out of the question. “There is never a bigger mystery than working out which way the Eurodollar, the S&P or bonds are going that day or next week or next year,” he says. “Those are huge challenges and they keep me very much alive.”
979;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-10-17T11:38:57Z;Over the counter: Exchanges have their eyes on the next opportunity;;There may be no end in sight to the financial crisis, but one consequence is already clear: over-the-counter markets will never be the same again.The crisis has brought complex structured financial products out of deep obscurity and exposed their weaknesses. In particular, credit derivatives – which allow investors to make bets on the creditworthiness of baskets of corporate debt – stand accused as an accomplice in the meltdown.Bad mortgage debt was at the heart of the credit crunch but, in the eyes of many observers, banks’ inability to quantify their exposure through credit default swaps (CDSs), the main kind of credit derivative, aggravated the crisis, while swings in the CDS market exacerbated the plunge in bank stocks.CDSs allow investors either to bet on the chance of a debt default or to protect themselves from that risk. One party pays an annual fee to another, in exchange for a promise that it will be compensated in a default.The CDS market has experienced explosive growth, expanding by 81 per cent last year to a value of $62,200bn. Although the sector has shrunk since then, it is so large that outstanding contracts are often 10 or more times larger than the underlying “cash” bonds.Credit derivatives contracts are predominantly negotiated “over the counter” – privately between traders in banks, rather than on a central exchange. Because it is private, the decade-old sector has been largely unsupervised.While CDSs have been hugely profitable for financial institutions, the lack of regulation and opacity have proved to be the market’s Achilles heel.“The real criticism of [the market] is twofold,” observe analysts at CreditSights, the research firm. “One, it is unregulated and that hides overall credit risk. Second, the CDS market has provided an incentive for credit risk to be taken without proper due diligence.”Christopher Cox, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, recently told the Senate Banking Committee the CDS market provides “significant opportunities” for manipulation.Meanwhile David Paterson, governor of the state of New York, unveiled plans to redefine some types of the product as insurance and put them under the control of insurance supervisors.The pressure has prompted attempts to clean up the sector: credit derivatives markets saw their first ever decline in the volume of outstanding contracts over the first half of this year, as the financial industry moved to tear up economically offsetting transactions.TriOptima, a specialist in the sector, oversaw more than $17,400bn worth of credit derivative terminations in the first half of 2008 in the inter-dealer market, while, overall, the notional outstanding volume of credit derivatives was $54,600bn at the end of June, down 12 per cent from the end of 2007.While such “compression” certainly helps rationalise the industry, it now seems inevitable that regulators will force a complete overhaul of the CDS market. In response, financial institutions have unleashed a flood of central clearing counterparty (CCP) initiatives.The absence of a central clearer has made CDSs risky because there is no guarantee that parties will pay out. As the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group, a taskforce of specialist bankers, has noted, a CCP would “create a shock absorber” that would reduce the impact of default by a big participant.In North America, CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, looks likely to be first off the mark.In early October, the Chicago-based company announced it was teaming up with Citadel, the hedge fund, to form an electronic marketplace and CCP for CDSs within 30 days.Days later, InterContinental Exchange (ICE), the electronic futures exchange based in Atlanta, struck a deal with The Clearing Corporation – a clearing house backed by big users of credit derivatives such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and JPMorgan – to create a “global clearing solution” for CDSs.In Europe, Liffe, a subsidiary of NYSE Euronext, plans to start a CCP by the end of the year, ahead of Eurex, the European derivatives exchange, which is aiming to launch by the middle of next year.Without banks’ support, CME’s solution may struggle to make inroads, as the CDS market in the US is dominated by a small number of large dealers. On the other hand, the crisis has put a strain on the dealers’ ability to fund a CCP.The US Federal Reserve is keen to speed up the various plans. As the Fed appears agnostic about which project to back, the CDS market seems set, at least at first, to resemble OTC energy markets, in which deals are done via telephone and can be cleared at Clearport, CME’s facility, or at the ICE’s clearing house.Fresh battlegrounds are also being marked out. Nasdaq OMX, for example, is investing $20m in International Derivatives Clearing Group, a venture that aims to be the first exchange to trade and clear OTC interest-rate swaps, a much larger than the CDSs.Exchanges, it seems, already have their eyes on the next OTC opportunity.
980;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-10-17T11:38:57Z;Time of crisis also gives opportunities;;This month, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange launched “Börsenspiel”, a competitive stock trading game aimed at attracting people who have never or only rarely traded stocks.Virtual seed money of €50,000 ($67,000) will be deposited into a fictitious securities account “for speculating and investing”. Participants will receive a special dictionary and be sent “supporting background articles” on investing to help them get up to speed with the art of stock market investing.In December, when the competition ends, prizes will be handed out, including a trading internship on the floor of the exchange.With stock markets experiencing their most stomach-churning weeks in living memory amid the unfolding global financial crisis, the timing of the Frankfurt exchange’s attempt to make trading fun may not have been ideal.According to the FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index, which tracks the performance of 17 of the world’s publicly listed exchanges, $16bn was wiped off the value of market capitalisation at those exchanges in September alone.Not only has the financial crisis brought to a screeching halt years of unbroken growth at many of the world’s stock and derivatives exchanges, it has cast a shadow over businesses that were once the darlings of the financial sector. Demutualisation and public listing of exchanges had helped drive record volumes on most exchanges since at least 2002, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange became the first US futures exchange to get a stock market listing.Herbie Skeete, managing director of Mondo Visione, which produces research on the 300-plus exchanges operating globally, says consolidation and increased deployment of sophisticated trading technology have helped exchanges perform more efficiently.But he predicts: “Volumes in most asset classes may decline in coming months as markets react to recent changes in financial markets. This, coupled with a slowdown in the number of IPOs [initial public offerings] suggests more downside for listed exchanges, at least in the short term.”At the World Federation of Exchanges’ annual meeting in Milan this month, Nasdaq OMX president Magnus Bocker said the outlook for the next year was “gloomy”, predicting a fall in equity trading volume into next year.Volatility has helped volumes, especially in the futures and options markets, which thrive on sudden changes in market expectations for the performance of underlying instruments or economic data.US options trading has remained relatively robust, for example. Credit Suisse estimates volumes in the first half of this month at the Chicago Board Options Exchange and International Securities Exchange were up 82 per cent and 43 per cent respectively. But the value of assets traded is falling as hedge funds, some of the biggest users of exchanges, cut back on trading as their prime brokers scale back lending to them in a process of “deleveraging”.Moreover, established stock exchanges in Europe have this year been forced to deal with the rise of alternative equities trading platforms in the wake of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or Mifid.Enacted 11 months ago by the European Commission, the rule has broken the exchanges’ monopolies on the trading of stocks in their host country and opened the door to competition for the first time in decades.Using ultra-high-speed trading systems and offering cheaper tariffs than the incumbents, the new platforms – such as Chi-X, Turquoise and Nasdaq OMX Europe, backed by the US-based exchange Nasdaq OMX, have started to make inroads.Tariff erosion is likely to continue, experts believe, as competition continues and users of exchanges focus on cost reduction and managing risk. Tabb Group, a consultancy, says: “There is no question that exchanges will lose market share to the [new platforms] and will need to fight hard to retain their commanding position, as their cost structures struggle with cumbersome legacy environments, lost revenue and pricing wars”.New issuance on exchanges has also slowed to a trickle, with IPO activity showing no sign of returning soon. While IPOs make up only a small part of an exchange’s revenues, new company listings are the lifeblood of a bourse’s secondary market.Consolidation has also slowed, although some acquisitions have still gone through: CME’s acquisition of the New York Mercantile Exchange, and NYSE Euronext’s purchase of a 25 per cent stake in the Doha Securities Market and of a 5 per cent stake in India’s Multi Commodity Exchange. The MCX is owned by Financial Technologies group, an ambitious Indian trading technology company that offers a glimpse of the way the exchange business could be reshaped in Asia.Yet as bad as the financial crisis is likely to be for exchanges, the mood is not all gloomy.Lee Hodgkinson, chief executive of SWX Europe, the London-based Swiss blue-chip stocks platform, says the new platforms might proceed more slowly amid a “dramatic paring back of customer IT budgets, resource allocation and changed priorities”.There are some signs that exchanges could be the beneficiaries of the fallout in other important ways.Some of the issues at the centre of the crisis, such as lack of transparency in the pricing of certain assets and poor counterparty risk management, highlight the importance – as the exchanges see it – of the kind of market infrastructure that the exchanges have long provided, such as transparent and reliable pricing, clearing and full regulation.Deirdre Somers, chief executive of the Irish Stock Exchange, says: “In recent months, despite extraordinary market conditions, regulated exchanges have, without fail, delivered …price formation, transparency and execution. More importantly, recent events have underscored how critical it is to have market operators who are highly vested in longterm market integrity and stability.“As economies, markets and investors respond to the changes ahead, it is time to re-assert the voice of the regulated exchange as a force for re-establishing much-needed stability and investor confidence.”Concerns over counterparty risk may also provide exchanges with opportunities. Regulators will be pushing for much of the over-the-counter trade in derivatives, foreign exchange and other asset classes to be cleared.
981;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;OCC picked by NYSE Liffe for futures clearing;;The Options Clearing Corporation, the world’s largest derivatives clearing house, took another step into the clearing of futures contracts when it was picked by NYSE Liffe, the futures arm of NYSE Euronext, as the clearer for the transatlantic exchange’s new US futures business.The move comes amid increasing focus by regulators on the need for central clearing mechanisms to protect traders in derivatives markets against the possibility of default.It also means that NYSE Liffe has put in place the most important building block for the growth of its planned venture since it started offering trading in US gold and silver futures contracts a month ago. The venture is the latest US futures exchange to compete against CME Group, which controls trading in 98 per cent of US futures contracts.The OCC’s business is based on clearing options contracts for all seven US options exchanges. But it has long wanted to expand beyond its small futures clearing operations, made up of clearing for OneChicago, a single stock futures exchange, a futures platform operated by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Philadelphia Board of Trade, part of Nasdaq OMX.NYSE Euronext took the first steps towards launching a futures business when it this year bought the right to trade gold and silver contracts and the outstanding trading volume associated with them from CME, which had acquired them through its purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade last year. The contracts had been part of the CBOT’s futures arm.NYSE Liffe plans to use the same metal futures contracts as the basis for the expansion of its futures business into other product categories. It is in talks with investment banks about possible equity investments by the banks in NYSE Liffe.CME is to clear NYSE Liffe’s contracts until March next year, when the OCC takes over.Thomas Callahan, NYSE Euronext head of US futures, said: “In these volatile times, it was essential for NYSE Liffe to find a strong, established clearing solution to offer unquestionable reliability for our members.”● BATS Trading, a US-based alternative equities trading platform, yesterday won approval from the UK’s Financial Services Authority to launch a facility for trading in FTSE 100 stocks, in competition with the London Stock Exchange. BATS is one of a handful of entrants to have emerged since rules were liberalised last year by the European Commission.
982;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;ICE joins banks for global clearing solution;;"Some of Wall Street’s biggest names sought to regain the initiative in the battle for control of the $54,000bn credit derivatives market on Friday by teaming up with InterContinental Exchange, the electronic futures exchange, to create a trading and central clearing counterparty (CCP) platform for credit default swaps.The Clearing Corporation – a Chicago-based clearing house backed by big users of credit derivatives, such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America – said it would join ICE to create a “global clearing solution” for CDSs.Others involved are Creditex and T Zero, subsidiaries of ICE that handle post-trade processing for CDSs, Markit Group, a provider of credit derivatives pricing systems and Risk Metrics, a risk management specialist. A subsidiary of ICE, ICE Trust, would function as a “global clearing house and central counterparty for CDS transactions”.The move comes in response to this week’s announcement by the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, and Citadel, the hedge fund, that they would join forces on a similar venture to begin operations within 30 days.It will raise questions about the CME’s ability to attract liquidity. “It will be challenging for any competing group [including the CME/Citadel venture] to gain significant traction in electronic trading or clearing of credit derivatives after today’s group of signed letters of intent,” wrote Niamh Alexander, analyst at Keefe Bruyette and Woods.The futures industry is marked by tension between the CME – which controls 98 per cent of listed derivatives in the US – and the big banks and dealers, which are loathe to cede more power to the exchange by allowing it to establish itself as a force in the CDS market.The banks have a natural partner in ICE, which last year launched a bidding war for the Chicago Board of Trade, which was eventually won by the CME.Since the CME purchased Nymex, the New York energy exchange, in August, it also competes with ICE in clearing over-the-counter energy contracts. ICE first signalled its intention to move into CDSs in June, when it paid $625m for
Creditex.The absence of a CCP, and thus of an entity that guarantees pay-outs in the event of any party’s inability to do so, has exposed the risk of massive market disruption.Banks and exchanges are under pressure from regulators to create a CCP for the opaque contracts as soon as possible. The New York Federal Reserve was due yesterday to hold a second meeting on the issue with the CME and Citadel, ICE and the TCC, and NYSE Euronext, as well as with dealers, buyside firms, US regulators and the European Central Bank.“The Federal Reserve does not endorse any of these specific proposals but is seeking to accelerate market adoption of central counterparty services,” the New York Fed said."
983;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-10-09T17:44:12Z;New attempt to set up swaps initiative;;"The New York Federal Reserve will on Friday hold its second meeting this week with three groups vying to set up a central clearing counterparty for the credit default swaps market in an attempt to breathe fresh life into the initiative.The first meeting ended without agreement on how to set up a central clearing counterparty (CCP) for the $54,000bn market. It was attended by CME and Citadel, a hedge fund; Intercontinental Exchange and The Clearing Corporation, a consortium of investment banks and broker-dealers and others.Efforts to get the project off the ground have been complicated by intense rivalry between CME/Citadel and TCC, whose bank shareholders are wary of exchange-led efforts to provide a solution because of exchanges’ historical focus on on-exchange derivatives.The CME is convinced an exchange-led effort is more likely to win favour from regulators since they have a strong record of managing counterparty risk in on-exchange derivatives through their clearing houses.The New York Fed is spearheading the regulatory drive to cut trading and settlement risks in OTC derivatives markets. Credit default swaps are used to protect or insure against the risk that a borrower will default on debt or to speculate on a borrower’s credit quality.Asked the purpose of the second meeting at the New York Fed, Andrew Williams, a spokesman, said: “It’s a continuation, mainly focused on accelerating getting a central counterparty up and running.”NYSE Euronext is also planning to enter the fray. Duncan Niederauer, chief executive, told the Financial Times on Thursday: ”In terms of the CDS market and looking at establishing a central platform we are very much at the table and involved in those discussions.””The CDS market is now such an important part of what goes on at the moment that I doubt it will go away. Exchanges can clearly deliver part of the solution and dealers cannot do it without exchanges.”Regulators are anxious to have a mechanism set up as soon as possible to reduce the risks of systemic failure in the opaque CDS market.On Wednesday, Christopher Cox, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, urged Congress to “act now” by providing oversight of the market."
984;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-10-07T21:56:55Z;CME-Citadel form CDS clearing facility;;The battle for control of the $54,000bn credit derivatives market intensified on Tuesday as CME Group and Citadel, the hedge fund, teamed up to form an electronic marketplace with central counterparty clearing for credit default swaps.The joint venture – poised to begin operations within 30 days – marks the first involvement by a large hedge fund in the race to provide a central clearing facility for CDSs.To attract customers, the Chicago-based companies are offering banks and hedge funds that become founding members of the new venture as much as 30 per cent equity in the new company.The decision is made as regulators press the industry to reduce structural risk in the CDS sector. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve was due to meet dealers, investors and exchange executives in New York to discuss the need for a central clearing house.The current CDS market faces a big test on Friday, when it attempts to unwind CDSs linked to Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy three weeks ago. Analysts estimate there could be $400bn of credit derivatives referenced to Lehman.“Events highlight the urgent need to reduce counterparty credit risks in the CDS market as well as the other over-the-counter markets,” said Craig Donohue, CME chief executive.The CME-Citadel venture pre-empts the expected launch by the year’s end of a similar project by The Clearing Corporation, a consortium of investment banks and broker-dealers, with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade service provider.“It is imperative to bring stability and transparency to the CDS market,” said Ken Griffin, Citadel chief executive. Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, said the joint venture would “reduce much of the systematic risk inherent in the current CDS market structure”.For Citadel, the decision reflects founder and chief executive Ken Griffin’s intention to turn the hedge fund into a diversified financial institution that will be a peer of Wall Street’s titans.As an already large user of CDSs, Citadel is likely to see in the CME project a way to make the trading of OTC products easier as central clearing drives the greater automation of the whole process.Chris Adams, global products head, alternative funds at BNP Paribas Securities Services, said: “It will give them confidence in the execution of their trading activities.”Like its European rival Eurex, the CME has long been keen to tap into OTC derivatives, which have for years dwarfed on-exchange derivatives, and have long been dominated by the investment banks.
985;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-10-06T23:20:36Z;Fed to hold CDS clearance talks;;Banks are hoarding cash in expectation of pay-outs on up to $400bn of defaulted credit derivatives linked to Lehman Brothers and other institutions, according to analysts and ­dealers.This added pressure on the frozen financial system comes as authorities prepare to meet participants in the so-far unregulated $54,000bn credit derivatives market to speed up plans for the creation of a central clearing house.The Federal Reserve will meet dealers, investors and exchange executives in New York on Tuesday. Although big dealers had committed to setting up a central counterparty by the end of the year, urgency has increased in light of the collapse of banks around the world and as company bankruptcies loom.“The New York Fed will hold a meeting Tuesday with a small number of banks and buyside firms to discuss the progress being made toward the creation of a central counterparty for credit default swaps,” said a Fed official, adding that this would “help reduce systemic risk associated with counterparty credit exposure and improve how the failure of a major participant would be addressed”.Credit default swaps, a form of insurance against bond defaults, are the most common type of credit derivative. On Monday, the default of up to $500bn in derivative contracts linked to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was settled, the biggest such exercise ever carried out.“We now clearly have the capacity to handle very large-scale settlements,” said Tom Price, managing director at Markit.The Fannie and Freddie CDS settled at between 91.5 and 99.9 cents on the dollar, reflecting the fact its underlying debt is not in default after the mortgage groups were seized by the US government. The seizure did trigger defaults on derivatives, however.The next test will be the unwinding of CDS linked to Lehman, which filed for bankruptcy three weeks ago. Michael Hampden-Turner, a credit strategist at Citi, estimates that there could be $400bn of credit derivatives referenced to Lehman.These contracts will be settled on Friday, and with the recovery value on Lehman bonds currently estimated at about 10 cents on the dollar, the pay-out by banks and other sellers of credit protection on Lehman could reach a gross $360bn.The Fed meeting is expected to include executives from exchanges such as the CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, which are vying with The Clearing Corporation, a consortium of investment banks and dealers that has vowed to establish a central counterparty clearing house by the end of the year.
986;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-09-29T14:41:30Z;Icap looks forward to derivative changes;;Icap, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, on Monday predicted it would achieve double-digit profit growth in its fiscal first half as the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the actions of governments and regulators to stabilise financial markets led to “significant activity” in over-the-counter (OTC) markets.Michael Spencer, chief executive, said the financial crisis would add to pressure from regulators and politicians to ensure that a central clearing system for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets would be developed.“You have to assume that the regulators and politicians will want to have an environment where the risk factors within the financial markets are reduced as much as reasonably possible. We have had 20-plus years of derivatives and OTC growth that have been enormously of economic benefit. Now we need the structures around the market to be strengthened,” he said as Icap released a trading update.Icap said no single customer accounted for more than 5 per cent group revenues, meaning that its exposure to the Lehman failure was restricted to unpaid brokerage fees and was “not material”.However the broker-dealer’s shares fell 19 per cent 306.5p by mid-afternoon in London.Icap acts as a broker in the markets beyond the currently troubled credit markets, including spot foreign exchange and voice broking of an array of off-exchange financial derivatives such as interest rate, commodities and freight derivatives.Efforts are already under way by some of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges – notably CME Group in Chicago – to come up with a mechanism for clearing OTC credit products. They are racing against a group of investment banks, under the umbrella of The Clearing Corporation (TCC), also Chicago-based, that want to offer the same thing.Industry experts are watching to see which model is likely to provide the most effective solution for OTC clearing. Regulators want some system in place as soon as possible to help reduce the counterparty risks when trades are negotiated privately, without a clearing house standing between parties to a trade to guarantee against either side defaulting.Mr Spencer said: “My own expectation is that the structure for OTC clearing will not automatically finish up in the hands of the exchange structures, partly because this one US exchange group [CME Group] dominates the landscape by such an extraordinary margin.” Icap is a shareholder in TCC.Mr Spencer said the OTC and trading market was “not about to disappear and will go through some structural change”.He said the last six months of market turmoil had presented Icap with “a very significant opportunity” to expand its current efforts to offer clearing services.“I think if anything it is going to be underscored by what has happened in the last six months,” Mr Spencer said.Addressing the fallout from multiple bank collapses and forced nationalisations in the US and UK, he said: “The regulators are, for sure, going to change the capital structure of investment banking, the regulatory environment is going to be altered. There will be a shift. I hope they spend some time doing this and don’t rush into it. And it clearly has to be a transatlantic issue. We don’t need an over-reaction, clearly, either.”Icap said that, during the past few weeks, the “extraordinary events in financial markets have again generated very high trading volumes in many markets as participants reassess their credit exposure and the flight to quality and liquidity resumes.“We believe that the current market turmoil will create more opportunities for the profitable development of our business despite parts of our customer base consolidating and continued deleveraging,” it said.
987;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Nasdaq OMX calls for client benefits;;Robert Greifeld, the chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, says the time has come for exchanges to start delivering the real benefits to their clients of the wave of consolidation that has swept the business.For its part Nasdaq OMX, the exchange operator, will on Monday introduce a new pricing scheme based on global transaction volume, together with new listing services designed to allow companies to list more easily on multiple Nasdaq OMX markets across the world.Mr Greifeld said the move marked an important step towards delivering the frequently talked-about benefits of consolidation to exchange users.The Nasdaq has played a big part in that consolidation, merging with OMX, the Nordic exchange operator earlier this year. It had previously tried unsuccessfully to buy the London Stock Exchange and the launch of a listings business in London will see it compete directly with the LSE.Mr Greifeld said: “We’ve witnessed a tremendous amount of exchange consolidation in the last several years, but exchanges still have not articulated or delivered to their customers the real value of those transactions.”The consolidation appears to be slowing now with many of the largest potential mergers now done and the largest exchanges such as NYSE Euronext, CME Group and Nasdaq OMX concentrating on integrating the various parts of their businesses rather than trying to pursue more growth through further acquisitions.One exchange analyst said: “Most of the exchanges have their hands full trying to deliver on the cost savings of their respective mergers and also adjusting in many cases to their new status as public companies.”Nasdaq OMX’s transaction pricing is designed to provide cost incentives for firms conducting trading across the exchange’s US and Nordic markets and Nasdaq OMX Europe, linking the markets in a new way.It is hoped that the tiered transaction pricing, due to come into effect later this month, will provide customers with a lower total cost of trading in Nasdaq OMX liquidity pools in the US, London, and the Nordic exchanges, based on aggregate volume.Mr Greifeld, said: “Global customers want to deal with global enterprises. While this has been the norm in most industries, the exchange space has been the exception to the rule.”Meanwhile, Nasdaq OMX’s expanded listing services aim to let companies access multiple listing markets more efficiently, and with less bureaucracy. The often arduous process of listing can deter many companies from pursuing a public offering.Nasdaq’s move comes as NYSE Euronext, the transatlantic exchange operator and Nasdaq’s main rival, gets set to combat alternative share trading platforms in Europe by launching one of its own, further escalating the battle for market share in the region.Europe’s established exchanges face an assault by share trading platforms, such as Turquoise and Chi-X, which are challenging them with fast trading and low fees.They have emerged because of the competitive forces unleashed by share trading rules passed by the European Commission last year as part of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which broke the exchanges’ dominance over where shares may be traded.
988;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-09-17T22:32:15Z;AIG fears lead to commodities sell-off;;AIG’s woes reverberated through commodity markets on Wednesday, triggering a wave of selling and forcing two exchanges to make an extraordinary intervention in the markets.The insurer acts as a counterparty to a substantial portion of the $30bn invested in the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index, the second most popular benchmark for investing in commodities.The insurer provides derivatives to investors that offer exposure to the index and commodity markets were beset by worries about potential risks on these deals.The London Stock Exchange suspended trading for a range of exchange traded commodities issued by ETF Securities, which are backed by matching products from AIG, after a number of marketmakers stopped trading them.ETF Securities said 113 of its 129 ETC products were affected, involving about $3bn, or one-third, of its total assets under management. The company stressed that AIG had continued to honour its obligations and normal trading was expected to resume in the next 48 hours.An emergency sale of AIG’s agricultural commodity positions also was staged by CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, after it received approval from US regulators for an unusual block-trading session.In a block trade, two counterparties privately agree an off-exchange transaction, but the deal goes through the exchange’s clearing house. It allows the exchange to facilitate large trades without disrupting the market. Although block trading is a common part of business in some financial futures, such as the CME’s Eurodollar market, it is unheard-of in agricultural markets.CME Group said it took the action to protect the orderly functioning of the market. It said: “The agreed-upon order permits the limited execution of block trades by AIG in certain . . . commodity futures products, including soybeans, soybean oil, corn, wheat, live cattle and lean hogs, for the purpose of liquidating a portion of AIG’s open positions.”“It’s a prudent measure,” said Mike Manning, chief executive of Chicago-based Rand Financial Services, a clearing member at the CME. “The markets are crazy as it is without that type of disruption.”
989;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

ETF said AIG was its counterparty for about $2bn in some of its DJ-AIG commodity products and that some investors had withdrawn money.John Reade, a commodity strategist at UBS, said investors in commodity indices were increasingly aware that they did not own hard assets but a swap on an index of commodity futures with counterparty risk.AIG commodity bankers declined to comment.Additional reporting by Chris Flood
991;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-09-09T18:33:04Z;CME Group looks outside US for expansion;;With a string of mega-acquisitions behind it, CME Group has realised there may be limits to how fast it can grow in the US. Now, it is turning its attention to the rest of the world.While the group has had a presence in Europe and Asia for some years, its offices have largely been limited to sales. But in recent months the CME has been on a recruitment drive, tripling its staff in London to almost 30 and doubling it in Asia. An office in Mumbai, India will be opened shortly.Robert Ray, managing director of commodities, equities and international sales, says the group carried out “a real deep dive” into its international strategy in April. The outcome was a “thorough re-organisation of our international structure”, he told the Financial Times. “It’s about making it more global and less Chicago-centric.”The new focus is to recruit specialists in each geographic location, with responsibility for generating more business from specific market participants. CME has hired specialists in London and Sydney to focus on hedge funds. A former Chicago Board of Trade commodities specialist was moved to the London office earlier this year.“We had generalists on the sales side and we decided we needed to have product specialists,” says Mr Ray, one of the few senior CBOT executives to have been retained after the CME’s acquisition of the exchange last year.Similarly, the person in charge of “strategic sales” in Asia has been moved from Chicago to Hong Kong. Two staff specialising in foreign exchange, and one in commodities, have been added, with a fourth in interest rate products to be recruited. CME also has permission to open a telecommunications hub in South Korea, which should help customers there get connected to the CME’s trading systems.CME is also trying to generate more trading from outside the US by encouraging market makers to generate liquidity in its products through special arrangements in each region, such as fee waivers or profit-sharing.“One of our focuses is to increase liquidity throughout all the markets by having focused market making in each time zone,” says Mr Ray. “We believe that we need to reach out to the dealers in more of a partnership.”CME also wants to start developing products in Europe and Asia that are “germane to those areas”, he says. Last week, the exchange launched a version of its popular “e-mini” S&P equity index futures contract, but denominated in euros, rather than dollars. The idea is to appeal to traders in Europe who may want to trade the S&P index futures contract but without dollar exposure.In Brazil, the CME and BM&F exchange recently agreed to swap equity stakes. Mr Ray says the relationship could allow development of both exchanges’ soya bean contracts.There are also opportunities in Japan, where CME last week agreed a memorandum of understanding with the Osaka Securities Exchange, Japan’s largest derivatives exchange.“We hear so much about China and India, but Japan is still the largest capital market in Asia, by far. You can’t forget that,” Mr Ray says.
992;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-09-09T18:17:13Z;Time to concentrate on integration;;Terry Duffy may be chairman of a global financial exchange that has just completed the $8.4bn acquisition of New York’s Nymex, but he remains a Chicagoan to the core.“What’s the name of that park in Manhattan?” he asks during his interview with the Financial Times, temporarily forgetting the name of one of New York’s most famous landmarks as he gives an example to illustrate the use of weather derivatives. “Oh yeah, Central Park.”Regardless of his apparent lack of familiarity with the geography of New York, as chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Mr Duffy sits at the head of a company that is a serious global competitor to the two super-exchanges that dominate the city: Nasdaq OMX and NYSE-Euronext.In the past two years, Mr Duffy has helped steer the CME through two large acquisitions that have given the company control over 98 per cent of US listed futures and transformed it into the largest futures exchange in the world.A former hog trader, the CME chairman retains the air of a straight-talking dealmaker. That proved instrumental in the company’s 2007 acquisition of the Chicago Board of Trade and the purchase of Nymex.To secure approval for the most recent transaction, the CME had to win over 612 votes of Nymex’s 816 class A members. That entailed a lot of one-on-one lobbying by senior CME management, a process Mr Duffy says “got a little tedious at the end”.The CME was able to win member approval without overpaying by choosing its concessions wisely, such as its commitment to retain Nymex’s trading floor until 2012 and to charge Nymex’s members lower trading fees.“I met with a lot of members,” he says. “I’m fortunate: I’ve been a member of this exchange since 1981, so people know I’m a straightforward person and I don’t say things I don’t believe in. So anything I said to the Nymex guys is something I truly believe …so I hopefully had an impact on them.”Taking over Nymex has given the CME stakes in various other ventures, such as the Dubai Mercantile Exchange and the Montreal exchange.Mr Duffy will not be drawn on whether the CME might sell any of those assets. “It’s premature to say what we’d be doing with them. Right now we’re going through all these businesses to understand them and it’s going to take us a little time to make any decision about whether we want to liquidate or maintain them.”After two huge takeovers in as many years, Mr Duffy suggests the company is unlikely to make any similarly large purchases in the near future.“We have the capacity to do a lot of things, but we are definitely not looking at doing another big acquisition at this moment,” he says. “We have to integrate the Nymex.“We’ve done two deals in 18 months. It’s critically important that we execute on these transactions. A lot of people can do deals. But what’s important is to make the deals work. We all know the statistics around mergers and acquisitions: 80 per cent of the acquiring companies fail to integrate properly,” he says.In recent months, the CME has become a victim of the credit crunch, as deleveraging by big financial institutions has led to lower trading volumes. Concern over the issue has been a main factor in the CME’s depressed share price: it closed last Friday at $328.93, down from a high of $714.48 last December.“The credit crunch was something that truly hurt our volumes,” Mr Duffy says. “We’ve seen some banks go through some major issues. These are big participants in our marketplace and they have pulled back.”He lamented the fact that the credit situation was so bad that financial institutions were finding it almost impossible to get loans. “That’s who qualifies for a loan right now – people who don’t want them or need them. That’s the predicament that we’re in.”Although he is wary of giving any predictions on timing, Mr Duffy is confident the volume will return.“Is it a long-term issue or a cyclical issue that will work itself out? We obviously think it’s the latter,” he says. “These products will come back and trade very actively and aggressively. I don’t think the financial system as we know it is coming to an end.”
993;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-09-09T16:57:45Z;CME to shift focus to new products;;The CME Group must re­focus on innovation to convince its critics it is not overly dependent on large, high-profile acquisitions for its growth, the chairman of the world’s largest financial exchange has said.“We’re getting the headlines on acquisitions. We need to get more headlines on innovation,” Terry Duffy, CME’s chairman, explained.“Some people can say: ‘the only reason they’re growing is because they’re acquiring people’. That’s an easy thing to say and, yes, it’s a hard thing for us to debate because that’s true.“But innovation takes much longer than an acquisition does. You can do an acquisition in nine months. To develop a new product can take years,” he said.Mr Duffy was responding to criticism from within the industry that established exchanges such as the CME – which played an important role in the development of financial futures in the early 1970s – have not been able to develop and generate significant interest in next-generation futures products.In recent years the exchange has been boosted by strong secular growth in futures trading and by acquisitions. It bought the Chicago Board of Trade for $11bn in 2007 and last month purchased Nymex for $8.4bn, giving it a near-monopoly in the US listed futures sector.However, the credit crunch has taken a toll on the volumes of contracts being traded as large financial institutions have been forced to deleverage and have cut back on derivatives trading. CME’s volumes last month were 32 per cent lower than a year ago.“We need to become more innovative again,” Mr Duffy said. “We need to create new product for the world to manage risk. We need to figure out what people need in 10 years, five years, two years down the road that they don’t even know they need yet. These institutions were built by people who saw what they believed the future was going to look like.”He said the company was “working very hard on innovative products” but he agreed that the take-up had been slow on newer contracts such as real-estate and weather futures.“These are products which are starting to grow,” Mr Duffy said. “They’re still brand new products.” He noted that trading in financial futures – the CME’s most popular products – grew slowly when they were first introduced.Mr Duffy said the CME was not considering any more large takeovers for the time being. “We have the capacity to do a lot of things, but we are definitely not looking at doing another big acquisition at this moment,” he said.
994;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-09-07T16:02:18Z;Renewed confidence in futures;;To some, the idea of launching another US futures exchange only weeks after the CME Group swallowed the New York Mercantile Exchange might look foolhardy.The combined CME-Nymex is a futures behemoth, controlling virtually all trading in US financial futures.But on Monday, NYSE Euronext, a rival exchange group – and so far active only in cash equities and options – launches its own US futures exchange, known as NYSE Liffe. The operation carries the “Liffe” moniker because NYSE Euronext owns the London International Financial Futures Exchange, Europe’s second-largest futures business after Eurex, owned by Deutsche Börse.Many in the markets remember the ill-fated attempt in 2003 by what was then Euronext-Liffe to compete against the CME in eurodollar futures.Yet, five years on, the NYSE Liffe venture does make sense for its parent. Increasingly, exchanges are offering trading in stocks, options and futures to satisfy the desire of traders – especially hedge funds – to trade multiple-assets in one place.That is why NYSE Euronext has developed a new electronic trading system, known as the Universal Trading Platform. By the first quarter of next year, it will be ready for use across all the products the group offers. Deutsche Börse is doing the same with its US options subsidiary, the International Securities Exchange. UTP will eventually be used to trade futures on NYSE Liffe.To work, NYSE Liffe must not only come up with new products that will provide a compelling alternative to the CME, but will generate liquidity right from the start.Yet it will not even start trading with products of its own making. NYSE Liffe will only offer gold and silver futures contracts, which its parent bought from the Chicago Board of Trade when the CBOT was acquired last year by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, creating CME Group.Hugh Freedberg, global head of derivatives at NYSE Euronext, says the liquidity issue should be solved by encouraging market participants to take an economic stake in NYSE Liffe itself. The exchange has been approached, he says, by ”at least eight or nine” investment banks, and the same number of proprietary trading houses and hedge funds.Mr Freedberg argues that such participants, the largest users of futures exchanges, are keen to see an alternative to CME Group given its virtual monopoly in US futures. “We’ve had investment banks knocking on our doors saying we want to participate. At the moment we are in a situation where we have more people than we can accommodate. To some extent we are spoiled for choice,” he says in an interview at the Swiss Futures and Options Association derivatives conference.“The environment and timing in our view is absolutely right because you have this enormous organisation with which the market can’t have a balanced relationship. People are saying ‘we genuinely want an alternative to bring competition to the marketplace’.”But NYSE Liffe must have new products to put on this platform.Mr Freedberg says having banks and hedge funds as shareholders means the exchange is more likely to develop products that the users of the exchange want, rather than the exchange coming up with products it hopes might appeal to the market.“That is why it’s important to have these guys working with us on this side of the fence,” he says.
995;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-09-03T22:52:05Z;CME joins Osaka in 24-hour trading deal;;The CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, on Wednesday sought to extend its foothold in Asia by entering talks with the Osaka Securities Exchange, Japan’s largest derivatives exchange, to develop new services.Fresh from winning member approval for its $8.2bn takeover of Nymex, the New York energy exchange, the agreement symbolises the CME’s desire to strengthen its ties in Asia as it seeks to enhance its global presence.The CME currently trades both yen and dollar-based Nikkei futures contracts. Initially, the two exchanges will collaborate on the development of 24-hour trading of Nikkei 225 stock index futures contracts.Co-operation on 24-hour futures trading between the two would mean stiff competition for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, whose Topix futures contracts lack the liquidity of the OSE’s Nikkei 225 contracts.Terry Duffy, CME chairman, told the Financial Times he hoped the agreement would herald arrangements on a range of Japanese products. “The Nikkei 225 futures is very compelling but really the contract that most people would like to participate in is the Nikkei 225 options [on futures], which has all the volume,” he said.Exchanges the world over have been signing memoranda of understanding with the aim of creating new business opportunities, though many of the agreements have yet to produce results. Mr Duffy said they were a necessary first step. “The Asian community is very much a protocol community,” he said. “These things take time …We’re the impatient Americans who want to do everything right away but we understand these arrangements do take time.”Last year the CME signed a deal with the Korea Exchange to list the benchmark Kospi 200 futures contract on its electronic trading platform.Mr Duffy said that in the longer term, he expected Asian exchanges to begin to enter into ownership agreements, echoing the $700m cross-equity deal the CME struck last year with the Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange, the largest derivatives exchange in Latin America, in which the CME took 10 per cent of BM&F shares in exchange for 2 per cent of its shares.“I think we’re looking to do more commercial agreements in the future rather than just signing memorandums of understanding,” he said. “The world’s getting smaller and people understand the benefits of scale.”Derivatives trading in Japan has been slower to take off than other regions, but Wednesday’s agreement could help Osaka increase its lead as Japan’s largest derivatives exchange. The OSE’s trading volume in 2007 reached a record 108.92m units, up 80 per cent from 2006, the exchange said.The TSE is considering ways to extend its own futures trading, which include a possible tie-up with another exchange.
996;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-08-26T08:14:39Z;Derivative exchanges;;The biggest just got bigger. CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, has sealed its deal for Nymex, the biggest commodities exchange. What comes next? Given the decline of nearly 50 per cent in its own share price, the CME has been swimming against a strong tide in winning over initially recalcitrant Nymex shareholders and members. But with its cash-and-shares offer pitched at close to 18.5 times forecast 2009 earnings, Nymex investors should not be too sore. InterContinental Exchange, a rival, for example, currently trades on about 13 times.Now it is back to basics – the business of pushing ever-greater trading volumes through the combined platforms. Stronger Nymex volumes may help the numbers – underlining the merits of diversity – but August so far looks sluggish for the CME, after a blockbuster summer in 2007. Extreme volatility has disrupted hedge funds’ trading strategies in eurodollar options. A shift to shorter-dated intruments has hurt volumes in 10- and 30-year Treasury futures. Volatility is usually a boon for exchanges but in its core interest rate products the CME might now benefit, instead, from some signs of financial stability.The real question is where longer-term growth rates for derivatives exchanges will settle. Volume uplift from automation and algorithmic trading is coming to an end at the CME. In a deleveraging environment, banks are reducing capital allocations to their trading desks. Formation of new hedge funds is no longer easily outstripping the numbers liquidating.In response, the CME’s management is eyeing new energy-related products. Its partnership with BM&F Bovespa will begin in September, targeting untapped international demand for derivatives. The next big push will be into products traded over-the-counter. That will pitch the group against Wall Street’s finest – another tough challenge for the CME team’s negotiating prowess. After the takeover, share buybacks of up to $1.1bn may please investors, as will $60m of forecast cost savings. Growth, though, will be harder to achieve.Post and read comments on this Lex
997;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-08-25T19:41:51Z;CME-Nymex deal raises questions;;"The combination of the CME Group with the New York Mercantile Exchange, now complete, makes a behemoth in futures trading even bigger but does little to clarify how the exchange sector will develop in the coming years.Michael Henry, a senior executive in Accenture’s global Capital Markets practice, said: “The acquisition itself was fairly straightforward. CME buys a US-based derivatives exchange with a similar product set and technology platform. But the broader context is more complex and occurs within an ongoing battle for market share between virtually all of the world’s largest exchanges.”Opinions differ widely as to how the consolidation of exchanges, which is taking place alongside fragmentation in the form of smaller players entering the market, will affect the status quo.One analyst said: “The exchange landscape of the future will consist of three or four large global players that offer access to a large and diverse range of asset classes.“The finalists will be become increasingly apparent over the next three to five years – and clearly CME could be one of them.”But to some, the CME’s acquisition of Nymex seems to be a defensive step, more designed to keep Nymex out of the hands of its rivals.“If the CME wants to be a global player, it will have to attempt more challenging strategic moves in the future, such as acquiring a cash market or overseas exchange …The challenge for CME will be to realise the $60m, in annual savings, which was not spelled out in its public announcements,” said Mr Henry.Larry Tabb, founder of the Tabb Group, a US consultant, said the landscape in the futures business could still be subject to further change. “Will the tightly and vertically integrated CME strategy of being the largest global player in an increasingly global market play out, or will Project Rainbow or ELX, the upstart brokerage- led futures initiatives gain share, or will the CFTC take the unlikely step of forcing the CME to divest its clearing arm?”Whether regulators make the CME re-examine its clearing model is questionable. By consolidating the two clearing houses, the transaction in effect cements the structure of exchange-owned “vertical” clearing, rather than the “horizontal” utility-style model favoured by some regulators.In February, the US Department of Justice antitrust division sent a letter to the Treasury recommending that clearing be separated from futures exchanges; the European Commission has been looking at extending its code of conduct on “interoperability” from equities to derivatives exchanges.The DoJ’s subsequent approval of the CME-Nymex merger not only makes reform of US clearing unlikely, but also makes it hard for European regulators to push horizontal clearing if they are not to damage their derivatives exchanges’ global competitiveness.For clearing firms, the takeover should bring savings. “The margin requirement benefits will be significant,” says Mike Manning, chief executive of Chicago-based Rand Financial Services, a clearing member at both exchanges.Nymex’s leadership had long positioned the exchange as an acquisition target. Since the CME first mooted the cash-and-shares deal in January, the value of the takeover tumbled from $11.3bn to $7.6bn.Nevertheless, in spite of noises from Nymex activists, the logic of consolidation in the exchange world meant that the New York energy exchange was never likely to continue long as a stand-alone company.Nymex trading was reliant on the CME’s system for its electronic execution. Partnering with the CME gives Nymex the scale and efficiencies to grow.The takeover may be the last big acquisition in global exchanges for a while. The sector had been marked by frenzied consolidation and the emergence of global super-exchanges, but that has slowed as the financial crisis has dragged down the share prices of exchanges and cut into derivatives trading volumes.Most of the largest exchanges have completed or are in the process of completing large, complex mergers. Old rivalries and diverging business models make it less than obvious where the next merger will come from.The merger leaves the question as to how other exchanges, most of whom want a piece of the expanding energy market, will react. NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX Group said they want to make an impact in the US derivatives market; the combination of Nymex and CME makes that trickier. The NYSE will take heart from its approval from regulators for a futures trading licence last week.Perhaps more importantly than scale, the merger gives the CME access to over-the-counter energy futures, which can be cleared through Nymex’s Clearport system. The CME has had little success itself in building OTC volumes."
998;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;Nymex takeover wins approval;;The CME Group enhanced its position as the world’s largest financial exchange on Monday by winning member approval for its $7.6bn takeover of Nymex, the New York energy exchange, creating a company that will dominate the US derivatives sector with control of 98 per cent of listed futures.The deal will cement Chicago’s fast-emerging role within the global exchange world. The CME Group was formed last year from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s $11bn purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade. Its takeover of Nymex – the combined company’s first purchase of an entire exchange – lays down a challenge to the CME’s New York-based rivals such as Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext.“The addition of NYMEX to CME Group creates an even stronger international company,” said Terry Duffy, CME chairman. “We are now the only exchange to offer access to every global benchmark product.”The vote capped a stormy six months since the CME first formally confirmed its interest in acquiring Nymex. The transaction had looked to be in peril on several occasions: many members felt their rights were being bought out for too little, shareholders were angry with large payouts to Nymex management and a last-minute tax revolt threatened to derail the deal.Last month the CME sweetened its bid, offering to pay 816 class A Nymex members an additional $113m, raising to $612m the total amount it will spend to buy them out of a profit-sharing scheme. It also cut the payout to Nymex’s management team by $30m and committed itself to maintaining the New York exchange’s current Manhattan trading floor until 2012.Those concessions helped the CME secure the votes of the 75 per cent of Nymex members it needed to approve the deal. About 650 Nymex members voted in favour of the takeover – well above the 612 needed for the deal to pass. Shareholders of both exchanges also approved the transaction in ballots on Monday.The CME also embarked on a targeted lobbying effort in recent days, wooing some of the deal’s more vocal opponents in private dinners at which senior management from the Chicago exchange made their case for the transaction. Last week, two of the most prominent former dissidents came out in support of the deal.Analysts expect the CME to slash administrative jobs at Nymex in a bid to cut costs. Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, suggested Monday the cuts could begin as soon as this week. “Following the closing of this transaction, which we expect to occur this Friday, we will begin executing our detailed integration plan to achieve significant cost synergies and operational efficiencies for our shareholders and customers,” he said.
999;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-08-18T22:23:08Z;Trading volume soars 58% on Russia’s Micex;;"Micex, Russia’s largest exchange group, on Monday bucked the trend of declining trading volumes at many of the world’s exchanges by reporting a 58 per cent rise in volume in the first six months of the year.The exchange was founded in 1992 as a currency exchange and has expanded into Russian corporate bonds and derivatives. Its main rival is the RTS exchange. Both are Moscow-based.Micex added a stock market four years ago, and now has 204 company listings, up from 106 in 2006. Half of the companies are involved in energy and include Gazprom, Lukoil, Rosneft and Surgutneftegaz.Micex saw overall trading volume across all its markets rise by 58 per cent to Rbs58,000bn ($2,366bn) in the first half of the year.Volume on the stock exchange was up by 52 per cent, driven mostly by a two-fold increase in repo transactions. The exchange accounted for 46 per cent of group turnover. Non-resident investors account for about 29 per cent of trading.Credit Suisse analysts said that global equity volumes had fallen up to mid-August “given seasonal trends and lower levels of equity market volatility”.However, primary listings on the Micex stock exchange – including new share placements and bond issuance – rose by 4 per cent. The exchange said this was “a significant achievement”.Micex said it planned a new risk management system for its futures market that it acquired recently from Chicago-based CME Group. It was also working on US dollar futures.

● The Johannesburg Stock Exchange launched a new equity derivatives trading system on Monday, replacing one inherited when the JSE bought the former Safex exchange. The move is designed to make it easier for institutional investors to see prices for equity derivatives, especially single stock futures, where the JSE is the world’s largest market."
1000;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-08-04T12:33:10Z;ICE boosted by volatile energy markets;;Intercontinental Exchange, the electronic exchange group, on Monday reported the second strongest quarter in its history, benefitting from volatile energy markets in its second quarter as companies sought to hedge against spiralling oil prices by buying futures contracts or increasing their use of over-the-counter trading.Net profits rose 58 per cent to $85m or $1.19 per share, up from $53.7m or 75 cents per share in the second quarter of 2007, on revenues up 44 per cent to $197.2m.The volume of futures contracts traded on ICE in the second quarter was up 18 per cent from the same period last year, with Brent Crude and WTI Crude futures contracts establishing new quarterly volume records.The exchange also announced on Monday that its Board of Directors had authorised a $500m share buyback. ICE’s shares have been dragged down this year by investors’ general bearishness towards financial stocks. From a recent high of $165.15 in May, the share price has declined to $96.20.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive, signalled that the company would seek to grow further by making acquisitions. “We continue to invest in new avenues of growth and to evaluate M&A opportunities to expand our position as one of the most global, diversified derivatives markets in the world,” he said.ICE – which last year lost a battle with the CME Group to take over the Chicago Board of Trade – announced in June a $625m deal to buy Creditex, an inter-dealer credit derivatives broker, signaling a move into the fast-growing $62,200bn credit-default swaps market.
1001;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-08-01T20:56:51Z;US stocks fall as investors digest jobs data;;Wall Street stocks fell for a second session on Friday, and trimmed already modest weekly gains, as investors wrestled with downbeat jobs data, poor results from General Motors and a bump in the price of oil.The latest employment report from the Labor Department showed that the US economy shed jobs for a seventh successive month in July, although the decline was slightly smaller than expected. The unemployment rate rose from 5.5 per cent in June to 5.7 per cent – the highest level since March 2004.Poor results from GM, the largest carmaker in the US, added to the losses. The company said it had made a second-quarter loss of $15.5bn, four times larger than analysts expected, because of the cost of labour disputes and a slump in domestic sales.A bump in the price of oil added to the pressure. GM shares fell 7.6 per cent to $10.27. Ford shares dipped 3.1 per cent to $4.65.By the close nine of the 10 leading industry groups were in the red, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.6 per cent to 1,260.31 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 11,326.32 points. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,310.96 points.Over a volatile week, the Dow edged down 0.3 per cent, the Nasdaq held its ground and the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent due to mixed second-quarter earnings, a decline in the price of oil and some weak data on growth, home prices and employment.Stu Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said: “You could be asking why markets are holding up as well as they are in the face of all of this . . . the S&P 500 was down around 1,200 a few weeks ago and here we are at 1,250 or so. I think a lot of the bad news is already discounted in the market.”S&P 500 company second-quarter profits have fallen 20 per cent on average compared to a year ago, according to Bloomberg data. Profits have slumped about 82 per cent at financials and more than 100 per cent at consumer discretionary companies while energy company profits have grown by 18 per cent. Excluding financials, average earnings on the S&P 500 rose 3 per cent.On Friday, financials were the only gainers as strength in the investment banking sector offset some bad news from exchanges. NYSE Euronext slid 12.9 per cent to $41.15 after it posted second-quarter profits that undershot ambitious analyst estimates.The shares in CME, another exchange operator dropped 7.6 per cent to $332.94 after it said that July daily average trading volume had fallen compared to a year ago.The financial sector as a whole made a late run to take its gain for the week to 4 per cent after Merrill Lynch announced asset sales and capital raising and the markets concluded that the results season had averted worst-case scenarios.Analysts at Barclays Capital said: “Overall, the US banks reported weak but not disastrous second-quarter results, and the markets breathed a sigh of relief.”For much of the session the energy sector was the only one to advance, but disappointing results from Chesapeake Energy, an independent natural-gas producer, and Chevron, the oil producer, eventually took their toll. Chesapeake lost 1.9 per cent to $49.22, Chevron dipped 0.3 per cent to $84.31, and the sector fell 0.4 per cent.Material stocks also fared poorly, hit by new data showing US manufacturing activity stagnated in July. Metals stocks led the materials sector down 2.6 per cent. Titanium Metals dropped 6.8 per cent to $10.50, Nucor fell 6 per cent to $54.78 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 5.6 per cent to $91.31.In healthcare, renewed safety concerns about Biogen Idec’s multiple sclerosis drug weighed on the sector. Biogen slumped 28.3 per cent to $50.01 while the sector gave up 1 per cent.In technology, poor results from Sun Microsystems, weighed on the sector. The maker of server computers said profit fell 73 per cent. Shares retreated 12.3 per cent to $9.32. The sector dipped 0.6 per cent.
1002;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;US firms in interdealer broker tie-up;;Six of the US’s independent over-the-counter brokers will on Thursday announce they are uniting to form an interdealer brokerage that will be a leading force in trading North American energy futures.The move comes as energy trading comes under intense pressure from Congress, where speculation and opaque markets have been blamed for high oil prices. The new company represents an attempt by brokers to pre-empt stiffer regulation by demonstrating that there is already some transparency in the clearing of OTC energy derivatives.Although the futures industry came together to defend itself from stringent legislation that it warned might push trading overseas, its lobbying efforts may also have been weakened by internal bickering.The CME Group, which operates the world’s biggest futures exchange and is poised to enter the energy trading market by taking over Nymex, the New York energy exchange, is keen to see pressure on traders who privately negotiate bilateral OTC energy futures contracts, in the hope that will force such trading on to exchanges.The formation of OTC Global Holdings – a group of four Houston-based firms and two companies in New York – is a response both to the CME’s push for greater transparency in OTC markets and the wider debate that has been taking place in Washington.“Given all the change in our industry – from the greater role the exchanges are playing in our space to regulatory change – we, as independent brokers with a lot of similar concerns, felt if we could put our companies together, we’d be in a better position to address those concerns,” said Javier Loya, chief executive.“The OTC market is not opaque,” he added. “It’s very diverse, very robust, very experienced and more business gets done over-the-counter than on an exchange.”OTC Global Holdings will be a broker for bespoke, privately negotiated bilateral contracts but once agreed, those contracts will be cleared on Nymex’s electronic Clearport system. Mr loya said the new company represented a “compromise” between the current situation and the calls for stricter regulation, in which “the transactions will continue to originate and execute at the OTC level but just clear on exchanges.”Mr Loya poured cold water on the notion that OTC energy trading could be forced on to established exchanges. “It’s very difficult to migrate liquidity,” he said. “I don’t see that our business could go back to open outcry in a pit on the floor. You can’t necessarily have a very generic commoditised product like an exchange contract.”OTC Global Holdings will be the largest liquidity provider to Nymex’s Clearport system, dominant in options contracts for North American natural gas and an important player in the crude and power sectors.
1003;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T07:50:23+0000;Eurex moves into clearing for OTC credit markets;;Eurex, Europe’s largest derivatives exchange, on Tuesday night joined the rush to provide clearing services for over-the-counter credit markets by unveiling plans to clear credit default swaps.The initiative comes a day after US rival CME Group said it would expand its clearing services into OTC interest-rate swaps.At the same time Markit Group, a data and trade processing company, announced a joint venture for processing and confirming OTC derivatives with The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade services provider.Eurex said its initiative “aims to complement current US initiatives with a European solution”.It was in talks with “several other infrastructure providers concerning their involvement in a new platform” for the service. One of them is the DTCC, sources familiar with the talks said.The moves come as regulators press for a reduction in the potential systemic risks inherent in such bilaterally negotiated markets. Eurex said its initiative was “designed to address recent developments in the OTC market that suggest concerns about systemic risk due to the backlog of transaction confirmation and potential counterparty defaults require improvements in the market’s infrastructure”.The Eurex platform, set for launch in the first half of next year, will initially focus on iTraxx index exposures mainly traded out of Europe.“An extension to other asset classes – for example equity and fixed income – can be handled flexibly according to market demand,” Eurex said.Kevin McPartland, senior analyst at Tabb Group, said: “With the increasing concern over counterparty risk, it [the Eurex plan] is not surprising. Exchanges see the growth and size of the OTC markets and want a piece of that pie.”In Europe, Eurex rival Liffe plans in the fourth quarter to launch credit default swaps based on iTraxx indices. They will be cleared on BClear, a service offered by Liffe that clears through LCH.Clearnet.The Clearing Corporation, a Chicago-based clearer, is also working on offering clearing of OTC credit products. It is backed in part by a group of investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, which has taken the lead in coming up with an OTC clearing solution outside the scope of the exchanges.Eurex said a European OTC clearing platform would increase capital efficiency by reducing balance sheet exposure, while promoting “the optimal use of margin deposits”.
1004;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-07-22T20:49:24Z;Wall Street rallies as oil price drops sharply;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday as a sharp drop in oil prices boosted consumer-facing stocks while a plan to turn round Wachovia helped investors shrug off some disappointing earnings reports.Most eyes were focused on the financial sector, which staged a remarkable midday volte-face to gain 6.6 per cent as investors skipped over a series of weak earnings results to focus on the positive.Overnight, American Express reported second-quarter earnings that missed estimates and withdrew its full-year earnings forecast. The credit card company’s shares tumbled 7.1 per cent to $37.99 while peer Discover Financial lost 3.8 per cent to $14.62.An $8.9bn loss from Wachovia and some depressing results from regional banks, including Regions Financial and Keycorp, initially added to the sour mood.But by midday investors had shrugged off the bad news, focusing instead on a strategy from Robert Steel, Wachovia’s new chief executive, to cut $2bn of expenses by the end of 2009, sell assets and slash jobs and the dividend at the bank.Wachovia shares swung from an 11.6 per cent loss to a 27.4 per cent gain at $16.79. Regions Financial and Keycorp overturned early losses to gain 9.6 per cent to $11.40 and 4.3 per cent to $11.99, respectively.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim, an online brokerage, said: “Wachovia presented a plan this morning, they cut their dividend – they are doing something. This credit crisis is not going away in a month, but if we have a plan to get ourselves out of it in a year that makes the market feel good.”There were some more consistent bright spots. Western Union advanced 8.6 per cent to $27.23 after the money-transfer company said second-quarter profit had risen 13 per cent, thanks to international revenues, and raised its 2008 profit forecast.SunTrust Banks said second-quarter earnings had slumped 21 per cent. But that was a smaller fall than expected and the shares rallied 17.1 per cent to $39.97 after the bank ruled out a capital raising or dividend cut.CME Group, which runs futures exchanges, said second-quarter profit had risen 60 per cent to $201m thanks to its purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade. CME shares rose 12.5 per cent to $366.27.By the close, the benchmark S&P 500 had shaken off early losses and was up 1.4 per cent at 1,277.01 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent higher at 11,602.5 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was ahead 1.1 per cent at 2,303.96 points.The day began in downbeat fashion after Apple forecast fourth-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ projections. The news, and speculation about the health of Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, sent shares in the iPod maker down 2.6 per cent to $162.02.Texas Instruments and SanDisk also disappointed investors in the technology sector. The semiconductor makers both predicted earnings that trailed analysts’ expectations. Texas shares fell 14.2 per cent to $24.48, SanDisk dropped 24 per cent to $13.62, while an index of semiconductor stocks slipped 2.8 per cent.A $4 drop in oil prices took the sting out of the worst results. Consumer staples and discretionary stocks were among the best performers, adding 2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart added 3.1 per cent to $59.06 while Starbucks rose 7.4 per cent to $15.13.In industrials, some solid earnings news helped steady investor concerns about the health of the economy. Caterpillar, the heavy goods maker, Lockheed Martin, the defence company, Paccar, the truckmaker, and United Parcel Service, each met or beat analysts’ expectations for their quarterly results.Caterpillar shares rose 2.4 per cent to $74.98, Lockheed Martin added 2.3 per cent to $103.88, Paccar climbed 4.4 per cent to $44.60 and UPS advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.11.Energy was the best performing sector on Monday, but that trend petered out on Tuesday as oil prices slipped back below $130 a barrel and some decent results from the services sub-industry left investors unmoved. BJ Services and Baker Hughes rose 6.6 per cent to $31.99, and 3.2 per cent to $87.06, respectively.
1005;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-07-22T17:02:35Z;CME confident of Nymex win;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, said on Tuesday it was confident it had won over enough Nymex members to secure approval of its proposed takeover of the New York energy exchange.The CME last week sweetened its $8.2bn bid by offering to pay 816 Nymex members an additional $113m, raising to $612m the total amount the Chicago exchange is proposing to buy them out of a profit-sharing scheme. CME said it would receive a combined $3.2bn bridge loan from Bank of America and UBS to finance the Nymex deal.The proposed takeover has come under severe criticism from some Nymex activists. The CME’s improved offer to members is an attempt to split the opposition between members who felt they were being undervalued and shareholders unhappy that the bid was linked to the CME’s share price, which has lost more than half its value since December.The deal must be approved by at least three-quarters of Nymex’s membership in a vote on August 18. Before the revised deal, activists had been confident that they could easily count on the 205 votes needed to block the deal.In an interview with the Financial Times, Terry Duffy, CME chairman, said: “This is a transaction we were committed to being very disciplined on and us making this modest increase displays that discipline and we think it secures the vote.”Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, said: “Both Terry and I have received a number of calls since we announced the revised agreement indicating strong support … we did a good job of working with the Nymex leadership to respond to the comments and the feedback we were getting.”Mr Duffy said another important concession was cutting the compensation to Nymex’s management team by $30m.He said Nymex members had also been won over by CME’s commitment to maintain the New York exchange’s current Manhattan trading floor until 2012.However, Mr Duffy also cautioned that opposition remained. “I don’t know if we’ve neutralised all the opposition from the members,” he said.“We’ve made a change that will appease the members and secure the vote. I can never say with complete conviction that we’ve neutralised all opposition. I’ve never seen that in any transaction or any deal.”CME also announced profits for the second quarter of the year that exceeded expectations. The CME’s net income rose to $215m or $3.93 per share, up from $194m or $3.52 per share a year before, once costs from its purchase last year of the Chicago Board of Trade and other special items are stripped out. That was ahead of analysts’ expectations of about $3.85 per share.
1006;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-07-22T01:17:54Z;IG bets on profitable US business;;IG Group, the UK’s biggest spread-betting company, saw “no signs” of a slowdown in customer activity in spite of a deteriorating UK economic outlook as its full-year earnings rose 40 per cent.Tim Howkins, chief executive, said the company expected its US business to approach being profitable by the end of this financial year, following recent expansion into the region including the purchase of Hedge­Street, an off-exchange foreign exchange platform.Market volatility helped drive earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to £98.5m (£70.4m) in the year to May 31. Revenues rose 51 per cent to £184m (£122m) and the pre-tax profit was £97m (£68.9m). The results were in line with analysts’ expectations.IG offers financial derivatives products ranging from simple spread bets to “trailing stops” and “bungee bets”, allowing investors to make bets on future movements in stocks, foreign exchange and on sports, entertainment and political events. Mr Howkins said even as IG benefited from volatility, it was “encouraging to note that our best month’s revenue in the year was achieved in April, which was not a volatile month when compared to the preceding nine months”.The company had recruited more than twice the number of spread betting and CFD (contracts for difference) clients compared with the previous year and over three times the number the year before that.IG’s client base is mostly in the UK but the company has been expanding internationally, opening offices in Paris, Madrid and Chicago.In December, IG completed its purchase of HedgeStreet, a dormant US exchange offering binary options. IG reactivated it in February and has been carrying out IT upgrades to allow it to expand its range of markets and opening hours.Earnings per share rose from 14.67p to 20.62p and the dividend was lifted from 6.5p to 9p, giving a total pay-out for the year of 12p (8.5p) – an increase of 41 per cent.Shares in the group fell 14p to 305p.
1007;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;CME sweetens bid for Nymex by $113m;;"The CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, on Friday sweetened its bid for Nymex by $113m, focusing its efforts on winning over members of the New York energy exchange while keeping its offer to shareholders unchanged.The CME’s takeover has been bitterly criticised by some activists within Nymex, both by members who feel the Chicago exchange was offering too little and by shareholders upset at how the value of the bid was tied to the CME’s beleaguered share price.The improved offer indicates the CME is attempting to divide opponents of the bid by wooing members while ignoring the gripes of shareholders. Any takeover must be approved by at least three-quarters of Nymex’s membership, meaning opponents need only secure 205 of 816 votes to block the deal, which has looked increasingly possible in recent months.The CME also moved to take the sting out of some attacks by Nymex activists against the New York exchange’s management, who stood collectively to make $60m from the deal. The CME said on Friday Nymex’s senior management had agreed large cuts in those packages and other expenses, reducing the cost of the acquisition by $30m.The deal would create a company that controls about 98 per cent of US-listed futures and offers contracts on a range of underlying commodities such as interest rates, foreign exchange, stock indices, oil, metals and agricultural products.In what CME said was its “full and final offer”, the Chicago-based company raised the amount it will pay for each Nymex membership from $612,000 to $750,000.The CME also announced a series of other measures designed to win over Nymex members, such as strengthening its commitment to maintain Nymex’s existing trading floor until 2012 and signalling that it would charge Nymex members lower trading fees.The value of the overall cash-and-shares deal has fallen from about $11.3bn when it was first announced in January to about $7.6bn, as CME shares have been hit by falling volumes and investors’ general bearishness towards the financial sector. Some Nymex shareholders previously said the bid was too low and were holding out for more, even though no other bidder emerged. But as the crisis in the US’s financial sector
has worsened, expectations among Nymex shareholders have lowered, and the activists are now pushing for the entire deal to be rejected.Nymex and CME shareholders and Nymex members will vote on the proposed deal on August 18."
1008;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-06-30T19:41:16Z;CME to leave NYSE for Nasdaq;;Shares in the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, will next week cease trading on the New York Stock Exchange and list solely on the Nasdaq, the NYSE’s main rival for listings in the US.Analysts said the move was likely to sour relations between NYSE Euronext, the parent company of the NYSE, and the CME, the two largest US exchange groups. The NYSE is aiming to break into the futures business, which is dominated by the CME, and hopes to gain its licence to trade futures as soon as next month.The NYSE and Nasdaq compete fiercely to attract listings from one another with any win loudly trumpeted by both.The CME has been listed on the NYSE for almost six years and dually listed on the Nasdaq since 2005.It will cease listing on the NYSE on July 11 and commence trading on Nasdaq on July 14 under the symbol CME, the same ticker it has on NYSE.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of the Nasdaq OMX Group, parent company of the Nasdaq, said: “The CME Group has been an innovative exchange leader that understands trading efficiencies.”Magnus Bocker, president of Nasdaq OMX, pointed out that the CME and Nasdaq share a similar market philosophy, adding that the CME Group had been a Nasdaq corporate services customer over the past few years.Along with the sole listing, Nasdaq will extend the CME’s exclusive rights to offer futures and options on futures contracts based on Nasdaq indices, for an additional seven-year period, to 2019. The exchanges said in a statement that this arrangement further strengthens a long-standing partnership that began in 1996.A spokesman for NYSE Euronext said the enhanced commercial relationship between the CME and Nasdaq was “clearly influential” in the listing decision.“We are proud of the market quality and service that we have provided the CME and their shareholders,” he said.The Nasdaq has a Chicago-based office and has 59 listed companies based in Chicago, with a market capitalisation of about $59bn.The agreement with Nasdaq comes as CME is coping with having lost its licence to list futures contracts based on the Russell indices, which formerly accounted for about 10 per cent of its equity index trading volume.For the past three years, Russell licensed its indexes to multiple exchanges. Instead, the company has an exclusive agreement with InterContinental Exchange, the Atlanta-based company that last year battled the CME for control of the Chicago Board of Trade, to list futures on the Russell indexes. The transition is expected to begin over the summer.
1009;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-06-26T22:57:16Z;LSE takes the plunge into dark pool;;If still waters run deep, then the London Stock Exchange’s long silence about whether it should plunge into the competition between dark pools of liquidity was evidence of profound thought about the wisdom and implications of such a move.It is unsurprising the LSE took its time. The pre-eminence of a platform based on a public order book, where shares are openly traded, is a point of principle for the exchange. But as a greater proportion of trading passes to new platforms, and sloshes in and out of dark pools, where big blocks of equity can be bought and sold unseen by the rest of the market, Dame Clara Furse, the LSE’s chief executive, has had to flex that principle.She’s right to have done so. Baikal – the new pan-European trading joint venture with Lehman Brothers – is an aggressive and welcome response to the competitive threat laid out in this column. LSE shares, having risen sharply on Wednesday, still lost ground. In part, that was because of disappointment that wilder rumours – a takeover by the CME Group, for instance – had not come true. But the reaction also reflects immediate prospects for Baikal: the venture is untried, will arrive later than some rivals, and may not generate much additional revenue. Fragmentation is the enemy of success for new markets. Simply by entering the race, the LSE and Lehman may have made it harder to win: if that is the case, a venture named after the deepest lake in the world could turn out to be less like Baikal and more like the Aral Sea.But that ultra-sceptical view ignores the fact that the LSE would be worse off had it done nothing. Now at least, Dame Clara can make the case that the LSE’s platform will be more innovative and its pool deeper than those of rivals. Without Baikal, she was at even greater risk of being left high and dry.The quest for a better mixQuotas are a lightning rod for controversy. Without positive discrimination, advocates say, women and minorities will never catch up with white men, be it in the boardroom or in parliament. Apply quotas, answer the critics, and you will fuel whispers that beneficiaries were selected on race or gender rather than talent.The European Professional Women’s Network’s latest survey of women in the boardroom provides compelling evidence about the effect of quotas. Norway – where, from 2010, companies will be fined if 40 per cent of directors are not female – tops the table on female board representation. In Britain, by shameful contrast, the percentage is stuck at 11.5 per cent, only a fraction higher than two years ago.Almost as worrying is the scarcity of women in executive management. This is the pipeline that should be supplying the next generation of chief executives, chairpeople and non-executives, and providing role-models for younger women. Only 3.2 per cent of European board executive roles are held by women.Now must be the time for more radical methods. Harriet Harman’s Equality Bill is a good start. It will allow employers to take under-representation into account and pick the female or minority (or presumably, in some cases, male) candidate if confronted by two equally qualified applicants.Ms Harman announced the proposals hours before a House of Commons reception about research into why women quit jobs in science, engineering and technology. The research, in the Harvard Business Review, highlights how US companies are taking bold positive action to increase the number of women in senior positions – mainly because they can see it makes economic sense to counter the brain drain. The new bill may not be perfect, but it will have succeeded if it prompts more UK companies to alter the mix of boards and executive committees. Not because it’s the law, but because it’s in their own interest to do so.Last orders at Regent InnsIt is tempting to write off Regent Inns as just another pub operator laid low by the introduction of the smoking ban, the slowdown in consumer spending, and higher energy and food costs.But why has it taken three profit warnings (the first last May) and a collapse in the shares to prompt a change in the management structure? Having run Regent as part-time executive chairman since being parachuted in four years ago, Bob Ivell has decided it is an “appropriate time” to appoint a full-time chief executive. That’s a decision investors or directors should have urged him to take months, if not years, ago.If the change is not too little, it is certainly too late. At worst – as one analyst says – the stock could plunge to zero. At best, the group may be able to batten down the hatches and wait for the credit market to recover and potential buyers to return.Either way, Mr Ivell has handed John Leslie, the former chief financial officer now elevated to chief executive, an unenviable task at the worst possible moment.Regent Inns: pan.yuk@ft.comandrew.hill@ft.comTo comment, visit www.ft.com/lombard

The pre-eminence of a platform based on a public order book, where shares are openly traded, is a point of principle for the London exchange.

Now, at the very least, Dame Clara can make the case that the LSE’s platform will be more innovative and its pool deeper than those of its rivals. Without Baikal, she was at even greater risk of being left high and dry.Canberra canterWhen Sinosteel first invested in Australia in 1987 in the landmark Channar joint venture, it got its own act of parliament in what was one of China’s first significant overseas deals.The Chinese state-owned iron ore group’s application for permission to take a substantial stake in Murchison Metals could prove equally ground-breaking.Canberra has now given itself 90 days to review the case through its Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), the agency whose opaque provisions enabled it to block Shell’s takeover of Woodside, the oil and gas group, in 2001.Until recently, Chinese companies were happy to take non-controlling stakes in resources joint ventures in Australia with local partners, following a strategy pursued by Japanese steelmakers for decades. But the sharp rise in iron ore prices, in particular, has produced a more aggressive stance.It is hoped Sinosteel’s application to FIRB will force the government to clarify rules on investment by sovereign-owned entities after months of prevaricating. Among other things, Canberra has yet to rubber-stamp Chinalco’s US$14bn purchase of a 9 per cent holding in Rio Tinto. FIRB’s role emerged as a sensitive issue in the lead-up to Australia’s free trade agreement with the US. It is no coincidence that Canberra is re-examining FIRB’s remit just as it is trying to inject momentum into its free trade agreement talks with Beijing.Folie de grandeurIs Jean-François Roverato going too far? Quite rightly, the veteran chief executive of Eiffage fought a fierce battle to prevent a backdoor takeover of the French construction group by Spanish raiders. But he also seems to think that victory over Sacyr Vallehermoso entitles him to absolute power. During the course of the bruising battle, he promised to retire as chief executive of the company he built over three decades into one of Europe’s largest construction groups.Indeed, he stood down last year as chief executive to become chairman before resuming the chief executive role in December after his successor resigned. He now says there is no immediate succession issue, suggesting he could stay on indefinitely. He even says he regrets having ever promised to step down.This week, the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignation, his main institutional shareholder, indicated it had had enough. Mr Roverato had proposed a resolution at the annual meeting to give long-standing shareholders double voting rights. But CDC blocked the move, which would have given an unnecessary and unjustified additional defence for the group. After all, these defences are already rock-solid given that employees, management and its two largest institutional shareholders (CDC and the Groupama insurer) hold between them about 55 per cent of shares. If Mr Roverato wants to build the strongest defences against any takeover, surely his best weapons will be to increase profits and good governance.world.view@ft.com
1011;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

1014;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T08:01:05+0000;LSE share jump;;What was behind Tuesday’s 3.5 per cent jump in the share price of the London Stock Exchange? Certainly nothing emanating from LSE headquarters, where chief executive Clara Furse and her team are working on a strategic review of the exchange’s clearing arrangements.The answer may lie across the Atlantic. On Monday, the US justice department approved the proposed takeover of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the energy futures market, by CME Group, the largest US futures exchange. The deal was waved through unconditionally. Not a peep of concern was expressed, in spite of the fact that almost all of US futures trading will now go through the CME and that the combination will reinforce the CME’s vertically integrated model of clearing house ownership – both Nymex and the CME have their own clearers.Ms Furse, seen until now as a champion of London’s model of open and competitive clearing, the process which guarantees that trades do not default, now faces a strategic decision. The justice department’s decision may give the LSE some extra political cover, to the probable dismay of the European Commission, to build its own clearing business if it wishes.At present the LSE, unlike big rivals Deutsche Börse and CME, contracts its clearing out to LCH.Clearnet in London. Exchange ownership of higher-margin clearing provides, other things being equal, a handy boost to exchange valuation multiples. The LSE’s share price needs a lift as it prepares for fresh competitors on the trading front and softer volumes in equities trading as markets weaken.The LSE’s acquisition of Borsa Italiana, which does its own clearing, gives Ms Furse the building blocks of a more vertically integrated business. If the LSE moves into clearing, this will create a headache for Brussels, which has been pushing for open and competitive clearing. But her shareholders should be happier.Post and read comments on this Lex
1015;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-06-16T08:57:58Z;Derivatives exchanges;;Is the schadenfreude starting to look a bit rich? Executives at derivatives exchanges have often made light of the slow-motion crisis affecting their compatriots over in traditional equity trading. Derivative volumes are growing faster, while margins are higher and more defendable – a contract opened on one exchange cannot be closed on another. Yet shares in CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives group, have almost halved since December, dragging down the rest of the sector with it.Some of this is a dose of reality, with shares re-rating from ridiculous highs. CME has fallen from 40 times forward earnings to about 22. But trading frequency is undoubtedly slowing, reflecting the drop in volatility. And last year’s frenzied activity in products such as interest rate futures makes for a very tough comparison ahead in the third and fourth quarters.More subdued valuations also reflect the exchanges’ struggle against their biggest competitor: the private, over-the-counter market. In spite of the near-collapse of Bear Stearns and worries that Lehman Brothers will be carried out feet first, there is little evidence that fears over counterparty risk have dampened bank-to-bank trading. Quite the opposite, in fact. As a group, inter-dealer brokers – arrangers and facilitators of OTC deals – have outperformed derivatives exchanges by about 5 per cent since Bear was rescued in March.It may seem obvious that the market is moving towards transparent, standardised structures traded on an exchange, with central clearing and settlement. But whether used for hedging or speculation, many of the lightly customisable contracts offered by the exchanges do not meet the needs of market participants. Credit default swap contracts, for example, have too many moving parts for the cookie-cutter treatment.New product launches may not pep up the exchanges either. Most of the really successful new products of the past few years – insurance, carbon and freight derivatives – have built momentum over-the-counter, where comfort levels rise by discussing the risks. Old-fashioned, maybe, but sometimes it is good to talk.Post and read comments on this Lex
1016;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-06-09T07:08:39Z;CBOE announces deal with Korea Exchange;;The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the largest options exchange in the US, will on Monday strengthen its presence in Asia by signing an agreement with the Korea Exchange that sets a foundation for the joint development of listed options contracts.The agreement comes as the CBOE is expected to move towards an initial public offering following a $1bn deal last week to settle a long-running legal dispute with members of the Chicago Board of Trade, which had delayed its move to demutualise. The CBOE is one of the world’s last big member-owned exchanges.In the fast-consolidating global exchange sector, the CBOE is likely to be an enticing takeover target for a larger exchange, such as NYSE Euronext or Nasdaq OMX. International tie-ups such as the Korea Exchange deal make it an even more attractive proposition.The Korea Exchange, created in 2005 from the merger of the country’s three stock and futures markets, is the world’s second-largest derivatives exchange after the Chicago-based CME Group. Its listed options and futures on the Kospi 200 index are the world’s most actively traded derivatives contracts.Last year the CME Group signed a deal with the Korea Exchange to list the Kospi 200 futures contract on its electronic trading platform. While the listing was originally proposed to be rolled out this year, it may be delayed following a change in top management at the Korea Exchange in March.Bill Brodsky, CBOE chairman and chief executive, suggested that, with the legal wrangle with the CBOT behind it, the CBOE – the world’s fifth-largest derivatives exchange by volume – could now focus on positioning itself in the global derivatives industry.“The financial marketplace is increasingly becoming more global,” Mr Brodsky said. “Opportunities such as this to create cross-continent relationships are essential to growing our business.”Jung-hwan Lee, the Korea Exchange chairman and chief executive, praised the CBOE’s “considerable expertise and experiences in operating the derivatives markets”.Richard DuFour, CBOE executive vice-president, said the agreement could result in the development of new products within a year. He said: “We could trade something based on the Korean economy, they might trade something based on the US economy – there’s all kind of ways you can work together.”About 15-20 per cent of CBOE’s order flow comes from outside the US, mostly from Europe, with much smaller volumes from Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia.
1017;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;LSE lifts head’s pay to near industry parity;;Clara Furse, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, has been given a 16 per cent rise in her total pay package after concern that her salary had “fallen so far below” the median for her industry.The disclosure, in the LSE’s annual report published on Friday, came as shares in the LSE and some of its global rivals fell to fresh lows this year.Ms Furse will be paid a base salary of £540,000 this year, up from £529,000, and was awarded a bonus of more than £1m – equivalent to 215 per cent of salary.However, her salary remains below that of her deputy, Massimo Capuano, who earns €750,000 (£596,250).Ms Furse presided over a 29 per cent rise in adjusted earnings per share in the year to end-March. In the past year, the LSE attracted 84 stock market listings from 25 countries, more than the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Deutsche Börse combined.The LSE also completed its acquisition of Borsa Italiana.The LSE’s remuneration committee said it was “concerned . . . that the chief executive’s salary had fallen so far behind” an 80 per cent median for the industry that it uses as a benchmark that “it was appropriate to adjust her salary in a single move rather than phase the increases”.Ms Furse told analysts last month that the LSE’s performance continued to be “significantly better” than its big rivals – the CME Group, the Chicago-based futures exchange, Deutsche Börse’s Eurex derivatives arm and Liffe, the derivatives unit of NYSE Euronext.Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse chief executive, received a salary of €2.4m in 2007, with other benefits taking total compensation to €3.2m.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, is paid a salary of $548,077, with a bonus of $2m.CME Group paid Craig Donohue, its chief executive, $850,000, although other incentive-related compensation took his total package to $3.5m.The LSE on Friday said May equity trading volume was up 13 per cent year on year. However, analysts at Citi sounded a note of caution over the sector, pointing out that cash equities trading at Deutsche Börse fell by 27 per cent in May, compared with a year ago.The Börse’s shares are down 32 per cent so far this year, closing at €85.32 yesterday. CME Group, which relies on the derivatives business, has seen its shares fall by almost 42 per cent this year. The LSE’s shares are down almost 54 per cent.
1018;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-06-03T15:27:16Z;ICE in $625m deal to buy Creditex;;The competition between financial institutions to position themselves in the $62,200bn credit-default swap market grew more intense on Tuesday when InterContinental Exchange, which operates energy derivatives markets in the US and UK, announced a $625m deal to buy Creditex, an inter-dealer credit derivatives broker.Credit derivatives, which allow investors to make bets on the creditworthiness of baskets of corporate debt, have seen explosive growth in recent years. The notional value of CDSs – most of which are privately negotiated bilateral contracts – grew by 81 per cent last year. That has prompted fierce competition between traditional exchanges, dealers and inter-dealer brokers to establish themselves in the sector.ICE’s move came days after 11 of the world’s biggest investment banks announced plans to create the first central clearer for credit derivative contracts by September. The CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, which is also trying to build its presence in the CDS market, acquired a pricing information service for CDS contracts in March.In part, these initiatives come in response to pressure from regulators, who are stepping up pressure on the industry to reduce the systemic risk in a sector that fuelled the global credit crunch.The Financial Stability Forum and the New York Federal Reserve are among those organisations demanding improvements in clearing and reduced counterparty risk in the CDS market. ICE, which operates clearing houses in the US and Canada, and recently established a clearing house in London to compete with LCH.Clearnet, sees itself as well positioned to meet these concerns.“I think everybody would suggest there are structural problems in the CDS space that are inhibiting its growth,” Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE chief executive, told the FT. “People that can solve those structural problems can release a lot of growth potential and help with the balance-sheet issues within the dealers.”Mr Sprecher has identified strategic acquisitions as a way to enable ICE hold its own as the fast-consolidating world of global exchanges, which is moving towards the creation of “super exchanges” such as Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext and the CME Group, which is trying to complete its acquisition of Nymex, ICE’s closest rival in energy derivatives trading.Mr Sprecher surprised the exchange world last year when he entered a bidding war with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to take over the Chicago Board of Trade. Although he lost out on that occasion, the ICE chief has completed a string of acquisitions, including the former New York Board of Trade and Yellowjacket, an electronic platform for over-the-counter trading that is dominant in weather contracts.ICE already clears over-the-counter contracts in energy products such as natural gas and electricity. Such deals accounted for 39 per cent or $80m of revenues in the first quarter of this year. ICE said on Tuesday it intends to use Creditex’s OTC trading model to expand into inter-dealer OTC markets beyond credit derivatives.
1019;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;Chicago exchanges strike $1bn settlement;;The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options exchange, took a big step towards an initial public offering on Monday by striking a $1bn settlement to end a long-running legal dispute with members of the Chicago Board of Trade.The CBOE was created by the CBOT in 1973, a legacy that left many CBOT members holding trading rights in the CBOE. Those members who have maintained their trading rights argued they were entitled to a share of the CBOE when it demutualises.However, the CBOT was taken over last year by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a development that the CBOE argued eliminated the CBOT members’ eligibility to the exercise rights. The issue has been before a Delaware court since 2006.The move will allow Bill Brodsky, the CBOE’s chairman and chief executive, to fulfil his longstanding ambition of transforming one of the world’s last remaining big members-only exchanges. The CBOE declared itself a “for-profit” organisation in 2006, but a proposed demutualisation – the next step towards an IPO – has been on hold pending the court case.Under the terms of the deal, the CBOT members will receive an 18 per cent stake in the CBOE and a cash payment of $300m. Given that the CBOE is valued at about $4bn, the settlement is worth more than $1bn.“Attempting to reach agreement on this contentious issue has been difficult,” the CBOE said in a statement. The exchange said it had opted to avoid “a protracted legal battle [that] could significantly impede CBOE’s strategic options in a rapidly changing environment”.While the case could have dragged on for up to three years, the CBOE said, the settlement should be finalised within six-12 months.The statement hinted that as well as demutualising, the CBOE would also seek to be bought by a big global exchange group. “Many of our competitors are now partnered with larger, well-funded entities,” it noted. “In this environment, we believe that ongoing litigation would exact an unquantifiable cost to CBOE and its seat owners.”Brendan Caldwell, chief executive of Caldwell Investment Management, one of the biggest CBOE members with 45 seats, told the FT he favours an IPO followed by a takeover by a larger exchange such as NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX or the LSE.CBOE members will vote on the settlement on June 11. Mr Caldwell said that although some CBOE members felt the CBOT claimants deserved nothing, he expected little opposition to the settlement.The CBOT members’ decision to settle may have been influenced by the decline in the share price of their parent company. The CME’s shares have dropped from $710 in late December to $412.10 by Monday’s close of trading.
1020;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-06-01T17:05:00Z;CME move for Nymex likely to be blocked;;The CME Group’s attempt to enhance its position as the world’s biggest financial exchange by taking over Nymex is looking increasingly likely to be derailed by shareholder opposition.Any deal must be approved by at least three-quarters of Nymex’s membership, meaning opponents of the bid need only secure 205 of 816 votes to block the takeover, a figure both activists and independent observers say is within their grasp.The deal would create a company that controls about 98 per cent of US-listed futures and offers contracts on a wide range of underlying commodities such as interest rates, foreign exchange, stock indices, oil, metals and agricultural products.While many members at the New York energy exchange feel the Chicago group’s offer to buy them out for $612,000 per seat is too low, the target company’s shareholders are unhappy about the level of the overall cash-and-shares bid, which has dropped from $11.3bn or more than $119 per share when it was first proposed in January to $8.8bn or about $93 per share due to falls in the CME’s share price.Gary Glass, who is spearheading one of several shareholder groups opposed to the current terms, said the bid would be voted down unless it was raised to near the level of the original proposal.“If the CME wants Nymex, they have got to pay,” he said. “If they don’t pay, there’s no way this deal’s closing whatsoever.”Those familiar with the CME’s thinking say there may be some wiggle-room for a relatively modest improvement in the offer, but warn it will not come close to what the opposition groups are demanding.“Will the CME come up with another billion dollars? Absolutely not,” said one former CME board member.“If I were still on the board and the only way to get this done was another billion, I’d say: ‘we’re out of here, have a nice life’. And CME is certainly prepared to walk away.”The CME’s move for Nymex had long been expected in the industry, especially after the New York exchange moved its electronic trading in futures and options to the CME’s system in 2006.Other potential bidders for Nymex failed to emerge in spite of speculation that the CME could face rival bids.The bid – agreed by the management of both exchanges in March – is the latest in a string of mergers in the exchange world in recent years.The CME itself is the product of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s $11bn takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade last year.As well as disgruntlement with the CME bid, the shareholder resentment also reflects the fraught relationship between the members and Nymex’s management, who stand to receive $60m in pay-offs if the deal is consummated.Richard Schaeffer, Nymex chairman, and James Newsome, president, had been due to face members at a meeting Tuesday, but last Friday the event was hastily rescheduled for June 19.
1021;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-05-28T22:58:17Z;Banks launch central clearer for derivatives;;Efforts to tackle the risk surrounding privately negotiated credit derivatives will take a step forward on Thursday when 11 of the world’s biggest investment banks announce the creation of the first central clearer for the opaque contracts by September.The absence of a central clearer has made such contracts risky because there is no guarantee that parties will pay out.This systemic risk has fuelled the global credit crunch, prompting regulators to step up pressure on banks to show they are trying to make the system more dependable.Credit derivatives allow investors to make bets on the creditworthiness of baskets of corporate debt. Global growth in the notional value of such contracts grew by 81 per cent last year to a value of $62,200bn.Credit derivatives contracts are predominantly negotiated privately between traders who rely on their assessments of each other’s ability to pay under the terms of the contract. A clearer uses funds contributed by traders to guarantee against default.“The credit crisis has definitely heightened interest in this kind of solution among the regulators,” said Kevin McClear, chief operating officer of The Clearing Corporation, the Chicago-based institution backed by the banks that will act as the new clearer. “We don’t think there’s a better approach to reducing systemic risk.”The need to act fast to pre-empt stiffer regulation in the wake of the credit crisis has given impetus to a proposal that has been 18 months in the making. It has also been accelerated by attempts by other clearers, such as LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearer, and the CME Group, the Chicago-based derivatives exchange, to muscle in on the business potential of clearing such over-the-counter derivatives.Thursday’s proposal is the result of an agreement between The Clearing Corporation (also known as CCorp) and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the New York-based clearing group.CCorp’s backers – including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley – will establish a guarantee fund to cover losses if any firm should fail.While Thursday’s announcement is sure to be welcomed, questions remain about whether the proposal will raise industry standards or if it is largely cosmetic.

1023;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-05-02T21:27:12Z;ICE chief looks for acquisition targets;;Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of Intercontinental­ Exchange, said on Friday he was looking for acquisition targets as he reported record profits from the electronic commodities exchange.He said that the demand for commodities would only continue to increase because of the growth of the middle classes in emerging economies, and that ICE was “very focused on a number of opportunities in new and underserved markets”.“This new middle class is driving increased demand for products such as sugar and cotton, which are traded on ICE,” he said. “I believe demand for commodities will only increase during our lifetime, as this new middle class develops.”Acquisitions could help ICE hold its own as the fast-consolidating world of exchanges moves towards the creation of “super exchanges” such as Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext and the CME Group, which is in the process of taking over Nymex, ICE’s closest rival in energy derivatives trading.Mr Sprecher surprised the exchange world last year when he entered a bidding war with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to take over the Chicago Board of Trade.Although he lost out on that occasion, the ICE chief has completed a string of acquisitions, including the former New York Board of Trade and, most recently, Yellowjacket, an electronic platform for over-the-counter trading that is dominant in weather contracts.His comments came as ICE reported record profits and revenues in the first quarter, as rising commodity prices and volatility in energy and agricultural markets prompted record quarterly volume of more than 100m contracts.The exchange group’s net income in the first quarter was $92.3m, or $1.29 per share, up from $55.6m or 80 cents per share a year ago.Consolidated revenues increased by 64 per cent to $207.2m, from $126.6m in the first quarter of 2007. The period marked the ninth ninth consecutive quarter in which ICE has posted record revenues.ICE’s share price had increased 1 per cent to $161.05 by early afternoon in New York.ICE is establishing its own clearing house in London to compete with LCH.Clearnet. The exchange group plans to open the clearing house for business this summer, pending approval from the UK’s Financial Services Authority.
1024;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;CME targets sovereign wealth funds;;"The CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, is targeting sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East and central banks in Asia as its next big source of growth in volumes, Craig Donohue, chief executive, said.Mr Donohue told the Financial Times that the CME had established a dedicated marketing team aimed at explaining to such funds how to access the exchange’s products and use its listed financial instruments. “We’re doing that on a broad basis across all the sovereign wealth funds and the major Asian central banks,” he said.Mr Donohue said that in recent months the sales and marketing team had ramped up its outreach to sovereign wealth fund investors. “We’re actually adding to our staffing in that area because of demand,” he said. Mr Donohue added that he and other senior executives had also been involved in the sales effort.The CME’s volumes have spiked in recent years as it has embarked on a wave of acquisitions.The exchange has also been boosted by secular growth in derivatives volumes fuelled by algorithmic trading and hedge funds. But drawing more trade from sovereign wealth funds could help soothe concerns about whether the CME can maintain the fast pace of growth in the long term.Although sovereign wealth funds are already trading at the CME, volumes are relatively small. “But they’re becoming an emerging source of growth for us,” Mr Donohue said.He characterised the rise of sovereign wealth funds and Asian central banks as the same kind of opportunity for growth in the coming decade that hedge funds offered in the past 10 years. “It’s significant in the same way that hedge funds have become increasingly significant,” he said.Mr Donohue said the marketing campaign found that sovereign wealth funds and Asian central banks were most interested in the exchange’s fixed-income, interest rate and foreign currency products.But he said the addition of Nymex’s energy products gave a wider range of financial instruments that could be attractive to such funds.Mr Donohue spoke after CME reported first-quarter earnings that hit a record but missed Wall Street’s expectations.Total revenues were $625m, up 88 per cent from the same period last year; net income rose 118 per cent from last year to $284m; and earnings per share rose 42 per cent from 2007 to $5.25."
1025;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-04-22T16:54:06Z;Mixed reception for derivatives clearing;;Antonio Zoido, chief executive of Spain’s Bolsa y Mercados Espanoles, seemed frustrated at a recent London conference.As the world’s regulators struggle with how to bring more transparency to the over-the-counter derivatives markets, why were they not studying the exchanges, such as his?“I haven’t heard anyone say ‘Hey, why don’t we pay some attention to the organised markets?’ I find myself a little isolated.” Mr Zoido said, making the point that exchanges provide price discovery even in market turmoil. Yet he is by no means isolated. Exchanges are falling over each other to persuade anyone who may be listening that their model of on-exchange clearing could be one way to reduce unwanted counterparty risks associated with the bilaterally-negotiated OTC derivatives markets.The beauty of organised exchanges, they say, is that a clearing house steps in and takes on the counterparty risk, rather than forcing each participant to carry extra risk capital on their balance sheet to guard against default by the opposing side in a transaction.On Tuesday, the CME Group, the largest US futures exchange, could not resist mentioning how its record first quarter earnings illustrated “the benefits of the exchange model for managing risks in diverse global markets”.The question is, what role can, and should exchanges play in the OTC credit markets?Gerald Corrigan a former president of the New York Federal Reserve, suggests thinking about “some sort of automated clearing house”, especially for credit default swaps (CDS) contracts, where valuation and risk issues are still fraught.The first problem is that OTC contracts are far from standardised, in contrast to on-exchange products that are cleared through an exchange’s clearing house. They are often specially tailored by two parties to meet a specific requirement.Pascale Scatozza, senior product manager for BNP Paribas Securities Services, says: “I think the initiative is good in the sense that the industry needs to have a central system for the clearing of these products. The only issue I see is that we are in the OTC derivatives world so each contract is different, it’s a bilateral agreement between two entities.”Second, bank’s prime brokerage businesses already make a lot of money from clearing bilaterally negotiated OTC products and would likely resist any move by exchanges to move too far into their territory.Liffe, the derivatives unit of NYSE Euronext, has since 2005 offered an OTC clearing service for equity derivatives known as “Bclear”.The CME will next quarter launch its first foray into clearing of OTC interest rate swaps under an umbrella OTC clearing service known as Clearing 360.That may help explain the emergence of an initiative from Chicago, where a group of investment banks, including Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, are developing a system that would allow institutions with strong capital bases and credible trading histories to clear trades in the CDS markets with a central counterparty.The plan would use The Clearing Corporation, once briefly clearer for the ill-fated attempt by Eurex, the Frankfurt-based derivatives exchange, to take on the Chicago Board of Trade’s Treasury bond futures in 2002.The Corporation is in talks with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which clears and settles all US stock trades, about offering common customers of the two institutions central counterparty guarantee services. The DTCC already brings some expertise to the project, having started automatic matching of CDS trades in 2003 under its DerivServ unit – taking advantage of an increasing desire of OTC participants to outsource the back office matching and trade confirmation functions.The reaction to the idea of a central clearing house among credit derivatives players beyond the group of dealer banks involved in the initiative has been mixed, however, with some highly sceptical about its workability or likelihood of success.The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a powerful lobby group for the interests of the OTC derivatives industry, has in the past opposed any centralised clearing for these markets.However, ISDA’s position seems to have mellowed somewhat and while the body is still not likely to support the initiative, it will not actively campaign against it. Robert Pickel, chief executive of ISDA, says that it is not clear there is a problem in need of a solution, let alone whether that solution is centralised clearing.He says the industry has grown up with the protection of the ISDA Master Agreement: the overriding contract common to all OTC derivatives that governs collateral arrangements and the cancelling out, or netting, of directly equivalent or mirrored exposures.“What we’ve constructed in the ISDA Master Agreement is an alternative to clearing and could be a complement to it,” Mr Pickel says. He says the protections it gives are real, effective and fully tested.Some ISDA members are more strongly opposed to central clearing, in part because it could take liquidity from participants who are denied access, or because it would concentrate all counterparty risk in a single entity.Tom Jasper, chief executive of Primus, a company that exists only to sell default protection on mainly corporate credit says that OTC markets have served derivatives well for more than 20 years and should not be dismantled in a hurry.Mr Jasper says he is sceptical, warning those involved to beware of unintended consequences. “We have to be sure we’re solving the problems we set out to solve and that we are not creating other problems further down the track,” he says.The business model of Primus and a number of other similar players relies on not having to post collateral, while according to analysts ordinary non-financial companies who buy or sell credit protection for hedging purposes also do not post collateral. This aspect would be likely to exclude such players from a centrally cleared market.Other traditional debt investors, particularly some of those who do not currently use credit derivatives to a great degree, see merit in the scheme.Dan Fuss, vice-chairman of Boston-based Loomis Sayles, says centralised clearing would reduce counterparty risk by creating an entity that was supported by the 10 or 12 different banks behind it. This would be an improvement for most investors who trade credit derivatives with probably only three to five different counterparties, he says.
1026;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;Surge in futures trading boosts CME;;CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, reported record first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, reflecting the company’s growth through acquisition and the surge in derivatives trading as equity and debt markets continue to be dogged by volatility.The CME’s total revenues for the quarter were $625m, up 88 per cent from the same period last year, while net income rose by 118 per cent from last year to $284m. Earnings per share for the quarter were up 42 per cent to $5.25.Those figures reflect solely the operations of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and not the Chicago Board of Trade, which the CME purchased last year.Taking both exchanges together, and removing several extraordinary charges, the CME said earnings per share were at $5.39, but excluding a tax benefit it received from the state of Illinois, the figure would have been $4.67 per share.Analysts had been expecting earnings per share of about $4.81. The CME’s share price fell 4.3 per cent in pre-market trading to $501.As well as its purchase of the CBOT, the CME has in the past year completed an equity swap with BM&F, the Brazilian exchange that is the world’s fourth largest market for listed futures, and has bid to take over Nymex, the New York energy exchange.
1027;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-04-18T23:45:59Z;LSE ponders best direction;;Since Clara Furse, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, saw off a hostile takeover bid from Nasdaq in February last year, its business – if not its share price – has powered ahead.Trading volumes have risen 86 per cent in the past 11 months, in spite of a challenge from Chi-X, an upstart electronic exchange.Efforts to lure foreign companies to list in London have paid off handsomely. Soon, the LSE will welcome its first Mongolian company.But this week, Ms Furse sounded anything but pleased. She warned that London’s long-cherished model of open and competitive clearing was under threat as rival exchanges Liffe and the US-based InterContinental Exchange moved to set up their own clearing arrangements.Clearing is an essential part of how most stocks and many derivatives contracts change hands, guaranteeing that parties to a trade do not default.The reason for Ms Furse’s concern lies partly in the US, where the CME Group – formed from the combination of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade – owns its own clearer. Such a structure usually gives an exchange a higher earnings multiple than one that does not.Deutsche Boerse, the LSE rival, also operates a so-called “vertical silo” model, combining a cash equities exchange, derivatives business and clearer all under one roof.Yet the LSE uses an external clearer, LCH.Clearnet, which is owned jointly by several large banks, Euro­next and Euroclear, Europe’s largest provider of settlement services. It clears for the LSE, Liffe, Euronext and the London Metals Exchange.The LSE trades on a price/earnings ratio of 17.9 – trailing the CME at 33.4 and slightly behind the German bourse at 19.Its shares have also underperformed those of its rivals in the past three months, falling by more than 27 per cent, compared with a drop of 8.8 per cent at NYSE Euronext. The LSE fell 17p to £11.95 on Friday.The European Commission has thrown its weight behind the expansion of the “horizontal” model embodied by the LSE approach under a “code of conduct” that the industry is – with limited results – trying to implement.The idea is to offer clearing choice, to bring down clearing costs for market users and to create a lower cost European capital market.The opposite model is developing among US futures exchanges. Liffe and ICE have been encouraged to move to vertical clearing by the approval by the US Department of Justice’s approval last year of the Chicago exchange merger.Hugh Freedberg, Liffe chief executive, says: “At the end of the day, it’s the CME and Eurex (Deutsche Boerse’s derivatives unit) that we are competing with. We have to be able to do so without having one arm tied behind our back.”The LSE’s concern is that, with signs of the same shift in Europe, even if only affecting futures exchanges, it may have to rethink its clearing model. It is calling for the industry to pause and reflect.Yet at the same time, Ms Furse has the option of building a vertical silo of her own. The LSE’s acquisition of Borsa Italiana last year gave it two important post-trade assets: Cassa di Compensazione e Garanizia, a clearing house, and Monti Titoli, a settlement system.The LSE has just begun a “strategic review” of its clearing arrangements. The question is, which way will Ms Furse jump?John Serocold, a director at the London Investment Banking Association, says: “I think they are genuinely looking at what to do next. But what is at stake here is nothing less than fundamental, structural reform for the UK securities market.”
1028;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-04-15T21:47:07Z;LSE chief warns over ‘vertical silos’;;Clara Furse, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, has warned of a “domino effect” of spreading anti-competitive behaviour if UK regulators do not intervene to force competition in the exchange clearing business.The call shows how concern about exchanges’ embrace of “vertical silo” business models, whereby they own or control their own clearing houses, has moved to Europe after plaguing the US in recent months.Competition authorities in Brussels have brokered a voluntary “code of conduct” among exchanges, clearers and settlement systems intended to make them “inter-operable”, promoting competition and reducing post-trade costs across borders. However, the process appears to be floundering as two derivatives exchanges have moved to set up their own clearers.The LSE, which clears through LCH.Clearnet, appears concerned that while such exchanges are not covered by the code, their action could force all exchanges to follow a vertical silo model – leaving the LSE’s “horizontal” model exposed.Critics of vertical silos – often the large banks that are among the biggest users of exchanges – say ownership of a clearing house gives an exchange control over the liquidity in contracts it offers – keeping competitors out.Writing in Wednesday’s Financial Times, Ms Furse criticises recent moves by Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext, to distance itself from LCH.Clearnet and set up another clearer, as well as plans by the US-owned futures exchange InterContinental Exchange to set up its own clearer in London.She said both moves were largely driven by pressure from the US, where the CME Group – which owns its own clearer – had been “Hoovering up derivatives business, buoyed by a high price-earnings ratio, a function of its own position of dominance in US derivatives”.On Tuesday, the Office of Fair Trading submitted to the Treasury the results of a nine-month probe into ICE’s plans.
1029;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-03-31T21:22:58Z;Merging the SEC and CFTC;;The boat is rocking. Shares in CME Group, Chicago’s futures exchange giant, were down 4.4 per cent at one point on Monday. Investors were digesting the Treasury’s call to merge the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Proposals to unify Washington’s “alphabet soup” of regulators are nothing new. Back in 1993, Jack Sandner, then-chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, called for seven agencies, including the CFTC and SEC, to be consolidated under one cabinet-level department. With the likes of hedge funds speculating in both securities and futures markets, a unified SEC-CFTC could make for greater efficiency.On the surface, Hank Paulson’s blueprint looks unthreatening to the likes of the CME. He wants the SEC to move towards the CFTC’s principles-based approach to regulation. Moreover, the Treasury’s proposal is just that. Substantial change to the status quo would only come after a lengthy process of lobbying and congressional turf wars.For its part, the CME rightly points out that the SEC and CFTC monitor different markets populated by different participants. Not all its arguments offered in recently are convincing, though. It is odd, for example, that a company which has just completed one big acquisition and is pushing another should argue, with reference to a SEC-CFTC tie-up, that “most mergers don’t work”.The real concern for the CME’s investors is not the content of the blueprint per se, but the impetus it imparts to the regulation debate. The CME’s share price has not yet recovered from February’s plunge, when department of justice concerns over the US futures exchanges’ vertical clearing model emerged.The CME has thrived and expanded under the current regulatory environment. A change to this, if it happens, is unpredictable in nature and far off. But the unfolding debate will inject volatility into the stock.Post and read comments on this Lex
1030;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-03-26T20:05:17Z;Bovespa and BM&F agree exchange deal;;Bovespa Holding, which controls the São Paulo Stock Exchange, and the BM&F, Brazil’s main futures exchange, on Wednesday gained approval from their boards for a merger that will create the second-largest exchange in the Americas.The two exchanges had announced last month they had entered talks, marking a further step in the consolidation of the world’s stock and futures exchanges, following a flurry of recent activity.Last year, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange bought the Chicago Board of Trade for $11bn and the enlarged CME group this month finalised a deal to buy Nymex, the New York energy exchange, for $9.4bn.However, it remains to be seen whether the two Brazilian exchanges will regain portfolio investors’ confidence after a rocky ride for the groups’ shares.Both exchanges demutualised through IPOs within the past six months. Shares immediately jumped, coinciding with the peak of the Brazilian market, but have since fallen.Low trading volumes, a sharp downturn in the number of IPOs and international market conditions have weighed heavily. Bovespa is highly dependent on foreign investors, who were responsible for some 70 per cent of IPOs purchases last year.Bovespa Holding’s IPO in November saw shares debut at R$23 and leap more than 50 per cent on the first day. Since then, they have dropped and were trading at R$26.60 on Wednesday. BM&F’s shares were launched at R$20 and had a similar trajectory. On Wednesday they were trading at R$17.60.“To improve performance, the exchanges will need to increase trading and revenues. To do this, they need to offer a wider range of products, in areas such as equity derivatives and options, and stimulate liquidity in mid- and small-cap cash-traded shares,” said Ricardo Kobayashi, co-head of asset management at UBS Pactual in Rio de Janeiro.The exchanges said the merger would squeeze expenses by 25 per cent up to 2010. “That looks achievable, if aggressive,” Mr Kobayashi said.Shareholders of BM&F and Bovespa will each own 50 per cent of the new company and Bovespa’s shareholders will receive a R$1.24bn ($715m) payout to compensate for its higher market value.The deal still requires shareholder approval, likely to be decided in late April, and the approval of market and antitrust regulators. If all goes well, the new company should be operational by the end of May and trade under the name Nova Bolsa.
1031;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-03-26T00:42:44Z;CME buys UK credit data group;;The CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, is to acquire Credit Market Analysis, a provider of credit derivatives market data, in the latest move by a derivatives exchange to establish a stronger foothold in the over-the-counter market.The move comes as several of the CME’s rival exchanges, including NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Börse and Nasdaq OMX, also target the OTC derivatives market for their future expansion.The Bank for International Settlements estimates the notional amount of all OTC contracts worldwide at $516,000bn. The CME said the move to buy London-based CMA would give it greater exposure to the rapidly growing $46,000bn credit derivatives market.The push by exchanges to enter the OTC market has been driven by the development of technology that can be used for exchange-based trading and for the execution of OTC transactions electronically, as opposed to through brokers by phone. The exchange-traded sector itself is undergoing transformation as consolidation sweeps the sector, with a series of mergers between exchanges across the world taking place in recent years.The CME has been one of the leaders in this consolidation drive, and was itself formed by the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade last year. Earlier this month, it agreed to buy energy exchange Nymex for $9.4bn in cash and shares. That deal will create a company that controls about 98 per cent of US-listed futures and offers contracts on a wide range of underlying commodities and events such as interest rates, foreign exchange, stock indices, oil, metals and agricultural products.Regulators and market participants are also grappling with the best way to value a range of complex fixed income instruments such as credit default swaps and mortgage-backed securities, which have wreaked havoc in the markets since the middle of last year.Problems with controlling and determining the extent of exposure to such instruments have contributed to huge write-downs at investment banks and have led to several hedge fund blow-ups.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive officer, said: “It’s impossible to overestimate the importance of accurate, timely and reliable sources of market data to the smooth functioning of financial markets, especially in today’s environment.”Following the deal, CMA will remain based in London. Laurent Paulhac will remain chief executive.
1032;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-03-25T19:09:00Z;Chicago’s star on the rise;;Older members of Chicago’s financial exchange community recall when their peers in New York looked down on them as unsophisticated traders in agricultural products such as pork bellies, cattle, corn and wheat.If any such sentiment still lingered in Wall Street, it will have evaporated last week after the CME Group struck a deal to buy Nymex, the New York energy exchange, for $9.4bn.The deal will make the CME – formed last year from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s $11bn purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade – the largest financial exchange in the world, controlling 98 per cent of US listed futures.Although the CME/CBoT deal was seen as a defensive move to ward off potential predators, it also bolstered the city’s standing, turning Chicago into a serious global player. The Nymex move has underlined that and cemented Chicago’s position as a global centre of risk-taking and risk-management.This reputation rests on its range of derivatives exchanges, with CME at the top of a scale that also includes the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options exchange, and smaller but more unique entities such as the Chicago Climate Exchange, the US’s first greenhouse-gas emissions exchange.The city also hosts the headquarters of large insurance companies such as Aon State Farm and Allstate.In recent months, while Wall Street has writhed in the agony of turbulent equity markets and an ongoing credit crunch, Chicago’s exchanges have been booming, as investors look to hedge their investments or bet on further volatility. That has augmented a trend of fast growth in options and futures trading, whose volumes are expanding by about 25 per cent a year.While the city’s financial star is on the rise, some locals say the traditional caricature was somewhat valid. “Historically, Chicago has not been very plugged into the economy of the wider world,” says Donald Jacobs, dean emeritus of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, Chicago. “New York looked to Europe, San Francisco looked to Asia, while here in Chicago – being in the middle of the country – we were mainly looking at cornfields.”But that very perspective gave the city its focus. Richard Sandor, chairman and chief executive of the Chicago Climate Exchange, says Chicago’s success at establishing itself as the centre of risk management grew from the inherently risky grain-trading business, with its dependence on Midwest weather conditions.With the invention in the 1970s of financial futures – of which Mr Sandor was one of the principal architects – Chicago grew beyond its agricultural roots. Trading in products such as interest-rate futures and volatility options now dwarfs the volumes in agricultural derivatives.“New York became the home of investment capital, San Francisco the home of venture capital, and Chicago the home of speculative capital,” Mr Sandor says.While Chicago remains very much America’s second financial city, the CME-Nymex deal has reinvigorated a rivalry with New York. “It drove [former NYSE chief executive] Dick Grasso up the wall that Chicago was so successful in derivatives and he was never able to move into that world,” says a former CME board member. “As for Nymex, whatever pride those guys in New York have, they’re going to have to swallow. They’re becoming part of something else that they’re really tangential to.”Chicago’s ascent has also sparked a battle among media outlets to increase their business coverage from the city. CNBC, Bloomberg, CNN, Fox Business Network and other broadcasters are setting up operations in a new media centre on the CME’s trading floor. Business Week recently launched BW Chicago, its first monthly magazine aimed at a specific city.“Because of its markets, Chicago has some of the leading indicators that we want to focus on,” says Brian Jones, Fox Business’s senior vice-president for news.The fact that the CME secured the CBOT in the face of a rival bid from the Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange helped retain the city’s role as an international centre for derivatives trading. “Had we not come together, there was no guarantee that either one of these institutions would have remained in Chicago,” says Terry Duffy, CME chairman.Many in the industry say the CME’s ability to gain a foothold in the backyard of exchange groups such as NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX resulted from its early embrace of trading technology and the development of new financial products.“We’re not just this little Chicago exchange any more,” Mr Duffy says. “We’ve done a lot of work as far as innovation goes, otherwise we’d still be trading butter and eggs.”
1033;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T08:01:05+0000;Relief follows CME-Nymex deal;;"Amid the self-congratulations on Monday as senior executives from the CME Group and Nymex discussed their $9.4bn cash-and-shares takeover deal, there was a strong undercurrent of relief.Richard Schaeffer, Nymex’s chairman, said the CME Group was “the right partner at the right time”. A less charitable version might have cast the CME as Nymex’s only option not to be left out of the rampant consolidation that has engulfed the exchange world in recent years.While the threat always hung over the talks that the Chicago exchange might choose to walk away from the deal, leaving the negotiating table was never a serious option for Nymex.The New York energy exchange had been publicly batting its eyelids at possible partners for some time before the CME confirmed in January that it was interested. Many Nymex members had been hoping another bidder would emerge to force the CME into a tug-of-love, perhaps the NYSE or the Intercontinental Exchange.The ICE upset the CME’s plans to acquire the Chicago Board of Trade last year by counter-bidding, pushing up the price the CME had to pay to secure the CBOT.This time, however, other possible purchasers seemed unwilling to scrap with the CME for the chance to buy Nymex; at least in part because it would require them to disentangle Nymex from the CME’s electronic trading platform, which it has used since 2006.In the absence of any other offers, Nymex was forced to accept the CME’s original terms, even though they valued Monday’s deal at almost $2bn less than what was first offered, due to falls in the CME’s share price.“Nymex has capitulated,” said one former CME senior official. “They’re selling control over their destiny.”In the seven weeks since the two exchanges first announced they were in exclusive talks, the agreement has been hit by a series of complications.The Department of Justice recommended last month that clearing be separated from futures exchanges on antitrust grounds, a move that would strip both the CME and Nymex of one of the most profitable parts of their businesses.Although the DoJ’s recommendation is almost certain to go nowhere in the short-term, it unsettled investors and sent CME’s share price into a tailspin. A plan by 12 financial institutions to set up an exchange to rival CME’s dominance of US listed futures also cast a shadow over the company. Worried they were selling at the wrong time, some activists among Nymex’s members threatened a revolt if the deal were not suitably attractive.While there may well be grumblings, most industry analysts expect that, in the absence of any other
real option, Nymex shareholders will accept the deal.One concession Nymex did wring from the negotiations was an assurance that the New York exchange would retain its Manhattan trading floor until 2012. Formerly, the CME had only pledged to keep a floor in the metropolitan area. However, Craig Donohue, the CME’s chief executive, issued a slightly ominous caveat on Monday, saying the floor would be maintained “as long as it is profitable”.That move was important in securing support from Chuck Schumer, the Democratic senator from New York whose backing will be useful when the deal goes to Washington for approval.In the longer term, most in the industry expect Nymex to lose its identity as it is swallowed into the ever-
expanding CME.“The CME has reached out and tapped the Nymex on its shoulder and said: ‘you’re the prettiest girl, we want
to dance with you’,” said
one former CME board
member.“But at some point the Nymex is just going to become another in a long line of pretty girls that the CME has chosen.”"
1034;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
1035;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T08:01:05+0000;CME completes $9.4bn Nymex deal;;The CME Group is set to enhance its position as the world’s biggest exchange after finalising a deal to buy Nymex for $9.4bn in cash and shares, providing a rare bright spot on a grim day for financial markets.The deal will create a company that controls about 98 per cent of US-listed futures and offers contracts on a wide range of underlying commodities and events such as interest rates, foreign exchange, stock indices, oil, metals and agricultural products.The agreement – which caps seven weeks of negotiations – is the latest in a string of mergers in the exchange world, which has been gripped by furious consolidation in recent years. The CME itself is the product of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s $11bn takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade last year. Its purchase of Nymex had long been expected in the industry, especially after the New York exchange moved its electronic trading in futures and options to the CME’s system in 2006. Other potential bidders for the Nymex failed to emerge in spite of persistent market rumours that the CME could face rival bids.The takeover will have to be approved by regulators in Washington. Although the CME’s purchase of the CBOT was waved through last year, approval for the Nymex deal is not a foregone conclusion.The US Department of Justice recently recommended that clearing be split off from exchanges on antitrust grounds.Nevertheless, Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, sounded confident of securing approval for the takeover. “Obviously, we prepare well for these kinds of situations,” he said, adding that he expected the deal to close in six to nine monthsChuck Schumer, the Democratic senator from New York, backed the takeover, calling it “very good news for both New York and America on a day when the financial markets are reeling”.The deal values each Nymex share at $100 compared with its $59 in November when it floated.Both exchanges saw their share prices fall yesterday, dragged down by the general gloom in the financial sector. CME shares were trading 14.4 per cent lower by early afternoon in New York at $416.14 – a 52-week low – while Nymex was down 15.4 per cent at $80.65.
1036;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-03-07T02:03:24Z;Nymex forges alliance with clearing house LCH;;Nymex, the US energy exchange, is joining forces with London’s LCH.Clearnet in an alliance that could pave the way for further transatlantic consolidation in the derivatives exchange business.Under the terms of the arrangement, Nymex will offer a new range of over-the-counter and futures products for clearing through LCH.Clearnet.The partnership should allow customers to trade a wider range of oil and gas contracts.Stock exchange consolidation has gathered pace recently with the formation of NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX.But the derivatives business has been slower to consolidate across borders.Within the US, however, several deals have been done or are in the pipeline that could see the number of derivatives trading venues fall.Nymex is in talks with the CME Group regarding a possible merger that would form by far the largest exchange group in the world, with a near monopoly on the trading of US listed futures contracts.The US Department of Justice wrote to the Treasury last month suggesting clearing be separated from futures exchanges.Although not a direct response to the CME/Nymex move, the letter prompted billions of dollars to be wiped off the value of the two exchange groups as investors feared they could be divested of their highly profitable clearing houses.The initial mix of products under the Nymex deal with LCH.Clearnet will include global benchmark oil contracts, including WTI, Brent and Gasoil, as well as several natural gas and electricity contracts. The contracts are expected to begin trading and clearing in mid-2008, pending regulatory approval.The contracts will be listed for trading on the CME Globex electronic trading system and on Nymex ClearPort for submission for clearing. They will be cleared by LCH.Clearnet using existing technology.Richard Schaeffer, Nymex chairman, said: “The benefits to clearing firms, commercial users, and market makers will be significant, including margin and other capital efficiencies, access to established global markets, an increased product slate and the ability to transact business virtually 24 hours a day.”
1037;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-28T21:16:55Z;Nasdaq OMX to join OTC commodity race;;Nasdaq OMX, the exchange group, is to invest in a platform for trading over-the-counter commodity contracts, in the latest example of the convergence of OTC and exchange-traded markets.Nasdaq has agreed to invest up to $7.5m in Agora-X, a subsidiary of risk management group FCStone, which is developing an electronic communications network for institutional trading in OTC commodity contracts.Nasdaq plans to acquire a 20 per cent equity interest in Agora-X, which is expected to launch in mid-2008. The trading platform will initially handle energy and agricultural commodities options, as well as commodity swaps, with the scope to add other OTC derivatives. These OTC options are settled in cash and based on the settlement price of a similar exchange-traded futures contract.Brent Weisenborn, chief executive officer of Agora-X, said: “The global trading community has seen tremendous growth in OTC commodities and related derivatives, but the technology hasn’t kept pace.”Exchanges including NYSE Euronext, CME Group, Deutsche Börse and now Nasdaq are targeting the OTC derivatives market for expansion.The Bank for International Settlements estimates the notional amount of OTC contracts worldwide at $516,000bn.The push by exchanges to enter the OTC market has been spurred on by the development of technology that can be used for exchange-based trading and for execution of OTC transactions electronically, as opposed to through brokers by phone.NYSE Euronext this week said it planned to join up with SuperDerivatives, a US options pricing specialist. Under the terms of the deal, NYSE Euronext’s international derivative arm, Liffe, will provide SuperDerivatives users with direct access to its Liffe Connect electronic trading platform.The partnership is designed to give users the ability to price, analyse and trade exchange-traded Liffe products alongside OTC products, in theory allowing them greater flexibility in choosing the appropriate market for their goals.CME Group’s effort to acquire the Nymex energy exchange is thought to be partly inspired by a desire to buy ClearPort, the Nymex OTC clearing system.
1038;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;CME and Nymex extend exclusive talks;;The CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, said on Monday night that it was extending exclusive talks to buy Nymex, the New York exchange.The CME – born last year from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s $11bn takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade – announced last month that it was in negotiations to buy the Nymex in a deal that would create the world’s largest exchange, controlling about 98 per cent of US listed futures.The talks have been complicated by valuation issues. When first announced, the deal was valued at about $11.3bn, but sharp falls in the share price of both exchanges mean that it is now worth about $10bn.The CME has considered improving its cash-and-shares offer to pre-empt opposition from within Nymex.The exchanges said that they would continue their talks until March 15. They were due to end on Tuesday.“The potential transaction remains subject to completion of due diligence, negotiation of terms of a definitive agreement and approvals of the boards of directors of both companies,” the CME said.“There can be no certainty that any agreement will be entered into or as to the terms.”Concerns are intensifying that a deal would face serious difficulties securing regulatory approval because relations with the Department of Justice have deteriorated in recent weeks.“We’re going to have a massive fight at Justice,” said Jeff Carter, a CME trader and former board member.That view reflects an increasing perception that priorities at the DoJ’s antitrust department have changed.When the proposed takeover was announced last month, it was widely reckoned that DoJ approval would be a formality, especially after the clearance last year of the CME’s takeover of the CBOT, a deal that formed a dominant player in US-listed futures with 80 per cent-plus market share.But the picture seemed to alter this month when the DoJ’s antitrust division sent a letter to the Treasury recommending clearing be separated from futures exchanges.Although not a direct response to the CME/Nymex move, the letter prompted billions of dollars to be wiped off the value of the two exchange groups as investors feared they could be divested of their highly profitable clearing houses.A deal would involve merging those clearing houses, something that did not affect the CBOT takeover as the CME was already clearing CBOT contracts.Gerry Alexis, an antitrust lawyer at Perkins Coie in San Francisco, who formerly worked at the Department of Justice, said the antitrust division was likely to use the opportunity presented by the Nymex takeover to press its case about clearing.“The DoJ lawyers may well be looking more at what could be done in connection with this merger review to open up clearing operations to make the exchanges more competitive, which they seem to think is a major bottleneck,” she said.
1039;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-25T22:08:58Z;NYSE links to OTC specialist;;NYSE Euronext, the exchange group, will on Tuesday announce a partnership with SuperDerivatives, a US options pricing specialist, in the latest example of the convergence of the exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives markets.Exchanges including NYSE Euronext and rivals such as CME Group and Deutsche Börse are targeting the over-the-counter derivatives market, which still dwarfs the exchange-traded market, for expansion.The Bank for International Settlements estimates the notional amount of OTC contracts worldwide at $516,000bn.The push by exchanges to enter the OTC market has been spurred on by the development of technology that can be used for exchange based trading and for execution of OTC transactions electronically, as opposed to through brokers by phone.SuperDerivatives operates a benchmark for derivatives pricing and provides front office systems, risk management, revaluation and online options trading.Meanwhile, under the terms of the deal, NYSE Euronext’s international derivative arm Liffe will provide SuperDerivatives users with direct access to its Liffe Connect electronic trading platform.The partnership is designed to give users the ability to price, analyse and trade exchange traded Liffe products alongside OTC products, in theory allowing them greater flexibility in choosing the appropriate market for their goals.SuperDerivatives will gain access to prices from the Euronext exchange. It will merge these prices with OTC prices, providing greater transparency and price discovery for users with the stated target of tightening the bid/offer spreads in the corresponding exchange products.“The combination of SuperDerivatives and Liffe represents a convergence of the OTC and exchange markets for the benefit of all users,” said David Gershon, president and chief executive of SuperDerivatives.”
1040;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T08:01:05+0000;CME considers improving Nymex offer;;CME Group is considering improving its bid for the Nymex as it seeks to create the world’s biggest exchange, said a person familiar with the negotiations.The CME – already the world’s biggest futures exchange – announced last month it was in exclusive talks to buy the New York energy exchange, a sign of the pace of consolidation within the exchange sector.The deal had been valued at about $11.3bn but sharp falls in the share price of both exchanges mean it is now worth about $10bn. However, the CME is considering the possibility of improving its cash-and-shares offer to bring it back to the original figure.“The CME would say, ‘we’ll change the ratio so you end up with the original price’,” said the person familiar with the talks.“So the value of the final deal would come out more or less where they were before.”The CME’s move could be designed to pre-empt any opposition from Nymex members about the deal and to prevent any rival bidder emerging after Tuesday, when a 30-day exclusive negotiating period comes to an end – although last-minute haggling over valuations could extend the talks. Coming seven months after the CME was formed from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s $11bn takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade, the company’s bid for Nymex would create an exchange that dominates the US derivatives industry, with control over about 98 per cent of US listed futures.When the deal was first announced, the CME bid valued Nymex at about $120 per share. In the month since, shares of both companies have been hit by the release earlier this month of a Department of Justice letter recommending that clearing be separated from exchanges – a move that would deprive both the CME and Nymex of one of the most profitable parts of their businesses.In the days following the release of the DoJ letter, shares in both companies dropped more than 20 per cent, with CME falling to $485.25 and Nymex tumbling to $87.88.Although the share prices have bounced back, neither has recovered completely. Nymex shares closed on Friday at $99.40, while CME ended the day at $525.10. That would value the CME’s bid under the original formula at $105.47 per Nymex share, or about $10bn. While that is some $600m more than the New York exchange’s current market capitalisation, investment banks representing Nymex are understood to have been collecting data on the exchange’s market share to bolster their argument that it is worth even more.In response, the CME is considering putting forward its improved bid.
1041;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-23T04:02:04Z;Mark Sellers: Take advantage when good companies come to market;;"When Google completed its initial public offering in August 2004, the stock seemed overpriced. Even after reducing its IPO price from $108 to $85, the company’s trailing price/earnings ratio was well over 200. Journalists, analysts and market pundits exclaimed that Google was the most overpriced IPO in years, and warned investors to avoid it.Shortly after the IPO, analysts were confused about how to model the company’s earnings. The average analyst estimate for Google’s first quarter as a public company was 56 cents a share, but the range of estimates was all over the map. Clearly, there was no “consensus” earnings number. Most analysts were cautious.When Google then reported earnings in October 2004, its earnings per share were 70 cents a share, and the stock jumped 15 per cent in one day. Analysts then rushed to increase their estimates for the following quarter, but were again too cautious. The next quarter, Google beat the average analyst estimate by 15 cents, earning 92 cents a share compared with estimates of 77. The quarter after that, Google earned $1.29 compared with the average estimate of 92 cents.As it turned out, Google’s stock was incredibly cheap at its IPO price of $85. Over the following year, the company’s actual (not estimated) earnings turned out to be $4.27 per share. This meant that it was priced at just 19.9 times its forward earnings on the date of its IPO, though no one knew that at the time.We can learn something valuable from this historical analysis: great companies are often treated by the market as if they are merely average companies when they first become public. Over the first four to six quarters as a public company, expectations rise as analysts come to appreciate the company’s competitive position. At the same time, analyst estimates become more clustered around a consensus, which gives investors more certainty about the company’s earnings outlook.The interaction of these two factors causes a “double-whammy” effect: not only do earnings expectations rise, lowering the forward p/e ratio, but the risk premium priced into the stock falls. In other words, both the earnings outlook and the p/e ratio go up. These two factors work like a slingshot, causing the stock price to rise dramatically. Google, for instance, saw its stock rise from $85 to $280 in its first year of trading as earnings estimates rose and the p/e ratio expanded.There are other examples of this phenomenon. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange went public in December 2002 at a price of $42 a share, which was about 18 times trailing earnings per share. That seemed a fair price to many pundits, who said the stock was fully valued at that amount. But the company continually beat estimates because of its operating leverage and ability to fend off would-be competitors. The stock price responded by rising more than 700 per cent over the next three years as earnings expectations continually rose and the p/e ratio expanded dramatically.Another good example of this “increasing expectations” phenomenon is Morningstar, which went public in May 2005 at $18. Today the stock is $66, a 270 per cent increase.There are two fundamental factors all these companies share. First, they have an “economic moat”, or natural defence against competitors, allowing them to generate high returns on capital. Second, they have lots of operating leverage (as opposed to financial leverage); in other words, a 10 per cent increase in revenue translates into far more than a 10 per cent increase in bottom-line profits. Operating leverage is almost always underestimated by analysts when they are not very familiar with a company.When a company with these two traits begins to trade publicly, analysts are too cautious at first. They do not know the company that well, so their estimates are all over the place. Investors can play this to their advantage by buying and holding great companies when they go public, ignoring what pundits or analysts say and betting that analyst estimates will rise and become more clustered, causing the p/e ratio to rise at the same time as earnings expectations.Excess investment returns come from buying an asset when the market’s expectations are too low, and selling when expectations are too high. Nowhere are expectations off so much as when a great company first trades publicly. In August 2006, I highlighted two stocks here that I felt were at the beginning of this “increasing expectations” cycle: Mastercard and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since then, Mastercard is up 314 per cent and Chipotle is up 92 per cent.A future IPO that I’m excited about is Visa, which plans to go public this year and is certainly a wide-moat company (even more so than Mastercard) and has oodles of operating leverage. It remains to be seen whether analysts will underestimate its potential or not. I will be sure to comment on this in future columns, when the IPO date is announced.The writer is a former equities strategist at Morningstar, who manages Sellers Capital, a hedge fundmsellers@sellerscapital.com"

1043;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-13T01:27:58Z;CME chief attacks investment banks;;Craig Donohue, chief executive of the CME Group, launched an attack on investment banks on Tuesday.He said the subprime mortgage crisis and the trading scandal at Société Générale had happened because Wall Street had resisted centralised clearing such as that offered by the CME.Shares in the CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, fell last week after the US Department of Justice called for clearing to be divested from futures exchan­ges on antitrust grounds.The share price has rallied somewhat, but Mr Donohue’s continued criticism of the DoJ proposal suggests he views it as a serious threat. His attack on the banks comes at a time of fraught rel­ations between the CME and some of its biggest clients.“Why in the world would anyone want to question the organisation and operation of one of the best-functioning pieces of our financial-system plumbing at a time when subprime write-offs have cost investment banks and their shareholders about $400bn – not to mention the unquantifiable second and third-order costs attributable to this debacle?” Mr Donohue said at a meeting of the Managed Funds Association in Key Biscayne, Florida.“Why would anyone question the efficacy of these exchange-owned clearing systems when we witness losses like the more than $7bn in­curred by Société Générale?”Mr Donohue said both the subprime and SocGen cases happened in opaque markets, involved subjective valuations and exposed a misunderstanding of true risk.“These problems exist in large part because investment banks traditionally have resisted a more centralised, transparent execution system for these products, preferring to maintain their dealer franchises and proprietary trading profits,” he said. “And they have tended to oppose central counterparty clearing services in these markets, worried that a mutualised risk structure will dissipate their credit and balance sheet advantages.”Mr Donohue said: “Should­n’t regulators be more concerned with asking whether a broader implementation of central counterparty clearing services for over-the-counter derivative trading could have mitigated effects of the subprime meltdown or the SocGen fraud?”
1044;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-12T16:09:57Z;Futures genie is out of the bottle;;Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE-Euronext, asks a question that is on everyone’s minds in the exchange world, thanks to a bombshell dropped by the US Justice department last week.“We are all waiting and wondering: is the futures market going to end up evolving the way the equities and options markets have? Is clearing ever going to be fungible?,” he posed during an interview with the Financial Times.Fungibility is the ability of traders to open a position at one exchange and close it at another. Central to their ability to do this is either that both exchanges use the same clearing house, or that there are links between the two exchanges’ clearing houses.Traders like this because it means exchanges must compete to offer the best prices at all times.Fungibility has been a feature of the stock and options markets for years. All six options exchanges use the same clearing house, the Options Clearing Corporation.But futures remain a holdout, with exchange ownership of clearers the bedrock of this model – and the CME Group its standard bearer. The group was formed last year from the combination the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade.Critics, mostly the investment banks and hedge funds that are the biggest users of exchanges like the CME, say that ownership of a clearing house means there is no competition to get the best price and traders are locked into a monopoly clearing fee.Last week, the DoJ signalled it was unhappy with this model in a letter to the US Treasury, throwing its weight behind the idea that clearing houses should be separated from the futures exchanges that own them.The CME’s shares were hit hard, amid investor fears that this could jeopardise its business model. Clearing is the most profitable part of its business.What, then, is the answer to Mr Niederauer’s question?Kenneth Worthington, an analyst at JP MorganChase, dismissed the letter as a “non-event”, perhaps implying that fungibility will never happen.Yet Christopher Allen, a Bank of America analyst, takes a longer view, saying: “We believe the near-term risk to market structure change for CME is minimal, although longer-term (over five years out) the risks could be real.”Two things are clear. It is certainly true that the DoJ’s move is unlikely to have any effect in the short-term, because there is no time to adopt its suggestions into a “blueprint” for financial regulatory reform that Treasury will publish in a matter of weeks.Moreover, such a change would likely have to be part of legislation that renews the congressional mandate of the futures regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). That is also due within weeks, again starving any initiative of time for it to be taken up.But far from being a non-event, the letter has for the first time laid down a powerful marker that the country’s antitrust authorities are unhappy with the way clearing is organised in the US.This means that the issue of fungibility is unlikely to go away – and could weigh on the CME’s business again. “The genie is out of the bottle. The DoJ now says it’s a regulatory issue,” says one derivatives industry expert.Indeed, the DoJ’s letter suggests there has long been unease among some antitrust officials about Chicago’s control of clearing, in spite of the department’s approval of the CME-CBOT merger last year.Part of the evidence for this are two revealing references to failed attempts by European derivatives exchanges to take on the Chicago futures exchanges in 2003 and 2004.These events may have been forgotten by some. But they are crucial to understanding the DoJ’s thinking and the criticisms that banks and hedge funds have of the US clearing model.In the first case Eurex, the Frankfurt-based derivatives exchange, tried – and failed - to take on the CBOT’s flagship Treasury bond futures contracts. It marked the first assault on the Chicago exchanges’ dominance in key, globally-traded futures contracts.The single biggest reason for failure was a controversial decision by the CFTC to approve a rule change by the CME that mandated the shifting of “open interest” – that is, trades left open at the end of a trading day – from a clearer that Eurex planned to use, to the CME’s own clearing house.That robbed Eurex of liquidity before it had even started offering its rival products, dooming the project to failure.Euronext-Liffe, now part of the NYSE, failed in its 2004 bid to break the CME’s grip on eurodollar interest rate futures for reasons rooted, similarly, in clearing control. Also criticised at the time was the CFTC’s approval of certain related rule-makings carried out by the CME under its self-regulatory status.The DoJ said one lesson from these events were that “exchange control over open interest and clearing have impeded entry and the development of meaningful competition in execution services”.The second thing that is clear in the wake of the DoJ’s letter is the CME’s determination to defend its model as “the industry standard” – and its growing political clout in Washington with which to back that up.Intellectually, the CME has strong arguments for maintaining the status quo.The first is that if exchange ownership of clearing in futures were abolished, this would put US exchanges at an immediate disadvantage to their foreign - mainly European – rivals.The CME said last week that, unlike domestic stock and options exchanges, domestic futures exchanges compete directly with non-US futures exchanges, where 70 per cent of all futures and options [on futures] contracts traded globally are cleared on - or through -exchange-owned or controlled clearing facilities.“Any failure to recognise that fact would create an unlevel playing field for US futures exchanges at a time when US futures exchanges are the strongest example of how to maintain our overall competitiveness in global financial markets – a key area of concern in recent times,” the CME said.Ironically, the CME is likely to have the support of Deutsche Börse, Eurex’s parent, which also operates a “vertical silo” clearing model.The CME also rejects claims that independent clearing arrangements in futures markets would increase market efficiency, saying the evidence shows that “total liquidity costs” in futures markets are “considerably lower than in securities and equity options markets”.It also argues that the absence of “cross-exchange fungibility” has not impaired innovation or competition in the derivatives industry. “New product and system innovation is unparalleled and customer fees and costs are close to insignificant in relation to the value of services performed.”Jeff Carter, a Eurodollar trader and former CME board member, adds: “All the major banks are clearing members of the CME. They own an extra seat that allows them to trade any product at the cheapest price. They also reap cross margining savings across all asset classes. This saves them billions.”He highlights a long-held suspicion among the Chicago exchange community that by pushing for fungibility, the banks and hedge funds want to be able to put open interest wherever they want to put it – resulting in less liquid markets and greater costs to trade.“What the banks really want is to do is trade and front run their customer orders, just like they do in stocks and options,” Mr Carter says.The CME is likely to use its impressive political connections in Washington to push such arguments.Last week, they resulted in the dispatch of a stinging letter from Dick Durbin, the Illinois senator, and congressman Rahm Emanuel to Michael Mukasey, attorney-general, and Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary, attacking the DoJ’s move.Its main lobbyist in the city is Bo Chambliss, son of Saxby Chambliss, the senior Republican member on the Senate agriculture committee – which oversees the CFTC.Last month, the CME nominated to its board former House Speaker Denny Hastert of Illinois, and Jackie Clegg, a consultant married to Christopher Dodd, Democratic chairman of the Senate banking committee.In its letter, the DoJ drew Congress into the argument by pointing out that the law that governs the CFTC, the Commodity Futures Modernisation Act, “directs the CFTC to prevent the adoption of exchange or clearing house rules that unreasonably restrain trade or impose a material anticompetitive burden on the markets”It said that this and other provisions “reflect Congress’s desire to stimulate competition between exchanges and between clearing organisations”. This line has been seized upon by the Futures Industry Association, the main futures user group, as a sign that the issue might gain political traction.That is unlikely in the current administration. Walter Lukken, acting CFTC chairman and a Republican, says the agency “continues to examine the industry’s clearing structure as part of our broader mission”.“While recent [DoJ] comments on clearing deserve thoughtful analysis, we believe that the various clearing models that have developed in the US meet the standards established by [Congress],” he says.The prospects for change to the US clearing model seem some time off. Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, believes ”the odds of any change to the clearing structure driven by the recent DoJ comment letter are less than five per cent over the next several years”.But the question remains: why did the DoJ choose to send its letter to the Treasury, eight months after it saw no problem with the CME’s clearing arrangement by approving – unconditionally – the CME-CBOT merger?Bart Chilton, a Democratic CFTC commissioner, called the DoJ’s conclusions “troubling” and questioned how it could “condemn a business model that received the legal blessing of the DoJ” only last year.The answer, Washington sources say, is that the staff who worked on the CME-CBOT antitrust probe had harboured serious concerns about the clearing arrangement that pre-existed before the deal. But their conclusions did not find their way into the final decision by the department.By submitting those views in the form of a letter to the Treasury, they have at least put on record their views, those insiders say.For its part, the DoJ says the scope of last year’s probe and the recommendations made in the letter to Treasury were two “separate questions”.
1045;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-10T19:09:08Z;Futures reform;;About-turns do not come much bigger than this. The US Department of Justice believes the ownership of clearing houses by derivatives exchanges is a significant barrier to competition. Too bad it did not say as much last year when it approved the acquisition of the Chicago Board of Trade by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, creating a behemoth that trades and clears 85 per cent of exchange-traded futures contracts in the US.Its new position is better late than never. The futures exchanges have used their control over clearing to thwart potential competitors. The DoJ has asked the US Treasury to examine whether the former should continue to be allowed to own the latter.Clearing is where customers hold “open interest” after purchasing a futures contract. Clearers are counterparties to buyer and seller. They reduce risk and costs by netting purchases off against sales and setting the level of collateral each side must hold.When an exchange controls clearing, it can prevent a customer from buying a contract on one exchange and selling it on another. Customers, therefore, have everything to gain from the DoJ’s move. The US stock markets, where exchanges share a common clearer, are undergoing fierce competition that has seen tariffs slashed, spreads tightened and volumes soar.Prices could well fall further and volumes rise further as a result of the DoJ’s move. In 1999, this was precisely what happened when the DoJ broke up a cartel among options exchanges not to launch competing products.The CME is fighting back, arguing that the system works well for everyone. But no greater evidence of market dysfunction exists than the move by its biggest customers to form a competing exchange.The CFTC, the CME’s regulator, has sided with the exchange. But the regulator’s own role has been less than even-handed. It has repeatedly turned a deaf ear to pleas from customers for open clearing. And it has allowed the CME and CBOT to use their rule-making powers to block competitors from the clearing system.The US has fretted that its exchanges are losing out to foreign rivals. While it is not surprising the CME should want to defend its dominant position, it would do better in the long run to support the DoJ’s move. If America’s futures markets are inefficient, business will drift abroad. To retain its pole position as the world’s largest derivatives market, the US will need to embrace competition. This U-turn is long overdue.
1046;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-08T22:08:44Z;Credit and economic fears weigh on Wall St;;Wall Street stocks were mixed on Friday as a modest rebound in the technology sector was overshadowed by heightened fears of corporate and commercial property credit defaults.A lacklustre session capped another bad week for equities which were beset by fears that the US economy is heading into recession.Fearing a sharp downturn, investors shifted into perceived safe havens, such as consumer staples and utilities, and off-loaded financial companies amid rumours of a fire-sale of credit derivatives.The S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,331.29 on Friday, marking a decline of 4.6 per cent for the week. The S&P closed lower in four of five trading sessions and almost wiped out a rebound of 4.9 per cent the previous week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 4.4 per cent to 12,182.13 over the week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rallied on Friday but still ended the week down 4.5 per cent at 2,304.85.Equity investors were left pondering whether stocks are now set to retest January’s lows or if equities were over-sold and are primed for a recovery.“Part of making a [market] bottom is time. Even if the market doesn’t make a new low it’s going to go sideways for a while,” said Jim Moffett, lead portfolio manager at UMB Scout Fund International.A spike in wholesale inventories provided further evidence on Friday of a slowing US economy. It followed a dire reading on the ISM non-manufacturing index, which sent stocks into their steepest declines in almost a year on Tuesday.Many analysts believe stocks have become cheap relative to earnings and say recession fears have already been priced in. However, the cost of insuring corporate debt soared this week, suggesting equities may be understating risks.“The battle is on a number of fronts right now, it’s not just in the real economy, it’s in the credit markets that are showing increasing signs of strain,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.One of the main factors weighing on the market remains the uncertain fate of monoline insurers. Investors fear a downgrade of a key bond insurer could trigger big losses at US banks.Moody’s Investors Service cut bond insurer Security Capital Assurance’s AAA rating this week and MBIA, a larger bond insurer, offered $1bn in new stock to raise much-needed capital. Its shares fell 10.8 per cent to $14.60 for the week.Financial stocks were among the worst performing this week with Citigroup falling 12.3 per cent to $26.03, while Morgan Stanley gave up 10.5 per cent to $43.19 as writedown fears persisted. Credit card companies including American Express, down 9.3 per cent at $44.98, were also hit after an analyst warned delinquencies would worsen well into 2009.The S&P homebuilder index fell 14.9 per cent over the period and the Bloom-berg real estate investment trust index declined 7.4 per cent amid signs the commercial real estate market has become the latest victim of the credit squeeze.Investors were also downbeat about earnings prospects, particularly in the technology sector.The Nasdaq saw the best of Friday’s gains after Amazon.com announced a $1bn share buy-back programme and McAfee, the antivirus software company, beat estimates with its quarterly results. Nonetheless, the two companies shed 1.5 per cent to $73.50 and 1.1 per cent to $34.65 respectively this week.Cognizant Technology Solutions, a tech outsourcing company, rose 6.7 per cent to $31.84 over the period after it issued a first-quarterly profit forecast that exceeded expectations.Tech shares have fallen sharply this year on concerns a looming economic slowdown will cause companies and consumers to cut back on spending. Cisco’s weak third-quarter sales outlook this week encouraged traders to keep selling large-cap tech stocks and although many of these pared losses on Friday, Cisco ended the week 5.6 per cent lower at $23.54 while Apple declined 6.2 per cent to $125.48.In retail, Wal-Mart’s till receipts were disappointing, leaving its stock down 4.7 per cent at $48.76 for the week. Some high-street names recovered ground after JC Penney, down 1.8 per cent at $47.63, gave reassuring earning guidance.Exchange operators were among the worst hit stocks after the Department of Justice called for clearing houses to be broken off from futures exchanges. Although the sector rebounded after an analyst called the selling overdone, CME Group still fell 15.3 per cent to $517 this week.
1047;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-08T19:04:04Z;DoJ defends call for clearing study;;The US Department of Justice on Friday defended its call for a review of the way clearing is organised in the US futures industry, insisting that there was no contradiction between the move and its clearance of the merger last year of Chicago’s two big futures exchanges.The issue sparked wild swings this week in the share price of the CME Group, formed through the $12bn takeover by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange of the Chicago Board of Trade.The DoJ approved the deal last year, disappointing the futures industry which had hoped it would at least be made conditional on changes to CME’s clearing model.The CME owns its own clearer. Futures exchanges’ ownership of clearing has become a flashpoint between exchanges and their biggest users, banks and hedge funds. They say this gives exchanges quasi-monopoly powers, shutting out competing exchanges.By this week calling for breaking off clearing houses from the exchanges that own them, the DoJ appeared to contradict the stance it took at the time it approved the CME-CBOT deal. Investors worried this represented a threat to its business model. Clearing is the most lucrative part of its business.On Friday the DoJ said its call for the study was “a separate question” from the scope of its antitrust probe into CME-CBOT. That was focused on whether the CME’s and CBOT’s respective products overlapped and that the entry of competitors would “not be foreclosed by the transaction”.The DoJ said its comments, in a letter to the US Treasury, “did not take a position on what action, if any, that should result from such a study”.
1048;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-08T02:17:22Z;Clearing reform doubts lift CME;;Reform of the way futures contracts are cleared in the US is unlikely to happen for at least five years, analysts said on Thursday, as the US Treasury distanced itself from a call by the US Department of Justice for reform of the futures clearing system.Their comments lifted shares in CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, and others in the sector. The shares had moved sharply lower this week after a call from the DoJ for clearing to be separated from futures exchanges on antitrust grounds.On Wednesday, CME’s shares fell 18 per cent as the market fretted over the effect on clearing, which is one of the most profitable parts of the CME, formed last year from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade. Shares in CME, which owns its own clearing house, rose sharply on Thursday, up $42.76 to $528.01.Investors appeared reassured by the CME’s contention that it has strong arguments against any change. It argues that such a change would make the US futures industry globally uncompetitive and would infringe the company’s intellectual property rights. They were also cheered by comments from Bart Chilton, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the industry regulator, who called the DoJ’s comments “troubling”.Christopher Allen, a Bank of America analyst, said: “Given the CFTC comments, our view is that any market structure change would be years [five-plus] out and, [given] CME’s political capabilities, we believe the pullback in the stock yesterday was overdone.”Rich Repetto at Sandler O’Neill said: “The market strongly overreacted to DoJ’s comment letter on clearing.”The DoJ’s call was made in a letter to the Treasury, which had invited public comment on a “blueprint” for reform of the US financial regulatory system.Robert Steel, Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance, said what the DoJ had advocated was not what his department was addressing. He said: “I think that from our perspective, what we are looking at is regulation of securities and futures with regard to regulatory structure, and really antitrust is not the perspective of Treasury.”Meanwhile, the CME was backed on Thursday by Illinois senator Dick Durbin and Rahm Emanuel, an Illinois congressman. In a letter to Hank Paulson, US Treasury secretary, they registered their “strong objections” to the DoJ’s remarks and demanded to know if the department had “considered the letter’s influence on the markets prior to issuance”.Mr Durbin and Mr Emanuel’s letter said the DoJ’s intervention “raises concerns about both the substance of the letter and the manner in which it was filed. The opinions in DoJ’s comment letter are inconsistent with its earlier determination to approve the CME/CBOT merger.”Mr Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, and Mr Emanuel, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, also noted the DoJ’s remarks were issued two months after a deadline for filing comments to the Treasury as part of its review of financial market regulationThe normally reticent Options Clearing Corporation, a quasi-governmental body that clears options in the US, also weighed in to the debate on Thursday, offering a cautious welcome to the opening of a discussion on the issue. “The Department of Justice comments were insightful,” the organisation said.
1049;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-07T21:36:34Z;Wall St rebounds in volatile trading;;"US stocks rebounded on Thursday as bargain-hunters rushed to buy into market weakness and called a halt on a three-day losing run.Consumer stocks surged in volatile trading after reassuring earnings guidance from JC Penney and Gap helped offset earlier disappointment with Wal-Mart’s January sales figures.The sharp upswing bore some of the hallmarks of an over-sold bounce and was led by beaten-down financial, energy and telecoms stocks. The rally stemmed a slide of almost 5 per cent on the S&P 500 this week.In spite of a broad-based rally a weak sales outlook from Cisco continued to weigh on some large-cap technology companies. Utilities stocks also lagged.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,336.91, having fallen 0.7 per cent before rebounding as much as 1.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 12,247 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 2,293.30.“I think the most likely scenario is that we reached a low in January and we are now in the base-building process,” Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said.A broad range of retailers rallied after JC Penney, up 8.5 per cent at $47.44, said same-store sales declined less than forecast and fourth-quarter earnings would be at the high end of its forecast range. Gap’s shares also rebounded, up 7.2 per cent at $19.65 after its earnings outlook also pleased investors.Elsewhere retail sales figures were generally disappointing, as consumers faced with falling house prices reined in their discretionary spending. However, the S&P retail index climbed 3.7 per cent to 403.51 as analysts said weaker consumer spending was already priced in to many retail shares,Wal-Mart’s same-store sales rose only 0.5 per cent in January, much less than the 2 per cent increase Wall Street had expected, and its February sales forecast also offered little cause for excitement. The shares fell in early trading but later closed up 2.1 per cent at $49.84.Upmarket retailer Nordstrom rose 3.7 per cent to $37.67 in spite of reporting a 6.6 per cent decline in same-store sales. Macy’s, up 4.9 per cent at $25.11 had reported a 7.1 per cent sales drop on Wednesday.Technology stocks also pared early losses caused by a cautious sales outlook from Cisco. The networking company said quarterly profit rose 7.2 per cent to $2.06bn, in line with analysts’ estimates, and projected 10 per cent sales growth for the fiscal third quarter, below expectations. The shares rose 1.3 per cent to $23.38.Many investors consider Cisco a bellwether for the sector and its cautious outlook kept shares in a some of large-cap tech companies under pressure. IBM fell 1.2 per cent to $102.34 and Hewlett Packard gave up 3.9 per cent to $40.50.There was mixed news on the employment front. Weekly jobless claims fell 22,000 to 356,000, but the reading was still far higher than many analysts had predicted. Jobless claims had surged the previous week to the highest reading in more than two years, but this time the market was expecting a figure of about 340,000. The four-week moving average of first time claims rose 8,500 to 335,000.“On balance, initial jobless claims have drifted higher, although at this point they remain below levels typically associated with outright recession,” economists at Bear Stearns said.Pending home sales fell a weaker-than-expected 1.5 per cent in December, according to the National Association of Realtors, and were down 24.2 per cent from the previous year. Homebuilder DR Horton rose 1.6 per cent to $15.04 after it posted a narrower-than-expected $128.8m quarterly loss.Consumer products group PepsiCo said fourth-quarter profit fell 30 per cent to $1.26bn from a year ago, when results were improved by a tax benefit. However, revenues rose 17 per cent to $12.35bn and the shares put on 5.5 per cent to $70.41.Rating agency Moody’s said fourth-quarter earnings fell 54 per cent to $127.3m as revenues from structured finance slumped. However, the result was slightly better than analysts had forecast and the stock surged 10.4 per cent to $37.Financial companies closed broadly higher after Jamie Dimon,chief executive of JP Morgan, said a possible downgrade of a key bond insurer would not be “that big a deal” for the banking industry. JP Morgan’s shares rose 3.2 per cent to $45.11Exchange operators also enjoyed a bounce after an analyst said the market overreacted to a Department of Justice call for ownership for clearing houses to be
broken off from futures exchanges. CME Group rose 8.8 per cent to $528.01 after falling 17.6 per cent the previous day."
1050;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-07T08:48:04Z;Regulating clearing;;Washington has just lobbed a bomb at Chicago. Shares in CME Group, which operates Chicago’s two big futures exchanges, fell 17.6 per cent on Wednesday, as investors digested a letter from the Department of Justice to the US Treasury.The DoJ voiced concerns that “vertical clearing” of futures trades could be anti-competitive. Clearing houses mitigate counterparty risk in financial trades. Futures exchanges typically keep clearing in-house. That means liquidity in a specific contract tends to accrue to one exchange, blunting competition.There is a strong case for a review. Defenders of vertical clearing point out it is the industry norm and gives incentives to exchanges to launch new products, knowing they will reap most of the benefits. Neither argument is convincing and to suggest that opening up the futures market to more competition would stifle innovation is bizarre.Some of the CME’s own arguments against any change in the status quo, however, have merit – most notably, that any change would need to be extended beyond US borders to keep domestic futures exchanges competitive with foreign rivals. That will also resonate with politicians fearful of the US losing its hegemony in financial markets. Touting vertical clearing as a shield against systemic risk will also play well in Washington in these fraught times.There is a lot riding on this. Apart from the competitive threat to core contracts, vertical clearing is a lucrative business, involving not just fees but managing the collateral posted by traders on open positions.The need for discussion, possible legislation, and the likelihood of it all being contested in court means any change is probably far off. For the CME, however, there is a nearer-term risk. This letter may well portend a harsh review of its proposal to buy Nymex. The discount at which Nymex’s shares trade relative to the CME’s offer has now blown out to 12 per cent.Post and read comments on this Lex
1051;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T08:01:05+0000;CME and Nymex fall after call on clearing;;Shares in the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, fell nearly 18 per cent on Wednesday as its chief executive hit back at a government proposal to prevent exchanges such as his from owning clearing houses.Other stock and derivative exchange shares were also dragged lower amid uncertainty over regulation of the business.The developments followed a Financial Times report that said the US justice department had written to the Treasury this week to urge that clearing be separated from futures ex-changes on antitrust grounds.In a hastily arranged conference call with analysts on Wednesday, Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, said the current arrangements were “a model that works and has been in existence outside the US. We would be distinctly disadvantaged given the fact that that’s who we’re competing with”.“There really is no public purpose to be served in attempting to transfer ownership of exchange-owned clearing facilities to intermediaries who may operate them strictly for the benefit of end-users,” he said.In a statement, the CME said: “70 per cent of all futures and options contracts traded globally are cleared on or through exchange-owned or controlled clearing facilities. Any failure to recognise that fact would create an un-level playing field for US futures exchanges.”When the justice department approved the CME-CBOT deal, it argued there was no evidence that the CME’s control of clearing would keep competitors out.But the latest letter now says “the control exercised by futures exchanges over clearing services…has made it difficult for exchanges to enter and compete in the trading of financial futures contracts”.The letter, signed by Thomas Barrett, assistant attorney-general in the antitrust division, recommends the Treasury “propose a thorough review of futures clearing and its alternatives”.Jerry Salzman, a lawyer with the CME, warned against expropriation of the company’s clearing facility. “The clearing house of the CME is a valuable asset in which hundreds of millions of dollars – more – have been invested over many years,” he said. “It’s not the custom and practice in this country to take something like that away from somebody by decree.”
1052;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-06T21:53:01Z;US stocks sell off amid recession fears;;US stocks extended this week’s sharp losses on Wednesday when a tentative rally fizzled out amid renewed concerns about the US economy sending the Nasdaq back into a bear market.Stocks retreated after Macy’s reported some disappointing sales figures and Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Charles Plosser warned inflation remained a concern. Trading was choppy throughout the session after heavy falls in Asian markets.Nervous traders sold technology stocks ahead of quarterly results from Cisco Systems, a bellwether for the sector, while energy stocks suffered as crude oil prices dropped. Investment banks also came under pressure amid concerns about their exposure to monoline bond insurers.The S&P 500 closed near its lows for the session, down 0.8 per cent at 1,326.45, having earlier rallied 1.2 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite gave up 1.3 per cent to 2,278.75, leaving the index more than 20 per cent below its October high, a “bear market “ in trader parlance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 per cent to 12,200.10.Wednesday’s sell-off added to Tuesday’s sharp losses, which were triggered by a dire reading on the January ISM services index. The S&P has now fallen 4.9 per cent this week, erasing a good chunk of recent equity market gains.Some analysts said the selling was not really surprising because a rally in late January had been overdone. S&P 500 companies had risen an average 9 per cent with about 90 per cent of stocks climbing above their 10-day moving average, a potentially bearish indicator.Bespoke Investment Group said the S&P 500’s most shorted stocks – shares acquired on loan, then sold in the expectation they can later be bought back more cheaply – were the ones to rally most since equities hit a bottom on January 22.“The decile of stocks with the highest short interest was up a whopping 17.1 per cent from the bottom, while the decile of stocks with the lowest short interest was only up 5.3 per cent,” it said. “The most recent gains have come from large amounts of short covering.”Wednesday’s light economic calendar was led by a slowdown in US productivity growth. Still, a fourth quarter increase of 1.8 per cent was more than three times better than expected.In spite of Mr Plosser’s more hawkish comments on Wednesday, traders continued to bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates aggressively. The futures market has fully priced in a 50 basis point cut, with a 32 per cent chance of a 75bp cut when the Fed meets in March.“If the US economy has fallen into recession, it seems likely to us that the Fed would cut the funds rate to 2 per cent, or conceivably 1 per cent, by the middle of the year,” said John Ryding, economist at Bear Stearns.Earnings news was led by Walt Disney, which posted a 26 per cent decline in profit from a year earlier when earnings benefited from a divestment. However, the results beat expectations as revenues jumped 9 per cent, and the stock rose 4.8 per cent to $31.50.Time Warner rose 2 per cent to $15.71 after the company said it plans to split AOL’s internet access and advertising businesses. Fourth-quarter earnings fell from $1.8bn to $1bn, again due to an unfavourable comparison, but adjusted earnings beat expectations.After the closing bell Cisco Systems, down 0.8 per cent at $23.08, reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.38bn, in line with estimates.Retailers opened higher after Polo Ralph Lauren’s quarterly net income far exceeded some analysts’ estimates prompting Its shares to climb 10 per cent to $63.19. However, the S&P retail index fell into negative territory after Macyâ€™s, down 4.6 per cent at $23.94, said same-store sales declined 7.1 per cent in January.Homebuilders were also in focus after Toll Brothers‘ chief executive said the company was “not yet seeing much light at the end of the tunnel”. Its shares fell 3.4 per cent to $21.13CME Group fell 17.6 per cent to $485.25 after the the Department of Justice called for clearing houses to be broken off from futures exchanges, posing a direct challenge to its business model and casting doubt on its proposed takeover of Nymex Holdings, which fell 17.6 per cent to $87.88.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange.

The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing.

1054;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-05T23:37:27Z;DoJ challenges ownership of clearing houses;;The US Department of Justice has called for clearing houses to be broken off from the futures exchanges that own them, throwing down a challenge to the business model that has propelled the CME Group to become the world’s largest futures exchange.The move raises questions about the approval given by US antitrust authorities last year for the almost $12bn takeover by the CME Group of cross-town rival the Chicago Board of Trade.It also comes as futures exchanges’ ownership of clearing has become a flashpoint between exchanges and their biggest users, banks and hedge funds.The users say ownership of clearing allows an exchange to ensure that liquidity is virtually impossible to shift to a competing platform – and locks users into high fees.The Justice Department’s latest position, in a letter to the US Treasury department, appears to contradict some of the rationale that underpinned the Department’s decision to approve the CME-CBOT deal, without any conditions, last year.At the time, the antitrust authority argued there was no evidence that the CME’s control of clearing would keep competitors out of the futures business – a key complaint of banks and hedge funds.In a June 11 statement, the antitrust watchdog said it had determined that “evidence does not indicate that either the transaction or the clearing agreement is likely to reduce competition substantially”.However, some of the same officials involved said in the letter that the department now believed that “the control exercised by futures exchanges over clearing services…has made it difficult for exchanges to enter and compete in the trading of financial futures contracts.”They recommended that Treasury “propose a thorough review of futures clearing and its alternatives”.“We would expect that a change in the regulatory regime that eliminated exchange control of the clearing function would facilitate the emergence of greater competition between exchanges,” the letter, signed by Thomas Barrett, assistant attorney general in the antitrust division, said.The department highlighted provisions in a law governing the futures regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, preventing the adoption of exchange or clearing house rules that “unreasonably restrain trade or impose a material anticompetitive burden on the markets”.“In the Department’s view, these provisions reflect Congress’s desire to stimulate competition between exchanges and between clearing organisations,” it said.The FIA, an industry body representing the biggest users of futures exchanges, welcomed the Justice Department’s call.“The FIA has consistently supported polices that promote competition in the futures industry,” said John Damgard, president. “We agree with the Justice Department’s recommendation that the Treasury Department review whether exchange-controlled clearing of financial futures best serves market participants and the overall competitiveness of our financial markets.”The scope of last year’s probe into the CME-CBOT merger was, among other things, to establish whether the combination – including the clearing arrangement - would unfairly shut out competitors. It did not address general reform of clearing in the futures industry.However, the conclusions and timing of the letter suggests that some in the Justice Department have long been uneasy about the way clearing is organised in the US.In contrast to the futures markets, clearing in the world of stocks and options is more commonly done by clearers that are independent, quasi-utilities, or partly owned by multiple exchanges.The CME lobbied heavily in Washington, arguing that its purchase of the CBOT posed no problems on antitrust grounds. Market users argued that the Department of Justice should make a loosening of the CME’s ownership of its clearing house a condition of approval – and were disappointed when this did not happen.About 70 per cent of CME Group’s revenue derives from trading and clearing fees.Terry Duffy, CME chairman, said on Tuesday that separating clearing from exchanges made little sense. “It has created nothing but efficiencies for the end-user customer and has had a zero default in its hundred-plus year system,” he told the FT. “Why anybody would think it’s a good idea to spin that out would be beyond me.”The CME on Tuesday reported a 96 per cent rise in net income for the fourth quarter.In Europe, moves are already under way to prise clearing and settlement away from exchanges in order to offer customers the ability to pick and choose among post-trade service providers.To back up its recommendations, the Justice Department cited two failed recent attempts by European exchanges - Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Boerse, and Euronext-Liffe - to prise business in some of the largest futures contracts away from Chicago’s exchanges as evidence that control of clearing unfairly shuts rivals out.They said that eliminating “exchange control of the clearing function would facilitate the emergence of greater competition between exchanges”.A clearing house guarantees that payments to be made under trades agreed by two parties are made, using collateral posted by the parties. Clearers make money by charging clearing fees, but also on the vast deposits lodged with them.The department’s letter was sent in response to Treasury’s request for public comment on a planned “blueprint” for reform of the US financial regulatory system.Robert Steel, undersecretary for domestic finance, will on Thursday update Wall Street on Treasury’s thinking in a speech in New York.While the justice department’s letter has no effect on last year’s approval of the CME-CBOT deal, it re-opens the sensitive issue of clearing ownership just as the CME is poised to acquire the New York Mercantile Exchange, further bolstering the CME’s dominance.However, the signatories to the letter - including George Baranko, an attorney central to last years’s CME-CBOT probe - said their comments did not apply to “energy futures markets” – a move apparently designed to indicate that the department was not prejudging the outcome of any probe into a CME-Nymex merger.Commenting on Tuesday’s letter, a spokesman for the Justice Department said: ”In its comments to the Treasury, the Antitrust Division recommended a study to determine whether the current regulatory structure for interest rate futures transactions could be improved in a manner that would make entry easier. In the CME-CBOT transaction, the Division investigated whether the transaction would substantially lessen competition, which involved a range of issues. Among other things, the Division noted that the CME’s products and CBOT’s products were not close substitutes and that neither firm was likely to introduce products directly competitive with the other’s established products. In connection with one issue, entry, the Division noted that, given the announced intentions of two exchanges to offer interest rate futures products, the evidence indicated that entry would not be foreclosed by the transaction under the current regulatory structure. The Division did not comment on the separate issue of whether the regulatory structure could be improved.”Additional reporting by Hal Weitzman in Chicago
1055;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;NYSE and CME announce record volumes;;Consolidation in the global exchange sector boosted earnings at US exchanges in the fourth quarter last year, with the New York Stock Exchange and the CME Group both announcing record volumes on Tuesday.Growth at the CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, has been fuelled by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade last year.Net income in the fourth quarter increased to $201m, up 96 per cent from the same period in 2006, while earnings per share for the quarter rose to $3.75, up from $2.91 a year earlier. Analysts said they had been expecting about $3.61.CME recorded its seventh consecutive year of record volumes last year. Total revenues rose 61 per cent from 2006 to $1.8bn, while net income rose 62 per cent to $659m.At NYSE Euronext, net income was $156m for the three months to December 31 2007, compared with $45m last time. The comparative results for 2006 reflected the operations of NYSE Group only.Its shares were down almost 9 per cent to $75.35 on worries that the predicted cost savings from last year’s merger between the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext would take longer to materialise because of NYSE’s recent acquisitions of Wombat Financial and the American Stock Exchange.
1056;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-04T19:43:50Z;Hefty job cuts expected if CME wins Nymex;;"The CME Group’s proposed takeover of Nymex would lead to a slew of job losses from the boardroom to the trading floor, with up to half the trading pits at the energy exchange likely to be closed within two years.While the CME will probably retain pits to trade options – one of the more complex areas of derivatives trading and hence more difficult to put on electronic platforms – the rest of the 136-year-old trading floor at the New York exchange could be closed within two years, according to those familiar with CME thinking.Electronic trading already makes up 80 per cent of trading on Nymex. The number of futures pit traders left at the exchange has dwindled and is thought to be less than 100, down from about 400 just under two years ago when Nymex went electronic. The exchange on Monday said it would disclose official headcount figures later this month.The CME – formed from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade last year – announced last week it was in exclusive 30-day talks to buy the New York energy exchange. The proposed cash-and-shares deal would create the world’s largest exchange, with an equity value of about $45bn, and control about 98 per cent of the listed futures sector in the US.The CME has said it will maintain a trading floor in the New York area, but many suspect it will sell the Nymex headquarters in the World Financial Center in downtown Manhattan and move the exchange – possibly to its disaster recovery site in Long Island.Because many of those on the Nymex floor are independent traders, they might well choose to leave the floor voluntarily rather than cling on after the takeover.“Except for options, there will not be a lot of people left on the floor,” says a former CME official. “They’re proposing to take over the memberships of the seats, which will hasten the decline of the floor because traders would have to rent trading access from the CME. That will be another reason for people to say: ‘I’m just going to take my money and get out’.”Scott Hess, a heating-oil trader on the Nymex floor, said many in the open-
outcry pits were worried about their futures. “There’s certainly anxiety – people are wondering whether they’ll stay in New York or have to move to Chicago,” he said. “A lot of the [lessees] have a tremendous amount of anxiety because they don’t have the financial resources.”The job cuts are also likely to affect Nymex’s board and staff. Terry Duffy, CME chairman, said “a couple of Nymex members” would get seats on the board of the combined company, but many observers suspect those will be kept to a minimum, because the CME has a very large board.The CME is also thought likely to look for substantial cost savings by cutting jobs in administration."
1057;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;CME bid for Nymex a ‘strategic decision’;;The CME group, the world’s largest futures exchange, which purchased the Chicago Board of Trade for $11bn last year, is intent on becoming the world’s largest exchange group through the $11.3bn acquisition of Nymex, the energy exchange. If a deal went through, it would create an industry group with a market capitalisation of $45bn and controlling about 98 per cent of US-listed futures.In the exchange sector, where consolidation has proceeded at a furious pace in recent years, the CME’s play for Nymex had been long expected, but fear of a dominant exchange with excessive pricing power has meant that the CME faces fierce opposition from traders and members of Nymex who hold trading rights.In their first interview since the announcement, CME chief executive Craig Donohue and chairman Terry Duffy say their proposal would be better for Nymex than merging with any other exchange. “We’re the best fit. It’s certainly a more seamless transition for them than any other combination,” says Mr Donohue.Nymex already uses the CME’s Globex system for electronic trading in futures and options. “Integrations can be disruptive but, given the relationship we already have, that makes it easier for the customers and provides them with efficiencies,” he says.“We also have a lot of customer overlap. We’re both pure-play derivatives exchanges with a well-developed clientele, which gives us a lot of synergy potential in terms of revenue and growth opportunities and cost synergies.”While they stress that the details will be worked out during the 30-day period of exclusive talks, Mr Duffy says he expects there will be room on the board for some Nymex officials. “You can get some expertise in the energy field that we may not have today that might fit with some of the Nymex directors,” he says.“We would have to add a couple of the Nymex members. I’m assuming they are going to want something but we don’t know yet what that number is.”The CME has said it would plan to keep Nymex’s trading floor open somewhere in the New York area although many suspect that, apart from options trading, much of it will be encouraged to migrate online. “There are different facets of our business where the floor is still a very important way for people to trade,” insists Mr Donohue.“Options is certainly representative of that. We trade so many different options – literally hundreds of thousands of different instruments – it’s not the same kind of liquidity you find in standardised futures markets, so they have tended to be slower to migrate towards electronic platforms.”Given that the purchase would solidify the CME’s dominant position in futures, it may well attract the attention of the Department of Justice’s antitrust division.However, given that the DoJ approved the CBOT acquisition, many observers suspect this deal will get nodded through. Mr Donohue says the CBOT purchase “was the first time the DoJ was presented with a major transaction in the derivatives markets”.“We spent a lot of time working with them to help them understand the market. Luckily, at this point, they know a fair amount about our business and that should be helpful should we find ourselves in another review with them.”Mr Duffy is dismissive of speculation that the timing of a deal was designed to ensure any review was completed before a change of administration in Washington.“It’s got nothing to do with it,” he says. “We’re not trying to do a trade based on the timing of administrations. We’re doing a transaction that is strategic in nature on our own timeframe.”“People think of that process as more politicised than it is,” adds Mr Donohue. “These issues are based on the technical merits of the staff review. You’re dealing with professional people with standards to apply.”Many observers have commented that a Nymex deal would leave the InterContinental Exchange (ICE) – Nymex’s main competitor, which proposed a failed, rival bid for the CBOT – somewhat isolated, and possibly an acquisition target itself.Mr Donohue appears to confirm that view. “Our industry is increasingly based on scale advantages,” he says. “A more narrowly focused exchange will have a harder time competing in the global marketplace.”
1058;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-02-01T22:29:15Z;Broker welcomes CME move for Nymex;;"Kevin Davis, chief executive of MF Global, the world’s largest independent broker of listed futures and options, welcomed the CME Group’s proposed takeover of energy exchange Nymex.“For us there will be more pros than there will be cons,” he said.MF Global is the largest broker on both the CME, the world’s largest exchange group, and Nymex.The two exchanges are in talks about an $11bn purchase. Nymex, the world’s largest energy exchange, already trades certain contracts on the CME’s Globex electronic platform.Nymex said the volume of such trading rose 91 per cent in the fourth quarter, fuelling market confidence that a merger between the two would be relatively easy because of their close ties.“We would expect to see reductions in our operating expenses, since we’d only be dealing with one clearing house rather than two,” Mr Davis told the FT.
“It would also be of benefit to us in terms of diversity of risk.”Nymex also said fourth-quarter profit rose 50 per cent, helped by the explosion in the volume of contracts it trades on the CME’s Globex.The higher trading volumes helped Nymex record net income of $63.5m, or 67 cents a share, compared with $42.3m, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier.Results included a $1.4m severance charge because of job cuts. Revenue grew 38 per cent to $172.6m.Meanwhile, the CME said its January 2008 volume averaged 14.3m contracts per day, up 65 per cent, recording its second-highest ever monthly volume amid volatile market conditions."
1059;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Consolidation ratchets up competition;;In the month since the “consortium of 12” unveiled a plan to challenge the CME Group’s dominance of US futures trading, much cold water has been poured on the idea.It is not hard to see why. There have been three such attempts in the past decade to loosen the grip of Chicago derivatives exchanges over the sector. None has succeeded.In addition to that poor record, the project lost its head just two weeks after the idea was first proposed when Paul Saltzman, chief operating officer of eSpeed, the brokerage, who was also acting as the new exchange’s chief executive, stepped down from both roles. It has hardly been a propitious birth.But the possibility that the fledgling consortium backed by some of the largest dealers might link up with the Intercontinental Exchange, a dynamic and fast-growing exchange with established liquidity and infrastructure, sets up the prospect of an intriguing industry battle.On one side would be a combined CME and Nymex, the world’s largest exchange group controlling 98 per cent of US listed futures, on the other a young, aggressive group with a point to prove.The ICE has already demonstrated it is not afraid of a fight with a bigger foe.Last year, the exchange launched an audacious bid for the Chicago Board of Trade, attempting to steal it from under the nose of the CME.Although the CME won that battle, it created bad blood between the two institutions.Many observers have commented this week that the CME’s bid for Nymex allows it to confront ICE in a more direct way, since Nymex and ICE compete for energy derivatives.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of the ICE, said on Thursday that the rapid evolution of electronic trading meant his exchange remained in a strong position despite the prospect of the CME taking over Nymex.He suggested that the trading structure at the Nymex was actually converging on that of the ICE, in that floor-based trading was increasing moving to electronic platforms.“We have always been at a competitive disadvantage to a floor-based exchange because we don’t have a floor,” he said. “We don’t have the brokers that are on the floor, we don’t have the information that disseminates from a floor …that is becoming less important.”Mr Sprecher said the CME’s proposed purchase of the Nymex “does not seemingly change the landscape in terms of the way we go to market in energy and the way that Nymex is increasingly going to market as an electronic participant”.He said the increasing importance of electronic trading strengthened the ICE, which has been all-electronic since its creation in 2000.The ICE chief appeared to dismiss speculation that his exchange might be interested in purchasing the Nymex.“Nymex has been available for sale for quite a long time and had presented quite an opportunity for people interested in the business,” he said. “The fact that it finally traded to somebody …was not a particular surprise.”“We’ve had opportunity – as has anyone in the market – for quite some time. There’s nothing in my mind compelling about the timing of this merger announcement for ICE.”With its announcement on Thursday that it will purchase YellowJacket – an electronic platform for over-the-counter trading that is dominant in weather contracts and also hosts natural power, gas and crude trades – ICE is looking to solidify its position in the lucrative and growing OTC market.One of CME’s main motivations in purchasing the Nymex is thought to be the New York exchange’s presence in clearing OTC trades.
1060;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-31T19:40:21Z;ICE begins move to rival CME and Nymex;;"The Intercontinental Exchange has held talks with a fledgling futures exchange backed by a posse of banks and trading firms with a view to forming a competitor to a combined CME Group and Nymex.Talks are at an early and informal stage, involving meetings between members of the new consortium and ICE management, according to people close to both sides.The new exchange, the working name for which is Four Seasons, remains in its early stages of development, with internal talks about the company’s management structure and interviews for the role of chief executive taking place.Both parties declined to comment.CME and Nymex said this week they were in merger talks.Larry Tabb, founder of US consultant the Tabb Group, said that in spite of the prospects of a CME/Nymex deal, ICE was in a good position, particularly if it could reach an agreement with the new exchange.“If the dealers backing the new exchange want a place to go, they could do worse than buying an existing exchange. If they come in for the ICE, they would immediately form a competitive platform.”The powerful group of companies backing the new futures exchange are Citigroup, Citadel, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse, eSpeed, Getco, JPMorgan, Peak6, and Royal Bank of Scotland.Consolidation has swept the exchange business in recent years, and talks between almost all exchanges and their competitors and peers are a regular occurrence as participants jockey for position.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of the ICE, said on Thursday that the proposed CME-Nymex deal “does not seemingly change the landscape” in trading, noting that the New York exchange had been moving towards electronic trading, bringing it closer to ICE’s all-electronic model.His comments came as ICE moved on Thursday to shore up its position in the over-the-counter sector with the purchase of YellowJacket, an electronic platform for OTC trades in energy and weather.Sang Lee, founder of US consultancy the Aite Group, said he would not be
surprised to see ICE become a target, but also did not rule out a bid for Nymex by ICE itself.But Mr Sprecher on Thursday appeared to dismiss the suggestion that his exchange might bid for its competitor, indicating that there had been plenty of chances for ICE to try to purchase the exchange, but it had chosen not to make an offer. “Nymex has been available for sale for quite a long time,” he said. “We’ve had opportunity – as has anyone in the market.”"
1061;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-30T22:07:49Z;CME’s Nymex bid set to trigger battles;;The CME Group’s $11.3bn bid for energy exchange Nymex is facing opposition from within the derivatives industry over concerns that it will create a dominant exchange with excessive pricing power.The CME could also be on a collision course with some members of Nymex who hold trading rights and feel that the CME’s proposal to buy them out for $500m understates the long-term value of the benefits associated with those rights. At least one hedge fund is thought to be looking at the option of threatening to sue the Nymex over the terms of the proposed deal.Patrice Blanc, chief executive of Newedge, a global broker based in Paris that is a member of both the CME and, through its US subsidiary, of Nymex, said he was troubled at how the purchase would affect the sector.“Competition in the US is disappearing fast,” he said. “It’s not good for futures commissions merchants like us. If there’s one American super-exchange, that’s problematic because we won’t have any competing exchange in the US.”While most observers expect a deal to go through, the concerns could force up the compensation CME has to pay for trading rights or complicate a deal.The CME Group – born of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade last year – is in exclusive 30-day talks to buy the New York energy exchange in a cash-and-shares deal that would create the world’s largest exchange, valuing its equity at some $45bn and controlling about 98 per cent of the US’s listed futures sector.The proposal has reopened wounds from the conflict that broke out between brokers and the CME over the CBOT purchase. Brokers fear they will get squeezed as exchanges build up their power and bypass them to deal with customers directly. Last month 12 financial institutions, including Citigroup and JPMorgan, announced plans to launch a rival derivatives exchange to challenge the CME.A CME spokesman would not comment directly on the complaints, other than to say that the exchange remained “focused on innovation, customer service and efficiencies to provide the lowest cost liquidity”.
1062;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-30T22:07:49Z;CME’s ambitions rile many;;"Some in the derivatives industry jokingly refer to CME Group as the Microsoft of the exchange world – a dominant, ever more-powerful company that many love to hate but is nearly impossible to resist.If CME is Microsoft, by extension Craig Donohue, the exchange’s CEO, is the Bill Gates of derivatives. Like Mr Gates, he is pursuing a strategy to make his company the biggest and most powerful in its sector. And like Mr Gates, he inspires emotions in the rest of the industry ranging from admiration and envy to fear and loathing.The CME’s every move seems to upset someone. Its $11.3bn bid for the Nymex, though long anticipated, is no different. While the exchanges themselves seem pleased with the proposed deal – a $11.3bn cash-and-shares offer – others are grumbling. Brokers and other futures commission merchants are complaining about the power of a “super exchange”; some energy traders worry about price increases and some brokers who trade on the Nymex could even move to another exchange to avoid the CME.A more serious immediate potential problem for the CME is a possible revolt from some of the 816 Nymex members who hold “Class B” shares, entitling them to 10 per cent of trading revenues if more than 90 per cent of volumes trade electronically. The CME wants to buy them out for $500m, but at least some members are thought likely to argue this does not compensate them adequately for the loss of long-term revenues.“If the CME were to be able to buy that out for $500m, that would be pretty cheap,” says the head of one firm that trades at both the CME and Nymex. “There’s going to be some resistance or litigation. The outcome will depend on how many shareholders object. If they’re in a minority, the CME might be able to force it through.”Another hiccup could be regulatory approval, but most observers say that will be no great problem given the approval of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade last year. Indeed, regulatory concerns could explain the timing of this deal ahead of US presidential elections in November.“This may have been the last opportunity for the CME and Nymex to get this done before a change of administration,” says John Lothian, editor of The John Lothian Newsletter, a derivatives markets daily briefing. “They’ve got a known quantity with the Department of Justice under the Bush administration …a Democratic or even a different Republican administration could take a different view.”The CME’s fractious relationships with brokers could bolster the development of a competitor and drive some liquidity away. Sources close to a new futures exchange being set up by a group of investment banks and trading firms said yesterday that an even larger CME was good for them, since it would stiffen the resolve of users to form a viable alternative.The head of a company in the over-the-counter energy market said antagonism between the CME and brokers could alienate some business from the exchange.“Nymex gets most of its volume through brokers and CME doesn’t have a good reputation of working with the brokers, so the over-the-counter volume might not all convey over to the CME,” he says. “They might go to ICE [Intercontinental Exchange, a rival to the Nymex] instead. These exchanges can do things that upset a lot of participants and move volume elsewhere. The customers haven’t pushed for this combination.”John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, representing the largest brokers, suggests opponents are keeping their powder dry during the 30-day exclusive negotiating period between the CME and Nymex. “This is going to be a quiet time, full of rumour and innuendo,” he says.Meanwhile, some critics hope another exchange will scupper the CME’s plans. “Just as when the CME went for the CBOT, I think we will see other players try to do something,” said Javier Loya, president and chief executive of Choice Energy in Houston, the largest liquidity provider on Nymex Clearport, the exchange’s electronic trading and clearing system. “This is just the beginning."
1063;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T08:01:05+0000;ICE in spotlight amid merger talks;;Merger talks between the CME Group and Nymex have raised the prospects that the Intercontinental Exchange, the main competitor to the Nymex in the energy trading business, will become an acquisition target.Potential bidders for the ICE include NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq, although overseas exchanges keen to gain a foothold in the rapidly expanding energy markets could also be interested, according to analysts.The ICE has been taking market share from Nymex and last year launched a counterbid for the Chicago Board of Trade. This move effectively raised the price the CME was forced to pay for CBOT before it eventually secured the all-Chicago deal to form the world’s largest futures exchange.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of the ICE, is seen as an aggressive operator. Sang Lee, founder of US consultancy the Aite Group, said he would not be surprised to see the exchange become a target, but also did not rule out a bid for the Nymex by the ICE itself. The ICE declined to comment.Several market insiders said Nymex and NYSE had been talking seriously about a combination until recently when talks appear to have broken down, opening the door for the CME. The departure of John Thain as NYSE chief executive, now head of Merrill Lynch, is not thought to have been a deal-breaker. NYSE Euronext declined to comment. Nymex did not return a call seeking comment.The fact that Nymex is already an active user of Globex, the CME’s electronic platform, is seen as the key advantage held by the CME over NYSE Euronext. However, the fact that the CME is based in Chicago might yet prove problematic for some Nymex members who worry about losing the Nymex trading floor.Javier Loya, president and chief executive of Choice Energy in Houston, the largest liquidity provider on Nymex’s Clearport electronic trading and clearing system, said the breadth of products that would be available on a combined CME-Nymex exchange would present a stiff challenge to the ICE.“The market’s always looking for liquidity and if you’re offering more services – like cross-margining between commodities, being a one-stop shop for clearing services – that’s a strong advantage,” he said. “If the CME can migrate some of the Nymex’s over-the-counter business to Globex, it will be a very healthy competitor to the ICE.”Exclusive 30-day talks between the CME and the Nymex do not ensure a deal, though people close to the talks said both sides were confident of reaching an agreement. The US Department of Justice is likely to examine the deal, although the relative lack of overlap between products traded on the CME and Nymex mean the deal is unlikely to face regulatory hurdles.Other stock exchange groups such as Deutsche Börse, which controls Eurex, have previously been linked with potential interest in Nymex.The German group refused to comment on Tuesday, although in a speech in Frankfurt late on Monday, Reto Francioni, the Börse’s chief executive, made it clear that his focus was mainly on organic growth.Michael Henry, capital markets analyst for Accenture, the consulting firm, said he would be very surprised if CME was the only bidder for the Nymex, despite the 30-day exclusivity agreement.If a CME/Nymex deal eventually happens, the only two remaining US independent pure commodities exchanges will be the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, both only trading wheat futures.Additional reporting by Hal Weitzman in Chicago, Ralph Atkins in Frankfurt and Javier Blas in London
1064;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-29T09:31:17Z;CME and Nymex;;The “C” stands for “consolidator”. CME Group, which already runs the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, is in talks to buy Nymex Holdings.Nymex’s shares jumped by as much as 9 per cent on Monday, but the news ought not to have come as a surprise. Nymex has been touting its attractions for months. Back in August, its chairman publicly speculated on the cost savings any buyer might reap.For CME, acquiring the world’s biggest commodities exchange fills a large gap in its product portfolio. About half of Nymex’s contracts are already traded on CME’s Globex system, reducing integration risk and also raising one barrier against any interlopers.One potential rival, NYSE Euronext, has recently replaced its chief executive. The new incumbent is already occupied with taking over the American Stock Exchange. And after a sharp fall in Nymex’s stock in recent weeks, it now looks a little more affordable – by the inflated standards of exchanges, at least. On Friday, its 2008 price/earnings multiple was 29 times, down from more than 60 a year ago and, finally, less than the CME’s 33 times. Those heady multiples, in themselves, put pressure on the CME to keep buying market share – it bought CBOT only six months ago. Under the mooted terms, 70 per cent of the Nymex price would be funded with paper.On the regulatory front, adding to the CME’s growing empire may also be easier while the present White House administration still clings to power. A deal could also satisfy baser instincts. With Nymex under its roof, the CME would pit itself in direct competition with Intercontinental Exchange, whose intervention in the CBOT deal helped drive up the price CME had to pay. Indeed, if Nymex really is taken out of play, ICE may quickly find itself in the sights of other predators.Post and read comments on this Lex
1065;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-29T01:14:33Z;CME in $11bn move for Nymex;;The CME Group on Monday confirmed that it is in preliminary talks to buy energy exchange Nymex for about $11bn in a deal that would solidify its position as the world’s most important futures market.Just six months after the CME acquired the Chicago Board of Trade for $12bn, the world’s largest futures exchange said it had agreed to a 30-day exclusive negotiating period with the New York Mercantile Exchange.The combined group would have a market value of about $60bn, making it the world’s largest exchange group by far. It would give the CME, which dominates the trading of agricultural and financial futures, a powerful position in fast-growing energy markets as well as in gold and silver through the Nymex’s Comex division.Market analysts have speculated for months that the deal would be a good fit because several Nymex benchmark contracts – for products including crude oil, natural gas and heating oil – already trade on the CME’s Globex electronic platform.Analysts cautioned that if the CME failed to strike a deal, a bidding war for Nymex would almost certainly result, with NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq among potential counterbidders.NYSE is currently integrating pan-European exchange Euronext and also agreed this month to buy the American Stock Exchange. Doug Atkin of consultancy Majestic Research said the NYSE had a lot on its plate, making it less likely to fight hard to buy the Nymex should the opportunity arise. NYSE and Nasdaq declined to comment.The US department of justice would likely examine a CME/Nymex deal on antitrust grounds. However, analysts said that it might face less resistance than the CME-CBOT deal because there is less overlap between products traded on the CME and Nymex. The CME and CBOT often traded the same commodities.Because of their existing relationship, a combination between the CME and Nymex is also likely to be easier from a technological perspective than if the exchanges had never worked together.For Nymex, the combination would help fend off competition from Atlanta’s Intercontinental Exchange, an electronic energy-trading market that has been growing its market share.Last month, Richard Schaeffer, Nymex chairman, said his company was not in merger talks with NYSE Euronext but that it was open to a merger, acquisition or being bought itself.Shares in CME fell 0.6 per cent on Monday to $625.78, while Nymex shares rose 8.7 per cent to $116.50. Under the terms being discussed, Nymex shareholders would receive $36 in cash and 0.1323 of a share of CME’s common stock in exchange for each Nymex share. That would value the deal at $10.9bn at Monday’s closing prices.The wave of consolidation sweeping the stock and derivatives trading business comes as smaller competitors struggle in an environment in which quality and speed of technology have become vital and expensive.At the same time, many investment banks worry that the smaller number of exchanges will give those that survive too much pricing power.Several efforts are under way by banks that are developing plans for their own exchanges on which they can trade with one another.
1066;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-28T19:30:37Z;CME casts its eye in Nymex’s direction;;The world’s biggest futures exchange did not even pause for breath. About an hour after the CME announced on Monday morning that it was in preliminary talks to buy Nymex, the company put out another statement, saying it had completed its electronic integration with the Chicago Board of Trade, which it purchased last year. As one $11bn acquisition was being digested, a fresh $11bn purchase was put on the plate to be swallowed.The exchange sector has seen a spate of mergers in recent times as smaller competitors are swallowed up and the larger players, who can afford the best technology, prosper.The pace of consolidation continues to be furious and speculation is rife. Recent deals have been signed involving exchanges including NYSE and Euronext, Nasdaq and OMX and the CME itself.This month, the NYSE agreed to buy the American Stock Exchange in the latest example of consolidation.The CME had widely been expected to target the Nymex. The New York exchange revealed last August that it had held preliminary discussions with both the CME and the NYSE Euronext, although uncertainty over valuations had prevented any agreement at that time.By moving from informal talks to an exclusive negotiation period with the Nymex the CME has not only got the better of a potential competitor, for the time being, it has also moved closer to a deal that is widely thought to make good business sense for both exchanges.First, the two exchanges have established a collaborative relationship. Nymex uses the CME’s Globex system for its electronic trading in all futures and options, giving the two a pre-existing built-in integration that had led many observers to conclude that a takeover was likely.Second, the CME has always made clear it was on the hunt for purchases. As a mature exchange with a strong brand, NYMEX represents a good opportunity. “The CME’s best bet to continue to grow is to acquire entry into pools of liquidity that don’t take time and money to develop,” says John Lothian, editor of The John Lothian Newsletter, a derivatives markets daily briefing.Nymex gives the CME the opportunity to tap into energy trading, a fast-growing area of the derivatives market, and a share of over-the-counter derivatives trading, something it has long coveted.Getting into energy enables the CME to square up to the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which has built up a strong position in energy and OTC trading. The CME and ICE have a fractious relationship: as the CME was moving ahead with its friendly takeover of the CBOT, ICE upset the cosy cross-town arrangement by making a surprise bid. The CME eventually had to pay a lot more than it had hoped and a fair amount of bad blood was created.“This looks like a great deal for CME, in that the company would be acquiring one of the two major players in energy at a very reasonable price,” Christopher Allen of Bank of America said in a research note.The CME’s purchase of Nymex may in turn force ICE to seek the support of a tie-up with a “big brother” exchange if it is not itself to become a target as exchange consolidation proceeds.For Nymex, which has made it clear that it does not see any future for itself as an independent exchange by touting itself as an acquisition target, a possible purchase by the CME at a 11 per cent premium on the share price is like the arrival of the cavalry at the eleventh hour.“The Nymex rank-and-file were getting frustrated that nothing was happening,” says one person close to the exchange. “They were concerned the CME wouldn’t pay such a high valuation. But with this valuation, everyone is thrilled. This deal is stone-cold locked.”Perhaps the only thing that might unlock it is regulatory intervention. The Department of Justice scrutinised the CME’s takeover of the CBOT after many in the industry raised antitrust concerns, arguing that the purchase gave the CME a near-monopoly in US futures. However, the DoJ ultimately approved the deal, saying neither the deal nor an existing clearing joint venture was likely to “reduce competition substantially” or impact innovation or barriers to entry.
1067;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-18T01:31:50Z;NYSE Euronext buys rival Amex for $260m;;NYSE Euronext on Thursday boosted its presence in US derivatives and exchange-traded funds by agreeing to pay $260m (£132m, €178m) to acquire the American Stock Exchange, putting an end to a century-long rivalry.Coming just weeks into the tenure of Duncan Niederauer as chief executive of NYSE Euronext, the deal shows he intends to follow the lead of his predecessor, John Thain, in pursuing expansion through mergers. The two exchanges have been in talks for months about a combination.The Amex has struggled to maintain market share in recent years amid a fierce battle for dominance between the NYSE and Nasdaq. Until the formation of the Nasdaq in the 1970s, the Amex had been the NYSE’s main competitor.The two had fought each other for corporate listings since the early 1900s, with their trading floors just a short walk across a graveyard in the financial district of downtown Manhattan.The Amex was once home to many large stocks, including the New York Times, but it has been forced in recent years to concentrate on smaller-cap stocks and, increasingly, the options market.The deal, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, bolsters NYSE Euronext’s presence in the US options, exchange-traded derivatives and structured products businesses, all of which are expanding rapidly.US options trading is dominated by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the International Securities Exchange, which between them control about 65 per cent of the market in equity and index options. A combined NYSE Euronext and Amex will become the third-largest US options trading venue.Mr Thain, now chief executive of Merrill Lynch, presided over several deals aimed at expanding the NYSE, including its merger with pan-European exchange Euronext, to create the world’s first transatlantic exchange. A reverse take-over of electronic exchange Archipelago took the NYSE public.A wave of consolidation has been sweeping the stock and derivatives trading business recently as smaller competitors struggle in an environment where quality and speed of technology have become increasingly vital and expensive.Recent exchange deals include those involving the NYSE. Others include Nasdaq’s deal to buy OMX and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s merger with the Chicago Board of Trade, creating the CME Group, the largest futures exchange in the world.At the same time, many investment banks are worried that the smaller number of exchanges gives those that survive too much pricing power. Several efforts are under way by groups of banks that are forming their own exchanges on which they can trade with one another, which could form a viable alternative to exchanges if they can generate sufficient liquidity.
1068;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-16T15:23:28Z;CBOE edges closer to flotation;;The US’s biggest options exchange took a critical step closer to going public on Wednesday when the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled in its favour in a dispute with the world’s largest futures exchange.The SEC upheld a decision by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, one of last big members-only exchanges, that would exclude former members of the Chicago Board of Trade – which was acquired by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange last year – from claiming a share of the CBOE once it demutualises.The wrangle has held up the CBOE’s plans to demutualise, which would pave the way for an initial public offering or for the exchange to be purchased.Since the CBOT created the CBOE in 1973, many of its members have held trading rights at the options exchange, which they claim entitles them to a share of the exchange when it demutualises. But in a private meeting of commissioners on Tuesday night, the SEC sided unanimously with the CBOE, which contends that the merger with the CME eliminates the exercise rights, since the CBOT effectively no longer exists.“The Commission finds that CBOE has articulated a sufficient basis to support its proposed rule change,” said the SEC in an announcement on Wednesday morning.Although it is a significant victory for the CBOE, the SEC’s ruling will not put the issue to rest. Attention now turns to Delaware, where former CBOT members - with the support of the CME - are suing the CBOE to have their trading rights converted into shares. John Noble, the judge hearing the case, halted proceedings in August, pending the SEC decision.The CME has downplayed the SEC action, saying the court’s ruling will ultimately prove decisive. But the SEC hit back on Wednesday at CBOT members who had said the watchdog should wait until the court had ruled before considering the issue. “The Exchange Act unambiguously places CBOE’s proposal firmly within the Commission’s authority and responsibility,” it said.Bill Brodsky, chief executive and chairman of the CBOE, said the ruling “should dispose of the claims in the class action in Delaware court,” but added that if it did not, “this places us in a very strong position to achieve a favorable resolution”.Speaking to reporters in Chicago on Tuesday, Mr Brodsky left open the possibility of a financial settlement between the former CBOT members and the CBOE to resolve the matter before the Delaware court makes its ruling. However, he added that in any case he expected the judge would only take a few months to reach a decision.The CME said it would press on with the court case, pointing out that the SEC had noted that “our consideration of the state law questions in this matter should in no way prejudice or affect the state court’s consideration of those questions”. The CME said in a statement on Wednesday that “the SEC has now agreed that the court, and not the SEC, has the authority to make the final decision”.
1069;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-11T00:21:21Z;Fledgling futures exchange chief quits;;Paul Saltzman, chief operating officer of brokerage eSpeed, and acting chief executive of a new futures exchange backed by some of the world’s largest derivatives dealers, surprisingly stepped down from both roles on Thursday.Mr Saltzman was to lead the new fully electronic exchange, due to launch in weeks, which is backed by financial institutions including Citigroup, Citadel, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch and designed to compete with the CME Group.Sources close to the new as yet unnamed exchange, which is run on eSpeed technology, said his role was always seen as an interim one and that all participants were fully behind the venture which remained on track to start business in the first quarter,The establishment of the new exchange throws down the gauntlet to the CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, which enjoys a near monopoly on many US derivatives contracts, particularly US Treasury futures.Mr Saltzman’s departure is seen by some analysts as an early blow to the plans for the rival exchange.Representatives of the exchange’s founders will meet as early as Friday to discuss the board composition of the new venture and select a replacement for Mr Saltzman and decide on other senior management appointments. Howard Lutnick, chief executive of eSpeed is expected to represent eSpeed at the meetings in place of Mr Saltzman.The founding firms also include: Bank of America, Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse, eSpeed, GETCO, JPMorgan, PEAK6, and The Royal Bank of Scotland.Through the exchange’s launch the founders, some of the leading users of the CME Group, aim to lower their trading fees compared to those paid to the CME Group, which is now the largest derivatives exchange operator in the US, enjoying something of a monopoly in many contracts. Each of the founding companies has an equity ownership stake in the new exchange.
1070;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-09T19:00:33Z;CME to halve trading times;;CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, will halve its electronic trading times in a move that could lessen the threat from a planned new exchange backed by some of the world’s largest derivatives dealers.The CME Group, formed by last year’s merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, will cut the time it takes for a futures transaction to trade on its Globex platform from 31 milliseconds to 16.5 milliseconds, through an upgrade to its electronic trading system.It will also reduce the minimum increment by which a quoted price can vary, or so-called ‘tick’ size, on three of its most actively traded interest rate contracts which could attract more users and reduce costs. It addition, it plans to allow so-called ‘block trading’ in an attempt to reduce the price impact for all users of the largest orders.The moves come only weeks after a group of twelve financial institutions unveiled plans for a rival exchange to the CME to counter its dominance in US Treasury futures in particular.The new challenger – as yet unnamed – is owned by institutions including Citigroup, JPMorgan and Barclays Capital and is considering ways to enter the US Treasury futures market.Craig Donohue, chief executive of the CME, said he regarded the new exchange as ‘serious competition’. However, he pointed out that similar consortia have tried and failed to break the group’s hold on the market.Paul Saltzman, acting chief executive of the fledgling exchange, said recently that the new venture had a better chance of success than previous efforts due to the nature of its backers, which includes some of the biggest traders in Chicago.Citadel, Getco and Peak6, all of which are based in Chicago and together provide a significant proportion of daily liquidity on the CME and other US exchanges, have signed up to the exchange. Other backers are Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Credit Suisse and Royal Bank of Scotland.Trading volumes on the CME have continued to grow, fuelled by market volatility. Terry Duffy, executive chairman of the CME, said market turmoil, as well as concerns about the credit standing of banks and other counterparties, was likely to lead to further volumes increases. “The mortgage issue is a very large one in the US and some banks are in very precarious situations in terms of their lending policy. The credit issue continues to be a big factor in the economic equation.”
1071;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-08T22:18:00Z;Banks throw weight behind BATS;;"JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have thrown their weight behind BATS Trading, the upstart platform that is taking market share from the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.It represents the first investment in an equity market centre by both banks for almost two years, and comes weeks after both were part of a group of 12 financial institutions backing a new futures exchange, planned to launch early this year, to compete with the CME Group.The two were among the founding members of the ISE Stock Exchange in April 2006.The moves show that investment banks do not want to be at the mercy of exchanges in the fees they are charged for trading certain securities.BATS Trading operates the BATS electronic communications network, which offers trading in US equity securities and has a market share of about 10 per cent in US equities trading, built up since its inception over the past two years.It is acknowledged as the third-largest US venue for trading equities. Its competitive pricing and speed have proved popular among traders and forced its two larger rivals to examine – and in some cases cut – fees and tariffs.Financial terms of the investments by Deutsche and JPMorgan were not disclosed.They join a host of financial institutions that have previously invested in BATS including Lehman Brothers, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Lime Brokerage, Wedbush Securities and Chicago-based trading house Getco.JPMorgan made an investment in BIDS Trading, another alternative trading system that focuses on the block trading market, last year, but BIDS is not in direct competition with the leading stock exchanges.Early last year, BATS began effectively paying banks and brokers to post liquidity on its system, a tactic that saw its share of Nasdaq share trading reach
14 per cent at the end of January 2007.The tactics attracted criticism from competitors, which claimed they were nothing more than a marketing ploy and unsustainable even in the medium term.Its market share has since held steady at around 10 per cent.In October last year, BATS said it was considering a launch in Europe."
1072;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-07T22:17:56Z;Exchange sector ‘to fragment’;;The global stock exchange industry will see continued fragmentation in spite of attempts to consolidate it by large sector participants, the head of the Nasdaq Stock Market has forecast.Bob Greifeld said more and more “exchange-like” institutions will emerge in the coming months and years, adding competition to the business. “Recent regulatory changes essentially allow electronic communications networks and other smaller players to compete,” he told the Financial Times.He pointed to the growing popularity of non-traditional sources of competition such as so-called “dark liquidity pools” – where investors trade outside the public markets – as evidence that in spite of a spate of exchange mergers, fragmentation was increasing.Mr Greifeld’s view of the future evolution of the business differs from his counterpart at the New York Stock Exchange, Duncan Niederauer, who has said he expects there will be four or five global players in the exchange space in three to five years along with a series of smaller players.Mr Greifeld said competition in the exchange industry was to be welcomed, as it ensured users’ oft-voiced fears of a pricing monopoly controlled by the largest players would not materialise.”I think we need to strike the right balance between fragmentation and centralisation,” he said.Several high profile mergers between exchanges have grabbed the headlines in recent years, with the New York Stock Exchange merging with Euronext to form the first transatlantic stock exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange merging with the Chicago Board of Trade to form the CME Group, and Nasdaq itself pusuing deals with OMX and buying the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in recent times.But at the same time, liquidity providers such as Liquidnet, Pipeline, ITG and a host of internal liquidity pools at investment banks are providing competition as worries persist among users that exchanges with too much market share can form monopolies.Mr Greifeld’s comments come as the Nasdaq said recently it had obtained clearance from The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) concerning Borse Dubai’s investment in Nasdaq, which will allow the US exchange to proceed with its plans to combine with Stockholm-based OMX. As part of the complex deal, Borse Dubai will sell all OMX shares it owns to Nasdaq while Nasdaq will make an investment in Dubai International Financial Exchange.Mr Greifeld said: ”There were many twists and turns to the OMX transaction, as anticipated, but we can now see a path to closure.”
1073;CME;CME Group Inc;2008-01-02T00:36:03Z;Rights wrangle clouds CBOE’s plans;;Bill Brodsky is a historian. Asked a question, the chairman and chief executive of the Chicago Board Options Exchange prefers to start his response some decades – and on occasion, a century or two – ago, before wending his way to the present.When making a point, he often jumps out of his seat in search of a reference in one of the histories of finance that line the shelves in his office. Rather than art, he collects old pictures of exchanges around the world.Mr Brodsky is keenly aware that 2008 is likely to be a historic year for the CBOE. For one thing, the exchange is celebrating its 35th anniversary.More importantly, it may be the year in which Mr Brodsky’s plans for transforming Chicago’s last big members-only exchange come to fruition. He would like to see the CBOE demutualise, a move that would pave the way for a possible flotation.Although the CBOE laid the groundwork by declaring itself a “for profit” organisation, demutualisation is on hold pending a cross-town wrangle with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which completed its purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade in the summer.Before the takeover, many CBOT members held trading rights in the CBOE, which they say entitles them to a share of the CBOE when it demutualises.The CBOE argues that the merger effectively eliminated the CBOT members’ eligibility to the exercise rights. The issue is pending a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission and is also before a Delaware court.Mr Brodsky’s assessment of the root of the problem is characteristically historical. “Exercise right eligibility was originally not clearly spelled out,” he says.“Thirty-five years ago no one dreamt that exchanges would ever demutualise. Once the CME acquired CBOT last July, our board concluded that former CBOT members no longer were eligible for the exercise right.”Chicago is rife with rumours of secret negotiations between the exchanges to settle the matter. Some speculate that both sides want to settle the matter promptly, others that the acquisition-hungry CME could use the dispute to reel in another local target.Mr Brodsky will not be drawn. “It’s all speculation,” he says. “No one knows for sure what will happen because I don’t know. And if I don’t know, no one knows.”If it can resolve the issue, the CBOE will become the US’s most high-profile lonely heart in a sector where the pace of consolidation is furious.As the country’s biggest options exchange and the world’s fifth-largest derivatives exchange by volume, it has benefited both from the secular growth in derivatives trading as well as from the recent turbulence in equity markets.“We are a highly desired partner for many major and larger exchanges,” says Mr Brodsky. “Two out of the three largest US options exchanges were taken over this year. There’s one that is not available at the moment but will become available at some point. We are an obvious partner or target.” One measure of how attractive a demutualised exchange will be is the dramatic rise in CBOE seat prices, which have increased from $299,000 in 2005 to $3.15m (£1.59m, €2.16m) in December as investors bet on a lucrative take-over deal in the near future.In the meantime, the CBOE is profiting as nervousness on Wall Street persists. Volumes [in 2007] were up about 40 per cent on 2006, in line with increases in the options industry as a whole. “One of the most important components of options pricing is volatility. It’s inherent in how options are valued and volatility is the fuel that stokes the fires of the options and futures markets globally,” says Mr Brodsky.“If markets are not volatile, these markets do not have the volume that they might otherwise have. It’s the ingredient that makes the difference between a very busy year and a ‘normal’ year.”Volatility has now become such a part of the overall market that the CBOE’s Vix index – the “fear gauge” – is almost as widely quoted in the media as movements in the well-known stock indices.“We have pioneered a suite of volatility products and they are just beginning to grow,” he says. “This is a major new development in the options business.”But is Mr Brodsky worried about volatility falling in the future? “What’s nice about our business is that even when it’s not volatile, we continue to grow, driven by the increased understanding of options by both retail and institutional investors.”Although he says the big growth in the industry will come from institutional investors, Mr Brodsky has a soft spot for retail investors.He has had many years in the exchange business, as head of options and then vice-president for operations at the American Stock Exchange and as chief executive of the CME for 12 years.But it is still retail investors who make him “as excited now as when I arrived here about the growth potential of our business”.
1074;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
1075;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-12-28T16:26:30Z;On Wall St: Rival to test Chicago’s futures dominance;;Three times in the past decade, rivals have tried to break the hold of Chicago exchanges on futures trading.Each time, they have failed.The first few weeks of 2008 will see another attempt, as a new futures exchange backed by some of Wall Street’s leading names including Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and JP Morgan launches amid growing fears about monopolistic exchanges hurting them on trading costs.The plans, unveiled this week, throw down a challenge to Chicago’s CME Group, the dominant force in futures trading, which enjoys a near monopoly on US Treasury futures trading in particular.It is not the first time Chicago’s pre-eminence in the trading of such contracts has been challeged.But what could make the difference this time around is the presence of three Chicago based trading companies among the founders of the new exchange that yield tremendous power in the fast, high-volume electronic markets of today.Chicago-based Citadel, the hedge fund, along with Getco and Peak6, the trading firms, transact massive volumes on stock and options exchanges around the world and in many cases serve as market makers.As such their presence as backers of the nascent exchange, gives the outfit a decent chance of establishing a liquid market.The other founders are Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and eSpeed, which will provide the technology platform.The US Treasury contract is likely to be important next year as volatility as a result of continuing credit concerns continues and the contracts are viewed as relatively safe haven buying opportunities.The CME said in response to the formation of the new exchange that its business ’thrives on competition’ and that it would continue to work to provide the lowest cost liquidity.But the fact banks and trading firms, many of which are currently leading users of the CME, are backing a competitive alternative, demonstrates how worried participants are about the formation of monopolies in which exchanges have the power to charge higher fees because they are the only viable source of liquidity.The entry of banks through ventures such as the new exchange means that despite consolidation, with several deals this year including the formation of the CME Group itself through the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Stock Exchange’s deal to merge with Euronext, the choice for customers of venues to trade on is actually getting bigger.A host of smaller players such as BIDS Holdings, which itself recently formed a joint venture with the NYSE, dark liquidity pools at investment banks, electronic communication networks and crossing venues are all gaining critical mass even as the number of traditional exchanges dwindles due to the number of mergers.Chicago’s history of protecting its position is well documented. ESpeed’s Cantor Exchange in 1999, BrokerTec in 2001 and Eurex US in 2004 all tried to loosen the CME’s and the CBOT’s hold but all failed. In the case of Eurex, which tried to compete on forex futures, the CME responded by slashing its fees, and promptly raised them as soon as the threat posed by Eurex was seen off.But, if other firms, many of which are in discussion with the new consortium about joining are persuaded that there are cost benefits, the new entrant could quickly build critical mass. And no matter their historical leanings, traders, particularly those working for public companies, will inevitably transact on liquid markets.At the very least, the venture fires a warning shot across the bows of the CME Group that it cannot have things all its own way.A host of other exchanges in the US and overseas are also seeking to bolster their derivatives trading capabilities and still further consolidation in the sector is expected next year. Both NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq, the two largest US stock exchanges have expressed their interest in growing their US derivative trading franchises and deals involving the two New York exchanges should not be discounted.Some analysts were moved this week to dismiss this latest effort of the banks to take control of their futures trading cost base as a rerun of failed efforts past or a token effort to ensure lower prices at the CME. ’While we never take competitive threats lightly and await more details on the new exchange, we are mindful that history is littered with failed US futures trading venues,’ Credit Suisse said in a note.But the timing together with the nature and clout of the backers suggests establishing a credible competitive alternative to the CME may not be the impossibility it once seemed.
1076;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-12-22T02:24:32Z;Consortium plans new futures exchange;;A group of financial institutions including Citigroup, Citadel, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch on Friday said they plan to launch a fully electronic futures exchange, intensifying competition in the US derivatives business.The move throws down the gauntlet to the CME Group, recently formed by the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.Through the launch the founders, some of the leading users of the CME Group, aim to lower their trading fees compared to those paid to the CME Group, which is now the largest derivatives exchange operator in the US, enjoying something of a monopoly in many contracts.US Treasury futures are expected to be the first product launched by the new exchange in 2008, with additional products anticipated later in the year.The founding firms also include: Bank of America, Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse, eSpeed, GETCO, JPMorgan, PEAK6, and The Royal Bank of Scotland.Each of the founders will take an equity ownership stake in the new exchange. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Electronic brokerge eSpeed will be the technology provider for the futures exchange, in a move designed to reduce transaction times.The consortium expects to appoint a chairman of the new exchange’s supervisory board in early 2008 and will also select a name for the new entity.Paul Saltzman, eSpeed’ current chief operating officer, will serve as acting chief executive officer as the exchange conducts a search process for its top management positions.A host of othe exchanges, including NYSE Euronext and the Nasdaq are also pushing to expand their presence in the lucrative
1077;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;TSX joins exchange race with Montreal deal;;TSX, the parent of the Toronto Stock Exchange, has agreed to buy the Montreal Exchange for C$1.3bn (US$1.3bn) in cash and shares in an important step towards resolving the regional fragmentation that has long bedevilled Canada’s securities markets.The Canadian deal also marks a further step in the rapid consolidation of securities exchanges. Competition between exchanges, particularly in the derivatives businesses, has forced many players to seek alliances.The two exchanges said on Monday that the merger would give the combined group, to be known as TMX Group, greater muscle for international expansion.The deal “will strengthen our impact in an increasingly borderless economy”, said Richard Nesbitt, TSX’s chief executive, who will head the combined company. “We are both looking to grow our businesses very significantly in the US.”Duncan Niederauer, the newly appointed chief executive of NYSE Euronext, said recently that just four or five global exchange groups would exist within the next few years. Regional US exchanges have now largely given up their independence, unable to compete with the speed and depth of the larger markets. The merger be­tween the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade to create the CME Group, a derivatives powerhouse, has pushed other exchanges keen to grow their US derivatives business, including NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq. Acquisitions, rather than organic growth, now top the agenda.Toronto has close to 4,000 listings and is the world’s twelfth biggest stock ex­change by trading values. Its main strength is in small- and mid-sized mining, oil and gas, and technology companies.But it has lost ground to New York, in particular, in listing and trading large North American companies, and faces competition from several alternative equity-trading systems.Under a 1999 rationalisation, Toronto became Canada’s sole exchange for trading in senior equities, while Montreal was given responsibility for derivatives. Both exchanges have numerous links with US markets. Montreal is in the throes of gaining a majority stake in the Boston Options Exchange.TSX set up a technology and clearing partnership earlier this year with the Chicago Intercontinental Exch­an­ge (ICE) covering natural gas and power markets.The New York Mercantile Exchange bought a 10 per cent stake in the Montreal exchange earlier this year as part of a partnership in trading and clearing oil, natural gas and electricity products. The Montreal group said that Nymex was “comfortable” with the TSX deal.Under the proposed deal, Montreal Exchange shareholders will own 18 per cent of the combined group. TSX shares were 5.6 per cent low­er at C$54 early on Monday.
1078;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-11-29T00:16:47Z;São Paulo futures exchange set to float;;The BM&F, the São Paulo futures exchange, will float on Friday on the São Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa), in what is expected to be another sign of huge investor interest in Brazilian assets.It follows the Bovespa’s own record-breaking IPO last month.Shares priced on Wednesday night at R$20 per share, at the top of the target range. At that price, the company’s market capitalisation would be about R$17.8bn ($10bn). CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, currently has a market cap of $33.2bn.The BM&F had planned to offer its shares in a range of R$14.50 to R$16.50 but this week increased its target range to R$18 to R$20 after greater-than-expected interest from investors during book building.The BM&F’s IPO follows the extraordinary IPO of Bovespa Holding, owner of the São Paulo Stock Exchange, whose shares gained more than 52 per cent on their first day of trading on October 26.If a supplementary offer is successful, the BM&F will sell 33.2 per cent of its shares, for a total of R$5.9bn. That would represent a substantial premium on two recent deals between the BM&F and strategic overseas investors.In September, the BM&F’s shareholders sold 10 per cent of its shares to General Atlantic, a US private equity firm that has taken stakes in several exchanges around the world, for R$1bn. General Atlantic paid R$900m up front with the remaining R$100m conditional on the BM&F’s IPO taking place before year end and on its subsequent market capitalisation exceeding R$12bn.Then last month the exchange swapped 10 per cent of its shares for 2 per cent of shares in the CME in a deal that valued the BM&F at R$13bn.Yet if the Bovespa floatation is any guide those values will be exceeded by a wide margin. The Bovespa offering was oversubscribed by about ten times and left the exchange with a market capitalisation of about R$24bn.Like the Bovespa, the BM&F has no competitors to speak of. Trading on the exchange can be expected to expand quickly if, as analysts expect, Brazil is given an investment grade rating next year.
1079;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-11-20T20:57:54Z;Tullow left behind as Footsie swings higher;;Tullow Oil missed out as the London market recovered a large chunk of Monday’s losses.As the FTSE 100 rallied 1.7 per cent, shares in the exploration and production company fell 5.5 per cent to 597½p after Dresdner Kleinwort advised clients to “sell”.“Tullow has been among the best performing E&Ps during 2007 following successful exploration in both Uganda and Ghana,” said analyst William Arnstein.“However, we believe that the shares have appreciated too far and that the future success implied in the price is far from guaranteed, let alone on the same scale,” he said.In the wider market, traders were left bemused and exhausted after a day of extreme volatility.London opened higher, rebounding from three days of weakness, but was soon in negative territory amid rumours of fresh writedowns in the banking sector. However, the market then turned around, rising 1.5 per cent during in the afternoon as Wall Street opened higher.By the close, the FTSE 100 was up 105.7 points, or 1.7 per cent, at 6,226.5 with dealers unable to come up with anything better than bargain hunting and rumours of an emergency rate cut from the Federal Reserve to explain the recovery from Monday’s losses.Lower down the market, the FTSE 250 advanced 95.4 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 10,499.9.Icap, the inter-dealer broker, led the market higher. Its shares jumped 12.9 per cent to 645p after interim results exceeded expectations and the company upgraded guidance for the full year.The stock was also helped by takeover speculation, with the CME Group, the world’s biggest derivatives exchange, the name in the frame.Property stocks were also in demand as they bounced back from Monday’s sharp losses. Land Securities advanced 7.3 per cent to £14.77, while British Land moved up 6.5 per cent to 873½p.On a more speculative tack, Rio Tinto added 2.2 per cent to £51.63 on rumours of a £65-a-share break-up bid led by CVRD of Brazil.In the banking sector, Barclays moved up 5.1 per cent to 516½p, while Royal Bank of Scotland improved 2.1 per cent to 412½p.Reuters, the news and financial information group, underperformed, however, falling 1.7 per cent to 600p. Traders said hedge funds were being forced to sell out of several “deal” names. Reuters is seeking to merge with Thomson, its Canadian rival.Scottish & Newcastle, the brewer which has rejected a 750p-a-share offer from Carlsberg and Heineken, eased 1.3 per cent to 729p after a weak third-quarter trading update.Traders said the share price fall also reflected S&N’s pledge to fight Carlsberg for control of Baltic Beverage Holdings, its east European joint venture, in the courts.Merrill Lynch said: “If S&N does win the arbitration, it mentioned that it is willing to introduce a minority partner. This will clearly be an opportunity for SABMiller. But this will remove the bid premium from the S&N share price, with potential significant downside for shareholders.”Paragon Group, the specialist mortgage lender, provided the main talking point in the FTSE 250. Paragon shares dropped 39 per cent to 125p after saying it was facing problems raising new funds and it might need to raise £280m from its shareholders.Software developer Misys was marked 3.4 per cent lower at 205p after Merrill Lynch downgraded from “buy” to “neutral”.“Misys is highly exposed to the two main risk factors affecting the market [currency and financial services exposure] but trades on a significantly higher multiple than its less risky peers,” it said.Gyrus, the medical devices company, firmed 0.3p to 609p. Japan’s Olympus Corporation, which announced a 630p-a-share recommended offer on Monday, revealed on Tuesday that it had raided the market and bought 20 per cent of Gyrus.Shaftesbury, the property company focused on London’s West End, rose 4 per cent to 560½p on stake-building rumours. Crédit Agricole declared a 5 per cent holding on Tuesday. Traders believe the stake could be a hedge for a client derivative position.
1080;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-11-16T10:11:13Z;Nationalism bites the dust;;Financial exchanges are the place to be. Even the chill gripping the world’s credit markets for much of this year has not stopped sharp rises in the share prices of global exchanges.The Dow Jones Global Exchanges index, which covers 22 exchanges across the world, most of which have been floated only in the past few years, gained 68 per cent in the first 10 months of this year. That followed gains of 76.8 per cent last year, 54.9 per cent in 2005, and 39.3 per cent in 2004. Since the index’s inception at the beginning of this decade, it has gained more than 1,000 per cent. This has been achieved over a period when the developed world’s stock markets have been almost flat.Meanwhile, the world’s financial centres have been full of speculation over exchange consolidation, as all the biggest names in the sector have sought to spread from their traditional territory, both geographically, and by moving into new asset classes. By reducing competition, leading clients of the exchanges worry that this wave of consolidation could lead to higher profit margins for exchanges – and higher prices for clients.This year saw the consummation of the merger of the NYSE Group, which controls the New York Stock Exchange, with the pan-European exchange operator Euronext, and of the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade to create the world’s largest futures exchange.The London Stock Exchange is still independent – despite a series of attempts by different suitors to buy it in recent years – and it looks as though it may stay that way after it succeeded in its own bid for Borsa Italiana.Further internationalisation is evident in the tri-continental deal that has seen Nasdaq of the US and Borse Dubai launch an agreed takeover of the Scandinavian exchange operator OMX.The sharp gains in share prices, and all the deal activity, are due in large part to advancing technology. Trading can be conducted much faster now, and at much cheaper costs for the exchanges.That helped prompt the realisation that exchanges, most of which had previously been run as mutual associations, can be very profitable.Much of the recent activity reflects a “one-off” adjustment to a world where exchanges exist to make a profit.But those technological advances threaten the long-term future of the bourses. They make it much easier for new forces to enter, avoiding traditional exchanges altogether. Currencies and government bonds, among the main asset classes, have always been traded without the aid of an exchange.In recent years, the market for credit derivatives, which started as an attempt by big banks to swap their exposures to big clients, has exploded. The credit crisis that started this summer demonstrated its importance. Credit is also largely traded over the counter.But even exchange-traded assets can now be traded elsewhere – notably the market for cash equities, where banks are forming trading consortia to drive down costs, or at least force the exchanges to lower the prices they charge.The trend shows up clearly for the New York Stock Exchange, still the world’s largest, which handles a much lower proportion of the transactions involving its listed stocks than it once did. In September of this year, it executed only 56.1 per cent of trades involving NYSE-listed stocks, down from 69.3 per cent a year earlier, and 78.6 per cent in September 2005.For now, this does not matter because total volumes are growing so rapidly. Average daily volumes on the NYSE are still running at a slightly higher level than they were a year ago, despite the loss of market share.But it is obvious that new technological platforms pose a grave long-term threat to exchanges. They also threaten the very notion of a financial centre.Traditionally, the concepts of exchanges and financial centres went hand in hand. For markets to work, all the participants needed to gather in the same place, which meant that they would also maintain their offices nearby.But that is no longer the case. The battle for supremacy between London and New York garners the most column inches (at least in London, if not New York). But an ever-increasing share of the revenues created by burgeoning trading volumes is going to new and different financial centres.This is partly to do with the growth of the emerging world. Shanghai’s stock exchange has grown remarkably in the last two years, as have the main exchanges in India, while Brazil’s Bovespa became the first quoted stock exchange in Latin America last month. Its initial public offering was so successful that it commanded a higher market value than established exchanges such as the LSE or Nasdaq.Small offshore centres have long been able to build up business by specialising, and by exploiting tax advantages. Bermuda’s insurance industry is one example, as are fund management centres in Dublin and Luxembourg.But it is also now possible deliberately to start new financial centres from scratch. Dubai is the most startling, and so far most successful, example of this. Its success in bidding for OMX, and the huge development of hotels and other real estate in Dubai itself, show what is possible.Other centres are now trying to get in on the act. For example, in the Dominican Republic, the government is backing an ambitious attempt to build a new financial centre for Latin America, which would be set on a greenfield site close to some of the island’s best beaches.Gaetan Bucher, the Dominican businessman who is leading the effort, spent years researching other financial centres before unveiling the plans. His findings on the drivers of competition are revealing: “There are five key points we found that make a financial centre work: regulation, its economic position, human resources, infrastructure, and finally the positioning or branding of the centre itself.”Most in the list is not surprising, but Mr Bucher’s fifth category, which comes down to quality of life issues, might cause some surprises. But even this makes sense.Now that there is no longer a need to be physically close to other traders, quality of life becomes more of an issue. As neither London nor New York boasts an ideal climate, rival centres in Bermuda and the Caribbean start to become much more substantial threats.The cost of living could also be important. London’s current prosperity owes much to the success of the City, but its growing reputation as an expensive place to live may make it harder to persuade businesses to relocate there. Similarly, the weakness of the dollar might help centres such as New York and Chicago, simply because they become cheaper places to operate.But some notions of a financial centre remain, even if technology means that such places no longer need to be focused around an exchange. Traders, and investment bankers, and others in the financial world, tend to gossip. Recruiters want a pool of talent on their doorstep, without needing to move new recruits from overseas.Such factors have plainly helped London in recent years. Once established as the biggest financial centre in western Europe, it was that much easier to bill itself as the centre used by businesses in eastern Europe and the Middle East.Other traditional notions, however, seem much less important. Why, for example, is ownership still thought to make any difference?London has grown as a financial centre even though few City businesses remain in British hands.Many in the City plainly believed that an independent LSE was vital for London’s competitive position. And yet the success of Euronext in snatching control of Liffe, London’s financial futures exchange, has done nothing to impede the City’s growth.Euronext was controlled from Paris at the time, and is now part of the New York-based NYSE Euronext group, but London has continued to benefit from increased trading volumes.It was the LSE’s failure to seize Liffe that, investment bankers say, condemned it to years as an acquisition target. But its failure inflicted no damage at all on London.The on-going soap opera of consolidation matters greatly to the shareholders of the exchanges involved. But it has little relevance for the balance of power between the world’s financial centres.
1081;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-11-16T10:11:13Z;Latin America outlook: Bovespa float inspires other exchanges;;There could be no better demonstration of the rising power of emerging market financial centres than the extraordinary flotation last month of Bovespa Holding, owner of the São Paulo Stock Exchange.Following its success, directors at the BM&F, the São Paulo futures exchange that plans to float before the end of the year, are “extremely animated” at the prospects for their own initial public offering, according to one official.Not to be left behind, the Cetip, which registers deals in the Bovespa, is preparing its own IPO. Further north, the Mexican Stock Exchange in August announced plans to float.The world is awash with liquidity and emerging market assets are offering both high returns and a safe haven. Yet even in that context, the build-up to the Bovespa’s IPO was breathtaking.Two days before book-building closed, the target range for its share price was increased from R$15.50–R$18.50 to a new range of R$20.00–R$23.00. In spite of protests from some brokers that the increase would limit upside on the first day’s trading, shares began trading on October 26 at the top of the new range.Brokers need not have worried. By the end of the first day, the shares had gained more than 52 per cent (easily a record for a first day’s trading) to close at R$34.99. Trading in the Bovespa’s shares alone that day was worth R$5.1bn – more than the daily average, for the year to date, of trading in all other shares on the exchange.Bovespa Holding’s market capitalisation is now about $13bn. The Nasdaq, by comparison, is worth a little more than $5bn. The mighty NYSE Euronext, the world’s biggest exchange group, is worth about $24bn – but companies trading on the NYSE and Euronext had a combined value of about $20,200bn in September, compared with $1,200bn for companies trading on the Bovespa.Numbers such as these bring to mind phrases such as “irrational exuberance” and “internet bubble”. Indeed, officials have begun muttering in private that investors need to take more care.Yet investors do have strong arguments on their side. NYSE Euronext itself took part in the flotation, buying a 1 per cent stake in Bovespa Holding for $90m. “This investment is part of our overall expansion strategy,” it said. “Brazil is one of the most dynamic regions in the world.”Brazil is enormously dynamic. Average daily trading on the Bovespa has leapt from R$558m in 2002, less than $200m at the time, to R$4.6bn in the year to date and R$6.7bn in October.There could be much more to come. The Bovespa has no competitors to speak of. Brazil’s capital markets awoke from years of slumber in 2004 and IPOs are running this year at a rate of more than one a week. Some 45 primary and secondary share issues are pending at the CVM, Brazil’s securities commission.But the real boost could come next year, when Brazil is widely expected to be given an investment grade rating by the big ratings agencies. That would open Brazilian equities to a whole new class of high quality investor and, potentially, to a flood of more money.Many analysts expect average daily trading, in those circumstances, to double to R$9bn. The Bovespa’s profits, which were R$243.7m during the first half of this year, up from R$274m for the whole of 2006, are expected to react accordingly.The BM&F, already the world’s fourth biggest futures exchange by average daily number of contracts, can be expected to ride that wave. It, too, has no competitors and is already attracting interest from big international investors. In September, its shareholders sold 10 per cent of its shares to General Atlantic, a US private equity firm that has taken stakes in several exchanges around the world, for R$1bn. General Atlantic paid R$900m up front with the remaining R$100m to follow on condition that the BM&F’s IPO took place before year-end and that its subsequent capitalisation should exceed R$12bn.Last month the CME, the world’s biggest futures exchange, followed suit, swapping 2 per cent of its own shares for a 10 per cent stake in the BM&F, in a deal that valued the São Paulo exchange at R$13bn. If the BM&F’s IPO is anything like the Bovespa’s, that valuation could easily double.Are there no black clouds to darken the horizon? Brazil’s IPO fever owes much to improved governance and regulation and to macroeconomic factors such as Brazil’s new-found economic stability and a solid cushion of about $165bn in foreign reserves.But two factors put these and other considerations in the shade: commodity prices and international liquidity. While those remain strong, there is little chance investor confidence will be shaken.Yet inflation has begun to creep up. In recent months the central bank first slowed then halted two years of interest rate cuts. In spite of record oil prices, the US Federal Reserve has continued to cut rates, showing more concern over the threat of recession than of inflation. Should central bankers be forced to step on the brakes, global conditions could change. Then Brazil’s financial centres might find themselves less out of kilter with the rest of the world.

10 per cent of Brazil’s Mercantile & Futures Exchange for R$1.3bn ($742m).NYSE Euronext already has a 5 per cent stake in India’s National Stock Exchange and a strategic alliance with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is expected to go public in 2009.Bovespa raised $3.7bn in its initial public offering, with about 80 per cent of interest in the several times subscribed offering coming from overseas investors.Soaring demand for emerging market assets has lifted the stock more than 40 per cent since its debut, giving the company a market capitalisation of some R$23bn.Daily trade volumes on Bovespa, the region’s largest exchange, have averaged R$6.6bn this month, compared with a daily average of R$4.5bn year to date and R$2.4bn in 2006.Brazil is widely expected to get an investment grade rating from the big agencies in the coming months, which would open its assets to investment from large foreign institutional investors.Nuno Camara, Dresdner Kleinwort’s senior Latin American economist, said Brazil was one of the strongest economies in the region.“This is a country that has really got its act together, and one that is extremely well-positioned to weather any storms in the external environment,” he said.Additional reporting from Jonathan Wheatley in São Paulo"
1083;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;CME in wave of growth outside the US;;CME Group, the world’s biggest derivatives exchange, on Wednesday signalled a wave of international expansion, strengthening its presence in Asia and taking its first step into Latin America.The enlarged group, created from the $11bn merger between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade in July, has seen trading volumes boom as volatility on Wall Street in recent months has spurred greater interest among investors for using derivatives to spread risk.CME announced this month it had already traded a record 1bn contracts this year on its electronic trading platform.The international forays comes as critics question whether the group’s current growth rate is sustainable. “With our historic merger with CBOT now complete, CME Group is continuing to aggressively execute our global growth strategy in important emerging markets,” said Craig Donohue, chief executive.CME signed a deal on Wednesday with the Korea Exchange to list the benchmark Kospi 200 futures contract on its electronic trading platform from next year.Mr Donohue said the Korean agreement was just one of a number of expansion opportunities in Asia. “We’re very broadly focused on Asia,” he said. “We’ve been very active in Japan, China, India and now Korea. We have a multitude of different growth initiatives throughout Asia.”Asia is attractive to the CME because it will add extra volumes during US after-hours trading, when its electronic trading platform has excess capacity.CME also announced a cross-equity deal with the Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange, the largest derivatives exchange in Latin America and the fourth-biggest in the world.Under the terms of the all-paper deal, the first of its kind between a US and a Latin American exchange, CME will take a 10 per cent stake in BM&F in exchange for a 2 per cent holding, a deal valued at some $700m or R$1.3bn. It comes in the run-up to an initial public offer of shares in the BM&F expected to take place by the end of the year.Officials declined to comment on the implication of valuing 10 per cent of the BM&F at $700m so soon before its IPO but the deal can be expected to set a new floor for the issue price.Last month BM&F’s shareholders sold 10 per cent of its shares to General Atlantic, a US private equity firm that has taken stakes in several exchanges around the world, for R$1bn, paying R$900m up front and the remaining R$100m on condition that the BM&F’s IPO should take place before year end and that its subsequent market capitalisation should exceed R$12bn.Mr Donhue said on Wednesday the BM&F deal was a growth opportunity “not just in new products, but in expanding the use of core products by Latin American investors … Latin America is a developing market. There’s a lot of business we can capture there as those markets are developing, opening and maturing.”The CME on Wednesday reported third-quarter net income up to $201.6m from $103.8m a year ago. Excluding merger-related expenses, earnings per share came in ahead of analysts’ expectations at $4.31.The company’s shares were up 2.7 per cent at $651.90 in the last hour of New York trading.

It is headed by Michael Tokarz, a former Kohlberg Kravis Roberts general partner.MVC’s latest investments include Ford dealerships in Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands and a pasta manufacturer in North Dakota.The establishment of the first US financial services firm with Chinese investors part-headquartered in Chicago is another sign of the Midwestern city’s growing importance as a global financial and commercial centre. A second office is to be set up in Purchase, New York.Richard Daley, Chicago mayor, recently has been pushing his city as a destination for Chinese investment.Mr Melamed was a driving force behind the CME’s purchase this year of the Chicago Board of Trade, creating the world’s largest combined derivatives exchange and clearing house.Chicago’s futures exchanges have been forging ties with the Dalian Commodity Exchange and the Shanghai Futures Exchange.Mr Stevenson is chairman of the Midwest US-China Association, formed in 2004 and whose mission is to attract Chinese investment to the Midwest.“HuaMei is a start-up, but our relations developed in China over many years, in many venues and now with China Merchants, give HuaMei an unequalled potential for execution and origination of transactions through China,” he said.In addition, MVC gave the new joint venture “institutional links” in Japan and other countries.Additional reporting by Richard McGregor in Beijing"
1085;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;New push in Nasdaq’s painful global campaign;;Nasdaq’s attempt to expand outside its US home market has been painful.Soon after he joined the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2003, Robert Greifeld’s first big decision as chief executive was to shut Nasdaq Europe two years after it was created with the takeover of Easdaq. A year earlier Nasdaq had closed its Japanese operations.As for its attempt to buy the London Stock Exchange, it got nowhere. The LSE’s management, led by Clara Furse, the chief executive, refused even to meet Nasdaq after it launched a $3.7bn (£1.8bn) hostile bid. LSE shareholders were hardly more impressed and Nasdaq was forced to abandon its bid in February. Nasdaq also struck a deal with OMX to buy the Nordic exchanges group, only to have this broken up by a rival offer from Borse Dubai.On Thursday, Nasdaq tried again. First Nasdaq has agreed to sell its 28 per cent stake in the LSE for more than it paid. Then, Nasdaq will allow Borse Dubai’s higher bid for OMX to prevail.It will then acquire the Nordic exchanges business from Borse Dubai in return for a 20 per cent stake in the enlarged Nasdaq.In return, Borse Dubai will proceed with its own bid for OMX but give the Nordic exchanges business to Nasdaq on completion of the bid. Borse Dubai will then get a 19.9 per cent stake in the enlarged Nasdaq and $1.7bn (£850m) in cash.In the four years since he called time on Nasdaq Europe, Mr Greifeld has presided over what one analyst recently called the “most impressive turnround story in the capital markets”. But until now, a big foreign deal has eluded him.Nasdaq’s fortunes have contrasted sharply with those of its main US rival, the New York Stock Exchange, which bought Archipelago, the electronic exchange, then went public and succeeded in buying Euronext, the pan-European exchange.This deal established the NYSE Group and John Thain, its chief executive, as the main driver of consolidation among exchanges, in the eyes of most observers.Magnus Bocker, chief executive of OMX, said on announcing the planned merger with Nasdaq earlier this year that the tie-up reflected the shape of stock exchanges of the future.“It will be borderless. It will be extremely dependent on technology. It will move at high speed,” he said. “Monopolies are disappearing.”Nasdaq has made some progress in laying the ground work for future global expansion and already has memorandums of understanding with the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Korea Exchange and Jasdaq, all of which could be turned into more formal alliances.For the NYSE Group and Nasdaq, the main target for future growth is likely to be the rapidly expanding derivatives market, a market in which both have acknowledged they are under-represented.
1086;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-09-06T04:13:13Z;Icap volumes leap amid volatility;;Icap, the inter-dealer broker, on Wednesday said volatility in global markets led to a 51 per cent increase in dealing volumes on its electronic platform in August, with average daily volumes hitting $945bn (£468bn).Icap said electronically-traded spot foreign exchange and fixed income contracts showed the strongest growth. Spot foreign exchange hit $456bn in a single day – exceeding the day record by just shy of 50 per cent.Dealing in fixed income for the month of August was up 42 per cent from August 2006 to $703bn.Michael Spencer, chief executive, said: “The record volumes in FX and fixed income electronic broking highlight Icap’s position as a trusted liquidity source in these volatile markets.”While the growth was impressive, some derivatives exchanges have reported greater year-on-year volume growth. CME’s August volumes were up 78 per cent year-on-year, while volumes at Eurex rose 64 per cent.Analysts at Numis, where Mr Spencer is chairman, pointed out that the August volume growth came even after June volumes in electronic broking were up 32 per cent on a year ago.“Icap’s electronic volumes are strong as expected given recent market volatility,” said Rupak Ghose, an analyst with Credit Suisse.Icap’s volumes typically benefit from market volatility but the share price often fails fully to reflect that because of concerns about its exposure to the dollar. Icap derives about half of its revenue from the US.The shares fell 15p to 498p.
1087;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-08-30T14:33:47Z;CME Group raises ante over rival’s ownership;;The CME Group on Thursday intensified the battle over the future ownership of the rival Chicago Board Options Exchange by lifting a cap on its legal expenses and buying disputed purchase rights.The CBOE is one of the few remaining mutually-owned exchanges, but its plans for an initial public offering that could value the group at more than $3bn have been effectively blocked by the simmering dispute with the CME.The CME argues that some members of the Chicago Board of Trade, which it purchased in July, are entitled to a payout from any sale or IPO of the options exchange through their control of so-called exercise rights in the CBOE.The CBOE argues that the exercise rights were voided by the merger of the two Chicago futures exchanges. The matter is currently before a court in Delaware.The CME said had lifted the $15m cap on its legal defences in the dispute, and announced it had spent almost $40m buying 159 of the 1,331 exercise rights from CBOT members in a tender offer which formed part of the merger agreement.The prospect of an IPO and a surge in trading volumes lifted the price of a CBOE seat to $2.7m earlier this month, though the CME is paying just $250,000 for each of the trading rights. The remaining holders of the exercise rights would be entitled to any sale proceeds if the CME’s legal action succeeds.The sales suggest the sellers expect either a protracted legal battle or a negative court ruling. Both sides have expressed confidence that the court will rule in their favour.The CME, which this week announced it would close some of its open-outcry pits in favour of electronic trading, also revealed the results of a tender offer used to sweeten its bid for the CBOT in the face of a competing offer from the Intercontinental Exchange.A recent rally in its share price – helped by the expectation of savings from the trading floor changes – helped trim demand for the buyback. It spent $922m repurchasing shares at $560 each – just below Wednesday’s close – having committed up to $3.5bn for the buyback.After peaking at $609.96 earlier this month, CME shares had fallen below the level of the tender offer as part of a broad sell-off in exchange stocks, despite the record volumes generated by the recent market turmoil.Analysts now expect synergies from the CME-CBOT deal to surpass expectations following the consolidation of their two trading floors next year in the Chicago Board of Trade building.The shift from open outcry to electronic trading in most contracts will see some pits closed altogether, including the frozen pork belly arena which was once one of its most hectic venues. Some currency-trading pits will be consolidated, though the venues for some equity options – complex products which are more difficult to trade on the screen – will be expanded.
1088;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-08-27T22:23:49Z;Volatility helps big jump in derivatives trading;;As the markets brace themselves for more casualties following the recent turmoil, one corner of the financial world has seen record volumes.The world’s international derivatives exchanges have seen volumes jump sharply because of the volatility as investors have used instruments such as equity derivatives to protect themselves from wild market swings.Investors can, for example, buy options to sell at a certain price to avoid big losses.The market turbulence has provided the exchanges with a golden opportunity to challenge the much larger market in over-the-counter, or private bilateral deals, as investors reassess counterparty risk and seek the advantages of centralised clearing. The exchanges also provide the certainty of valuations from assets marked-to-market one or more times a day, unlike the more opaque OTC markets.In short, the key longer term question is whether a change in the attitude to risk offers the opportunity for a step change in exchange competition with the OTC markets, which are dominated by the leading investment banks in everything from interest rate swaps to currencies and even mortgages.The newly enlarged CME Group, Deutsche Börse’s Eurex arm, and others have already set out their stalls in targeting a share of an OTC market that still accounts for 85 per cent of derivatives trading.“This is a great opportunity for us,” says Craig Donohue, the CME’s chief executive, who has said the exchange is seeking to change the “status quo in some OTC markets” by leveraging the attractions of centralised clearing. In particular, the exchanges are targeting business from hedge funds in products such as interest rate swaps, currencies and – the industry’s big hope – credit derivatives. The strategy has already caused rancour among some banks, whose reluctance to participate has led to a sluggish start for the credit derivatives offerings from the CME and Eurex, though product design has played a part.“This is not an overnight thing,” says Robert Koraj-czyk, professor of finance at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, noting that tailored OTC and exchange-traded products can be imperfect substitutes.Mr Donohue accepts the challenge but insists “it’s not that difficult” for innovative designs to bridge the gap, though securing market acceptance could be a lengthy process. “This gives us a new platform for marketing [the exchange model],” says Mr Donohue of the market turmoil, though the CME is only in the early stages of deciding whether to rejig its pipeline to focus on more OTC launches.Resources and potential regulatory reform provide two key barriers to the ability of the CME and others to roll out more OTC-like products. While executives tout the scalability of their clearing houses, volumes of existing equity, commodity and interest rate products continue to grow at around 25 per cent a year.The ability of the exchanges to expand their clearing infrastructure is limited by the potential for a customer revolt as well as any emergence of a low-cost rival, which could claim market share like Bats has in the cash equities market.US exchanges are also wary that claiming a large share of the OTC market could affect their self-regulatory status, heightening calls for fungibility or even treatment as banks, complete with Basel II capital requirements. “I don’t see them getting that large,” argues Mr Korajczyk, who says it is the OTC markets that are likely to face more scrutiny – witness the recent Congressional focus on their role in the energy markets – providing exchanges with another marketing lever.
1089;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-08-22T18:28:56Z;Nymex held talks with CME and NYSE;;A two-way tussle for control of the New York Mercantile Exchange is likely to be deferred until later this year after the energy and metals-trading specialist unexpectedly revealed it had held takeover talks, market experts said on Wednesday.The NYSE and the CME have both held preliminary discussions with the exchange in recent months, according to people close to the situation, but uncertainty over valuations had prevented any agreement.However, Nymex chairman Richard Schaeffer disclosed more details during an investor briefing hosted by Deutsche Bank on Tuesday, forcing the exchange to issue a statement after the market close.“They’ve been out there flogging themselves for the past few months,” said one banker familiar with the situation. “Obviously nothing is happening.”The Nymex is valued at around $11bn following last year’s flotation, and had retained JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch to explore a sale or other options during a period of intense consolidation within the futures exchange sector.The NYSE and the CME, fresh from their takeovers of Euronext and the Chicago Board of Trade, respectively, are viewed as frontrunners if a sale process emerges.John Thain, the NYSE’s chief executive, has stated his intention to expand in US futures, fuelling speculation of interest in the Nymex or the Intercontinental Exchange.However, any bid for Nymex would have to overcome potential opposition from the CME, which has based its energy strategy around a 10-year alliance with the energy exchange, which runs through 2016.Nymex, which competes with the ICE for leadership in the global energy trading market, now lists its oil, gas and metals contracts on the CME’s electronic trading platform.The move has sparked a surge in volumes and seen more than three-quarters of its trading migrate to the screen. The switch has opened the potential for huge cost savings from reduction in the size of its trading floor and the sale of its New York headquarters.Nymex had already signalled actions in the second half to take costs from the floor business, and said in its statement that a “business combination” could generate annual cost savings of $250m, with the sale of its headquarters fetching $500m.Shares in Nymex climbed almost 8 per cent to $126.35 by midday in New York.Mr Schaeffer said any deal would be at a “meaningful premium” to its share price, which analysts said already included a takeover premium.Exchange valuations have slumped in recent weeks, despite the market turmoil which has fuelled record volumes, and bankers said it was difficult to fix a price on the Nymex in the current climate, despite its attractive business and potential cost savings.The CME said it was focused on executing its alliance with the Nymex, and declined to comment on any talks, a position shared by the NYSE. Deutsche Börse, which had also been linked with potential interest in the Nymex, also declined to comment, though its shareholders have told management not to pursue further deals after its agreed purchase of the International Securities Exchange, the second-largest US options platform.
1090;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-08-21T19:04:46Z;Exchanges/volatility;;Debating what the future holds for futures can result in some pretty confusing conversations. It can also mean some wild price swings. Since August 8, shares in futures exchanges including Nymex, Intercontinental Exchange, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have suffered double-digit percentage drops, compared with a 3 per cent fall in the S&P 500.That might seem odd. In the same period, the Vix index – a measure of volatility in US equities – has increased by 18 per cent, while commodities have also been choppy. Volatility ought to be good for derivatives exchanges, which traders use to try to hedge their exposure. And indeed, in July and August, exchanges hosted record volumes.But while the fallout from the problems in credit markets has pumped up demand for derivatives for now, there are unpleasant side effects. Sentinel Management Group’s meltdown was a wake-up call from one of the less prominent corners of the market. Sentinel was a provider of supposedly safe cash management services to futures brokers. The fear was that its problems could spread across the market and eventually leave the exchanges’ in-house clearing businesses dealing with hung trades.For now, that risk looks minimal – Deutsche Bank estimates that funds parked with Sentinel amount to 1 per cent of total futures market capital. The other, perhaps more serious, threat comes from the “de-risking” process underlying current volatility. If a swathe of investment funds unwinds and investors lose their taste for leverage-fuelled speculation, demand for contracts to hedge positions will fall accordingly.It is too early to tell how big a threat that is. But the exchange sector was trading on forward price/earnings multiples of 40 and upwards before the latest turbulence. Far from being odd, taking some money off the table – the stocks still trade at multiples in the high 30s – looks sensible.
1091;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-08-21T01:17:27Z;ICE ups Winnipeg exchange offer;;"The Intercontinental Exchange has raised its bid for the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange in the face of a competing offer from a partner of the CME Group.The electronic futures exchange on Monday raised its offer for the Canadian group from C$40m ($37.7m) to C$50m in a move that would see key commodities contracts switched from the CME to the ICE this year.The Winnipeg exchange hosts the benchmark contract for canola, a rapeseed variant, and would add to the expansion of the ICE in Canadian energy products. It would also give the Atlanta-based exchange access to the carbon-trading market via the Winnipeg-controlled Canadian Climate Exchange.The ICE raised its offer to C$77.59 a share to secure board backing from the privately-held Winnipeg exchange, whose shareholders will vote on August 22.The unsolicited competing bid – which traders said came from the Nymex – is the latest sparring between the ICE and the CME, parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which won the hotly contested takeover battle for the Chicago Board of Trade this year.The Nymex has a long-term deal to list its products on the CME’s electronic platform, although it is expected to take part in the consolidation that has transformed the derivatives industry.The ICE is viewed as a potential takeover target following its failure to acquire the CBOT; the NYSE Group’s ambitions to expand in US futures make it a possible acquirer.The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the third-largest US option trading venue, last week said it was examining a sale or flotation. It has held talks with the Nasdaq, which wants to establish a US options business.The ICE has expanded from its roots as an energy exchange and clearer of over-the-counter trades with a series of acquisitions and joint ventures over the past year, including with the New York Board of Trade, which gave it access to soft commodities for the first time.Shares in the ICE on Monday continued their recovery from a five-session slide that had wiped almost a fifth from its market value, in spite of the surge in volumes from market volatility."
1092;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-08-20T20:51:02Z;Nasdaq stages a tactical withdrawal;;"After having been the target of one or another bidder for the better part of the last three years, the London Stock Exchange finally appears to have cemented its future in the ranks of consolidators.On Monday, Nasdaq announced it would put its 31 per cent stake in the LSE up for sale, saying that the market has never given it credit for the value of that stake. It will use proceeds to buy back $1bn in long-term debt and repurchase its own shares, which have languished near current levels pretty much since the company first approached the LSE early in 2006.The move gives it considerable firepower to increase its offer for OMX, the Nordic exchanges and technology group, where it faces a bidding war with Borse Dubai.The move is the latest wrinkle in the rapidly evolving transformation of Europe’s exchanges which are undergoing a consolidation wave almost unimaginable a few short years ago.This month, shareholders in the LSE, in effect, short-circuited Nasdaq’s hopes of a successful bid for that company when they overwhelmingly approved its all-share deal to buy Borsa Italiana. Not only did that transaction have the effect of diluting Nasdaq’s stake to 22 per cent, it also created a board in which five of 12 seats would be held by representatives of the Borsa – board members even more likely to oppose a takeover by Nasdaq than that at present – if such a position were possible.In making its move, Nasdaq made the implicit admission that it stands no chance in the foreseeable future of ever making a successful bid for the LSE and decided that it might as well use its firepower to buy the exchange whose management appears eager to have it as a new owner; OMX.Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, in a conference call with analysts on Monday, stopped short of saying the LSE’s agreed deal to acquire the Borsa was the nail in the coffin. “We certainly had the opportunity to talk to other shareholders regarding the Borsa Italiana vote,” he said. Although the decision to sell the stake was made by Nasdaq’s board within the past two weeks, it had been discussed before that, he said.Mr Greifeld’s conference call, significantly, was held from Stockholm where he was meeting with shareholders in OMX and other stakeholders. Nasdaq’s SKr208 per share cash and stock offer for OMX has been eclipsed by an all-cash SKr230 bid by Borse Dubai.Indeed, Mr Greifeld said the flexibility he has signalled in adjusting Nasdaq’s offer for OMX was not as justified when it bid for the LSE this year. “I would say that the European competitive landscape will change and change dramatically in the next few years,” he said.OMX, which has a significant technology business, is not nearly as threatened as some other exchanges by competitive trading platforms such as Project Turquoise – a consortium formed by a group of Europe’s biggest exchange customers – and indeed, may be able to benefit from them, he said.Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said that although the inability to conclude a deal with the LSE had been part of the decision, the market had indeed failed to give the Nasdaq share price any credit for the stake. Nasdaq is trading at only 18 times its estimated 2008 earnings while exchanges on average are trading at 22.7 times future earnings.The bid for independence by the LSE comes at a time when its own business model appears stronger than ever. Since the final phase of its new, high-speed trading platform, TradElect, was implemented in June, volumes on the LSE have broken records.And while other European bourses have taken steps to improve latency – the time between sending an order and completing it – as well as capacity, the LSE’s system is faster and cheaper than any other in the region, it says.But the LSE’s muscle-flexing comes at a risky time for exchanges in general, only some of which reflect current market conditions. In the event of an economic slowdown, overall share trading may reduce and its robust revenue growth could slow in tandem.Also, with the prospect of a bid from Nasdaq ebbing, it is not clear that there are any other LSE suitors in the wings. NYSE Euronext is fighting bitterly to retain market share in the LSE’s home market where competition for share trading is fierce.The LSE’s own share price is down by nearly 30 per cent for the year and the recent market turmoil has not helped.Other possible bidders, such as the CME Group – formed through the acquisition of the Chicago Board of Trade by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange – are only interested in acquiring other derivatives exchanges. While the LSE will acquire a derivatives platform with Borsa Italiana, it is relatively small and heavily retail-oriented.Deutsche Börse, itself once a contender for the LSE, has agreed to buy US-based International Securities Exchange, an options exchange, and is thought to be interested mostly in expanding its derivatives business rather than its cash equities trading platform.And the LSE itself will face home-grown competition in equities trading and in the sale of data products as new entrants take advantage of European legislation, known as Mifid, designed to encourage it.Indeed, there is a final irony in Nasdaq’s move. If the disposal of its LSE stake enables it to complete its bid for OMX, it will own the technology provider to the single greatest threat to the LSE’s market share equities.A group of nine European investment banks, the biggest customers of the region’s exchanges, have formed Project Turquoise to compete with those exchanges and have vowed to slash tariffs. Its chosen technology provider is OMX."
1093;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-08-16T23:09:50Z;CME raises margin requirement;;The CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, on Thursday increased margin requirements across a range of products, limiting potential trading losses from increased market volatility.While exchanges review the leverage which traders can employ on a daily basis, the scope of the CME’s move was viewed as unusual.“What’s interesting is the across-the-board increase,” said John Lothian, head of electronic trading at The Price Group in Chicago. “Normally, you would have one market or sector show an increase.”The changes took effect after Thursday’s market close, and apply to 24 of the CME’s 400-plus contracts, including those based on currencies, interest rates and stock indices.Futures markets have priced in as many as two rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, prompting particular volatility in contracts based on Fed Funds, which were among those covered by the CME’s tighter margin requirements.The affected contracts included a range of currency pairs such as euro/yen and sterling/yen, as well as some short-term interest-rate products.The CME described the move as “normal” and maintained its member firms continued to meet their trading obligations.The market was rattled this week when Sentinel Management Group, a small Illinois-based asset manager, said it was freezing client accounts.The firm’s clients included small brokers operating on the CME and other exchanges, raising concerns their trading ability could be curtailed. Sentinel told clients on Wednesday that it was seeking to sell assets so that funds could be returned, though did not identify potential buyers.Traders said the CME’s move was unlikely to impact the record trading volumes seen across global derivative exchanges in the wake of market volatility.Futures brokers typically require clients to post margin over and above the CME’s so-called “performance bonds”, generating excess liquidity which was expected to provide a cushion against any reduced trading capability.However, the CME share price suffered one of its sharpest declines since last month’s merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.The stock had slipped more than 5 per cent to $509 by midday in New York, losing 16 per cent since reaching a 52-week high of $609.96 just a week ago. The Intercontinental Exchange, which lost out in a bidding war for the CBOT, saw its share price slump almost 12 per cent, and the NYSE Group fell almost 8 per cent.
1094;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Equity derivatives volumes soar;;Equity derivatives volumes are surging to daily records as traders scramble to take advantage of or hedge themselves against market turmoil and the resulting spike in volatility.In the US, average daily volumes on CME group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, stands at 16.6m contracts this month so far, a 99 per increase over the combined month of August last year.The Options Clearing Corporation, which collates the volumes on all the US options exchanges, said that a new daily record was set on July 26 when 21.3m contracts were cleared. Figures for last week are expected to be even higher.In Europe, combined volumes on Liffe and Eurex, the continent’s two main derivatives exchanges, have risen by 66 per cent since the beginning of July to the end of last week compared with the same period last year. Panic started to grip the markets in early July after Bear Stearns announced the closure of two hedge funds because of more than $20bn in subprime losses.Over-the-counter volumes, which account for the lion’s share of equity derivatives business, are also soaring, as hedge funds in particular enter in to complex contracts designed to hedge their exposure to underlying securities. However, these trades are difficult to measure because they are private bilateral deals.Traders typically use equity derivatives to protect themselves from volatile markets as they use options to either sell or buy back a single stock or an equity index at a certain price in the future.Ade Cordell, head of equity derivatives wholesale services at Liffe, said: “When markets are falling, you do need an element of protection. That means more market participants will use equity derivatives to provide that protection with certain option strategies. We have certainly seen a spike in volumes in the past few weeks because of the volatility.”Aaron Brask, head of equity derivatives research at Barclays Capital, added: “Equity derivatives volumes have been up sharply over-the-counter and on the exchanges as the turbulence over the past few weeks have prompted investors to increasingly focus on equity volatility.”The rise in demand for protection against volatility has also seen the growing use of sophisticated over-the-counter products.These include instruments such as variance swaps, which isolate volatility and take away all of the other attributes that are ordinarily factored in, such as interest rates, dividends and movements in the price of the underlying asset. Other instrument rising in demand are dividend swaps, where investors can lock in a dividend price.
1095;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T08:01:05+0000;NYSE Euronext profit doubles;;NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange, more than doubled its second-quarter profit as Euronext contributed to earnings for the first time.Nelson Chai, chief financial officer of the combined group, said on Thursday it continued to explore strategic opportunities amid the rapidly consolidating exchange sector.The acquisition of Euronext, the pan-European exchange, has extended New York Stock Exchange’s reach into equities and derivatives trading in Europe.The European business operates the Lisbon, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges and runs London-based Euronext.liffe derivatives market. The company plans to cut $250m in annual costs by 2009 as it shares technology across markets.NYSE Euronext is under pressure to establish a greater presence in the US derivatives market. John Thain, chief executive of the group, says bolstering its derivatives business in the US is a key priority.Analysts say the recent formation of CME Group, through a combination of Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade, to form the world’s largest derivative exchange, means NYSE Euronext must act urgently.Net income for the combined group rose to $161m, or 62 cents a share, beating analysts’ estimates, from $61m, or 39 cents, for NYSE alone a year earlier.Revenue almost doubled to $1.1bn from $660m for the second quarter last year. The second-quarter results include NYSE’s earnings for the full three months and Euronext earnings from April 4. The second-quarter 2006 comparison represents NYSE results alone.“Record revenues in our European cash and derivatives trading, as well as balanced growth in other business lines, including listings and market data, produced a strong second quarter,” Mr Chai said.Last year, NYSE led a group of investors in acquiring a 20 per cent stake in India’s National Stock Exchange and deepened an existing relationship with Tokyo Stock Exchange.These deals come as consolidation within the global stock and derivatives exchange landscape continues apace. Nasdaq, NYSE’s main US rival, recently announced an agreement to buy the Nordic exchange operator OMX after its bid to buy London Stock Exchange failed.Nasdaq, which remains the largest shareholder in LSE, on Wednesday said it would vote in favour of the planned merger of LSE and Borsa Italiana.
1096;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world.

Beazer Homes also posted a $123m quarterly loss, sending its shares down 20.2 per cent at $15.66.This followed second quarter losses reported late on Wednesday from Pulte Homes, whose shares sank 10 per cent to $19.84.Ryland Group shares fared better than the rest of the sector but still ended the week down 3.9 per cent at $33.94.Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, fell 12.2 per cent to $30.09 after
it posted a 33 per cent slide in second quarter profit.The weaker housing market prompted it to lower the 2007 outlook.“The credit story is still too opaque and evolving at too rapid a pace for anyone to seriously take a shot at counter-trading this into the weekend, and any big move is much more likely to come from a further slide in risky assets than a recovery today,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.“If there are a few ingredients worth remembering, it is that credit events are not one-day, one-week or even one-month wonders.”Shares in recently floated private equity and hedge fund group Fortress Investment Group suffered a bout of investor uncertainty last week.It was down 10.5per cent for the week at $19.95.Financials were once again hit by continuing subprime concerns. Bear Stearns shares were down 7.1 per cent at $125.10 while Citigroup lost 6.3 per cent to close at $47.53, JPMorgan fell 5.3 per cent to $45.02 and Goldman Sachs fell 4.5 per to $196.68.CME Group reported a 15 per cent rise in quarterly results as the merger between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings and the Chicago Board of Trade was completed. Its shares roe 1 per cent to $562.54.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 4.9 per cent for the week at 1,458.95 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 4.7 per cent lower at 2,562.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 4.2 per cent lower at 13,265.47 for the week.In earnings news, Chevron reported a 24 per cent rise in second quarter profit, but its shares suffered from the prevailing bearish mood, ending the week down 5.7 per cent at $86.88.Investors received upbeat news on the economy on Friday, as the Commerce Department reported that the nation’s economy grew at a faster-than-expected pace during the second quarter.Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.4 per cent annual rate for the second quarter, while the first quarter was downwardly revised to 0.6 per cent from an original estimate of 0.7 per cent.But analysts said credit concerns were likely to continue to dictate sentiment.“Historical growth measures mean little given the looming financial crisis that could unhinge estimates for future growth,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “The widening of credit spreads and potential for tighter lending standards represents a significant risk to the growth outlook.”Banks are struggling to clear a backlog of debt deals that are required to fund this year’s record level of buy-outs. Debt financing for the Chrysler and AllianceBoots buy-outs ran into difficulties earlier in the week and investors say the huge pipeline of deals will not ease until the mood in credit stabilises.In other corporate news, Boeing raised its full-year earnings forecast and reported net income of $1.35 a share in the second quarter compared with a loss
of $160m, or 21 cents, a year earlier, when the company paid a $615m government fine. Its shares rose 0.8 per cent to $104.74.ConocoPhillips and Colgate-Palmolive also reported better-than-expected second quarter results, buoying sentiment during the week although ConocoPhillips finished the week down 6.3 per cent at $80.84.Colgate-Palmolive shares rose 2 per cent to $68.99.“The market’s sharp sell-off has stoked investor concern, and a surge of put-buying at significantly higher prices indicates the slide may soon provide a short-covering bounce,” said Tom McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities. Small capitalised stocks which have benefited greatly from the boom in M&A were hit hard.Traders say the risk reduction trade within equities has involved selling small- and mid-caps and seeking the relative safety of large cap stocks.Tom McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities, said: “Small-stock indexes like the Russell 2000 may enjoy a ‘beta-bounce’ if the market snaps back as we expect, but we would use strength there to reduce exposure to smaller stocks, and we continue to favour the large-capitalisation indexes, such as the S&P 500, S&P 100, or Russell Top 50.”"

His comments come just weeks after the creation of the CME Group, formed earlier this month by the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.He said it was important for the group to continueplaying a part in the consolidation that has swept the global equity and derivatives exchange business in recent times. He said the group would also continue to expand and compete with investment banks in the massive over-the-counter derivatives market, which dwarfs the exchange-traded business. In this area, he said CME would focus on opportunities in foreign exchange derivatives and interest rate swaps market.The CME declared victory in its pursuit of the CBOT this month after members and shareholders voted to combine and create the world’s largest derivatives platform. The deal was eventually reached after CME raised its offer three times to fend off a competing bid from Intercontinental Exchange.The company said it was ahead of schedule on integrating the two exchanges as it reported second-quarter results for both on Tuesday. Mr Donohue said the transition of CME and CBOT products on to a single electronic platform should be completed in January next year and the two trading floors would follow in March.The CME’s $11.8bn deal for the CBOT comes against the backdrop of frantic M&A activity among the exchanges, with recent deals including the New York Stock Exchange’s merger with Euronext, Nasdaq’s deal with the OMX, Deutsche Börse’s agreed bid for the International Securities Exchange, and the purchase by the Intercontinental Exchange of the New York Board of Trade.The exchanges are jockeying for position in the lucrative derivatives market which most see as the key battleground for expansion as investors increasingly look to such products to hedge risk in volatile markets.The CME reported strong earnings growth for both exchanges in their last full quarter as separate entities.The CME Group posted a 15 per cent rise in second-quarter profit in its last quarter before completing its acquisition of the CBOT, narrowly missing analyst expectations. For the same period, the CBOT posted a 34 per cent jump in net income as a result of higher trading volume and derivative
contract fees."

For the same period, the CBOT posted a 34 per cent jump in net income as a result of higher trading volume and derivative contract fees.CME on Tuesday reported net income of $126m, or $3.57 a share, compared with $110m, or $3.12 a share, for the same period a year ago. Excluding merger costs, earnings would have been $3.69 a share. Revenue increased 17 per cent to $329m.CME reported average daily volume of 6.4m contracts in the second quarter, a 4.5 per cent rise, and said it handled 4m CBOT contracts a day, while New York Mercantile Exchange volume on CME’s Globex electronic platform averaged a record 710,000 contracts a day.CBOT posted net income of $58m compared with $43m for the second quarter last year. Excluding merger costs, earnings would have risen 65 per cent to $72m , or $1.35 a share. Revenue climbed 33 per cent to $2004.The CME declared victory in its pursuit of the CBOT earlier this month after members and shareholders voted to combine and create the world’s largest derivatives platform.The deal was eventually reached after CME raised its offer three times to fend off a competing bid from Atlanta’s IntercontinentalExchange.

1100;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-07-18T18:53:02Z;Observer: Merkel’s summertime glow;;German chancellor Angela Merkel is going into her summer holiday next week in a very good mood. Fielding questions from hundreds of journalists in Berlin yesterday in her pre-vacation press conference, the “Queen of Europe”, as she was labelled this year, was all smiles as she rattled off her economic and foreign policy successes.Dressed in a fetching pink jacket, she even focused for a moment on the feminine touch she occasionally brings to politics – a topic she rarely addresses. Asked why it had been so long since a minister resigned from her cabinet, she replied in a flash that her softly-softly style was the key.“Look at my caring way of doing things,” she exclaimed.Next week she is off – as every year – to the Wagner opera festival in Bayreuth, southern Germany, followed by a few days’ relaxation away from the Berlin crowds.If her good fortune continues into the autumn, Observer wonders how the Social Democrats, her coalition partner – let alone the opposition parties – are going to make any political headway.Rotating logicAl Hubbard, one of US president George W. Bush’s top economic tsars, has been spending a little more time in Europe than usual.But that doesn’t mean the Harvard-educated Bushie understands how it works any better as a result.“I wonder if I’ll ever figure out how the EU works,” he told an audience at the US Chamber of Commerce, recounting a recent trip to visit Merkel.Hubbard was picked by Bush in April to chair jointly a new effort to iron out regulatory kinks between the US and EU, a pet project of Merkel’s while her country chaired the rotating EU presidency.But it’s the rotation part that seems to have stumped Hubbard. “It’s bizarre,” he said. “Merkel was president of the EU, then Barosso – he’s president of something as well. I don’t understand how the EU government works. It’s been explained to me five times and I still can’t get it into my head.”Help is at hand, however, in the form of his co-chair: Günter Verheugen, the EU’s (non-rotating) vice-president.Fashion statementThere has been speculation that Conrad Black may have to suffer the indignity of being required to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet after he goes before a judge today at a bail hearing in Chicago.The device would be used to track his movement, which could possibly be limited to the city limits of Chicago if the judge decides to prevent him from returning to Toronto. If this happens, then Black at least can draw comfort from the fact that these devices have become somewhat fashionable in the US. Martha Stewart, the US home-making mogul, wore one a few years ago when she faced legal problems. More recently, some young celebrities have been sporting monitoring devices of one sort or another.Lindsay Lohan, the bad-girl actress, began sporting a chunky bracelet that monitors her alcohol intake following a stint in rehab. As The Washington Post pointed out this week, other actors and actresses have been appearing on stage wearing monitoring bracelets. The US television actress Michelle Rodriguez wore one at New York’s Fashion Week in February.Black may remain on the A-list after all.Chicago meets NYTwo veterans of the bustling, shouting Chicago trading pits are to be feted tonight by members of a rival tribe – Wall Streeters.Charlie Carey, the chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, is the keynote speaker tonight at the Wall Street 50, which honours Irishmen (and Irish women) working in finance. Also honoured will be Terence Duffy, the chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange – which this year won a fierce battle to buy Carey’s CBOT.Carey and Duffy have been friends for decades. They met in the 1980s, when they both dealt hog futures at the Chicago Merc. That friendship helped them pull off the merger, which was the largest ever involving a financial exchange. The Merc’s winning bid finally saw off rival offers for the CBOT by the IntercontinentalExchange, an electronic market from Atlanta.The next challenge for the Chicago traders may come from the New York Stock Exchange, which may want to expand into their market. Perhaps they will make some valuable connections tonight.Not-so-merry SenUS politicians are worked up about the vast incomes and low taxes enjoyed by hedge fund managers. Now they have been handed some fresh fodder for outrage.Charles Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate finance committee, has a few sharp words for the Robin Hood Foundation, the hedge fund managers’ favourite charity which was set up by industry veteran Paul Tudor Jones.The charity’s legendary fundraisers have featured performances by The Who, The Rolling Stones and Beyoncé. Now, it turns out that much of Robin Hood’s $140m rainy-day fund is invested in hedge funds run by either Robin Hood board members, or by its donors. Grassley does not approve. “I don’t remember Robin Hood keeping ‘two and 20’ as his cut,” he said, referring to the hedge fee formula.The 31-member board includes business people such as Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein, Lehman’s Richard Fuld and GE’s Jeff Immelt – as well as Gwyneth Paltrow.Send your comments to observer@ft.com
1101;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-07-10T23:09:53Z;NYSE races to build derivatives trade;;John Thain, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, has made no secret of his ambition to bolster the transatlantic exchange’s presence significantly in the US derivatives market.At a recent analyst meeting, he admitted that competing head-to-head in the trading of existing derivatives contracts in the US would be difficult.But the task has been made still more tricky now that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade have finally agreed to merge, creating a derivatives trading powerhouse in Chicago.“I think if we’re going to develop a bigger presence in the US in the areas that are currently in existence, I think it has to be by acquisition,” Mr Thain said.With the formation of the CME Group, Mr Thain is likely to want to act sooner rather than later to bolster his US derivatives business before the gap with Chicago becomes too big to bridge.Two acquisitions stand out as most likely for NYSE Euronext.The first is a quick move to buy the Intercontinental Exchange, which is now seen by analysts as a target after missing out on the CBOT to the CME.Almost right up until the shareholder vote this week, many expected the ICE to raise its offer for the CBOT still further in a last-ditch attempt to buy it.When it became clear late last week that it would not raise its bid, the ICE itself became a target.A second potential move for NYSE Euronext is a deal to buy the New York Mercantile Exchange. For months, the market has buzzed with talk of a potential bid for the Nymex, with NYSE Euronext being mentioned as one possible bidder for the energy exchange along with the CME and the Deutsche Börse.The Nymex is seen by many as being too limited in its product and geographic reach to remain an island as consolidation of the ex-change business continues. Some analysts said the ICE might itself be interested in merging with the Nymex.Adam Sussman, of the Tabb Group, the financial markets’ research and advisory firm, said: “I think this puts the ICE on the defensive and it is likely to seek either a merger of equals or be acquired by a larger exchange. A deal with the Nymex would be a good deal for both in terms of diversification.”The Nymex and its energy products, in particular, could also be an attractive acquisition target for either CME or Deutsche Börse.Securing Euronext from under the nose of main rival Deutsche Börse this year represented the NYSE’s first concerted push into exchange-traded derivatives, through the acquisition of Euronext Liffe, the London derivatives exchange.Derivatives account for 22 per cent of the revenue of the combined NYSE Euronext. Mr Thain will be keen to see that number rise steeply and quickly in the coming months and years.
1102;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-07-09T20:21:52Z;CME declares victory in battle for CBOT;;The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Monday declared victory after a nine-month pursuit of the Chicago Board of Trade as members and shareholders voted to combine and create the world’s largest derivatives platform.The vote followed a four-month bid battle for CBOT with the smaller Intercontinental Exchange, which elected not to sweeten its bid for a third time after a contest which pushed the indicative value of the Board of Trade close to $12bn.The Merc finally ended its quest for an acquisition after boosting its own offer for a third time on July 6, quelling opposition from a core of CBOT members who had pushed for better terms while supporting the principle of an all-Chicago combination.The enlarged group will narrowly top the derivatives business of Deutsche Bôrse in volume terms following the German group’s planned purchase of the US-based International Securities Exchange.However, the renamed CME Group also faces a number of challenges as it seeks to integrate the two Chicago exchanges and handle some of the fallout from the bid battle.The Merc still needs to find a long-term solution to the long-running spat over CBOT’s potential ownership in the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which is currently the subject of litigation in the US courts.Relations with Wall Street banks have also been strained by the opposition of some institutions to a Chicago deal which they claimed could stifle competition. The Merc argued that banks were attempting to defend their own pricing power in the over-the-counter derivatives market, a key expansion target for the large global exchanges.The CME was forced to boost the merger terms first outlined last October by almost 25 per cent in order to win control of the 159-year old Board of Trade and its valuable franchise in financial and commodity-based futures and options.The ICE proposal, which was rejected three times by the CBOT board, had led the indicative value of the Merc proposal for most of the past four months before last week’s final moves eliminated almost all of the difference between the all-stock offers.The Chicago exchanges were forced to postpone a planned April 4 vote on the merger, and CBOT members remained deeply split over its merits until the latest raise provided the Merc with the momentum to win backing in Monday’s polls.The renamed CME Group will have a market value of almost $32bn, based on yesterday’s closing prices, and the deal already has antitrust approval following a justice department ruling expected to trigger further consolidation in the US derivatives sector.NYSE Euronext has said its plans to bolster its Liffe platform with a US acquisition, triggering speculation it could seek a combination with either the ICE or the New York Mercantile Exchange, breaking up the latter’s strategic alliance with the CME.CBOT shareholders took less than five minutes to vote in favour of the CME deal. Charles Carey chairman said preliminary results showed an earlier poll of CBOT members had also voted overwhelmingly in favour.
1103;CME;CME Group Inc;2007-02-18T21:03:33Z;Lobby group warns on CME deal;;Plans by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to acquire the neighbouring Board of Trade received a potential setback after the industry’s main lobby group said the creation of the world’s largest futures exchange could harm competition.The Futures Industry Association, which represents the largest futures brokers, has taken four months to adopt a formal position on the proposed deal. Its reservations come as the US Department of Justice continues its second-stage probe into the combination.The FIA board has quizzed exchange officials on the transaction and formed a working group to support the DoJ investigation, which has focused on the impact on clearing services.FIA members, which include the largest banks and brokers, have not voiced public opposition to the Chicago deal, but reservations in a brief statement on Friday highlight private rumblings about the competitive power of an enlarged CME Group.Executives from both the exchanges have continued to push the merits of the proposed cash-and-stock deal, which they hope to close by mid-2007.Craig Donohue, the CME chief executive who would take the same role at the new company, said there had been “tremendous enthusiasm” for a deal, which he said would provide $70m a year in savings to customers.“I don’t think this has been a hard sell in terms of the vast majority [of our customers],” he told the Financial Times last month.The FIA stopped short of calling for additional benefits or for the deal to be blocked. But it said the combination would “concentrate significant market power in the new CME Group, substantially lessen competition among US futures exchanges, and raise even higher the barriers to entry for new competitors”.It would study the potential impact of “various market structure alternatives”.Critics of consolidation have expressed particular concern about the near-monopoly on exchange-traded clearing it would create in the US. There are plans for the new Chicago group to expand into clearing for the over-the-counter market.The CME reported a pre-tax margin of 58 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, three times the level generated by US options exchanges, which share a common “utility” clearing service.Futures experts said competition could come from new OTC structures that mimicked exchange characteristics.
1104;CME;CME Group Inc;2006-10-24T14:22:10Z;CME vows to push on with OTC drive;;The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said on Tuesday that its planned $8bn takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade would not be a distraction from the push to capture share from the over-the-counter market, a move which could see it link with the inter-dealer broker community.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, said links with inter-broker dealers were “consistent” with efforts to tap into the OTC market, which accounts for more than 80 per cent of futures trades.“We certainly think this is consistent with our long-term strategy of facilitating the convergence of the two separate derivative markets,” he told analysts as the exchange reported a 34 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings.The CME has launched a range of initiatives to drive more volume through its Globex electronic trading platform to boost fees and liquidity, notably FXMarketspace, a foreign-exchange joint venture with Reuters scheduled to launch next year.Mr Donohue said the venture had signed up 16 of the top 20 foreign-exchange banks – including the top five – in its bid to capture share from a market dominated by off-exchange trades between institutions.The CME’s third-quarter performance underlined the scaleability of Globex, with average daily trading volumes climbing 28 per cent to 5.4m a day in the three months to September 30.“Every product line is growing by more than 20 per cent,” said Mr Donohue, though growth has moderated from the record volumes seen in September to around 5.2m contracts a day so far in October.Mr Donohue declined to be drawn on the CME’s approach to securing regulatory approval for the proposed acquisition of the CBOT, which is slated to close next June.The enlarged CME Group would account for around 90 per cent of on-exchange futures trading in the US, raising fears among some users that it would have excessive pricing power, but Mr Donohue maintained that it expected the transaction to be cleared.CME executives are due to meet investors on Wednesday, but Terry Duffy, chairman, was upbeat about initial contact with users and regulators since the offer was announced on October 17.“The response has been overwhelmingly positive,” he said.The CME’s third-quarter performance included the first contribution from its joint venture with the New York Mercantile Exchange to list energy and metals contracts on Globex.Mr Donohue said Nymex-derived volumes were running ahead of forecast, but also declined to comment on how it would reconcile the business with CBOT’s own competing metals trading operation if the merger is completed.Net profits in the September quarter rose from $77.5m to $103.8m as revenues climbed 22 per cent to $275m.
1105;CME;CME Group Inc;2006-10-18T20:02:33Z;Stock deals come back into fashion;;Stock deals may be a dying breed, but they made a high-profile comeback in the past few weeks with Google’s $1.65bn acquisition of YouTube and Tuesday’s takeover of the CBOT by the CME.According to Thomson Financial, only 22 per cent of all US takeover activity this year has involved shares, compared with 34 per cent last year, and 45 per cent in 2004.The drop has been driven by factors including the low cost of debt, the willingness of banks to write large cheques for acquisition financing, and the greater openness of both institutional and hedge fund investors to accepting cash bids.So why did the CME decide to pay for its cross-town rival with only a small portion of cash, and a large amount of shares?People involved in the negotiations said there was some discussion about structuring it as an all-cash takeover. However, in the end it was agreed that investors in both companies should be able to “share” the benefits of the combination, including $125m in annual cost savings.The CME, which is more than twice as large as the CBOT in terms of market capitalisation, did not give anything up in terms of control, and the deal remained very much a CME takeover.The combined company will have 29 board members, of which 20 are designated by the CME.In addition, CME shareholders will hold 70-80 per cent of the combined company, and CME management, led by Craig Donohue, will run the new entity.The enlarged group, to be known as the CME Group, intends to expand in financial futures and push into other asset classes.
1106;CME;CME Group Inc;2020-04-24T06:54:01+0000;Chicago exchanges in $8bn deal;;Chicago’s two main derivatives exchanges on Tuesday unveiled an $8bn (£4.3bn) merger plan that will increase momentum for consolidation in the financial exchange sector by creating a platform with unmatched global reach.The takeover by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange of the smaller Chicago Board of Trade would create the world’s largest futures exchange. The merged group would have an estimated annual $125m in synergies to fund expansion into Europe and Asia, as well as fast-growing areas such as credit derivatives and foreign exchange, which remain dominated by over-the-counter trading.The announcement follows a year of talks and flirtations with rival exchanges. An all-American solution arrives at a time when the competitiveness of US capital markets has come under pressure from regulatory changes that have driven users overseas.It comes two years after the CBOT rejected an approach from the CME in favour of its own listing last year, a move that proved crucial in providing an agreed price for the smaller exchange, with both trading near record levels in recent weeks.“The transaction was done with both companies in a position of strength,” said Terry Duffy, CME chairman, who would chair CME Group, as the company would be known.The deal will raise the ante on the New York Stock Exchange to close its transatlantic deal with Euronext, the Paris-based stock and derivatives exchange. It would also leave Deutsche Börse, the world’s largest derivatives platform, with a shortage of friendly merger partners, in the light of Euronext’s preference for a deal with the NYSE.European analysts and investors said the deal raised pressure on Deutsche Börse to seek a rival merger that would create a viable competitor and on competition authorities in Brussels to approve that combination. “It makes the case for a merger of European competitors even more compelling,” said Mamoun Tazi, analyst at Man Securities.Craig Donohue, the CME chief, who would retain that role in the merged group, said he did not expect regulators to block the deal, which is forecast to close in mid-2007, subject to shareholder and antitrust approval.Robert Fleishman, an attorney at Steptoe & Johnson, said that the Justice Department would probably find that the benefits of “demonstrable efficiencies” in IT operations, staffing, and trading floor platforms would outweigh potential negative competitive effects of the deal, particularly because technological leaps would make it difficult for the DoJ to predict how markets will be shaped in the future.However, users said they would be watching closely for synergies to be passed on in the form of lower trading feesAdditional reporting by Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington
