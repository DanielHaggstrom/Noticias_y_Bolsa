0;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-02-06T22:24:05Z;Intercontinental Exchange chief defends eBay approach ;NYSE owner did not ‘lose its mind’, says Jeffrey Sprecher;Intercontinental Exchange has given up its pursuit of eBay, the struggling auction website, after it failed to persuade investors it was not overreaching itself in search of growth.Shareholders reacted with confusion this week following confirmation that ICE had approached eBay over a possible combination of the two companies.“We aren’t crazy, we didn’t lose our minds,” Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE’s chief executive and founder, told analysts earlier in the day. “We know what our platform does and we know how to lever it. And we feel really good about our ability to continue to find new asset classes.” Under Mr Sprecher, ICE has become a $50bn behemoth in the stock, futures and bond markets via a series of acquisitions, including the purchase of the New York Stock Exchange in 2013. However, its shares slumped 8 per cent on Tuesday, its worst one-day performance in a decade, as investors took fright at the prospect ICE could move from institutional investors to the consumer market.Its stock fell another 5 per cent after its annual results on Thursday. Following conversations with investors, ICE said it would cease exploring strategic opportunities with eBay. Shares in eBay fell 6 per cent.Mr Sprecher said on a conference call that there were similarities between the two businesses and added he had sought the advice of eBay’s then-chief executive Meg Whitman 20 years ago about building an online marketplace.Ebay has been under pressure from activist investors upset at its performance relative to competitors such as Amazon and US retail group Walmart. Earlier this week one investor, Starboard Value, said the board had not made enough progress and urged them to sell its classifieds business. The company has already sold its online ticket subsidiary StubHub to rival reseller Viagogo for $4bn and has been evaluating a sale of the classifieds business, which analysts estimate could be worth between $8bn and $12bn. “I'm not sure that it’s been fair for the market to hold eBay accountable as an ecommerce company and compare it to the likes of Amazon . . . [eBay] looks a lot more like the NYSE than Amazon,” Mr Sprecher said.Kyle Voigt, an analyst at KBW, said that while a deal for eBay would have boosted ICE’s earnings per share it could also dilute shareholders and change ICE’s shareholder base owing to the very different nature of eBay’s business.Atlanta-based ICE reported a 4 per cent increase in net revenues to $5.2bn for the year to December 31. Net income fell 3 per cent to $1.9bn.Operating income rose 3 per cent to $2.7bn but operating margins slipped to 51 per cent from 52 per cent over the same period.
1;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-02-05T19:06:38Z;Market questions why ICE would make eyes at eBay;Talks came to nothing, said exchange group, but its shares had their biggest fall in a decade;"The bewilderment that greeted news that the world’s second-largest exchange group had considered buying eBay is unlikely to faze its chief executive Jeffrey Sprecher.He built Intercontinental Exchange into a $50bn powerhouse that provides the data and infrastructure that companies use to trade in financial markets and has spent his career looking one way as rivals have looked the other.But investors fear that a move into the consumer market would be a leap too far.Following news it had held discussions about combining with eBay, ICE shares fell by 8 per cent, their biggest one-day drop in more than a decade.“We’re sceptical of how ICE could leverage its experience and technology into eBay . . . a purchase of such a different kind of company could be bold but also a sign of reaching for growth,” said Chris Kuiper, analyst at CFRA Research.Mr Sprecher’s investment approach has driven ICE from an Atlanta-based start-up in 2000 into an increasingly influential US company. Last month, his wife Kelly Loeffler, an early ICE employee, was appointed a senator for Georgia. She sits on the senate agriculture committee that helps regulates ICE.Mr Sprecher was a power plant manager before setting up a power exchange that was the forerunner of ICE. When its rivals were fighting for assets in big M&A deals, ICE opened the first clearing house in London in 100 years in 2008. As exchange megadeals became bogged down in competition questions, ICE was the first to move into fixed income data and trading instead.The risk this time around is that [ICE] management have been so visionary that investors think they are hallucinatingThat solidified its reputation among investors, not only for the coherence of strategy but for executing on its deals. Over the past decade, reinvested total returns for ICE have been 410 per cent; for the S&P 500 Composite it has been 268 per cent, according to Refinitiv Datastream.What the discussions with eBay do indicate is ICE’s new willingness to look for opportunities beyond the traditional exchange world of trading, data and clearing.Mr Sprecher’s management team meets every two weeks to discuss potential deals. “The risk this time around is that management have been so visionary that investors think they are hallucinating,” said one analyst.Still, ICE damped expectations it was prepared to jump fully into the consumer market.It confirmed it had approached eBay to explore possibilities that could “create value for the shareholders of both companies”. However, it said the discussions had since been dropped and the two were not engaged in negotiations. Barely a day later, ICE said it would buy Bridge2Solutions, a company that runs customer loyalty programmes, for an undisclosed sum.Chris Turner, an analyst at Berenberg in London, said it looked like the market had reacted to a completely different scenario from the one ICE had in mind.The Bridge2Solutions deal would accelerate the push into consumer markets by Bakkt, an ICE subsidiary for trading digital assets such as bitcoin that was run by Ms Loeffler before she moved into politics.Yet Bakkt, along with other recent acquisitions such as mortgage provider Mers and last year’s $335m purchase of real estate technology group Simplifile, are long-term projects that are unlikely to materially affect ICE’s earnings for many years.Since it moved into data provision with the purchase of Interactive Data Corp for $5.2bn in 2016, ICE has traded rapid revenue growth for steadily rising earnings per share and operating margins, which were 52 per cent in 2018.Ed Ditmire, head of investor relations at Nasdaq, pointed out that many exchange businesses were maturing and it was harder for them to do M&A because of antitrust and political concerns.“It’s really hard to find the perfect puzzle piece now,” he said. “We’re moving from a transactional relationship with customers to deeper, higher quality one.”Even so, that change may not come easily to an acquisition machine such as ICE. Mr Sprecher told investors in December that he felt pressure to grow and deliver consistent earnings growth. But “when we do [a deal] and announce it, you all have to say, ah, that’s so logical.”"
2;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-02-05T03:22:22Z;NYSE parent held takeover talks with eBay;Possibility of deal between Intercontinental Exchange and online retailer off for now;Intercontinental Exchange held preliminary takeover talks with eBay, but the discussions between the owner of the New York Stock Exchange and the online marketplace provider fell apart before the two companies could clinch an agreement.ICE on Tuesday confirmed it had approached eBay to explore a range of possibilities that could “create value for the shareholders of both companies”. However it said the discussions had since been dropped and the two were not engaged in negotiations. “Ebay has not engaged in a meaningful way,” ICE said in a statement. “We are not in negotiations regarding the sale of all or part of eBay.”People familiar with the discussions said the world’s second-largest exchange group by market value had held on-and-off discussions with eBay, but it had not made a formal takeover offer to buy the company.It was unclear if the talks would be restarted, which could value eBay at more than $30bn, its current market valuation. Ebay declined to comment.Shares of ICE, which has a market capitalisation of more than $50bn, dropped 7.5 per cent on news of the talks as investors and analysts struggled to understand the rationale for a deal.There is no limit to the potential for new derivative and data products“While ICE is an acquisitive company, this hypothetical transaction seems like a stretch to us as it is seemingly outside of the company’s core competency,” Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note to investors. “In the past, ICE has had success acquiring exchanges and modernising them, through technology and other upgrades, although it is a bit unclear how that expertise could be applied to eBay. The exchange markets ICE operates possess oligopoly-like characteristics with ‘protective moats’ which doesn’t seem to be the case at eBay,” the analysts added. Ebay has been evaluating its strategic options for several months after pressure from activist investors upset at its performance relative to competitors such as ecommerce behemoth Amazon and US retail group Walmart. Late last year, eBay agreed to sell its online ticket subsidiary StubHub to rival reseller Viagogo for $4bn and has been evaluating a sale of its classifieds business, which analysts estimate could be worth between $8bn and $12bn. Shares in eBay rose nearly 9 per cent on Tuesday to $37.41 after the Wall Street Journal first reported news of the approach from ICE. ICE has grown through acquisitions since it was founded at the turn of the century. Initially a commodity futures exchange, it bought NYSE in 2013 and has also expanded into market indices and fixed income data and trading. Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive, has described ICE as a company that “just marshals data in and out of a database” and exchanges were effectively a distribution network. “What people really want are large information providers that can provide an array of content,” he said in December. “Content is king right now.”The takeover would nonetheless mark an unexpected foray by ICE, which has largely kept itself to the trading of financial instruments and not the consumer goods for which eBay is known.The exchange operator last year began trading and storage of digital assets such as bitcoin and could use eBay to help build a cyber currency trading platform, one person familiar with the talks said. “There is no limit to the potential for new derivative and data products. The future of the capital markets will be defined by new, effective ways of defining what a trading platform is and what it trades, whether in bitcoin, home decor or powertools,” said Brad Bailey, research director at Celent, the capital markets consultancy. ICE’s overtures to eBay come as the ecommerce group comes under pressure from activist investors Starboard Value and Elliott Management. Starboard on Tuesday said that it was “disappointed with the speed and lack of urgency” at which the company was conducting its strategic reviews. 
3;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2019-12-05T05:00:44Z;Wall Street power player makes her political debut;Kelly Loeffler swaps exchange group ICE for the US Senate, over Trump’s objections;Kelly Loeffler was the smooth investor-relations chief who pitched Intercontinental Exchange to Wall Street. Now she is promoting President Donald Trump’s border wall.When the executive from the Atlanta-based exchange group on Wednesday was named a Republican senator for the southern US state of Georgia, she wasted no time professing loyalty to the president.“I want to fight socialism side by side with President Trump,” Ms Loeffler said at an event in Atlanta.The comments were a political coming-out for an exchange executive more used to shaping financial narratives to investors and financial analysts. Ms Loeffler joined ICE in its infancy in 2002 and married founder and chief executive Jeff Sprecher two years later. Together they built a goliath of electronic markets worth $52bn whose businesses include the New York Stock Exchange and London’s main futures exchange.Her nomination, to replace a Republican Senator retiring for health reasons, gives a figure with close ties to the biggest securities, derivatives and cryptocurrency traders a powerful perch in Washington. Ms Loeffler was most recently chief executive of Bakkt, an ICE subsidiary for bitcoin products.Mr Trump had opposed Ms Loeffler, who has never held elected office. He instead favoured ally Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee. On Wednesday Mr Collins stood up for Mr Trump against the impeachment investigation led by Democrats, calling it a “simple railroad job”.After Georgia Governor Brian Kemp chose Ms Loeffler instead, she used her debut in his ceremonial office to introduce herself as a politician with dark-red conservative credentials.Noting her Christian faith and girlhood on an Illinois farm, she said she supported gun rights and was “pro-Trump, pro-military and pro-wall”. She lambasted what she called an impeachment “circus”, accusing Democrats of being motivated by hatred of Mr Trump.“They want to overturn our way of life because they resent America’s success,” she said, Mr Sprecher standing by her side.Ms Loeffler’s rhetoric stood in contrast to years in the delicate role of investor relations and public relations for ICE as it grew from a power and natural gas trading platform to a systemically important pillar of financial markets.Chris Giancarlo, a lawyer and former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, described her style as straightforward, affable, courteous and responsive. “She’s also a down-home person. Growing up on a family farm, it’s hard to be overly pretentious or full of yourself,” he said.Before Bakkt, Ms Loeffler served on ICE’s executive management committee along with others including her husband. “The two of them have been intellectual partners in ICE for many years, even if the titles don’t necessarily say that,” said a futures industry executive.She has been a distinctive presence among the senior, mostly male executives who run the world’s largest exchanges.* In Atlanta she may be better known for co-owning the Atlanta Dream, a women’s professional basketball team.ICE said Ms Loeffler would relinquish her post at Bakkt before her swearing-in. She will replace senator Johnny Isakson, who announced he would retire at the end of the year because of health concerns.A fundraiser for her is a luncheon with her accountantMr Kemp appointed Ms Loeffler in part to appeal to more moderate women voters in Georgia and boost the number of Republican women on Capitol Hill, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. Of 25 female US senators, eight are Republicans.Ms Loeffler will need to run for election in November 2020. She is prepared to spend $20m of her own money on the campaign, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other media reported.“She will blow out of the water any candidate who challenges her. A fundraiser for her is a luncheon with her accountant,” Mr Sabato said.Ms Loeffler has over the years donated to Republican campaigns and in 2012 gave $750,000 to a political action committee for then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney, records show. Mr Romney is now a US senator and occasional critic of Mr Trump. Her name previously surfaced as a potential Senate candidate in 2013.“I think that she’s had political aspirations for a long time,” said John Lothian, the publisher of a markets newsletter who knows Ms Loeffler.ICE runs businesses that are highly regulated by federal agencies. NYSE and other stock exchanges have been engaged in a legal fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission over their ability to raise market data fees. The CFTC oversees ICE’s US futures markets and clearing houses. Both agencies are overseen by committees in the Senate and House of Representatives.The NYSE had sought the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, the huge state oil company of Saudi Arabia. Mr Trump in 2017 tweeted his support for a New York listing, calling it “very important for the United States”. Saudi Aramco has since chosen to pursue a listing on Riyadh’s Tadawul exchangeMr Sabato said he expected Mr Trump’s conservative allies to ultimately back Ms Loeffler.“As long as she votes the Trump line, they will really have nothing to complain about,” he said.*This article has been amended to remove a screenshot and quote from a Twitter account that did not belong to Ms Loeffler.
4;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2019-11-11T07:52:24Z;Intercontinental Exchange to launch new platform in Abu Dhabi;Exchange to host first futures contract based on state oil company’s Murban oil;Intercontinental Exchange is to launch a new exchange in Abu Dhabi to host the first futures contract based on the state oil company’s Murban crude.Abu Dhabi National Oil Company will join other oil majors and traders as founder partners in Ice Futures Abu Dhabi, which will be established in Abu Dhabi Global Market, the financial centre of the United Arab Emirates capital, Adnoc’s chief executive said on Monday.The announcement of the new platform, scheduled to launch in the first half of 2020, comes after the Abu Dhabi government earlier this month decided to implement a new price mechanism for Murban. It will use the Murban futures contract as a price marker, removing a decades-long policy of retroactive monthly official selling prices for its mainly Asian customer base.Sultan Al Jaber, Adnoc’s chief executive, described the new contract as an “historic milestone” that would place Abu Dhabi and the UAE at the centre of global crude trading.“It will allow buyers to hedge their risk in the open market,” he told delegates at an energy conference in Abu Dhabi. “And it will help capture more value from every barrel we produce.”The Murban crude futures contract will compete with the Dubai/Oman oil benchmark, which is operated by the Dubai Mercantile Exchange based in the neighbouring emirate’s Dubai International Financial Centre, using a platform provided by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.Adnoc produces around 3m barrels a day of oil, of which around 1.7m is Murban, a light, sweet grade. Mr Jaber said the company is on track to raise output capacity to 4m barrels a day by the end of next year.ICE Murban Futures will be a physically delivered contract with delivery at Fujairah, a port on the UAE’s Gulf of Oman coast.Contracts at the new exchange will be cleared at ICE Clear Europe, alongside other contracts such as ICE Brent.“Murban futures will sit alongside the most significant global oil benchmarks, providing the opportunity for the first time for a much larger group of participants to trade and hedge Murban in a regulated, transparent and accessible venue,” said Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman and chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange.
5;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2019-10-28T16:32:59Z;Intercontinental Exchange launches bond ETF platform;Hub goes live in push towards greater automation of fixed income markets;"Intercontinental Exchange has launched a new hub to help create and redeem exchange traded shares. hoping to steal a march on rivals and accelerate a move towards greater automation in fixed income.The platform went live last week in the US after a year of preparation. It has the backing of industry heavyweights like investment banks JPMorgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, as well as BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and one of the biggest ETF providers.The hub offers a platform to help create and redeem baskets of bonds in ETFs, as well as assemble baskets of fixed income ETFs, a fast-growing sector that has spurred some modernisation of the underlying market. It has already gone live with equity-focused ETFs.Over the past 25 years, the ETF market has mushroomed to 2,000 US funds with $3.9tn in total net assets at the end of August, according to ICI, an investment trade body, with investors lured in by the ease of trading what were previously complex baskets of securities.Most ETFs are based in equities, which accounts for about 9 per cent of the US equities market, according to BlackRock. But the investment house also said it believes bond ETF assets will double over the next five years from the current level of about $1tn.That is a tricky task; governments and companies all have multiple outstanding bonds at various different maturities and backed by diverse sets of rules and regulations. Up to now, bundling them together into tradable units has been a cumbersome process involving manual construction of baskets of bonds.Portfolio trading in fixed-income ETFs has emerged as way to move large, multibillion dollar blocks of debt quickly between investment banks and asset managers. There were $43bn worth of portfolio trades in 2018 compared to a negligible amount in 2017, BlackRock found.ICE’s new platform is aimed at institutional investors and at brokers creating and redeeming the shares. It will streamline the portfolio trading process further and remove the need to package the underlying securities together manually.ICE faces competition from some of the industry’s biggest providers, such as Bloomberg, MarketAxess and Tradeweb, which has facilitated corporate bond deals worth $21bn in the nine months to September.Ben Jackson, ICE president, said it had developed its hub following industry pressure for a venue that could standardise the industry’s disparate data, analytics and execution protocols. He described the fixed income ETF market, which has had a compound annual growth rate of 30 per cent over the past 10 years, as “red hot”.“What this initiative is all about is how can we create some innovation in that primary trading space to help enable and help support the further growth that we’ve seen in the passive investing space,” he said.The industry is also hoping to benefit from a ruling last month by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US markets regulator, that will allow more ETF providers to come to market, and far quicker. In the past asset managers had to apply for so-called “exemptive relief” from existing US mutual fund rules, a cumbersome process that took several months.The first trades on ICE’s new platform were in equities. Fixed income is expected to be online before the end of the year. In August, ICE agreed to buy Bank of America’s MOVE benchmark indices, which track volatility in fixed income markets.This article has been amended to clarify that the platform creates and redeems ETFs"
6;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2019-09-10T10:30:26Z;Tradeweb lines up new benchmark for $16tn Treasuries market;Move aims to reduce reliance on informal prices from a range of data providers;Investors and traders in the $16tn US Treasuries market — which sets borrowing costs for the government, while also providing a starting point to price trillions of dollars in other assets — now have a daily “closing price” to use as an independent benchmark.Until this point asset managers, clearing houses, banks and traders have relied on informal, composite prices from providers such as Bloomberg or Refinitiv, to keep track of the value of their securities, monitor compliance and manage their portfolios.Now Tradeweb, a New York-based bond and derivatives trading venue, has created a new product in conjunction with IBA, the global benchmark administration business owned by Intercontinental Exchange.“The global financial system [needs] a reliable price for the day at one moment in time,” said Tim Bowler, president of IBA.Since 2012, when authorities began doling out billions of dollars of fines to banks for attempts to manipulate vital currency and lending rates, administrators of benchmarks have been forced to tighten standards. The two companies said the new product, which launches on Tuesday, would be the first benchmark for Treasuries built on principles developed by Iosco, the umbrella group for global markets watchdogs.Some $500bn is traded in Treasuries each day around the world, with transactions spread across a number of systems. Tradeweb itself handles about $80bn a day in deals related to Treasuries, mainly between banks and large investors, using prices from roughly 30 dealers.Prices for the new benchmark will be collated from deals on Tradeweb at 3pm Eastern Time, typically the hour large US banks close their books to begin valuations for index pricing. It will be published just before 4pm.“There’s demand for a closing price from exchange traded funds and passive investors,” said Colm Murtagh, head of institutional rates at Tradeweb. “There’s a large amount of ETF flow that has to be done at the close, to reduce tracking errors.”The initial closing prices will apply to more than 900 securities including bonds, notes and Treasury bills.Tradeweb has been operating a similar “closing price” mechanism for the £1.6tn UK gilt market, in conjunction with FTSE Russell, since the government debt office withdrew from that role in 2017.IBA also operates benchmarks for the Libor lending rate, swap rates and gold and silver prices.
7;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2019-08-16T15:45:39Z;Intercontinental Exchange to launch trading in bitcoin futures;Long-delayed move by Atlanta-based group seeks to woo Wall Street investors;Intercontinental Exchange, the world’s second-largest exchange group by market value, is to launch trading in bitcoin futures next month, in a long-awaited bid to lure more Wall Street investors into the sometimes treacherous world of crypto.Bakkt, the business set up by the Atlanta-based group a year ago to develop infrastructure for trading digital assets, said on Friday that it would launch two physically delivered bitcoin futures contracts on September 23, one of them monthly and one daily.Bakkt confirmed it would provide custody for the futures after gaining a trust licence from the New York State Department of Financial Services. Safekeeping of crypto assets has been a big concern of institutional investors, because exchanges have repeatedly suffered hacks and outages.The futures products, which had received a green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, will list on the ICE Futures US derivatives exchange, while ICE’s clearing house will clear them.Institutional interest in the crypto assets market has waned since ICE announced its project in August 2018, as prices dropped from record highs and regulators began to circle the so-called “digital wild west”. In March, Cboe Global Markets, the first big US derivatives exchange to offer bitcoin futures, pulled the plug on its product after volumes dried up. Nevertheless, bitcoin proper continues to attract speculative traders at a time of negative bond yields, which have increased the relative appeal of yieldless assets such as gold. The price of bitcoin has rallied from about $4,000 in April to about $10,000 today.In addition, Facebook’s plans to launch its own digital currency, Libra, raised hopes among crypto advocates that digital currencies may yet be used as a medium of exchange.Kelly Loeffler, Bakkt’s chief executive, said that ICE had received demand for the leveraged products from the Wall Street clients that typically trade ICE’s commodity, currency and stock index contracts.Unlike existing futures contracts, which track bitcoin price indices and rely on unregulated data, the derivatives will be based on “deliveries” of actual bitcoin to a highly secure “warehouse”, the company said. This will be protected by $125m in insurance, it added. ICE has also contributed an extra $35m to its existing $68m guarantee fund to back the transactions at its clearing house.“The market was really built around retail participants,” said Ms Loeffler. “So stepping back and designing the market around institutional needs will help bring in more sophisticated participants.”The company said it also expected to see crypto-focused businesses, such as cryptocurrency mining companies, use the futures to hedge risk rather than just for speculative purposes.Other financial services firms are seeking to develop services to store crypto assets safely. Fidelity, the US asset manager, is among the institutions that has been working on a dedicated custody service, while US crypto exchange Coinbase recently acquired the custody business of wallet provider Xapo in a push into the institutional custody business.The company said it had no immediate plans to launch futures based on other popular cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum. Separately, Bakkt is working with Starbucks to give coffee drinkers a way to convert digital currencies into dollars to make purchases, which Ms Loeffler said would launch “in the coming months”.Bakkt initially sought regulatory oversight for its custody business from the CFTC, before turning to the NYDFS in April this year. Bakkt’s licence to operate from New York’s state financial regulator makes it the 22nd crypto company to receive one.“This approval demonstrates New York’s competitiveness as a hub of innovation and leadership in emerging technologies,” said Linda Lacewell, superintendent.
8;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2019-08-05T12:30:26Z;ICE expands data business by buying MOVE indices;Purchase of volatility benchmarks allows exchange group to target growth of fixed income ETFs;Intercontinental Exchange will acquire Bank of America’s MOVE indices in the latest example of an exchange group expanding its data business after rival operator the London Stock Exchange Group agreed to purchase Refinitiv.The MOVE benchmarks track volatility in the fixed income markets. The most popular, an index that tracks volatility in US government bonds, is the fixed income equivalent of the Vix benchmark that is commonly known as the stock market’s “fear gauge”. Terms of the deal, announced Monday, were not disclosed.The flagship bond benchmark, also known as the Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate, dates back 30 years and measures US interest rate volatility based on options pricing for government debt with maturities of two, five, 10 and 30 years.The suite of indices also includes a benchmark that measures volatility in US interest rate swaps. The deal reunites the MOVE indices with the broader suite of fixed income indices ICE acquired from Bank of America in 2017.The deal is in part motivated by ICE’s desire to target the growth of fixed income exchange traded funds, which this year surpassed $1tn in assets, said Lynn Martin, president and chief operating office for ICE’s data services division.“This acquisition really rounds out the offering that we have established around fixed income risk management,” Ms Martin said. “The MOVE index provides a unique way for firms to provide their views of monetary policy at a very interesting time in fixed income markets.”The purchase comes as exchange operators compete to expand further into the business of selling data and analytics rather than matching buyers and sellers. Indexing in particular has boomed in recent years as investors have moved away from actively managed funds to passive portfolios that follow an index. This has swelled the indexing business to $3.5bn last year from $2bn in 2013, according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting.ICE is emblematic of the shift and in 2015 purchased Interactive Data Corp for $5.2bn, a landmark move that sent shockwaves through the industry.The $27bn LSE deal to acquire Refinitiv sets a new marker of the intense competition between exchange groups. The Refinitiv deal brings a broad set of data and analytics capabilities to LSE, from market data to quantitative modelling.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, said the group had considered many of the properties within Refinitiv when speaking on the company’s earnings call on Thursday.“We’ve had conversations around those assets for more than a decade with multiple management teams,” Mr Sprecher said. “Over many, many years we were not able to find a way we could create value.”ICE’s indexing business includes 5,000 benchmarks that span fixed income, equities, commodities and currencies and are used as a reference for $1tn in assets.“Data are a very important output of liquid markets, but in order to make markets electronic and transparent data are also an important input — it’s a virtuous cycle,” Ms Martin said. “The network that falls around the provision of such data drives the transparency and liquidity of markets, particularly the fragmented parts of the fixed income market.”
9;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2019-06-25T13:24:40Z;ICE muscles into New York harbour heating oil futures;Launch in July on the company’s London futures bourse is a direct challenge to CME;For more than 40 years, clusters of giant oil tanks on New York harbour have been at the centre of one of the world’s most lucrative petroleum markets. Now Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) wants a piece of the action.The exchange and financial data company next month plans to launch a heating oil futures contract for delivery into the harbour, executives said, in a direct challenge to CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange that created the world’s first petroleum futures market when it listed heating oil futures in 1978.The move comes as US oil refineries produce and ship out more low-sulphur distillate oil, a category of petroleum product that includes diesel and heating oil. American exports have averaged more than 1m barrels a day in the past two years, most going to Europe and Latin America.Volume in CME’s Nymex contract, now called ultra-low sulphur diesel futures, reached 46.2bn barrels equivalent last year.ICE has its own New York diesel contract, but prices are based on the prices at Nymex and deals are settled in cash rather than physical oil movements. The exchange's new contract would allow traders to take delivery in the massive tank terminals that dot dockside locations such as those in the South Bronx and Bayonne, New Jersey.Jeff Barbuto, ICE’s global head of oil business development, called the contract, which is set to launch July 29 on the company’s London futures bourse, “a first for us”.Chemically, US heating oil and diesel are virtually identical. ICE is banking on a regulatory distinction to pitch their contract to companies trying to hedge the risks of exporting distillate fuel from the US to Europe.The existing diesel contracts are affected by swings in the market for renewable fuel credits, known as Rins, ICE officials said. Refiners and fuel suppliers are required by US law to either blend biofuels such as soya oil-based diesel into their motor fuels or purchase an equivalent value of Rins.But Rin markets can move wildly whenever federal regulators make changes to biofuel policy.ICE’s contract would not be subject to Rin pricing because it is based on a grade of distillate defined as heating oil under the rules of a big interstate pipeline feeding New York harbour, executives said. As heating oil, not diesel, it is not considered a motor fuel and thus not subject to rules for biofuel blending or credits, ICE said.“For those who are exporting or buying out of New York harbour into international markets, they had to deal with exposure to Rins pricing. This will alleviate that price exposure,” Mr Barbuto said.A CME spokesman declined to comment. An energy futures broker said he was puzzled by ICE’s claim because the contract specifications say the Nymex product “must contain no renewable diesel or biodiesel”.Unlike most futures markets where a single exchange dominates, ICE and CME compete fiercely for volume in oil and natural gas and have more recently had to fend off a Nasdaq futures exchange. In the first quarter, ICE’s energy trading and clearing revenue fell 2 per cent year on year to $229m, while CME’s energy revenue fell 14 per cent to $165m.
10;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2019-05-30T03:00:26Z;Futures exchanges eye shift to ‘Flash Boys’ speed bumps;High-frequency traders fight effort to put brakes on ultrafast transactions;After years of trying to cater to their quickest customers, the world’s biggest futures exchanges are now looking to slow them down.Deutsche Börse’s Eurex will start a pilot scheme next week that introduces tiny delays, or “speed bumps”, to the trading of options on French and German stocks. The London Metal Exchange is also set to receive approval for a similar initiative, from UK authorities.Just two weeks ago US regulators approved Intercontinental Exchange, the second-largest US futures operator, to apply delays on trades of two precious metals contracts.The moves represent a significant shift for the futures industry, which has long supplied high-frequency trading (HFT) shops such as Citadel Securities and Jump Trading with ever-improved connections, so they could try to profit from the difference between the most up-to-date trading price and older prices offered by slower players in the market. But in doing so, other market-making groups have had no choice but to spend heavily on technology to keep pace. Some are now growing weary of the fight.Winners and losers may be separated by just one-millionth of a second but the cumulative costs of missing out have left some players marginalised, the exchanges say, which has contributed to declining liquidity in the market.“[Futures] markets exist for the transfer of risk by increasing liquidity,” said Carl Gilmore, president of Integritas Financial Consulting in Chicago, who is a supporter of speed bumps. “If it draws people in, it makes the markets fairer. If they’re perceived to be unfair, then something needs to be done to correct that perception,” he said.The HFT industry, understandably, has protested efforts to throw sand in their wheels. Rob Creamer, chief executive of Chicago-based Geneva Trading and chairman of FIA PTG, a lobby group, said that while the exchanges’ various projects seemingly only affect small parts of the market, “the broad language” of the proposals “makes us very concerned that this could be like opening a Pandora’s Box of changes to market structure”.Speed bumps in futures markets discriminate against some classes of participant, the HFTs argue, while potentially destabilising other assets in periods of volatility. That is because big markets such as US equities and Treasuries are pegged to prices set by futures.“The goal of financial markets is not to protect or shelter the less informed,” said Brian Quintenz, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission commissioner who opposed the agency’s approval of speed bumps for ICE. “Market efficiencies are earned — they are created through research, investment, and intellectual property.”But ICE and Eurex say certain categories of high-speed traders have become a problem, even if they have generally refrained from practices such as “spoofing”, where orders are rapidly entered and cancelled to trick other traders into buying and selling. The cost of staying in the arms race is concentrating business among a few companies that can afford it, ICE argued in a filing to the CFTC.Efforts to slow down trading have been seen in other asset classes. In equities, for example, IEX Group burst on to the scene on a wave of publicity generated by Flash Boys, Michael Lewis’s book about HFT. The platform’s speed bump — sending all orders down 38 miles of coiled fibre, amounting to a delay of 350 millionths of a second — had a limited impact, though, as IEX accounts for just 3 per cent of all US equities trading.Futures contracts, however, are typically open for long periods and their risk is assessed daily. That tends to concentrate trading in an asset at a sole venue, on one order book: a “winner takes all” approach that means exchanges are in a stronger position to try and change behaviour in the market.ICE and Eurex say they will delay certain types of orders from hitting their books. For ICE it will be three milliseconds — or thousandths of a second — for gold and silver contracts. For Eurex it will be one millisecond for German options and three for French options. In theory, those fractional delays should give market-makers the chance to update their price or cancel an order before a faster trader can hit it, and lock in the price. “More and better posted orders would represent an improvement in overall market quality in the markets,” ICE argued in its CFTC filing.Opposition from the HFTs is tempered for now because the projects carried out by the exchanges are billed as experiments, and affect small parts of the overall market. ICE’s rival, CME Group, for example, is the dominant venue for gold and silver futures trading.But the lobby groups for HFT on both sides of the Atlantic are ready to step up their arguments if the pilots show signs of gaining traction.“You have to let markets evolve and let them decide,” said Niki Beattie, founder of Market Structure Partners, a consultancy, and non-executive chair of XTX Markets, which supports speed bumps.“You can give people choice but if you haven’t got competition then you can’t do it.”
11;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2019-05-01T21:53:27Z;ICE furthers mortgage push with Simplifile acquisition;;Intercontinental Exchange, the US exchanges operator, took a step further into US mortgage market on Wednesday with the purchase of tech company Simplifile for $335m.The Provo, Utah-based group was founded in 2000 with a goal of digitising the closing process in the real estate industry. With 200 employees, it operates an electronic network connecting lenders, settlement agents and county recording offices.ICE, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange, has been building up its business interests in the US mortgage market in anticipation of a large-scale shift to electronic documents from paper records.“Originators, consumers, and investors can obtain significant benefits and savings as the real estate process shifts from paper-based to digital transactions,” said Chris McEntee, president of ICE mortgage services. “By connecting lenders, settlement agents, and counties through a robust network, Simplifile will enhance ICE’s efforts to further streamline a legacy process ripe for innovation.”Last year, ICE took full control of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, or MERS, which tracks 30m home loans, after buying a controlling stake in 2016.Founded in 2000 as an energy trading platform, ICE is now the world’s second-most valuable exchange group. Part of its growth has come from its ability to capitalise on the technologic change in financial markets that has led to the rise of electronic trading.“We’ve seen how ICE has helped to transform markets going through an analog to digital conversion and has made them more transparent and efficient for all participants,” said Paul Clifford, founder and president of Simplifile.
12;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2019-02-12T04:00:32Z;Exchange giants take their rivalry to Texas as shale oil booms;Battle of the contracts reflects Houston’s growing status as an energy trading hotspot;The world’s two biggest energy exchanges have taken their fierce rivalry to Houston, Texas in pursuit of business linked to the millions of barrels of shale oil arriving in the city every day.Last last year, exchange operators CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange introduced duelling futures contracts that track the price of West Texas Intermediate crude as delivered at the coastal city.The battle between the contracts — dubbed WTI Houston and Permian WTI — is a reflection of Houston’s growing status as an energy trading hotspot, as US oil production breaks records, Texas refineries add capacity and exports of crude soar.At the moment, oil markets in the Gulf coast region lack widely traded derivatives contracts, which is a potential problem for companies trying to hedge risks. Contracts culminating in physical delivery at Houston would be a purpose-built tool which reflect the city’s emergence as a gateway between domestic and international markets, exchange executives say.At stake is the chance to own the next major oil contract that some believe could be a major money-spinner for the two exchanges. CME of Chicago and ICE of Atlanta have earned billions of dollars in revenues since establishing the world’s two main oil benchmarks — WTI and North Sea Brent, respectively — three decades ago.US barrels are going to become more and more relevant to global oil flows.”“This is not our average contract launch,” says Jeff Barbuto, global head of oil marketing at ICE. “US barrels are going to become more and more relevant to global oil flows.”Exchanges owned by ICE and CME have competed in crude oil futures since the 1980s. ICE’s Brent crude benchmark is based on North Sea supply. CME’s light, sweet WTI benchmark is delivered to the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma — a small town about 500 miles north of Houston.At times, the price of oil at Houston disconnects from prices in the North Sea, Cushing or both, suggesting the new contracts could be useful to companies selling oil there. Volumes have picked up in recent weeks.“We are following the lead of the commercial customers that are telling us both with their investments and with their marketing where they need risk management,” says Peter Keavey, CME’s global head of energy.The contracts present somewhat different opportunities for each exchange group. At CME, Houston trading complements its flagship oil contract. “The key benchmark is still WTI-Cushing,” Mr Keavey says.For ICE, Houston is a potential beachhead in the US crude oil market, where its main contract is a “lookalike” that tracks the price of CME’s WTI. “ICE would love this to be a giant contract,” says Campbell Faulkner, chief data analyst at OTC Global Holdings, a Houston-based energy broker.Academic research has shown that new futures contracts are likely to fail unless they are substantially better at reducing risks than existing futures contracts, says Hilary Till, principal at Premia Research in Chicago.She cites the economist Holbrook Working’s conclusion that commercial traders would choose an imperfectly tailored futures contract — such as WTI-Cushing to manage risks at Houston — if it protected them against extreme losses, and if the cost of entering and exiting the market were small.CME’s WTI-Cushing and ICE Brent are already deeply traded markets with daily volumes hundreds of times higher than the Houston contracts.“The history of well-designed futures contracts not gaining traction is very long,” Ms Till says.The new CME contract is delivered at Houston terminals owned by Enterprise Products Partners. Its rules require oil with gravity, or density, that measures within a narrow band of 40-44 “degrees”. The oil may contain no more than 0.275 per cent sulphur content and four parts per million of the metals nickel and vanadium.ICE’s contract is delivered at Houston terminals owned by Magellan Midstream Partners, whose specifications allow oil with a wider gravity band of 36-44 degrees and a sulphur cap of 0.45 per cent.“We have a tighter spec,” CME’s Mr Keavey says.ICE, however, has been publishing monthly average readings of gravity, sulphur and metals to demonstrate the consistent quality of the WTI underpinning its contract. The unblended crude is tapped from pipelines running straight from oilfields in west Texas’s Permian Basin, according to the exchange company.“We're really betting that quality control all the way from the wellhead to the water is going to make the difference,” Mr Barbuto says.Dennis Sutton, executive director of the Crude Oil Quality Association, an industry group, says ICE’s reports “could lead me to believe that it is better quality,” but he noted that the figures were averages which could mask day-to-day variation.“If I had crude buyers asking me which ones should I buy and how much should I pay, I’d need to run the numbers through more sophisticated linear program models to come up with the answers,” says Mr Sutton, a former Marathon Petroleum executive.The push to establish a Gulf coast crude oil price standard comes as S&P Global Platts, whose North Sea price assessments form part of the physical trading market, is examining whether to incorporate other light, sweet oil streams into its daily snapshots of the north-west European market.This could include the light US crude oil captured by the Houston contracts, with Platts noting it has seen “regular trade flow” from the region. The Platts Dated Brent benchmark is intrinsically linked to ICE Brent futures, which together help form reference prices for the majority of the world's seaborne crude trade.
13;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2019-02-07T16:45:28Z;ICE will not fight upstart exchange MEMX, CEO says;;Intercontinental Exchange, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, will not fight the latest upstart exchange aiming to cut the cost of trading in the world’s largest stock market.Jeff Sprecher, ICE’s outspoken chairman and chief executive, said his company would not resist the planned new exchange, called Members Exchange, or MEMX.The venture was announced in January and has the backing of a group of US financial heavyweights including high-speed traders Virtu Financial and Citadel Securities as well as Fidelity Investments and TD Ameritrade. Other details, such as its management and business model, have yet to be published.“We will not fight it,” Mr Sprecher said on a conference call with investors as it published fourth-quarter earnings. “We think it has spillover benefits for the New York Stock Exchange.”Mr Sprecher said he saw the plan as a response to heightened regulatory scrutiny of the US equity market, which may ultimately lead to a review of retail order flow.“Retail order flow that comes through retail brokers is largely sold directly to high-frequency market makers. It never goes to exchanges and what we saw is a group of high-frequency market makers that participate in the retail space organize all of the retail brokers that pay these fees to try to quickly move to set up an exchange . . . to try to get it in front of what may be a trend of eliminating and changing their business model,” he said.MEMX will also need approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US markets regulator. “Things are not necessarily moving fast in the US,” he noted.Regarding the long awaited Consolidated Audit Trail, or CAT, Mr Sprecher called it “one of the most difficult projects for the industry.”Born out of the 2010 Flash Crash, CAT is meant to be a comprehensive database of orders and trades in the US equity and options markets. But it has faced years of delays. The most recent snag came earlier this month with the departure of Thesys, the company appointed a few years ago, to build the CAT. Some people close to the deal said exchanges were unhappy with their progress and others talked about payment disputes.“It’s a daunting challenge and it’s been a huge spend on the exchanges. We would like people to come in and defray the costs,” Mr Sprecher said.ICE executives also confirmed the exchanges operator may lead a further financing round for Bakkt, a cryptocurrencies infrastructure business. ICE is the main investor in the venture, which is headed by Kelly Loeffler, ICE’s former head of investor relations.Still, shares of ICE slid on Thursday after disappointment over forward guidance overshadowed an earnings beat for this quarter.The company reported earnings of 94 cents a year for the fourth quarter ahead of analysts’ expectations of 92 cent and up 25 per cent from a year ago. While wild trading at the end of 2018 may have roiled investors, heightened volatility and volumes were a boon to exchanges.Revenue rose 14 per cent to $1.31bn from a year ago and slightly above expectations.But the group’s forecasts disappointed some analysts.Richard Repetto of Sandler O’Neill said ICE’s market data revenue guidance of $2.19bn-$2.24bn for this year was below Sandler’s prior estimate of $2.249bn. For expenses, ICE’s range of $2.15bn-$2.2bn was higher than Sandler’s estimate of $2.15bnAs a result, Mr Repetto lowered his 2019 and 2020 EPS estimates for the ICE.By late afternoon in New York, ICE shares were down 2.9 per cent at $75.18 after falling as much as 4 per cent earlier in the session.
14;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2019-01-24T20:17:08Z;Intercontinental Exchange plans alternative rate to tarnished Libor;;Intercontinental Exchange, the US exchanges operator, is looking to launch an alternative rate to replace Libor, the tarnished benchmark that global authorities are trying to phase out in the next two years.ICE, which also administers the existing London interbank offered rate, is exploring launching a new rate aimed at cash markets such as loans, according to a white paper it published on Thursday. It has been supported by 13 out of the 16 banks that supply daily submissions for Libor.The exchange’s move is an attempt to resolve a stand-off between markets and global regulators over a transition away from Libor, which authorities want to happen by the end of 2021.Watchdogs are concerned that Libor is not based on real market transactions. But the benchmark has become so pervasive that it is still central to thousands of derivatives, bonds, credit cards and loan contracts, with a notional value of around $370tn. Around $200tn of deals are dollar-based loans and derivatives.Regulators would prefer banks and investors to use alternative rates that reflect liquid and active markets, but take-up has been slow, in part because the alternatives are usually based on overnight rates.Critics argue they do not sufficiently replicate Libor over a longer period and they are a particular problem for the loan market. Libor measures the cost of unsecured borrowing between banks for a specific period, usually over one, three and six months.The exchange’s proposed replacement “has been developed to meet the potential short-term interest rate benchmark needs of lenders, borrowers and other users of [cash] products,” ICE’s white paper said.Derivatives markets, which make up the bulk of deals, could transition from using Libor to alternative rates “without too much difficulty”, the paper added.ICE’s benchmark, called the ICE Bank Yield index, would be based on transactions data reported to Finra, the US watchdog, as well as daily data directly submitted by 13 “large, internationally active” banks.The benchmark would be based on unsecured lending, which, like Libor, would cover one, three and six months for lending in US dollars. It would be published every morning New York time.In the paper, ICE also highlighted concerns that if the markets use overnight rates, in times of stress banks could be forced to lower their cost of lending, which would create an imbalance between risks and liabilities on their books.ICE’s alternative would mimic Libor movements in volatile markets, and allow banks to match their liabilities, ICE said.Last week Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, told UK parliamentarians that a transition from Libor “will happen”.“We will work with the industry to make sure it happens . . . but it’s not going back,” he added.
15;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-10-01T03:00:57Z;ICE makes its move in $15tn US mortgage market;Exchange group bets on modernisation as it takes full control of home loan registry MERS;The company that owns the New York Stock Exchange is putting itself at the centre of the $15tn US mortgage market in anticipation of an epochal switch to electronic documents from unwieldy stacks of paper.Intercontinental Exchange, which is known for transforming musty financial institutions into lucrative high-tech trading venues, is close to taking full control of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, which keeps track of almost 30m US home loans.It is doing so at a time when 99 per cent of mortgage documents are still on paper, but amid an industry push for digitisation that ICE’s founder Jeffrey Sprecher hopes will turn the utility-like MERS into a new profit engine for his company.Mr Sprecher first bought a controlling stake in 2016, and has only hinted at his ambition for the business since then. He has likened MERS to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, the securities clearing house owned by banks that long dealt in paper share certificates.Brendon Weiss, chief operating officer at MERS, told the Financial Times that ICE intends a “full acquisition” of the registry. The deal for the remaining stake it does not already own is expected within the next few weeks.“ICE’s experience in the past has been taking analogue markets and making them digital,” he said. Among those were the London’s former International Petroleum Exchange and the New York Board of Trade, whose noisy trading pits shut after ICE acquired them (see below).MERS was created in 1995 to track changes in loan ownership and servicing rights, making it easier for loans to change hands among its 5,000 members.For ICE, full ownership of MERS presents an opportunity to transform the member-owned utility by reducing costs and improving efficiencies. “It’s a very big total addressable market. It’s probably the second largest in the world,” said Christopher McEntee, ICE’s director of corporate development, who joined the company from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta.The arrival of ICE into the mortgage industry has sparked intrigue as to its plans. Founded in 2000 as an energy trading platform, it is now the world’s second-most valuable exchange group.Federal records show the company’s representatives have lobbied Congress on “Housing Market Structure Modernisation,” efforts ICE executives would not shed more light on.In mid-September, ICE migrated MERS’s almost 30m records to the same high-security data centre in Mahwah, New Jersey where NYSE matches deals between microsecond-speed stock traders, a company spokesman said.“If I had to guess, what is probably their long-term play is to create the New York Stock Exchange for mortgages,” said Tim Anderson, director of eStrategy at DocMagic, a software vendor connected to the MERS system.Mr McEntee, who sits on the MERS board, declined to discuss the purchase price for the remaining MERS stake. ICE has not disclosed what percentage of the business it currently owns.He said ICE does not currently plan to turn MERS into a mortgage exchange, even if the technology resides in the same building as NYSE’s computers. Individual home loans are too heterogeneous to lend themselves to the kind of rapid-fire continuous auctions that comprise exchange trading, he said.What ICE intends to do is make it faster and easier to track who has issued home loans and who purchased them. Improved technology could hasten the adoption of digital mortgages and facilitate the process of securitisation, in which home loans are bundled for sale to big investors.Just 347,000 digital mortgage notes, known as eNotes, have been registered at MERS so far, although they have been permitted by law since the year 2000. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage agencies, first accepted them for purchase more than a decade ago.For several reasons — not least the subprime mortgage crisis — the industry has been slow to adopt them. “It’s been fits and starts for 18 years,” said Margo Tank, a lawyer at DLA Piper.They may be finally gaining momentum. Ginnie Mae, which guarantees government-insured and guaranteed loans, recently said it would lay groundwork for processing digital mortgages by 2019.Lenders such as Quicken Loans have begun to originate digital mortgages. A handful of warehouse lenders such as Bank of America have begun to fund them. The US Treasury department has endorsed their wider use.“It’s a potential tipping point,” said Michael Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, who also chairs MERS’ membership committee. “Finally we’re at a place where we’re not seeing the roadblocks that have kept the industry from moving to a fully digital process.”The promise here is that if you can get more machine scalability you can get marginsThe low-profile MERS burst into the headlines during the housing crisis. It was sued by borrowers fighting foreclosure and by local governments claiming it robbed them of recording fees, but it prevailed in court.In 2011, however, US banking regulators ordered MERS to improve its practices after finding management failures in tracking mortgage loans and initiating foreclosures. They lifted the order in January this year, citing full compliance.With legal problems resolved, ICE executives now see MERS as poised for growth and mortgages as a huge untapped opportunity. The business registers 5.5m loans a year, 75 per cent of all new mortgages.MERS charges users modest fees, typically $11.95 per loan registration. ICE shareholders accustomed to the company’s rank as one of the nation’s most profitable companies may want to see higher fees.But Mr McEntee said he envisaged higher profit margins for MERS through better technology and stronger volumes rather than fee raises. “The promise here is that if you can get more machine scalability you can get margins,” he said.Mr Sprecher has said MERS is ripe for change. “Handling boxes and boxes of mortgages is a massive undertaking for many of these companies and there’s a lot of incumbents, and there’s a lot of things that have to get disintermediated in order to go from analogue to digital, but the trend is there,” he told a conference in June.“It’s one of the largest asset classes that we see that’s still analogue, and we want to be right at the middle of it.”Most financial exchanges were built in centuries past, when brokers and traders agreed deals with shouts and hand gestures. Intercontinental Exchange was formed in May 2000 as the dotcom bubble was losing air.Entrepreneur Jeffrey Sprecher set up the company as an all-electronic marketplace for gas and power. ICE received an inadvertent assist from the energy trader Enron, whose rival online platform imploded when the company did. “After the collapse of Enron, our revenues took off,” Mr Sprecher has said.A lack of attachment to physical trading venues marked its growth. In 2001 it acquired International Petroleum Exchange, the largest energy futures exchange in Europe. After shutting down the IPE’s floor in 2005, volumes in flagship crude oil contract Brent have grown eightfold.ICE also shut down the trading floor after purchasing the New York Board of Trade, an exchange for cotton, sugar and other soft commodities, in 2007. The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange, a Canadian canola seed venue, was acquired by ICE and incorporated into its US-based electronic futures platform.In 2013 ICE made its largest-ever acquisition with the purchase of the NYSE Euronext. The prize justifying its $10bn price tag was the all-electronic Liffe futures exchange in London, but the deal also gave ICE ownership of the New York Stock Exchange — whose ornate floor has been kept open.Additional reporting by Joe Rennison in New York
16;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-08-30T22:03:47Z;Nasdaq admits closing auction blunders;Exchange says it mistakenly executed more than a thousand trades;Nasdaq has mistakenly allowed more than a thousand trades to be executed around the market open and close, an error that it said prevented other investors from getting their orders filled at a crucial time of the trading day.In an alert to the market, Nasdaq said certain orders, called minimum quality orders, were mistakenly included in the opening and closing “cross” where outstanding orders are executed.The exchange said the error dates back to November 2011. Closing prices are widely used to set the valuations of mutual funds and other investment instruments.Minimum quantity orders are so called because execution of the trade is contingent on a certain amount of the order being filled. However, because these orders often do not result in actual trades, Nasdaq decided to exclude them from the cross, but failed to do so.Since implementation, Nasdaq has excluded minimum quantity orders from the opening and closing price calculation, the alert said, “but included them in the execution process”.The mistake meant there were instances where other orders did not execute because the minimum quantity orders that were ahead of them “by price or time” were included in the execution process, Nasdaq said.“It is seven years and them not knowing about it — that is just unacceptable,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-founder of Themis Trading. “The person who lost here appears to be the person who did not get the [order filled] and should have. Also, had these orders been in the calculation, there might have been a different closing price.”Mr Saluzzi also questioned whether some sophisticated traders may have detected the “bug” and been able to profit from it. A spokesman for the exchange declined to comment.Nasdaq did not provide information on the full period since 2011 but said its analysis of 2018 data shows that 1,287 minimum quantity orders have been executed during 1,231 opening or closing crosses.The exchange pointed out that these orders represented a tiny fraction of trading activity: it has executed more than 48m orders across more than 892,000 opening and closing auctions so far in 2018, it said.Nasdaq said that about 50 customers were affected in 2018.It pledged to fix the problem.A person with knowledge of the situation said Nasdaq reported the issue to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been taking a tougher stance on interruptions and glitches that have come to characterise modern markets.In March, the New York Stock Exchange agreed to pay $14m to settle regulatory charges over a string of alleged violations of new rules around computerised trading in US equities.The growth of index investing and exchange traded funds has added to the importance of the closing auction since ETFs need to create or redeem shares by the close of trading.
17;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-08-21T04:00:28Z;CME pulls ahead in race to control bitcoin futures;Rival Cboe relaxes trading rules in attempt to bolster cryptocurrency business;The world’s largest exchange group is pulling ahead in the nascent bitcoin derivatives market and its rival has retooled its product to stay in the race.Volumes of bitcoin futures listed by CME Group doubled in July and have continued to increase in August, even as the price of the digital currency collapsed.Such growth has been lacking at fellow Chicago exchange operator Cboe Global Markets, which last December launched its own bitcoin futures contracts one week before CME.The two exchanges are under pressure to gain traction because it is rare for similar futures contracts to flourish in more than one venue. A third company, Intercontinental Exchange, plans to offer its own bitcoin futures in November.Cboe this month quintupled the number of bitcoin contracts any one trader may hold to match the limits in place at CME. The move would “promote competition” and provide “more of a level playing field” between CME and Cboe, “enabling market participants to trade between the two products”, the company said in a regulatory filing. Cboe declined to comment further.CME’s bitcoin futures volumes now exceed volumes of spot bitcoin traded on San Francisco-based Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange.This month, daily futures volumes have averaged more than 30,000 bitcoin equivalent on CME and 5,000 on Cboe, according to data from the exchanges. Coinbase volumes have averaged more than 11,000 bitcoin, said Coinalyze, a cryptocurrency information service. Coinbase had no comment.Both CME and Cboe have sought to build liquidity by paying high-volume traders. Last week, CME extended a programme of rebates for bitcoin market-makers until at least February 2019, a regulatory filing showed.CME said more than 1,600 accounts have traded its bitcoin futures. The market remains tiny, however: CME’s total exchange volumes averaged 13.5m contracts per day in July.
18;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-08-03T18:57:32Z;Intercontinental Exchange poised to list bitcoin futures;Group to launch Bakkt venture that aims to expand the use of digital currencies;"Intercontinental Exchange, the world’s second-largest exchange group by market value, has deepened its involvement in digital currencies with a new company that aims to make them mainstream for institutional investors and consumers.The Atlanta-based group on Friday announced plans to launch Bakkt, a business that plans to build infrastructure allowing easier use of digital currencies for everyday transactions. Earmarked to lead the venture is Kelly Loeffler, ICE’s head of investor relations and the wife of Jeff Sprecher, chief executive.The company’s first step would be the launch of bitcoin futures deliverable in one day, effectively tracking spot prices under the umbrella of a regulated exchange and clearing house.Devotees of digital currencies tout them as an alternative to conventional money, but they have sputtered as a medium of exchange.They have instead become tools of speculation. The price of bitcoin was $7,463 on Friday, down more than 60 per cent from a high of nearly $20,000 in December. Cash exchanges operate under minimal regulation and hackers have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from some.Indicating its ambitions, ICE is working with Starbucks to give coffee drinkers a way to convert digital currencies into dollars to make purchases. Maria Smith, Starbucks’ vice-president for partnerships and payments, said in a statement that it sought “expanding payment options for our customers”.ICE’s move follows the December 2017 debut of bitcoin futures by exchange rivals CME Group and Cboe Global Markets, both based in Chicago. Their adoption was seen as an important step towards adding institutional credibility to cryptocurrencies, but volumes to date have been modest.Bakkt’s bitcoin futures intends to list on the ICE Futures US derivatives exchange, a home to commodity, currency and stock index contracts. Unlike existing contracts, which track bitcoin price indices, ICE futures would be based on “deliveries” of actual bitcoin to a new “warehouse” the company plans to develop. ICE plans to create a separate guarantee fund, financed by Bakkt, to back the transactions at its clearing house.“In bringing regulated, connected infrastructure together with institutional and consumer applications for digital assets, we aim to build confidence in the asset class on a global scale,” Mr Sprecher said in a statement.ICE plans to hold a majority stake in Bakkt. Other investors include Alan Howard, the co-founder of UK hedge fund Brevan Howard; Eagle Seven and Susquehanna, two leading proprietary trading firms; and M12, the venture capital arm of Microsoft, which is helping to develop cloud technology underpinning the venture.ICE has since 2015 had a minority stake in Coinbase, a bitcoin exchange based in San Francisco. Bakkt would be separate from that company, ICE said."
19;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-06-08T20:45:15Z;ICE abandons attempt to unseat CME in grain futures;Corn, wheat and soyabean contracts launched in 2012 failed to attract liquidity;Intercontinental Exchange is pulling the plug on US corn, wheat and soyabean futures products after an unsuccessful attempt to storm Chicago’s fortress of grain trading.The exchange operator said in a notice Friday that it would cease listing new contracts on the agricultural commodities and delist all of those without any open interest. That accounted for all but one, the ICE August soyabean futures contract, in which a total of four contracts remain outstanding.ICE launched the grain and oilseed futures and options in 2012 in a bold gambit to break into a market controlled by Chicago-based CME Group and its predecessor exchanges since the 19th century. The move broke a taboo because ICE allowed trading for 22 hours a day, including during the release of market-moving crop reports from the US Department of Agriculture.CME’s Chicago Board of Trade had traditionally paused action during the reports to allow traders to digest the data held within. After ICE’s foray it relented and expanded its trading hours. The USDA subsequently changed the release times of its crop reports to midday so they would coincide with times of highest volume.ICE’s corn, wheat, soyabean, soyabean oil and soyabean meal contracts were “lookalikes” that tracked the price moves of CME’s futures. But they never caught on, another example of the adage that liquidity begets liquidity in futures markets.Meanwhile, CME grain markets have been booming. This week the company announced that open interest in its corn futures had surpassed 2m contracts.The last remaining ICE grain and oilseed contracts are canola seed futures, inherited with its acquisition of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange in Canada, and a thinly traded feed wheat contract listed on its London futures bourse.
20;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-06-08T11:30:36Z;Invesco fees row is a tragedy for shareholder democracy;Retail investors are the biggest shareholders, but their voice is unlikely to be heard;"I spent some time this week discussing how best to attract a broader group of people to work in the financial industry.How can one challenge the view that, say, the fund management profession is laddish, overly mathematical, greedy, exploitative, entitled and pathetically socially unaware?This should be easy. A good job in fund management is as much about behavioural finance as numbers. It can be done part-time or inside set hours, and is one of the few professions that gives people a genuine opportunity to have a real governance impact (via effective ownership of corporate Britain).But it isn’t easy, for the simple reason that enough of the industry behaves badly enough, often enough and publicly enough to tar everyone with their sticky brush. You will all have your own list of maddening examples of this (do send them in).But for me, the recent dispute between the directors of the Invesco Perpetual Enhanced Income Trust (IPE) is a classic of the genre.One reason I like investment trusts as an asset class is because they have proper boards of directors who run the companies for the benefit of shareholders — doing the compliance, hiring and firing the asset management firms they feel can run the money best.So I was pleased when the directors of the IPE asked Invesco, the fund management firm it had been employing, to reduce the fees it charges for running the assets in the trust.Invesco was charging the trust 0.9 per cent a year (very much at the high end in the world of modern investment trusts) plus an annual performance fee. Add in other costs, and the total ongoing charges for the trust in 2017/18 came to 2.15 per cent (the market average is less than 1.5 per cent, according to the Association of Investment Companies).Between 2007 and 2017, Invesco’s management fees for IPE amounted to more than £12m. Its long-term performance is admittedly very good — over the past decade, IPE has delivered a total return of 95.6 per cent to investors, far more than the 30 per cent average for funds in its sector. But £12m is just too high — particularly for a bond fund with a market cap of only £120m.The directors were therefore quite right to want to see the costs reduced and have asked their fund managers to produce a new proposal. The fund managers were then perfectly within their rights to say no (unless you are a man working at the BBC, you don’t usually have to take a salary cut if you don’t want to). They did — and resigned.So far, so fine. What happened next was not fine. In the wake of Invesco’s resignation, the directors should have held a “beauty parade” — asking other fund managers to pitch for the business instead. A cheaper one would have been chosen, and the money moved from Invesco. Job done.However, that is not quite what has happened. The directors did have a beauty parade (in which Invesco could have participated to remake its case, but did not). They also found good managers prepared to do the job for much less (the lowest fee offer was 0.35 per cent and the highest 0.65 per cent). But then Invesco stepped in.It called for the directors who challenged its fees to resign; new ones to be hired (they have even proposed candidates); and a shareholder vote on the matter to be held in July.You might think that this would be totally beyond its control, given that Invesco is a contractor to the business, not the majority owner.But it turns out that Invesco, via holdings in its other funds, controls 16.8 per cent of the shares in IPE itself. Assuming Invesco intends to use these voting rights, it could get the board it wants, and keep on managing the trust — and charging fees. This is potentially shocking stuff.If Invesco wins the day, the fees investors are charged should still fall (IPE’s board said that before the resignation, Invesco had agreed cut its fee to 0.77 per cent).Assuming it succeeds, the fund management firm’s behaviour will nonetheless have displayed pretty much every unattractive characteristic on offer in the industry. If Invesco uses its clients’ voting rights on the IPE shares, this could disadvantage those very same clients by keeping fees higher than they would have been otherwise.In that event, one can only wonder how those clients might feel if they knew that they had been used by their fund manager as a weapon against their own interests. Hello greed, exploitation and entitlement (Invesco may have another interpretation for any such behaviour but I can’t present that here, as the company declined to talk to me when I outlined this potential scenario).However, the key point in this dispute is about shareholder democracy.Invesco has the support of a few other institutional shareholders (who I assume have confidence that Invesco can continue to keep up this level of investment performance to compensate for higher fees). This takes the level of the potential vote it controls up to 23 per cent. With that, small as it sounds, they could easily win. Why?There may be rights and wrongs on both sides in this dispute that we don’t know about yet, but the lack of voice ordinary shareholders will get in its resolution is a very, very bad thingBecause as Winterflood Securities puts it, “a significant element of the register is held through platforms [ie by small retail investors] and so will prove difficult to corral”.Retail investors don’t hold the shares directly, so they won’t vote. The rise of the investment platform (wonderful as it is to be able hold shares in such a simple way) has robbed individual shareholders of their ability to participate easily in this kind of thing.If those individual shareholders could have their say, Invesco would not (I think) be in with a chance. I have hopes that this situation will soon change — the technology exists to make it possible.But in the meantime, if you hold units in a fund that holds IPE, do write to, or email, Invesco’s client relations manager via its head office in Henley-on-Thames and complain about your votes being used like this. And if you hold them directly, call your platform and ask how you can use your vote.There may be rights and wrongs on both sides in this dispute that we don’t know about yet, but the lack of voice ordinary shareholders will get in its resolution is a very, very bad thing.

21;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-06-05T12:17:14Z;NYSE buys business advice video group Radiate;Deal comes as exchange aims to boost services in corporate listings battle;The New York Stock Exchange is buying Radiate, a company which creates short videos of career advice from business leaders, to boost its services in the arms race for corporate listings in the world’s biggest equity market.Betty Liu, who founded Radiate and worked as a business journalist for outlets including Bloomberg Television and the Financial Times, will join NYSE as executive vice-chairman as of July 9 and have a seat on the NYSE Group board. “We have 2,400 listed companies on the exchange and we want to create a bigger community for them,” Ms Liu told the FT, saying Radiate’s short videos on leadership and live events would help make a NYSE listing “more than just a trading relationship” for existing members and prospective initial public offering candidates.Her appointment comes just weeks after Intercontinental Exchange, NYSE’s parent, named Stacey Cunningham as the first female leader in the New York exchange’s 226-year history. NYSE and Nasdaq are locked in a battle for corporate listings that involves not just intense blitzes for IPOs, but efforts to persuade companies to transfer from rival exchanges.[Ms Liu will] help us offer our customers even more opportunities to tap the NYSE network to connect and share ideasThe pattern over time has been that Nasdaq wins a greater number of deals, but the “Big Board” attracts listings of larger size. So far this year, 55 companies raising $12.3bn have listed on Nasdaq while 29 companies raising $15.7bn have opted for NYSE.Following the dotcom boom of the 1990s and early 2000s, NYSE changed its standards and has targeted more tech listings, winning high-profile deals in recent years like Snap, the owner of messaging app Snapchat, and music streaming service Spotify.NYSE did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, but said the transaction would not affect ICE’s 2018 results or capital return plans.Radiate, which has just three full-time staff and about 20 freelancers, has built a library of concise video lessons from chief executives about leadership and management challenges, from how to hire good people to how to fire underperformers. Lessons on time management and how chief executives handle emails were among its most popular videos, Ms Liu said.“We look forward to building on Radiate, the innovative business [Ms Liu] founded, as part of our efforts to enrich the NYSE network and experience for our listed issuers and the broader business community,” said Jeff Sprecher, ICE’s chairman and chief executive.Ms Cunningham said Ms Liu would “help us offer our customers even more opportunities to tap the NYSE network to connect and share ideas on our global stage”.
22;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-05-22T19:10:21Z;Intercontinental Exchange: right recipe;Data reigns supreme for the exchange group;Stacey Cunningham, chief operating officer of the New York Stock Exchange, once took a leave of absence to train in a demanding restaurant kitchen. She is no longer a sous chef. Her appointment on Tuesday makes Ms Cunningham the first female president of the Big Board in its more than 200-year history. Her predecessor, Tom Farley, is departing to set up a “blank-check” shell investment company with Dan Loeb.Ms Cunningham began as an intern on the floor of NYSE in the 1990s. Her career has coincided with the rise of electronification in securities trading that crimped profitability and resulted in a wave of global consolidation among exchanges. NYSE was acquired in 2012 by Intercontinental Exchange.In spite of the acquisition, ICE has opted to focus on data alongside trading. It now makes nearly half of its $6bn in annual revenue from sales of pricing and other financial data. The company believes these two units — data packages and securities exchanges — form a virtuous circle. Its 2015 acquisition of Interactive Data Corporation, a pricing service and data feed for hard-to-value securities, for $5bn, is part of the same strategy. Along with other niche data acquisitions such as S&P Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis, and SuperDerivatives, ICE is creating bundles that buy- and sell-side analysis firms have become heavily dependent on.Data providers have found new favour because of their recurring revenue streams and stickiness among such customers. Meanwhile, NYSE has become a strong rival to Nasdaq for high-profile tech listings such as Snap and Spotify. It remains the leader for global IPOs (little actual trading goes on at the NYSE venue on Wall Street but firms still love to ring the bell). The exchange may be stuck in the middle of a tricky tech revamp but ICE has said that NYSE’s profit margin and cash flow has doubled since it was acquired. Ms Cunningham will be a big figure for NYSE even if her bosses at ICE regard trading as just one ingredient in the dish they are serving.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

The appointment was confirmed by a spokesperson for Intercontinental Exchange, NYSE’s parent company.Her appointment comes eighteen months after Nasdaq, NYSE’s big rival, named Adena Friedman as its first female head.Ms Cunningham originally started out on the NYSE floor in the 1990s as a “specialist” for JJC, handling the shares of companies such as Hershey Foods and Ambac Financial. After she left the floor in the early 2000s, she took a nine-month programme at the Institute of Culinary Education in Manhattan, which required six weeks working in a restaurant, and rejoined NYSE in 2012 after a spell at Nasdaq.The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Mr Farley will join Far Point, a special purpose acquisition vehicle backed by Daniel Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund, the newspaper said. Mr Farley had been president of NYSE since its purchase by ICE in late 2013.
24;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;ICE to begin futures trading in new alternative Libor rate;;IntercontinentalExchange, which administers the Libor lending rate, is to begin trading futures on the alternative benchmark rate intended to supplant the scandal-hit Libor.The US exchange operator said on Wednesday it would launch 3-month futures contracts based on the Sterling Overnight Index Average, or Sonia, a measure of the short-term price at which banks and building societies lend to each other.The reformed Sonia benchmark part of a broader global push this year by banks and regulators to wean the market off the tarnished Libor rates, whose role has come under fierce scrutiny after banks and brokers were found trying to manipulate them. From next week the Bank of England will begin publishing the new Sonia rates.Libor has been built up over 30 years into a lynchpin of the financial system. Oliver Wyman, the consultancy, estimates total notional exposure to Libor is around $240tn, in the form of mortgages, consumer loans, credit card rates, derivatives and bonds. Companies, banks and consumers use the benchmarks to underpin their payment schedules.IBA, a unit of ICE, took over administration of Libor from the British Bankers Association in 2013, is also working on a reformed version of the benchmark. It argues that many market participants do not want to see Libor phased out.Dozens of companies and financial institutions are wary of moving away from Libor because it could dramatically change their payments exposures. Sonia is an overnight rate that can fluctuate while Libor rates are held steady for a term.The new 3 month Sonia futures contracts will be cash-settled and will debut on June 1, subject to regulatory approval, ICE said. It becomes the second venue to try to capture the potential new business, after CurveGlobal, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange Group and several investment banks.The three month contract is the main reference benchmark for swaps and futures deals. Traders in derivatives markets watch the overnight benchmark rates closely because the returns tend to closely mirror those earned on margin posted on derivatives. The trader can benefit when the spread between Libor and overnight rates widens.ICE’s European exchange is also the main venue for trading and clearing most other sterling-related futures, including gilts and the main interest rate benchmark, called short sterling.
25;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-04-05T21:28:57Z;Chicago Stock Exchange agrees sale to ICE;Move follows collapse of deal with consortium including Chinese investors;The Chicago Stock Exchange has agreed a sale to Intercontinental Exchange, after the collapse of a deal to sell to a consortium that included Chinese investors.It comes a month after the Chicago exchange abandoned a plan for a controversial acquisition by a bidding group called North America Casin Holdings, which was based on the idea of making Chicago a destination for Chinese listings.The purchase adds to the growing footprint of ICE, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago bourse’s larger rival. The exchanges announced the deal on Thursday but did not disclose terms.According to people with knowledge of the deal, that sale price was about $70m compared with the $20m to $30m the Casin group was poised to pay.Atlanta-based ICE has clinched a number of fixed-income acquisitions over the past few years, including that of BondPoint, a bond trading platform, and Interactive Data. The Chicago deal will bolster its equity franchise.John Kerin, chief executive and president of the Chicago exchange, said: “ICE is a proven innovator, and we are looking forward to joining its family of exchanges.”Shares of ICE, which has a market capitalisation of more than $42bn, were up 0.2 per cent in New York.The sale will give NYSE another exchange licence to potentially experiment with, analysts said. In 2016, NYSE bought the National Stock Exchange and plans to launch this year with a taker-maker model — the flipside of the traditional maker taker model for US equity trading whereby exchanges offer rebates to brokers that post orders and charge for those that access existing ones.ICE is a proven innovator, and we are looking forward to joining its family of exchangesThe Chicago exchange, founded in the late 1800s and now accounting for about 1 per cent of daily US equities, will continue to operate as a registered national securities exchange based in Chicago. It represents the last of the traditional regional equity bourses in the US, a group that once included dozens of exchange across the country. They became more difficult and expensive to operate with the rise of modern, largely electronic trading.The sale to ICE is expected to close by the year’s end pending regulatory approval.The Chicago exchange gave up on the Casin deal after regulators rejected it. Regulators also thwarted a plan by the Chicago bourse to offer a delay on some orders.“On the Chicago side, they lost their Chinese-backed bid for regulatory reasons and they also were denied by the SEC recently on their speed bump,” said Doug Clark, head of Americas market structure at ITG, the agency broker. “That cramped their ability to do things that were differentiating and the financing they thought was coming disappeared.”The Securities and Exchange Commission last month voted against the Casin transaction. It had been left in limbo last summer when the commission delayed an earlier approval pending further review.The SEC cited concerns that it conflicted with rules governing exchanges, but the plan had been met with opposition over the presence of Chinese investors in the bidding consortium.

The deal is expected to close by year end pending regulatory approvals. The Securities and Exchange Commission had put the kibosh on the earlier Chicago deal after a saga that included SEC staff approving it, but then regulators imposing a stay on the approval only to ultimately reject it.The purchase of the Chicago Stock Exchange, which handles roughly 1 per cent of US stock trading a day, adds to ICE’s growing exchange footprint.The Atlanta-based group has clinched a number of fixed income acquisitions over the past few years, including its purchase of BondPoint, a bond trading platform, and Interactive Data. Its deal for the Chicago Stock Exchange will in turn bolster its equity franchise.“After an in-depth review of strategic alternatives for CHX, we believe this transaction is clearly in the best interests of CHX stockholders and positions the organisation well going forward,” said Matthew Frymier, chairman of the Chicago Stock Exchange.
27;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-03-27T21:35:22Z;ICE communications head Kelly Loeffler to step down at year’s end;;Intercontinental Exchange has announced the pending resignation of Kelly Loeffler, a senior executive who helped win over Wall Street as the company emerged from roots as an energy trading platform into a pillar of finance. Ms Loeffler, ICE’s head of communications, marketing and investor relations, will depart at the end of the year, the company said. After joining ICE in 2002, Ms Loeffler fielded queries from investors and journalists as the company acquired a string of bourses including the New York Board of Trade and the New York Stock Exchange. She helped prepare ICE for its initial public offering in 2005. In 2004 she married Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, forming a high-profile couple in the exchange industry. ICE did not provide a reason for her departure. Ms Loeffler is co-owner of the Atlanta Dream, a women’s professional basketball team. She had previously been reported to be considering a run for elected office. Scott Hill, chief financial officer, said: “Kelly has been an integral member of our management team and served as a key link to our investors, while mentoring countless employees over the years. She has earned this opportunity to step back and pursue the interests that she put on hold to help build our company. She’s assembled a strong team that will continue to drive us forward.”In recent months ICE said it has added three executives to handle investor relations, communications and marketing functions. They are, respectively, Warren Gardiner, Josh King and Russ Rubino. This story has been corrected to remove a reference to the International Petroleum Exchange, which ICE acquired in 2001, before Ms Loeffler’s arrival.

That broke the record of 3.8m contracts set in July 2007, ICE Futures Europe confirmed.Financial futures are used by investors to speculate and hedge against expected moves in borrowing costs. Sterling futures contracts at ICE are tied to rates set by the Bank of England.The Bank will meet to set rates this week and last month indicated rate rises were likely to come earlier and faster than previously expected. Investors are now pricing in a 70 per cent chance the BoE will raise rates in May, analysts said.The pound rose above $1.40 against the US dollar on Monday after UK and EU leaders struck a preliminary agreement for a 21-month Brexit transition.Rising growth in the eurozone is also fuelling expectations of a change in tone on monetary policy from the European Central Bank during the year. Average daily volume of Euribor futures, which are tied to rates set by the ECB, hit 1m contracts at ICE in February, up 37 per cent year-on-year.

The same goes for heavyweight bidders for strategic assets. The prospect of Michael Spencer, a City entrepreneur and rhino conservationist, auctioningNex Group has therefore excited minority investors. The price could be steep if a herd of pachyderms joins the stampede.The shares nosed up 30 per cent to 870p on news that CME Group had made an approach for Nex, valuing it at £3.3bn. Bosses at the US exchanges group should warily remember Mr Spencer is as shrewd an observer of business cycles as he is of wildlife. He sold out of voice broking last year.This meant saying goodbye to ICAP, the business he built up through the nineties and noughties, for an estimated personal gain of over £200m. The thrill had gone. ICAP had paid a £55m rate-rigging penalty. The rise of automated trading had made voice brokers — shouty folk who trade weird investments by phone — as endangered as rhinos.This left Mr Spencer with a legacy business presciently stuffed with financial technology assets. CME will be greatly interested in an electronic trading platform for US Treasuries. This would sit sweetly alongside CME’s Treasury futures trading operation. A Nex unit that nets derivatives exposure to reduce the outlay of banks is an attractive asset to numerous buyers.Nex warned on profits recently. This means the midpoint of the acquisition price range estimated by Liberum — 885p per share — would be a steep 37 times current year earnings. This becomes a thriftier 26 times, in line with large quoted exchange groups, at next year’s forecast earnings.Besides, Nex has fintech glitz. It could sell for north of £10 per share if big beasts such as CME’s Terry Duffy and Jeff Sprecher of Intercontinental Exchange lock horns.

That added to the day’s tumult by causing delays and additional suspensions as shares were recovering. The session included 1,278 trading suspensions and, of the 999 pauses on Arca, 697 were repeated halts.A NYSE spokesperson said: “We believe this settlement is in the best interest of the NYSE exchanges. We take our regulatory obligations seriously and remain focused on building and maintaining industry leading technology and ensuring that our markets operate with the utmost integrity.”NYSE and its affiliates NYSE Arca and NYSE American neither admitted nor denied the findings in the SEC’s order.

That further strengthens its holding of one of the Europe’s biggest independent market utilities.The group bought a 4.7 per cent stake in Euroclear from Royal Bank of Scotland for €275m in October, in a deal that valued the European group at more than €5bn.

32;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-01-23T19:47:40Z;Nasdaq seeks boost from bitcoin products;Chief executive Adena Friedman exploring cryptocurrency offering for retail investors;Nasdaq is actively exploring bitcoin-linked products and other digital currencies that would appeal to retail investors, Adena Friedman, the exchange’s chief executive has said. The initiative comes as the financial establishment is looking for ways to play a part in the rise of cryptocurrencies, which gathered pace with bitcoin’s sharp appreciation last year, where trading volatility stands in sharp contrast to the placid markets for traditional assets.Nasdaq rivals Cboe Global Markets and CME Group already have rolled out their own bitcoin futures contracts.“We are looking to create a product geared to investors, not traders, as an investible asset,” Ms Friedman told the Financial Times, adding that what she is calling a “digital gold” model might be the most effective precedent to use when structuring retail-friendly products.She described digital gold as a store of value that would exist alongside other “real” currencies, rather than a fully fledged currency in its own right. Nasdaq wants its product to be a vehicle for long-term investment rather than trading or arbitraging against moves in bitcoin.Nasdaq has previously expressed interest in bitcoin futures. While it did not offer specifics, a total return future is a type of derivative that mimics a privately-negotiated swap, but is traded on a regulated exchange.Nasdaq is also likely to create a bitcoin index, which might pave the way for exchange traded products, further broadening the retail appeal for digital currencies. CME has a bitcoin reference rate and Intercontinental Exchange recently unveiled plans to create a consolidated price data feed for cryptocurrencies.Nasdaq officials stress that they have not yet taken any formal decision about when they might unveil this move, not least because US regulators have been opposed to bitcoin-linked ETFs. However, the exchange group has already quietly worked with partners to launch exchange traded notes linked to bitcoin and Ethereum on its Scandinavian exchanges, where regulators have permitted these innovations.And the discussions inside Nasdaq about potential retail bitcoin products have accelerated after the CME and Cboe Global Markets each launched futures contracts linked to bitcoin last year.Retail investors can already trade existing bitcoin futures through retail brokerages such as TD Ameritrade and ETrade and the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator, show interest from retail investors, even though Cboe’s future, for example, requires an outlay of more than $10,000 based on the current bitcoin price.Until recently, Nasdaq was wary of jumping into the sector since its senior officials feared that the structure of the unregulated digital currency market left retail investors at a deep disadvantage. One problem is that when an investor buys or sells bitcoin at present, brokers usually only offer “indicative” price, rather than stop limits, meaning that brokers cannot guarantee the price at execution. The market is also prone to technical glitches, particularly when volumes are high, and transparency is low. “There are a lot of opportunities to improve the market structure as it exists today,” Ms Friedman said. “Other instruments [in finance] have matured into a mode which is offered to retail investors. There is room for this to happen in cryptocurrency. We will only launch a product if we can make it much better.”
33;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-01-18T01:10:21Z;Cboe approval shakes up stock market’s closing auction;Rival hopes to lure lucrative end-of-day business away from NYSE and Nasdaq;Regulators have given Cboe Global Markets approval to create an alternative to closing auctions for the US stock market, in a victory for the exchange that could shake up one of the most important moments in the trading day.The decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission, late on Wednesday, is a blow to the New York Stock Exchange, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange and Nasdaq, where nearly all companies list their shares and for whom the closing auction has guaranteed a certain amount of trading volume.While US equities trade on about a dozen exchanges and through a myriad of dark pools during the trading session, the official closing price is set through the auction on a company’s home exchange.The new regulatory approval allows Cboe to launch what it calls the “Cboe Market Close”, which will match trades using the closing price set on the home exchanges, potentially luring volume away from its rivals.Cboe argued industry participants were frustrated with closing auction trading fees, which it said have increased between 16 per cent at NYSE and 60 per cent at Nasdaq over the past five years.“It is a big win and a significant change in market structure,” said Larry Tabb, founder of the Tabb Group, a capital markets consultancy.“To the extent that 8-10 per cent of volumes is at the close, that is 8-10 per cent [Cboe] does not get, but now has access to,” Mr Tabb said. “It could be an impactful aspect of their trading revenues.”Cboe equity exchanges are second to NYSE in terms of volumes traded, but can boast only one corporate listing: Cboe’s own shares.With the growth of index investing and exchange traded funds, the closing auction has become an even more critical part of the overall system, since ETFs need to create or redeem shares by the close of trading.Volume executed in the auctions rose more than 70 per cent between 2012 and 2016 — meaning a growing portion of trading is increasingly expensive.“Cboe Market Close was created in response to widespread industry frustration with existing closing auctions,” said Bryan Harkins, head of US equities and global FX at Cboe, in a statement.Given the increasing importance of the closing auction …and the apparent concerns that a competing facility could have unintended consequences, we respectfully advise great cautionThe SEC approved Cboe’s plan against opposition from NYSE and Nasdaq.A NYSE spokesperson declined to comment on whether the exchange would appeal the regulator’s decision. “The NYSE Closing Auction is consistently the largest daily liquidity event globally thanks to its unique mix of technology and human judgment that reliably delivers the best outcome for listed companies, investors and index providers,” they said.Nasdaq declined to comment.Large fund managers, such as T Rowe Price, and listed companies including FedEx also opposed the approval of Cboe Market Close. For their part, S&P Dow Jones Indices, the owner of the benchmark S&P 500 and other indices widely tracked by ETFs, urged caution.“In keeping with the overall ethos of passive investing, SPDJ applauds any measures that decrease costs, increase transparency and generally result in greater utility for investors,” said Alex Matturri, its chief executive, in a letter to the SEC.“However, given the increasing importance of the closing auction to those same investors, and the apparent concerns that a competing facility could have unintended consequences, we respectfully advise great caution in approaching any changes to this aspect of our market structure.”Supporters included Sifma, the US trade group for the securities industry, rival exchange IEX and market maker Virtu Financial..

Like most firms, DRW is privately owned and does not announce financial results. Yet the company has discreetly filed years of accounts for DRW Investments at Companies House, going unnoticed by the industry.The accounts put the subsidiary in the same league as top traders whose finances are known. Virtu Financial, one of the few publicly listed proprietary trading firms, in 2016 had adjusted net trading income of $414.1m, a figure that subtracts brokerage commissions and exchange fees from revenue. DRW Investments’ trading expenses totalled $76m in 2016.John Lothian, a markets newsletter publisher, described Mr Wilson and his colleagues as “absolute leaders” in the trading community. “Don not only has tremendous personal influence within the community, but he also has tremendous business influence,” said Mr Lothian, a Chicago-based former futures trader and broker.DRW has become an important source of volume on the world’s largest futures exchanges, and Mr Wilson has pushed the traditionally low-profile industry to advocate for its interests.DRW Investments’ trading activity includes fixed-income derivatives and other futures, according to a company legal filing, and it runs three types of strategies — making markets as a liquidity provider, taking risks on the direction of prices, and high-frequency trading — people familiar with the company said.In 2008, DRW took over Lehman Brothers’ book of foreign exchange, interest rate and agriculture futures when the investment bank collapsed. It was the only non-bank to participate in the fire sale.The same year DRW Investments generated $656.5m in revenue, the most in at least the past decade, according to its accounts.The statements filed at Companies House offer an incomplete picture of the overall business of the DRW parent company, which includes several other subsidiaries. They do not reflect gains or losses at those businesses. A DRW spokeswoman declined to comment.As well as financial figures, the accounts also provide information on DRW Investments’ battle against allegations it manipulated interest-rate contracts. A civil case brought by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission went to trial in 2016 but has not been adjudicated.The regulator is seeking steep penalties, including a possible trading ban, but DRW Investments’ accounts said management believed the case was without merit and “the ultimate resolution of the matter will not have a material impact on the ongoing operations of the company”.
35;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2018-01-11T16:47:53Z;London loses oil futures listings as Mifid II bites;ICE shifts 245 North American contracts to US in response to customer demand;Intercontinental Exchange plans to transfer trading in hundreds of energy futures contracts from London to the US, as customers seek to escape new Mifid II rules governing European financial markets.The company said that as of February 19, 245 futures and options contracts on North American oil and natural gas liquids will be removed from ICE Futures Europe, its London-based derivatives bourse, and instead traded on its ICE Futures US exchange.That would put trading under the oversight of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission rather than European regulators.Europe’s far-reaching new Mifid II markets legislation sets stricter transparency standards on institutions trading on EU-based markets. It took effect on January 3.Traders also now face tighter position limits, designed to prevent any trader from having an outsized influence on the market, for a multitude of commodities contracts listed in Europe. The limits are set by national regulators and although the UK is leaving the EU, authorities have insisted on fully applying Mifid II.By contrast, position limits for US energy futures are governed by exchanges and are less restrictive. A proposed rule to allow the CFTC to directly set position limits remains unfinished and would have addressed only a handful of contracts in any event.When US lawmakers passed the Dodd-Frank financial reforms in 2010, the EU appeared to have less regulation, said Paul Architzel, a partner at WilmerHale, a law firm in the US. But with Mifid II now complete, “some people are finding that the US regulations are less onerous”, he said.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of Atlanta-based ICE, has been an outspoken critic of Mifid II, once calling it “the worst piece of legislation I have seen in my career”.An ICE spokesman declined to comment.The ICE contracts shifting from London to the US do not include the biggest North American oil futures such as benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude, heating oil and gasoline futures, the company told customers in a notice on Wednesday. Brent, ICE’s flagship North Sea crude contract, will remain listed in London.However, they do feature contracts heavily traded by both commercial energy companies and hedge funds, such as one tracking the difference between WTI and Brent crude.The announcement could be a defensive move for ICE, whose chief competitor in energy futures is Chicago-based CME Group. CME shut down a fledgling European exchange last year, leaving all its contracts under US oversight.As Mifid II took effect, some traders in energy contracts began closing positions on ICE and opening equivalent ones on CME, a broker said before Wednesday’s announcement. Filing paperwork to European regulators for each individual contract was creating headaches, an oil trader said.Daily volume in CME’s main WTI-Brent difference contract has trebled this month compared to the 2017 average. ICE reported zero volume last week in its WTI-Brent contract, called BTD, with transactions ticking up into the hundreds early this week.The ICE notice said it was shifting the contracts “following the recent growth in demand for execution in certain North American energy contracts in the US”, as well as ICE’s recent acquisition of NGX, a North American natural gas, electricity and oil marketplace. On Thursday, the exchange backtracked on plans to list 10 new contracts on ICE Futures Europe, not explaining why.While traded under US jurisdiction, the contracts would still be guaranteed by the company’s London-based clearing house.In addition, the US-based contracts “will continue to be traded using the same ICE platform technology”, ICE said.The computer “matching engine” for both ICE’s Europe and US exchanges is located in Chicago.
36;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-12-20T01:36:01Z;US exchanges to face lawsuit over dealings with HFT;Appeals court revives claims that high-speed traders were given unfair advantage;The largest US exchanges will face claims that they cheated investors by favouring high-frequency traders, after a group of pension funds won a federal appeals court ruling on Tuesday.The ruling, which overturns a lower court’s decision to throw the case out, is the latest setback for the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets and comes as exchanges are facing increasing pressure over their practices.The lawsuit was first brought in 2014 by plaintiffs including the City of Providence, Rhode Island, the Plumbers and Pipefitters national pension fund and Great Pacific Securities, at a time when the Michael Lewis book Flash Boys had caused a groundswell of concern about high-frequency traders. The book alleged that markets were “rigged” for the benefit of HFTs.“The lead plaintiffs, institutional investors who traded on the defendant stock exchanges during the class period, allege that the exchanges misled them about certain products and services that the exchanges sold to high-frequency trading firms, which purportedly created a two-tiered system that favoured those firms at the plaintiffs’ expense,” the ruling on Tuesday said.At issue are certain types of buy and sell orders offered by exchanges, as well as the sale of detailed market data to HFTs along with fast access to that information.HFTs typically use sophisticated computer programmes to trade stock positions, sometimes faster than a blink of an eye, collecting a profit on small differences in stock prices rather than holding stocks for long periods.“Relevant to this appeal, the plaintiffs allege that the [HFT] firms engage in predatory practices, such as repeatedly ‘front-running’ other market participants: anticipating when a large investment of a given security is about to be made, purchasing shares of the security in advance of the investment, and then selling those shares to the buying investors at slightly increased prices,” the ruling said.The plaintiffs said they account for nearly three-quarters of exchanges’ equity trading.The appeals court on Tuesday overturned a 2015 ruling that said the exchanges had immunity to such claims based on their regulatory status.Officials for NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange, Nasdaq, Bats Global Markets, now owned by Cboe, and the Chicago Stock Exchange either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. The exchanges have previously moved to dismiss the complaint.They are facing criticism from investors on multiple fronts over their practices and prices.Earlier this month, 24 companies — including Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Vanguard — petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission to require exchanges to conduct a thorough review of the collection, distribution and sale of market data.Data fees have been a hot-button issue in equities markets for years. Exchanges have been pressured by falling profit margins on trading and so have looked to maximise prices for data. Traders, whose profits have been squeezed of late because of historically low volatility, have balked at those prices.
37;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Isda reopens applications for credit derivatives role;;The swaps industry’s main trade body is reopening the tender to run the controversial committees that determine when a company has failed to honour its credit derivative debts, after a planned handover to a new secretary fell through.The International Swaps and Derivatives Association said on Thursday it would reopen the tender for the role of secretary to the committees that determine if a company defaulted on payments for credit default swaps.Isda holds the role and was due to pass it onto ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), a unit of US exchanges operator Intercontinental Exchange. However, IBA withdrew last month when the two sides were unable to agree on some of the US group’s proposed changes.The committees judge when a company is in default, seeking to avoid widespread confusion or drawn-out legal disputes in the $10tn market. But its rulings leave winners and losers in the market.Although it administers the process, the DC secretary does not vote on whether credit events have occurred.Last month, an Isda determinations committee hit the headlines when it ruled that attempts to trigger the contracts of commodities broker Noble bilaterally were only valid if backed up with supporting documentation. That led to uncertainty over whether sellers owe money to buyers of credit.
38;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-11-08T16:17:02Z;Fangs futures debut as tech stocks boom inspires a new market;The launch by ICE of a futures contract made up of big tech stocks seeks to tap investor enthusiasm;A leading exchange operator is getting in on investor enthusiasm for Fangs, a small basket of highly valuable technology stocks, with the launch of a futures contract branded with the catchy acronym.The Fangs — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, the parent company of Google — are joined by six other tech names in the futures contract that began trading Wednesday on Intercontinental Exchange. “Trade the top of tech,” said ICE in an announcement to customers.ICE, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange, created the NYSE FANG+ stock index in September. The equally-weighted basket is up 58 per cent in the year to date, compared to a 16 per cent gain for the S&P 500 stock index.It is the latest instance of a derivatives market trying to cash in on excitement happening outside its gates. Last week CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange operator, said it planned to offer bitcoin futures as prices for the cryptocurrency soar.ICE will next year lose the right to list futures on the Russell 2000 small-stock index as they migrate to CME. The Russell index family is owned by London Stock Exchange Group, an ICE competitor. The FANG+ index is controlled by ICE.Trabue Bland, president of ICE Futures US, said his company invented NYSE FANG+ in response to customer demand. Futures volume had topped 40 contracts at midday in New York.“We were out talking to customers about equity indexes, and this was the product that came back the most. It was the stocks that people were most excited about, and most excited about trading in one basket,” Mr Bland said.In addition to the four stocks captured by the Fang acronym, the equally weighted ICE index includes Apple, Alibaba, Baidu, Nvidia, Tesla and Twitter. The total market value of the 10 stocks is $3.5tn.Nicholas Colas of DataTrek, a research company, said it was unclear what question the product was supposed to answer or who the main users of the product would be, and called the US-listed stocks in the index “remarkably geo-centric”.He was amused by the “trade the top of tech” announcement. “Is it really the top of tech, like 1999?” he asked.Equity investors can already trade the stocks individually or gain similar exposure through exchange traded funds, baskets of securities that trade as a single name on a stock exchange. Last summer an ETF launched with the ticker “FNG” holding many of the same names.In contrast to ETFs or cash equities, trading futures only requires traders to post margin against their positions, tying up less capital. ICE described its products as a “hedging mechanism to quickly increase or decrease tech exposure in equities portfolios”.
39;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-11-02T20:39:04Z;ICE confident it is not over-reliant on sale of trading data;Exchange operator confident even as US Treasury touts recommendations over market fees;Executives at Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, on Thursday sought to play down its reliance on the sale of stock trading data amid mounting questions about potential changes in how exchanges handle this information.Data sales have become an increasingly important revenue stream for stock exchanges as profit margins on trading have declined over the past decade with regulatory change and heightened competition. Technological advancement and the rise of high-frequency trading has also made information on the stock market more valuable.In October, the US Treasury delivered a comprehensive report on capital markets to President Donald Trump that included recommendations on market data. The report also highlighted the debate over the rise of high-frequency traders. Critics argue HFTs can seek to use speed along with market data feeds to trade ahead of long-term investors, who see their costs increased.Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE’s chief executive, told analysts on a earnings call on Thursday that “the controversy around this is a legacy issue that’s been going on for a long time and we’re still debating the Flash Boys mentality in a world where I don’t believe that the same dynamics exist today”.In the 2014 book Flash Boys, author Michael Lewis argued that the markets were “rigged” to the benefit of high-speed traders, setting off a firestorm around them that has since died down. Mr Sprecher said that exchanges like NYSE “have gotten more sophisticated in the way we run our platforms to take out arbitrage. We’ve been able to time markets. We measure cables, work with networks and so on and so forth that has essentially taken the Flash Boys type of behaviour out of the markets.”He also said that ICE had fielded “a number of questions” from investors about NYSE’s data sales since the Treasury report.“The sales of NYSE real-time equity data products are expected to be less than $90m in annual revenue to us and their growth has been relatively stagnant,” he said. “These products account for approximately 2 per cent of ICE’s annual revenue and whether their growth continues to slow, stabilise or improve, over time, it will not be particularly meaningful to the growth plan that ICE is pursuing.”In the report, the Treasury recommended the Securities and Exchange Commission consider whether data fees are “fair and reasonable” when approving changes to them, wading into a bitter battle between brokers and exchanges over the cost of market data. It also said that data fees made up nearly a third of exchanges’ $28.3bn in revenue in 2016.Scott Hill, ICE’s chief financial officer, added that the “vast majority” of ICE’s $2bn data revenues come from “a broad array of proprietary pricing data, reference data, analytics, indices, futures data and desktops and connectivity solutions across multiple asset classes and consumed by customers around the world”. He forecast that ICE’s data revenues would grow 6 per cent in 2017 despite a general decline in revenues from real-time cash equity data products.Exchanges also contribute to another data feed called the SIP, but this includes less information on the market making in stocks at any given moment and is delivered at a slower speed than proprietary feeds.Since the release of the report, the SEC has named Brett Redfearn, former global head of market structure at JPMorgan, as the head of its trading and markets division. With Mr Redfearn having previously worked for a broker, the appointment fanned further speculation of an effort to revise the rules around pricing of stock market data feeds.
40;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;ICE to sell commodities trading platform Trayport for £550m;;Intercontinental Exchange, the US group, plans to sell Trayport, a UK commodities trading platform it bought nearly two years ago, to Canadian exchange TMX Group in a deal valued at £550m.ICE said on Friday that it will sell Trayport for £550m in cash, but in return buy the energy broker Shorcan Energy and NGX, an Alberta-based exchange, together valued at £200m.The exchange and clearing house operator had come under pressure for buying Trayport in late 2015 for $650m on the grounds that the deal could curb competition in the European energy trading market.In March, the UK appeals court upheld a ruling by the Competition and Markets Authority that ICE had to sell the business. The CMA’s initial ruling last October was the first time the CMA had demanded a company sell an asset it had already bought since the watchdog replaced the merged Office of Fair Trading and Competition Commission in 2014.The CMA has approved the sale to TMX Group, the owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange, ICE said. ICE added that it had entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding agreeing to “explore in future further avenues for possible collaboration” with the Canadian group.TMX Group said the deal was expected to have a positive impact on its adjusted earnings per share and be accretive in 2018.
41;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-10-24T22:48:09Z;ICE ramps up move on corporate bond market;US exchanges operator to buy BondPoint from Virtu Financial in $400m deal;Intercontinental Exchange, the US exchanges operator, has underscored its designs on the corporate bond market by agreeing to buy fixed income trading platform BondPoint from Virtu Financial for $400m in cash.ICE beat competition from other established venues including Tradeweb and MarketAxess, the largest corporate bond trading platform in the US, according to people familiar with the bidding process.It comes as trading in fixed income markets is increasingly being carried out electronically, with a host of established platform providers vying with upstart venues.BondPoint, which focuses mainly on retail investors who trade corporate and municipal bonds, will complement ICE’s credit derivatives platform CreditEx, according to analysts. It will also fit with ICE’s acquisition of Interactive Data in 2015, which provides credit market information to investors.“They have a strong franchise in credit derivatives. They have invested in credit data. It makes sense that they would buy an asset that furthers corporate bond trading as well,” said Kevin McPartland, head of market structure research as Greenwich Associates. “It completely makes sense.”It also sets up the potential for ICE to go head-to-head with MarketAxess in more institutional client-to-dealer trading, said analysts at Raymond James.Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman and chief executive at ICE, said: “We believe adding BondPoint’s capabilities to our data and technology infrastructure will allow us to continue to innovate for our customers as the fixed income markets evolve.”Virtu acquired BondPoint as part of its takeover of KCG Holdings this year but quickly moved to offload the platform as it seeks to streamline the business. A spokesperson for Virtu said that the sale is on top of the target of $250m in cost savings being sought from the KCG merger.The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. Virtu said that it would use the proceeds to pay back part of an outstanding loan from the KCG acquisition.“After a thorough analysis, we concluded that BondPoint is a unique asset better suited to operate outside of Virtu’s core operations,” said Douglas Cifu, Virtu chief executive.

ICE also said it anticipates having a member on the board.The move comes as ICE awaits the outcome of the UK’s negotiations to leave the European Union. ICE has spent more than £4bn to make London the centre of its European operations. ICE also has a clearing house based in the Netherlands.Euroclear has more than €27.7tn assets under custody and its main rival is Deutsche Borse’s Clearstream. Settlement houses hold assets, typically highly liquid assets like top-rated government bonds or cash, for investors to use for securities and derivatives trading.Analysts have tipped Euroclear as a potential target for the London Stock Exchange Group. UBS in August described it as a “hidden jewel”.“We are thrilled to become a shareholder of Euroclear,” said Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE. “We look forward to supporting Euroclear’s role as an independent provider of vitally important financial market infrastructure services.”
44;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-10-12T03:09:14Z;Credit derivatives market woes deepen after ICE exit;NYSE owner took on oversight role almost a year ago to improve transparency of resolution process;"When things go wrong in the $10tn market for derivatives that insure against the risk of a company defaulting, buyers and sellers turn to the industry’s global trade body for answers.Rulings from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association on whether a company has failed to honour its debts are central to the functioning of the market, leaving winners and losers among banks, hedge funds and asset managers depending on which side of the credit default swap they are on.Almost a decade after credit derivatives had an ill-starred role in the financial crisis, ISDA — whose committees decide whether a company has had a so-called “credit event” — is again drawing intense scrutiny. The committees are made up of representatives of banks that often stand to lose or gain from the outcome.The organisation’s troubles deepened this week after Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange and Liffe derivatives exchange, said it no longer wanted to oversee the administration of the determination committees. ICE had agreed to take on the role almost a year ago in a move by ISDA designed to give the process more transparency and independence.However, the transition to ICE has been scuppered by the exchange operator insisting that the banks that make up the committees provide it legal indemnity in the event rulings trigger lawsuits. A run of recent contentious disputes have highlighted how high the stakes are in the process and the complexity of issues involved.In August, the world’s largest banks ended up in a tussle over CDS written against the debt of troubled commodity trader Noble Group, after ISDA was unable to rule on whether a credit event had occurred for the first time in its history.Many buyers of CDS on Noble demanded payment from the banks that sold them credit protection. Efforts by the buyers to settle the contracts bilaterally jarred the CDS market. The ISDA committee eventually made a ruling a month later that halted these attempts, but only with a qualified and narrow verdict that did not rule on whether Singapore-based Noble had actually triggered a credit event.Given the scope for controversy, Ice Benchmark Administration insisted that it needed some form of indemnity from committee members, according to people with knowledge of the matter.But IBA was unable to reach an agreement on key terms with the banks and investment groups that comprise the five current determination committees. Negotiations were derailed in part by this dispute over who would be legally liable for their often controversial decisions. At present committee members do not underwrite any potential legal liabilities stemming from decisions to ISDA. ICE declined to comment on the matter.“I have no idea why ICE could not reach an agreement, but obviously over the last weeks and months there have been so many difficult determinations with long delays,” says Jochen Felsenheimer, a managing director at XAIA Investment, an asset manager that specialises in CDS.Disclosed in a press release after US markets closed last Friday, the withdrawal of ICE underlines the challenge ISDA faces in finding a third party suited to overseeing the often complex process of adjudicating on defaults, but which is also independent enough to satisfy critics calling for reform.“People manage conflicts of interest all the time, but this is quite a distinct process,” says one CDS trader. “I’m confident that there’ll be a third party doing this at some stage; you just need to find the right platform. It’s not a benchmark and IBA is really a benchmark publisher.”The recent run of disputes in the CDS market comes in spite of ISDA rewriting the rules in 2014. An effort to iron out flaws in the process was conducted after the chaos caused by credit derivatives in the financial crisis, when institutions and investors had to settle masses of these contracts bilaterally and ended up in bitter disputes over whether buyers owed sellers money.“ISDA is committed to safe and efficient markets and ensuring the credit derivatives market remains a viable long-term solution for CDS participants,” ISDA said.Even after the extensive overhaul, it remains difficult to have a uniform set of terms and conditions for a product linked to defaults — frequently unpredictable events in different jurisdictions.“Clearly, the 2014 definitions are a bit tricky and have not made things less complex,” says Dr Felsenheimer.The failure of ICE to reach an agreement means that ISDA will have to continue administering the committees until it can find another solution. The trade body’s term as secretary is due to expire in April and ISDA says it “will now pursue other avenues for the transition” to a third-party secretary.Additional reporting by Philip Stafford"

The two sides had been negotiating directly.“As a result, Isda and the determining committee will now pursue other avenues for the transition to a new DC secretary before Isda’s term as secretary expires in April 2018,” it said in a statement.Isda announced in December last year that IBA, as an independent organisation, would take over the role of DC secretary to keep up with rapidly evolving governance standards.The committees judge when a company is in default, seeking to avoid widespread confusion or drawn-out legal disputes.

46;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-09-26T10:32:28Z;Bank of England policy shift boosts ICE trading;Currency and interest rate futures contract volumes surge;Expectations of a UK interest rate rise by the Bank of England in the coming months are providing a boost to the financial futures business of Intercontinental Exchange, the US exchanges operator.Volumes for the world’s second largest exchange group by market capitalisation have risen to their highest levels in four years as investors buy contracts that help insulate their portfolios from adverse changes in currencies and interest rates.Financial futures are used by investors to speculate and hedge against expected moves in borrowing costs. Rising average daily volumes in short-term sterling interest rate futures, and euribor futures at ICE, are tied to rates set by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.Investors are expecting the BoE will raise its current base rate of 0.25 per cent before the end of the year to curtail inflation running above the central bank’s target of 2 per cent. The pound has risen to its firmest level since the June 2016 EU referendum, while the two-year gilt yield has jumped above the current base rate to 0.44 per cent this month.“The lag in the interest cycle of the UK/Europe against the US has clearly been reflected in ICE’s underperforming financial volumes against the CME but the European cycle could be turning,” said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill in New York.However, economists noted that the ECB was still buying assets as part of its easing programme, while a UK rate rise would be likely a one-off.“Unless signs of sustained inflationary pressures emerge it’s hard to believe that this will be the start of the tightening cycle — particularly given the UK housing market appears to be close to flat at present,” said Simon Derrick, chief markets strategist at BNY Mellon.Hedging activity has doubled short-term interest rate volumes so far during September versus August. Transactions are averaging 3.8m contracts a day for the month, and are up 60 per cent year on year.The volume figures for ICE are the highest since its record year of 2013, when speculation about the eurozone’s future and changing US monetary policy sent average daily volume in financial products to nearly 3m contracts a day, according to broker Sandler O’Neill.The move represents a change in fortune for ICE, whose financial futures business has lagged behind that of its great rival CME Group in the intervening years.ICE expanded into the market at the end of 2013 by acquiring the London derivatives exchange Liffe as part of the $11bn NYSE Euronext deal.CME’s interest rates business has set volume records in three of the last four years, and is currently averaging a record 8.26m contracts per day in interest rate contracts this year, Sandler added.Chicago’s CME is US-focused, and the home for trading both short-term and long-term US futures. The Federal Reserve has indicated there will be four further rate rises by the end of 2018.
47;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-09-15T15:24:10Z;CME to exit CDS clearing business, cedes ground to ICE;;"CME Group will no longer clear credit default swaps, ceding ground to rival Intercontinental Exchange in a business established after the financial crisis.
Credit default swaps offer investors protection against the default of a borrower or index of borrowers. Exchanges and policy makers moved to push the derivatives on to regulated clearinghouses after uncleared swaps sold by the insurer AIG necessitated its government bailout in 2008.In 2009, both CME and ICE began clearing credit default swaps, but the latter has absorbed more business. The average daily notional value of derivatives cleared at ICE’s US credit clearinghouse is $34bn, according to the company. CME clears about $1.5bn in notional credit default swaps daily.CME has been trimming businesses that don’t make money. Earlier this year it announced the closure of its loss-making London exchange and clearing house after failing to gain traction among European customers.The company said it will exit the credit default swap clearing business by mid-2018, returning $650m in clearing funds to members at the clearing house. Another $50m contributed by CME will be returned to its treasury.CME will continue to clear over-the-counter interest rate swaps and foreign exchange products, where margin money can be offset against margin held for similar futures contracts.Clearing interest rate swaps and credit default swap contracts has contributed 2 per cent of CME’s $3.6bn in annual revenue."
48;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-09-07T21:09:39Z;ICE to ‘Go West’ with Chicago-to-Tokyo network;;Intercontinental Exchange and a consortium of high-speed traders have teamed up to sell access to an ultrafast network between the financial centres of Chicago and Tokyo.Called Go West, the wireless and cable route is set to launch in the fourth quarter.It was started by top traders including DRW, IMC, Jump Trading and XR Trading in an effort to pool resources at a time when market makers are being pressured by an environment of rising costs and low volatility and volumes, the core element of profitable trading.The deal, whose financial terms were not disclosed, will enhance an existing wireless network that ICE sells to financial services companies, while Go West gets a reseller for bandwidth its architects won’t be using, a person briefed the deal said. The Go West network also connects with a data center in Illinois for ICE’s rive CME Group.“We’re excited to add Go West’s key Chicago to Tokyo route to our growing range of connectivity options,” said Jonathan Reeve, global head of connectivity and consolidated feeds at ICE Data Services. “As the demand for data capacity, speed and security increases, Go West extends our network’s geographical reach and offers a new alternative for customers that require ultra-low latency connectivity between North American and Asian markets.”The network uses a system of wireless towers, fiber-optic lines and submarine cables to connect Chicago and Tokyo.
49;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-09-06T09:19:32Z;David Peniket steps down as Intercontinental Exchange reshuffles top brass;;David Peniket, one of the key drivers in Intercontinental Exchange’s growth in London over the last 15 years, is to step down from his role amid a reshuffle of ICE’s top management in Europe.Mr Peniket, who joined ICE when the US group acquired the International Petroleum Exchange in 2002, is to retire and will be replaced by Stuart Williams, promoted from his role as chief operating officer to president at ICE Futures Europe.At the same time ICE also appointed Timothy Bowler from Goldman Sachs to be president of ICE Benchmark Administration, the ICE unit that operates benchmark indices such as Libor, ICE Swap rate for interest rate derivatives, and the LBMA silver price auction, which it won in late August. Prior to Goldman Sachs, Bowler worked for four years at the US Treasury where he last served as counselor to Secretary Jack Lew.Mr Bowler’s appointment will allow Finbarr Hutcheson, the current president of IBA, to move across to become head of ICE Clear Europe, ICE’s London-based clearing house. Mr Hutcheson’s new role had been announced in February when Paul Swann, the current incumbent, also said he would retire this year. All the appointments will become effective from October.Mr Swann and Mr Peniket have been key figures in ICE’s growth in London. Mr Peniket’s role has grown after Atlanta-based ICE has spent more than $4bn on a string of London assets, such as the IPE, the Liffe derivatives exchange and Climate Exchange, whose names have disappeared under the ICE brand. Revenues from its UK operations topped $1.4bn in 2015. Mr Swann oversaw the launch of the first clearing house in London in 100 years when ICE Clear Europe opened in London in late 2008.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, welcomed their appointments and thanked Mr Peniket and Mr Swann “for their outstanding contributions to ICE”.
50;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-08-15T23:55:13Z;Massachusetts launches probe into ‘maker taker’ rebate system;State looking at whether payments by exchanges creates a conflict that hurts investors;Massachusetts on Tuesday entered the debate over sales practices in the US stock market as it launched an investigation into whether paying rebates on bids and offers hurts investors.William Galvin, the state’s secretary of the commonwealth, said it had sent letters to retail brokerages Charles Schwab, Scottrade, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, E* Trade, Edward Jones and Morgan Stanley inquiring about routing orders to exchanges that pay rebates.“Institutional brokers are responsible for placing millions of dollars of average investors’ life savings in their employers’ pension plans, as well as in mutual funds and variable annuities,” Mr Galvin said. “If financial rebates or kickbacks create a conflict that results in less than the best deal for the investors, this practice must stop.”Rebates are part of a two-way system known as “maker-taker” whereby equity exchanges pay brokers to provide prices on their platforms. Exchanges also charge brokers and market makers for accepting, or taking, bids and offers on their venues. The difference between the two is revenue for the exchanges.The level of both fees and rebates have to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Critics of maker-taker have long argued that the system creates the potential for conflicts of interest that would drive brokers to post orders to venues with the highest rebates, which may not ultimately be in the best interest for investors.Others say that eliminating rebates could cost investors, as brokers would have to widen the difference, or spread, between quoting a buying and selling price for a share.Some market participants have said that a new administration in Washington that has promised reform of financial regulation and staff changes at the SEC could create an opportunity to revisit the maker-taker model.In a press release announcing the investigation, Mr Galvin cited a recent editorial in the New York Times by Jonathan Macey, a professor at Yale Law School, and David Swensen, Yale’s chief investment officer, arguing that brokers pick exchanges that pay “kickbacks at a price disadvantage to investors”.Mr Galvin said his office was looking into whether brokers were meeting their obligation to get the best prices for customers.Morgan Stanley, Fidelity, Edward Jones, TD Ameritrade and Scottrade declined to comment while officials for E* Trade and Charles Schwab were not immediately available to comment.A few years ago, Jeffrey Sprecher, the head of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, raised the idea of eliminating maker-taker. In a recent blueprint for revitalising markets, Adena Friedman, Nasdaq chief executive, argued for “an intelligent rebate/fee structure”, but also cautioned on “policies that would eliminate or significantly reduce rebates in the context of less liquid stocks where incentivisation of market making is most impactful”.IEX, which became an exchange last year, opposes rebates while Bats Global Markets, owned by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, recently unveiled a flat-fee model for one of its venues in response to industry demand.
51;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-08-08T07:17:59Z;Euronext agrees new derivatives clearing deal with LCH;;Euronext has finalised a deal to keep its derivatives clearing with LCH in France, in a move that ends the European exchange operator’s threat to take its business to rival ICE Clear Europe.The group has agreed a new 10-year deal with the French arm of LCH, its long-standing clearing house, and will swap a 2.3 per cent stake in the parent LCH Group for an 11.1 per cent stake in the French business. The deal was struck in conjunction with the London Stock Exchange Group, which majority owns LCH Group.It has also secured pre-emption rights if the LCH parent company decides to sell more than 50 per cent of the shares in LCH France.Euronext had tried to pressure the LSE in April to reopen talks over the €510m sale of the French clearing house to Euronext, with plans to move its derivatives and commodities business from the unit to rival Intercontinental Exchange. Euronext supplies around half its business and has long been keen on the asset.“LCH SA is a core strategic asset and neither LCH Group nor London Stock Exchange Group have any intention to sell it,” LCH said in a statement on Tuesday.The move will increase the LSE’s ownership of LCH to 59 per cent from 57.8 per cent. The deal with ICE has been terminated, Euronext said.The two parties will aim to achieve cuts of up to 15 per cent in clearing fees. Euronext will also recognise at closing a net capital gain following the share swap of around €24m. A formal deal is likely to be completed in the fourth quarter.Stéphane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, said the deal “also provides Euronext with a sizeable ownership position in a leading multi-asset clearing house based in the Eurozone with strong positions in the fast growing fixed income and CDS businesses.”
52;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;ICE pushes further into European energy trading;;Intercontinental Exchange, the US exchanges operator, is preparing to push further into European energy trading after purchasing the 21 per cent it does not own in Endex, a Dutch energy exchange, from Gasunie.ICE said it bought the outstanding stake to help it develop the Dutch gas futures and options market, one of Europe’s most active hubs for trading derivatives in gas.US-based ICE did not disclose the terms of the deal and said it was immaterial to their financial results. It bought its majority share in Endex in 2013 from Gasunie and also set up a joint venture later that year with the European gas infrastructure group. When purchasing the original 79 per cent stake, ICE said the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired were $43m.The Dutch gas market is based on the virtual Title Transfer Facility (TTF) hub. Europe’s benchmarks for natural gas have been emerging in recent years but have yet to develop the deep liquidity seen with US counterparts like the Henry Hub.
53;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-06-09T22:53:53Z;World cotton futures die a quiet death;Existing US benchmark may be flawed, but ICE’s alternative failed to take off;Creating a new cotton futures contract took Intercontinental Exchange years of planning, multiple rounds of wrangling with cotton merchants and finally an act of US Congress — but the exchange operator has quietly pulled the plug just 18 months after its debut.The global product was designed as an alternative to the US cotton futures contract that has been the industry benchmark for decades, but whose limitations have contributed to wild price swings.The new product, however, failed to take off, underlining the challenge of creating new derivatives products from scratch. Despite early expressions of interest, the global contract never attracted much volume after its launch in November 2015.The last trade took place a year ago. Late on Friday, ICE said it was delisting world cotton futures effective on Monday.The world futures were designed so traders could buy cotton grown on farms from west Africa to Brazil for delivery to warehouses in several countries. Listing the product required an act of Congress to amend rules pertaining to how bales are graded — a legislative saga that included a temporary block by Ted Cruz, a senator from the top cotton-producing state of Texas.Merchants had advocated for a world futures contract to overcome the constraints of the longstanding benchmark, which allows only US-grown bales to satisfy delivery obligations. When domestic supplies are tight, market squeezes and wild price moves sometimes result.“I think the exchange responded to the strong urgings of some of the leading members of the trade, but it never made sense,” said Herman Kohlmeyer, a cotton broker in New Orleans. “And it was too complicated.”The failure of the world cotton futures contract speaks to the difficulty of generating interest in a new derivatives market when liquidity is concentrated in another one, however flawed it might be.The costs of entering and exiting positions in a thinly traded market can outweigh the benefits of a contract that better addresses a company’s risks. Without commercial traders, hedge funds and proprietary trading firms will be reluctant to dive in and provide volume.Despite its drawbacks, the ICE’s US cotton futures contract has registered record open interest of more than 200,000 contracts this year. ICE on Friday called the surviving contract the “global benchmark for cotton prices and risk management”.“When a mill in Bangladesh buys cotton, they consult the ICE price,” Trabue Bland, ICE Futures US president, said at an investor event last week in reference to the US contract.ICE said it would consult with traders about the possibility of relisting the world futures, but did not suggest that would happen. “Based on customer feedback we are reviewing the world cotton contract’s original terms, and how we might improve its usefulness to the global cotton trade,” the exchange operator said.
54;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;IntercontinentalExchange to buy BofA’s fixed income indices;;IntercontinentalExchange on Thursday unveiled plans to scoop up Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s fixed income indices in a move that will give the owner of the New York Stock Exchange a deeper foothold in the rapidly-growing indexing business.The BofA global research platform encompasses more than 5,000 fixed income, currencies and commodities indices and represents the second-most used fixed-income gauges globally by assets under management, ICE said in a statement. After the deal, ICE’s combined fixed income index business will benchmark almost $1tn in assets.The platform will be re-branded as the ICE BofAML indices at the close of the deal.“As the demand for independent indices rises, we are pleased to monetise this valuable set of benchmarks with a strategic owner,” said Candace Browning, head of global research at BofA Merrill Lynch.ICE’s deal comes just a day after Citigroup said it will sell its global bond analytics business to the London Stock Exchange for $685m. The terms of the BofA-ICE deal were not disclosed.The rapid growth of the passive investment industry has been a major boon to the indexing business, since exchange-traded products generally track particular indexes. In fact, ETF providers are mulling over the idea of creating an industry co-operative to create indices that would compete with traditional providers in a bid to lower costs.
55;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-05-17T00:14:46Z;NYSE wins approval for ‘speed bump’ in trading;SEC gives green light to delay of 350 microseconds for small and mid-sized companies;"The New York Stock Exchange has won approval to introduce a “speed bump” on one of its trading venues, a direct challenge to its smaller rival IEX and the latest example of US exchanges experimenting with speed.The Securities and Exchange Commission late on Tuesday released an order giving the green light to NYSE’s plan, which allows a delay of 350 microseconds to trades on its NYSE American exchange for small and mid-cap companies.The move highlights the shifting landscape in the world’s largest equity market which has for the past two decades been involved in a race for speed driven by customer demand and regulatory requirements.It also represents a competitive threat to IEX, which successfully lobbied last year to become a registered exchange. Since launching in September, its market share has risen to 2.6 per cent from 1.6 per cent, but still represents a small part of the market.“We are pleased that we are on track to enhance our market for small to mid-cap companies, NYSE American, with a new market model and recently approved functionality that will deliver greater choice and competitive fees to our trading participants,” said Stacey Cunningham, chief operating officer, at NYSE, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange.IEX, made famous by the Michael Lewis book Flash Boys, pioneered the speed bump concept as a way of levelling the playing field for long term investors against high speed traders that now dominate daily market trading in the US.The SEC approval comes despite the opposition of IEX, which further criticised NYSE’s plan on Tuesday.“The IEX model is about protecting investors from predatory trading strategies enabled by NYSE’s other exchanges,” said Brad Katsuyama, IEX’s chief executive. “Investors are sophisticated and will see through this; selling speed bumps and speed advantages at the same time just demonstrates that NYSE doesn’t understand the point.”NYSE’s proposal raised eyebrows earlier this year because the exchange had been a vocal opponent of IEX’s effort to become an registered exchange. NYSE officials have since said that the exchange had opposed IEX’s application because it believed the rival exchange was looking for an exception to rule.When IEX was approved, regulators also updated existing trading rules that paved the way for competitors to experiment with speed.Nasdaq, for example, has lodged an application for a new order type that would give priority to retail orders that are visible to the entire market when traders agree not to cancel them for at least one full second.In regulatory documents, NYSE also said that its speed bump system would “provide broker-dealers and issuers with a competitive model” to IEX’s delay.Citadel Securities, the market making arm of Citadel which runs a separate hedge fund, had also opposed NYSE’s speed bump and called for a review of the impact on such delays.Rival exchange Bats Global Markets argued in regulatory filings that speed bumps, add “unnecessary complexity” to markets, but saw no legal grounds for regulators to reject NYSE proposal after its rulings around IEX."
56;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-05-08T23:10:37Z;ICE turns to atomic clock for time-stamping trades;Shift reflects incoming new rule under Mifid to keep pace with high-frequency trading;In an era of hyper fast financial market trading, the atomic clock looms as the answer for the difficult task of tracking activity accurately.In the blink of an eye, or just 300 to 400 milliseconds, an HFT firm can execute roughly 400 orders thanks to modern computing power and growth of electronic markets in equities and futures.Such speed has prompted Intercontinental Exchange to start timestamping thousands of European futures trades using an atomic clock, recording the market’s fastest traders from the UK’s National Physical Laboratory (NPL), a government body that sets measurements standards.An atomic clock functions via the wave frequency of an electron’s transition energy in an atom, or as the NPL says like a clock based on the swinging of a pendulum.ICE has shifted to this new frequency standard for timekeeping as current technology is seen not being able to satisfy new European standards trying to keep up with the frenetic trading of HFT.In an effort to stay in touch with automated trading, Europe has mandated from January next year that traders and venues timestamp deals far more accurately, against a standard known as Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC).High-frequency traders, which are a key presence in modern markets, face the toughest hurdles and are required to be within 100 microseconds’ accuracy, according to the new Mifid II rules that come into effect from January. Asset managers have longer to respond.“One real challenge will be to ensure that every piece of software and hardware in one’s systems knows that a time stamp is the first thing it needs to get done — not run through other commands first,” said Sam Tyfield, a lawyer at Vedder Price in London, who represents many automated trading companies.“There’s also a bigger issue in having a potential single point of weakness in a system. If one has a primary connection to a clock of which all other clocks in the system run, and that clock goes down, there’s a problem.”Current systems are based on GPS, whose accuracy needs to be constantly checked and can also be subject to jamming, or deliberate blocks on wireless signals.Computer clocks also run at different frequencies and will diverge from each other over time if left unsynchronised.The UK government has estimated that the City experiences between 80 and 120 GPS jamming incidences a month, which could also disrupt attempts to build a reliable audit trail of trading.ICE will use the service in its Basildon data centre, the home of its European derivatives exchange, and offer it to customers struggling to reconcile tougher European rules with their current systems for measuring time.NPL says its next generation of clocks promises accuracy to one second in 158m years. It is supplied by fibre optic cable and so independent of GPS. “We are in discussions with several other exchanges,” said Leon Lobo, strategic business development manager at NPL.ICE has been running trials using NPL for several years. Last year UBS became the first big bank to sign up to the service, as has Atrium, a Canadian trading technology company that last week was bought by ICE. However, the services to ICE and TMX Atrium in Basildon are separate. It declined to comment further.
57;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-04-05T03:00:52Z;ICE bets on data to resurrect Libor’s reputation;Three years since taking over the benchmark, executive says use of data is helping;Finbarr Hutcheson has had an unenviable task for the last three years: resurrecting the reputation of Libor.The London interbank benchmark offered rate, which is used to help price loans, is one of the most important benchmarks in global markets but in recent years became one of the most scandal-ridden as a series of banks, including Barclays, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland, together paid hundreds of millions of pounds in fines as they admitted traders had sought to manipulate the rate.The Irish executive played an important role in persuading a government-backed committee to hand over administering the benchmark to Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange. It has been doing so since early 2014, and as president of ICE Benchmark Administration, Mr Hutcheson says progress has been made in overhauling the benchmark.Calculated on a daily basis using submissions from banks, ICE has sought to ensure those inputs are far more reliant on an institution’s own transactions rather than the opinion of an individual. In short, ICE has turned to data in an effort to bulletproof the Libor-setting process from a repeat of the manipulation scandal that engulfed it.“It’s taken three years of a lot of work” says Mr Hutcheson. “You go from the transactions good, judgment bad, kind of Orwellian sort-of mentality from some people . . . to the people who say well, you know, I never manipulated it, our bank never manipulated it . . . why do we have to change?”The quest to put data at the heart of the Libor-setting process will intensify this summer, Mr Hutcheson says, as ICE establishes rules for the algorithms that banks apply to their own transaction data used to generate their submissions. Inputs banks use, for example, include their own transactions on commercial paper, unsecured deposits and certificates of deposit.“Where a bank doesn’t have as many trades as necessary to make a purely transaction driven input, they then have to use some judgment or some market colour,” Mr Hutcheson points out.ICE, which also owns the London-based derivatives exchange Liffe, has a “surveillance” team to assess the submissions after publication of the rates, which takes place each morning. ICE now processes 4.5m data points and comparisons a day as part of that process.“The computer churns through a huge amount of work, and it presents to the users what it views as anomalous,” says Mr Hutcheson, who spent more than a decade at Goldman Sachs before joining NYSE Euronext in 2011, a year before ICE bought it. “The users, the surveillance team are also looking into these submissions in terms of what they might themselves feel is anomalous.”This algorithmic approach has been “backtested” against days in which manipulation was known to have occurred, and Mr Hutcheson argues the breaches would have been picked up. The company has hired academics and mathematicians, as well as former traders, to try to spot suspicious activity.ICE, which began life as an energy futures exchange in Atlanta in the late 1990s, makes money through charging institutions which use Libor, such as banks lending out mortgages. It paid a token £1 to take control of the benchmark from the British Bankers’ Association.While the reliance on data aims to limit the ability of Libor submitters to manipulate the benchmark, it also, critically, shifts responsibility to a new group of individuals: those writing the algorithms. The daily rate relies on the algorithms used by the banks, the calculation used by ICE to bring together the submissions, and the algorithms which then retrospectively assess the validity of those submissions.“It used to be what’s your submission, and the guy came up with the number,” explains Mr Hutcheson. “Now it’s more the machine produces a suggested submission and the humans have to disagree with the machine . . . but they [the machines] are only as powerful as the people programming them in the first place”.What’s more, the algorithms require constant updating. “No matter how brilliant your algorithm is or the algorithm designer is . . . I think every algorithm designer would acknowledge that over time the inputs may change, the environment may change, and therefore you need to refresh it every now and then,” says Mr Hutcheson.This summer, Mr Hutcheson will leave his current role to become head of ICE Clear Europe, the company’s UK clearing house. With his departure in sight after more than three years, the executive reflects that there is still a role for humans in the Libor-setting process.“You can almost go to 100 per cent data driven on a day-to-day basis, but frankly you always need to ability for humans to step in when the machine goes nuts.”

59;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Euronext and Intercontinental Exchange sign clearing services pact;;Euronext, the pan-European exchanges operator, has moved swiftly from missing out on the €510m purchase of LCH’s French unit by agreeing to move its derivatives and commodities clearing operations to rival Intercontinental Exchange.The Paris-based exchanges operator has agreed a 10-year deal to use the clearing services of ICE’s Dutch business from the second half of 2018, and end a long-standing relationship with LCH.Euronext accounts for nearly half of LCH France’s business and has a contract with the clearing house that expires at the end of 2018.It had hoped to pick up LCH SA, which was offered by the London Stock Exchange Group as a concession to European antitrust regulators to bless its merger with Deutsche Borse. Last week Brussels blocked the deal and the LSE’s provisional deal with Euronext was unwound.Stéphane Boujnah, chief executive, said Euronext:Continues to remain a willing buyer of Clearnet but in the absence of an agreement is fully committed to securing the best long-term solution for its post-trade activities, in the interests of clients and shareholders.Euronext will contribute a €10m upfront investment in ICE Clear Netherlands. Clearing operations will be run from Amsterdam and a new business for asset financing, inventory management and physical delivery for commodities will be built by Euronext and operated from Paris.Euronext has been reviewing all its clearing agreements with LCH and last year bought a 20 per cent stake in EuroCCP for its cash equities business.
60;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-03-06T19:28:09Z;UK court upholds ICE Trayport sale order;;A UK appeals court has upheld a ruling by competition authorities that Intercontinental Exchange must sell Trayport, an energy software trading platform it bought for $650m more than a year ago.The Competition Appeal Tribunal said late on Monday it backed a ruling by the UK antitrust watchdog that the deal could curb competition in the European energy trading market.The Competition and Markets Authority’s ruling against ICE last October was the first time the CMA had demanded a company sell an asset it had already bought since the watchdog replaced the merged Office of Fair Trading and Competition Commission in 2014.Trayport is the main platform that connects traders, brokers and companies to the energy market’s electronic trading and clearing systems. About 70-80 per cent of European utilities trades flows through it. ICE had argued that the CMA’s verdict was “simplistic” and “set a terrible precedent”.In a statement on Monday ICE said it was disappointed by the CAT ruling. “We will review the CAT’s judgment and consider our options, including the possibility of a further appeal to the Court of Appeal,” it said.However the Tribunal said the CMA had no grounds to force ICE to unwind an agreement struck with Trayport last May. That would put ICE’s data on Trayport trading screens and offer customers a link to ICE’s clearing house. The CAT said the CMA’s decision on this aspect of the case was “too cursory and too conclusory”. This “represented a serious failure,” the CAT concluded.ICE and the CMA must now discuss the issues again. “We are hopeful that the CMA will recognise the merits of customers gaining access to additional Trayport connectivity and greater access to relevant markets through the agreement,” ICE said.
61;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-02-07T18:00:29Z;SEC eyes charges over glitch that hit NYSE trading;Parent ICE says it will fight any action over hold-up it admits was ‘embarrassing’;US regulators are seeking to charge the New York Stock Exchange over a technology glitch that halted trading on the equity market for more than three hours in 2015, the Big Board’s owner has disclosed.Staff at the Securities and Exchange Commission have recommended filing civil charges against Intercontinental Exchange, NYSE’s parent, over how it responded to the software configuration issue that led to the trading interruption, the company’s annual report revealed on Tuesday.The outage on July 8, 2015, was a serious mis-step for ICE, which ventured into equities markets when it acquired NYSE Euronext for $13bn in 2013. The prolonged gap in activity accounted for $28tn worth of stocks.NYSE said on Tuesday that it disputed the proposed action, which it learnt in December via a Wells notice might be on the cards. A Wells notice allows parties to present their defences to the SEC before any charges are brought, and Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, told analysts that NYSE would do so.“We dispute the appropriateness of the potential charges that the SEC wants to bring and we have a lot of defences,” he said.“And as a result of that we’ve made our own written submission to the SEC, articulating our points that at the end of the day it was a technology outage, it was very unfortunate, it was embarrassing and a black eye, but we don't believe it violated any law.”It is unclear whether any action will be taken, because of changes at the SEC under President Donald Trump who wants to loosen regulation. A move to file a case would require approval from the five-member commission, which has three vacancies. Mr Trump has nominated Jay Clayton, a Wall Street lawyer, to become its next chairman.The SEC declined to comment. The halt in trading activity during the glitch grabbed attention because of NYSE’s name and the fact that it is one of the last exchanges with a floor, where humans rather than computers can execute deals. The floor served as a television backdrop as exchange executives scrambled to jump-start trading. NYSE-listed securities continued to trade at other exchanges during the session.  At the time the exchange said the suspension happened because of “communication issues” between its platform and customers after the release of new trading software. SEC enforcement lawyers have been investigating the outage since at least 2015, the annual report said, and agency staff notified NYSE in December of their plans via the Wells notice.The SEC also conducted an extensive review of rival Nasdaq after a 2013 outage of a data feed but the exchange was not fined.ICE disclosed the investigation as it reported fourth-quarter net profit of $352m, or $0.59 per share, down from $370m, or $0.66 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted for items, earnings per share rose 9 per cent to $0.71, beating estimates. ICE shares rose 2.6 per cent to $60 in New York. Cash equities made up 11 per cent of ICE’s $518m in trading and clearing revenue in the fourth quarter.
62;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;ICE warned of potential SEC action over 2015 NYSE glitch;;New York Stock Exchange parent InterContinental Exchange disclosed on Tuesday that US securities regulators are considering an “enforcement action” over the Big Board’s response to a trading outage that took place in 2015.On December 29, 2016, NYSE received a Wells notice indicating that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s staff had “made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action in connection with how NYSE responded on July 8, 2015 to the circumstances leading into the suspension of trading that day”, ICE said in a regulatory filing.The query refers to the technical hiccup that suspended trading on the Wall Street equities exchange for three-and-a-half hours on all symbols. Notably, other exchanges were able to to route trading away from NYSE, meaning the markets were able to function without major interruption that day.ICE said in the filing that “NYSE disputes the appropriateness of the proposed charges, believes there are substantial defenses, and has made a written submission to the Staff in response to the Wells Notice setting forth such points”.The exchange operator added that “if the staff determines to maintain its recommendation contained in the Wells Notice, the Commissioners of the SEC will need to determine whether to authorize the filing of an enforcement action”.A NYSE spokesperson declined to comment beyond what was stated in the regulatory filing.
63;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-01-23T18:37:48Z;CME cedes European cocoa trading victory to ICE;;The battle over cocoa trading has been won by the Intercontinental Exchange after CME Group announced that it was suspending trading in its European cocoa contracts as of Monday’s close.In a notice to customers, the CME said cocoa contracts starting with the May 2017 contract would be suspended, although it said the March 2017 contract will remain available for trading with the open interest for the contract unaffected.The CME launched its cocoa contracts in 2015 in an attempt to challenge the dominance of rival ICE, which oversees two cocoa benchmarks — the dollar-denominated contract traded in New York, and a London benchmark traded in pounds.Cocoa traders said the suspension had been a matter of time as there was little liquidity in the new contracts. “Apart from one large trading house, the other big buys in the market were not interested,” said one.
64;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2017-01-11T23:30:36Z;NYSE to expand floor trading as part of integrated dealing system;Increased number of securities will include Nasdaq-listed stocks and ETFs;"The New York Stock Exchange is expanding trading on its storied floor as part of a move to an integrated technology system for trading equities and options on its markets.NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange, plans to roll out the technology system, called Pillar, throughout 2017. As part of the move it will increase the number of securities that can be traded on the floor from 3,166 to the full complement of 8,600, including Nasdaq-listed stocks and exchange traded funds.“Our plan to provide even greater access to trade US securities is a positive move toward bolstering fair and transparent liquidity and offering even greater choice,” said Stacey Cunningham, NYSE’s chief operating officer. “We are committed to our proven market model that combines high-tech trading capabilities with human judgment at the point of sale on our iconic NYSE trading floor.”The changes will not necessarily require an increase in the number of floor traders because the designated market makers will continue to serve just the NYSE-listed companies even if they can trade other securities electronically.“The extent [to which] they can extend the New York model to more symbols [means] they can get more volume and more volume means more revenue,” said Larry Tabb, founder of the Tabb Group, a capital markets consultancy.Under the plan, market participants will also be able to trade all securities that are listed on the exchange, whether on the Big Board; NYSE Arca, an electronic venue; or NYSE MKT.The rationale is to offer traders and investors different options, including for speed which has become a controversial issue. The trading floor, for example, uses a “parity” model — enabling competing orders at the same price to share executions regardless of when an order arrives — versus Arca, which prioritises speed. Orders there are filled at the best price on a first-come, first-served basis.The historic Big Board has been a bastion of open-outcry trading even as the rest of the trading universe has moved to electronic trading. The floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the leading energy and metals exchange, for example, closed at the end of 2016. NYSE itself is ending floor trading for NYSE MKT, its venue for small capitalisation stocks.In December, NYSE bought the National Stock Exchange, the US’s smallest bourse, giving it another exchange to experiment with a new speed or pricing model.Since IEX was approved as an exchange last year, other exchanges have proposed different speed models. IEX uses a 350-microsecond delay for orders to thwart high-frequency traders in what it believes is a market system that allows them to race ahead of slower investors to take advantage of price changes before they formally update."
65;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-12-16T05:50:27Z;Chicago retains role as capital of derivatives industry;Open-outcry pits are becoming a thing of the past, but the expertise has stayed;When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched its electronic transaction system, its chosen name of Globex was a clear indication of how it saw the business developing.Globex allowed people anywhere in the world to buy and sell futures as easily as the traders shouting in Chicago’s octagonal pits. The technology also signalled the beginning of the end of the open outcry system that had been operating in Chicago since the 19th century.Yet, while the marketplaces have largely become virtual, Chicago has retained its role as capital of the listed derivatives industry.The metropolitan area has 45,000 jobs in derivatives and related sectors — which includes trade in futures contracts and other financial products — about the same as 15 years ago, according to the Illinois Department of Employment Security.Including programmers, lawyers, accountants and other people in the services industries, the derivatives sector probably employs tens of thousands more, industry executives say.It has survived because many of the traders and brokers who learnt their business in the pits stayed on and embraced digital change. CME also acquired its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, and competitors in New York and Kansas City to become CME Group, a futures markets titan.The headquarters of proprietary trading firms such as Jump Trading, DRW, Allston Trading, Peak6, Spot Trading and Ronin Capital can all be found in a two-mile radius around the centrally located Chicago Loop district. Proprietary traders risk their own capital in markets from interest rates to oil and often generate the most volume on exchanges.“Many of the firms that were founded here have their roots in the pits, but we’ve all found ways to use technology to do this better,” says Donald Wilson, chief executive of DRW, which he established in 1992, the same year that Globex was launched.Many large independent futures brokers have chosen Chicago as their base, including ADM Investor Services, RJ O’Brien Associates, and Rosenthal Collins Group.Futures brokers provide crucial links between traders and listed derivatives markets, helping to ensure that financial commitments are met. CME says 70 per cent of its clearing brokers are located in Illinois.“You can feel it,” says Michael Creadon, chief executive of Traditum Group, a proprietary trader based in the Chicago Board of Trade building. “There’s still a very large trading presence in the city.”Trend of moving out to the suburbs is now being reversedThe network revolves around the exchanges, particularly CME and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, respectively the world’s biggest futures exchange and largest US equity options bourse.The majority of volumes at both CME and CBOE are now transacted electronically. But the city retains business networks of brokers, lawyers, accountants and the universities with their academic specialists in derivatives markets. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based exchange operator, also has an office and a data centre in the city.“By virtue of CME Group, CBOE and even ICE’s presence, there has been a concentration more than a dispersion of activity in Chicago,” says Craig Donohue, chief executive of Chicago-based Options Clearing Corp and former head of CME.However deep their roots, Chicago exchanges threatened to leave town several years ago after the state raised the corporate tax rate.Earlier this year, CME protested against plans to impose a financial transaction tax to alleviate state budget problems.“A transaction tax will absolutely drive our customers and customers of other exchanges not only out of the markets — but I assure you — out of Illinois,” Terry Duffy, CME chairman, warned in written testimony.Almost everyone you meet knows someone who has worked in the markets at some pointMr Duffy informed lawmakers that CME had just sold and leased back its data centre in the Chicago suburb of Aurora, a deal that allowed it to move the guts of the Globex system to another state. “We have 28 data centres to choose from,” he said.Despite threatened departures, Chicago remains a magnet. When GH Financials of London expanded to the US about five years ago, the futures broker chose Chicago for its base.“Almost everyone you meet who lives here knows someone who has worked in the markets at some point,” says Mr Wilson of DRW. “And it’s always been a place where you could find success without a pedigree or connections, as long as you were willing to work hard and chase things down.”Bernard Dan, who previously ran both the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago-based proprietary trading firm Sun Trading, says the city’s dense web of infrastructure, expertise and capital for the industry is “very hard to replicate”.“That’s really what has historically solidified Chicago as the derivatives capital,” Mr Dan says. “In my judgment it’s going to continue, because the talent’s there.”
66;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-12-11T05:17:50Z;Bond market sell-off fails to upset fixed income ETFs;Regulators are trying to reduce conflicts of interest among indexers;There may have been a mass sell-off of US bonds since Donald Trump’s election as president, but the exchange traded funds tracking global debt markets are on course for a record year.Between July and November yields on 10-year US Treasury notes — which move inversely to prices — rose by a full percentage point as investors sold government bonds. Yet the use of fixed income in the fast-growing ETF market has accelerated rapidly in 2016. Assets in ETFs tracking bond indices reached $594bn worldwide by November, a tenfold increase since 2007, according to BlackRock. Equity ETF sales total $186bn so far this year, while bond ETFs have attracted a record $109bn of inflows, despite representing only a fifth of the global ETF market by assets.“Fixed income ETFs are increasingly being used as a gateway to the overall bond markets, especially in corporate bonds and especially in the US,” says Sophia Dancygier, managing director at index provider IHS Markit.But the indices that underlie bond ETFs differ from those tracked by equity funds. Compared to equity indices, fixed income indices are more complex, requiring more individual data on prices and features such as bond call dates and seniority.“In fixed income, most securities don’t trade daily and you are forced to use an evaluation process to determine prices,” says Matt Tucker, head of fixed income strategy at BlackRock’s ETF unit iShares. “A single security can have three different prices attributed to it by three different index firms, all of which may be plausible. All this makes indexing a much greater challenge.”Recent regulatory changes have shaken up the business of providing benchmarks. The Libor and foreign exchange rate-rigging scandals have led to a wholesale review of the framework for index production. Iosco, the international securities regulator, issued a new set of principles for benchmarks in 2013. Meanwhile, new EU benchmark regulations will come into force in January 2018.Both initiatives are designed to reduce conflicts of interest at index providers and, in practical terms, to separate index management and administration from trading.In response to the heavier compliance burden, several banks have exited the fixed income index business in the past two years, most notably Barclays, which sold its benchmarking unit to Bloomberg for £520m last December. Analysts expect more banks to sell their index units.Yet other banks, such as Citi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan and Nomura, continue to produce and disseminate bond indices.Another important regulatory development is Europe’s updated Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid II), due to take effect in 2018.One of Mifid II’s aims is to increase transparency in fixed income trading by requiring greater price disclosure before and after trades. In parallel, it also aims to push more bond trades on to central trading venues. The data collected at these venues are expected to prove valuable for index designers.Banks that stay in the fixed income index business will be under pressure to end the practice of offering data at low cost or even for free to clients to win business due to the potential for conflicts of interest.“We have to charge independently for the indices and the services we provide, independently from what the trading desk might or might not receive in terms of execution flow,” says Arom Pathammavong, head of Citi’s fixed income index business.Srikant Dash, formerly head of Bloomberg’s index business and now an independent adviser and board member, notes that being offered index data is only one of the services bond investors require from information providers.“Compared to equity indexing, which is a brand-based business, the fixed income index business is a three-legged stool,” he says. “One part is the index itself, the second is pricing and the third is analytics. They all have to work together.”A single security can have three different prices attributed to it. All this makes indexing a much greater challengeFinancial technology provider Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is making a push into bond indexing. This year it launched indices on US government and corporate bonds.Meanwhile, index providers that have traditionally seemed focused on equity benchmarks are investing heavily in their fixed income operations. In November London Stock Exchange Group bought data and analytics provider Mergent, increasing its capabilities in the corporate bond market.“Customers are clamouring for more fixed income index providers, especially independent firms,” says Waqas Samad, head of LSE’s fixed income indices.In October, provider S&P Dow Jones Indices teamed up with fixed income trading platform MarketAxess to launch US corporate bond indices. “We’re using the data from the platform to help identify the most liquid corporate bonds for the index selection process,” says James Rieger, global head of fixed income at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Despite increased competition among benchmark providers, some bond index users say they now face sharply rising costs as a result of the indexing boom.“The fixed income index firms have gained substantial pricing power,” says an executive at the Information Provider User Group, a non-profit body representing the purchasers of market data. “The cost of one fixed income index product data licence we’ve looked at has risen fourfold since 2008, from $50,000 a year to $200,000.”
67;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-11-04T21:13:26Z;Investors grow less bullish on US oil futures;Net long position in WTI crude hits its lowest level since late September;Hedge funds and other money managers grew less bullish on US oil futures in the past week amid a decline that brought prices back below $45 a barrel.The net long, or buying, position in West Texas Intermediate crude was the equivalent of 211.4m barrels on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of Tuesday, according to weekly government data, contracting by 33.2m barrels. The net position was the lowest since late September.The funds pared their position by selling out of 20.7m barrels’ worth of long positions and adding 12.4m short, or bearish, futures positions in the week to Tuesday.The shuffle came as the market has become sceptical about the ability of Opec, the producers’ cartel, to formalise a supply reduction agreed in Algiers in September. The group’s next official meeting is scheduled for November 30.There are also signs that oil output in the US has bottomed out. On Monday, the US energy department reported that US production had climbed in August from the previous month, reflecting new supplies from offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico. US drillers this week added nine rigs to explore for oil, bringing the total to 450, according to data from Baker Hughes, the oil services company.WTI futures fell 9.5 per cent in the week to $44.07 a barrel. Adding to the negative sentiment was a record 14.4m barrel increase in US crude oil inventories reported on Wednesday.In a smaller WTI futures market on Intercontinental Exchange, money managers have a net short position of 6.5m barrels equivalent. In the past week they also cut long and added short positions, according to the data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.The latest positions in Brent crude, the international benchmark, are set to be reported on Monday.
68;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-11-01T17:44:40Z;ICE to appeal UK antitrust ruling on Trayport acquisition;US exchanges operator describes the UK watchdog’s decision as ‘simplistic’;Intercontinental Exchange will appeal a UK antitrust ruling that its purchase of an energy trading software platform hurt competition, saying the watchdog’s decision was “simplistic” and “set a terrible precedent”.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said the Competition and Markets Authority’s decision compelling the US exchanges operator to sell the Trayport business it bought for $650m was based on “a vague and speculative theory”.It “relied on a simplistic assessment of market dynamics . . . and largely on the views of conflicted third parties that have a competitive interest in the outcome”, he told analysts on Tuesday.The CMA’s ruling last month was the first time it had demanded a company sell an asset it had bought since the watchdog replaced the merged Office of Fair Trading and Competition Commission in 2014.Trayport is the main platform that connects traders, brokers and companies to the energy market’s electronic trading and clearing systems. About 70-80 per cent of European utilities trades flows through it.Rivals Nasdaq, CME, Deutsche Börse-owned EEX energy exchange, interdealer brokers Tradition and ICAP and energy suppliers Centrica and RWE all expressed concerns. ICE argued that it was not a competitor with Trayport.Mr Sprecher again backed London as a financial centre following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. ICE has invested more than $1bn in the UK capital on deals and infrastructure such as clearing houses over the last 15 years. Its quarterly earnings were hit by the decline in the value of sterling over the summer. ICE shares fell 2 per cent in morning trade in New York after analysts said results missed expectations.ICE considered breaking up the potential merger of the London Stock Exchange Group and Deutsche Börse but did not proceed with a bid.“Because this important asset could be leaving the City of London, we believe that this may create new opportunities for us . . . as we see the ability to continue to invest in the UK,” said Mr Sprecher.The two European exchanges have said they will keep headquarters in both countries. However a referendum committee comprising of executives from both sides is assessing the potential impact of Brexit on the combined business and could make further recommendations, most likely next year.Mr Sprecher also called on British, European and US regulators to work together to ensure that the UK’s regulations were deemed “equivalent”, to keep the global clearing business in London. “We do not believe that financial market infrastructure leaving London is in the best interest of Europe’s markets,” he added.Earnings results for the three months to September 30 highlighted the growing reliance on provision of data to investors. Net revenues were roughly flat at $1.1bn, boosted by its $5.2bn acquisition of Interactive Data Corp a year ago. Net income fell from $393m to $391m.
69;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-10-17T15:36:16Z;ICE considers appeal after watchdog demands Trayport sale;UK regulator concerned that exchange operator could use acquisition to reduce competition;Intercontinental Exchange may appeal against a rare ruling by UK competition authorities that it sell an energy trading software platform it bought last year, and fight off potential interest for the asset from IHS Markit.After a five-month investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority said on Monday ICE could use its $650m purchase of Trayport to reduce competition against rivals such as Nasdaq, CME Group and European Energy Exchange.The final ruling was the first time the CMA had demanded a company sell an asset it had bought since the watchdog replaced the merged Office of Fair Trading and Competition Commission in 2014.Trayport is the pre-eminent platform connecting energy traders, brokers, utilities and resource companies to the market’s electronic trading and clearing systems. About 70-80 per cent of European utilities trades flows through the venue.Companies such as the Deutsche Börse-owned EEX energy exchange, energy suppliers Centrica and RWE and interdealer brokers Tradition and ICAP had all responded to the CMA with their concerns.However, IHS Markit has emerged as a potential bidder for London-based Trayport after beginning informal discussions over the summer with market participants about creating a rival venue.IHS Markit postponed its plans to build a rival venue last month, saying the project would have taken up resources. It warned the CMA on September 13 a rival platform to Trayport could take nearly 2 years to build. The company was pipped at the post by ICE to a deal for Interactive Data Corp in October 2015.“Participants in this market have a high level of dependence on Trayport’s integrated software offering, alternatives are weak and barriers to entry in this market are high,” said Simon Polito, inquiry chair.ICE said the company was “disappointed after having presented a compelling case” and is considering all its options, including a potential appeal.The CMA rejected ICE’s commitment to running Trayport as an open and autonomous software provider, saying “it would not be effective”. The new owner would also have to be approved by the CMA, it said.“I don’t think CME nor Nasdaq could acquire it now for the same anti-competitive reasons ICE needs to divest,” said Rich Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill in New York.IHS Markit declined to comment on Monday’s announcement.Energy markets such as gas, coal, power and emissions are often hybrids of voice and electronic trading. Agreements are often negotiated over the phone by brokers, but the deals are traded electronically in blocks of futures.ICE, headquartered in the US, already has a dominant position in energy futures trading in the UK. It completed the deal to acquire Trayport in six weeks last December, paying BGC Partners, the US interdealer broker, about 2.5m of common ICE shares.UK deals do not have to be approved in advance by the CMA although companies can submit their mergers before completion to avoid the risk of a retroactive adverse decision. The CMA launched the investigation this year and approached market participants with a questionnaire.
70;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-10-17T14:04:07Z;Hedge fund bets on rising oil prices hit highest since July 2014;;Hedge funds and investors are betting heavily on rising oil prices as Opec inches toward a deal to cut production.Net long positions – the difference between bets on rising and falling prices — in Brent crude oil derivatives climbed by 38m barrels to 397m barrels over the week to October 11, data from the InterContinental Exchange on Monday showed. This is the highest since April.On the other side of the Atlantic, speculators increased their net long in US crude contracts by 39m barrels to 292m barrels, figures from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday. The combined net long futures and options positions in New York and London were at the highest level since July 2014 – just after the two year downturn in prices begun.“We believe Opec’s intervention pushed any shorts to the sidelines for now and should keep prices in the upper part of our trading band until at least the November 30 meeting in Vienna, said Adam Longson, analyst at Morgan Stanley.Brent crude, the global benchmark, edged lower by 46 cents on Monday to $51.51 a barrel. US marker West Texas Intermediate dipped 54 cents to $49.81 a barrel.At the end of September, Opec nations agreed to cut production later this year helping send prices rally almost 15 per cent since the meeting of ministers in Algiers. But details are still being ironed out including how supply reductions would be split between members.There were further talks at an energy conference in Istanbul last week to shore up support for the preliminary deal. Meetings in Vienna and Riyadh are due to take place later this month and are expected to involve big non-Opec producer Russia ahead of the next formal meeting of Opec ministers.“Whether investors will stick to their guns will depend primarily on whether Opec maintains the credibility of its announced production cuts. If there are growing doubts and investors jettison their long positions, this would generate significant selling pressure on oil prices.” said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank.Higher oil prices are already having one visible side effect. US shale oil output has increased and the number of rigs drilling for oil climbed last week for the 15th time in 16 weeks, according to figures from services company Baker Hughes published on Friday.
71;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;UK competition watchdog calls for ICE to drop Trayport;;A spanner in the works.Intercontinental Exchange says it is considering launching an appeal after the UK’s competition watchdog called for it to sell Trayport, an electronic trading venue it bought last year.The Competition and Markets Authority said on Monday thattraders, and the brokers, exchanges and clearinghouses that compete with ICE in the trading and clearing of European utilities, depend on the Trayport platform to carry out these activities effectively.ICE, which is the largest operator of exchanges and clearinghouses in European utilities, “could use its ownership of Trayport’s platform to reduce competition between itself and its rivals which could lead to increased fees for execution and clearing, and worse terms offered to traders”, the CMA said.In a statement, a spokesman for ICE said the company was “disappointed” and considering all its options, including a potential appeal.
72;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-10-17T10:12:34Z;ICE aims to shake up London gold market with futures contract;Exchange operator to start daily futures contract based on London metal but traded in US;Intercontinental Exchange has increased its efforts to control the future of London’s $5tn gold market with a plan to launch a daily futures contract next year based on metal held in the UK capital.The US exchange operator, which last year won the right to host the daily London gold price auction that replaced the almost century-old gold “fix”, said the futures will start trading in February.The move comes amid efforts to reform London’s gold market as it comes under pressure to give regulators greater transparency. That is being seized as an opportunity by banks and some of the world’s largest exchange operators who want to shift the market on to a centralised exchange.The London Metal Exchange and the World Gold Council are also set to launch a rival gold futures in London in the second quarter of 2017. That effort is backed by six partners, including Goldman Sachs and ICBC, the Chinese lender.Currently, central banks, miners and investors trade gold in London over the counter via the large bullion banks. There is little data on how much is traded each year, although estimates put it at around $5tn.Since the financial crisis, whose scale was partly blamed on the growth of derivatives, regulators have pressed for greater transparency of so-called over-the-counter markets. ICE, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, said its futures will be traded in the US rather than London, but will still be based on London gold and be physically settled in the capital.Trading and clearing trades in the US could allow traders to avoid European regulations such as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or Mifid 2, which comes into effect in January 2018. It is also an acknowledgment of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit in the UK, according to ICE officials.“The US has more regulatory certainty around capital and reporting requirements. Not knowing how the regulation is going to pan out is definitely a consideration about getting this up and running,” said Matthew Glenville, chief operating officer of ICE Benchmark Administration.London’s daily gold pricing fix, which for almost a century was run by a handful of banks, was replaced by an electronic benchmark run by ICE after Barclays was fined £26m for alleged manipulation.In addition, ICE will also start a gold price auction at 2pm in Singapore to cater for Asian demand for gold. That will allow traders to put orders through during Asian hours, rather than waiting for the London opening, the exchange operator said. The other main Asian benchmark is run by the Shanghai Gold Exchange, which prices at 10.15am and 2.15pm in China.The London Bullion Market Association, which oversees the London market, said it welcomed ICE’s plans.“Central clearing is something that we have hoped to see ever since we started transitioning the benchmarks in 2014,” said Ruth Crowell, LBMA chief executive. “Central clearing during the auction will allow the number of diverse direct participants to continue to grow.”But adding to the complexity, LBMA is also attempting to set up its own platform for the market. Starting next quarter, physical gold trades by LBMA members will be reported to a platform run by Boat Services, a London-based company that provides financial trading technology, and its partner Autilla, another fintech start-up.The LBMA has said it has greater plans for the platform, including setting up clearing and trading services if the market requires it.
73;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-10-03T11:48:28Z;Oil at highest level since August, Brent tops $50 a barrel;;Oil increased to its highest level since August, surpassing the $50 a barrel mark, after traders warmed to an agreement by the Opec cartel to cut production.Despite scant details of any potential deal and lingering concerns the oil market supply overhang may persist, the price of Brent crude – the global benchmark – increased 46 cents to $50.64 a barrel on Monday, reports Anjli Raval, Oil and Gas Correspondent.Opec said it would reduce its output to between 32.5m-33m barrels a day, down from more than 33.6m b/d it pumped in September, according to a Reuters survey.While some analysts have deemed the result of last week’s meeting of ministers in Algiers as no more than verbal intervention, others have said this is a push to reinstate Saudi Arabia’s guiding hand over the oil market.The kingdom in late 2014 led an Opec decision to let the market do its work, choosing not to intervene and keep supplies high to drive down rival production, from US shale oil to crude from Brazil’s deepwater fields.“The real significance of last week’s framework Opec production agreement is not the size of the implied or actual output cut, but the fact that Saudi Arabia and Opec have returned to active market management,” said Michael Wittner at Société Générale. “It is difficult to overstate the importance of this change.”In the run-up to the meeting in Algiers, hedge funds increased their bets on a higher oil price in the week to September 27, data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Intercontinental Exchange showed.Any deal by November, when Opec next meets formally, still faces many hurdles.
74;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-08-18T19:50:18Z;Co-op Bank: Crystal Methodist’s toxic legacy;Three years on from crisis, the lender remains in recovery mode;If you work for Co-operative Bank, you must never joke you’re only there for the craic. The lender, which unveiled a £177m half-year loss on Thursday, remains deeply damaged by the crisis that engulfed it in 2013. First it emerged that Co-op Bank had a £1.5bn capital shortfall. Then, a tabloid sting caught ex-chairman Paul Flowers trying to buy cocaine and methamphetamine.Snorts of derision turned to howls of laughter when the nickname “the Crystal Methodist” was coined to describe the clergyman, who in a parliamentary hearing had proved disturbingly ignorant about banking. Even before newspapers documented his apparent pursuit of Class A drugs, his selection as chairman had signalled the bank’s poor governance.Three years on, Co-op Bank remains in recovery mode. Its group loss included a fair value writedown of £97.2m on an ill-advised merger with Britannia, a building society that had ventured into high-risk lending from an HQ on the Staffordshire moors. Co-op Bank had trumpeted the deal as creating a stronger mutually owned rival to shareholder-owned banks.Instead, it precipitated the collapse in capital and a debt-for-equity swap that cut the stake of parent Co-operative Group to 20 per cent. The hedge funds which hold the balance have become long-term shareholders. They don’t have much choice — a stock market float is a distant prospect.The privatisation of the state’s stake in Royal Bank of Scotland is equally far off. With both businesses whittling down toxic loan books, it is natural to see Co-Op Bank as RBS’s Mini-me. Both made a half-year operating profit on their “core businesses”. This was £2bn at RBS and £26m at Co-Op.A weakening economy and lower interest rates mean neither bank is likely to recover fully on the watch of current management. Niall Booker, Co-op Bank’s chief executive, will step down next January. RBS’s phlegmatic Ross McEwan should be around for some time to come.The parallels convey a dreary but important truth. The official character of an organisation — private company, mutually owned business or workers’ collective — might make far less difference to its success or failure than how well it is run. Politicians loudly championed customer and employee ownership until the Crystal Methodist made it harder to do so. This was the ultimate category error: the belief that easily observed structural differences matter more than the quality of management and governance, which are altogether more slippery.Off the leashIs the Competition and Markets Authority becoming more militant about takeovers involving securities trading platforms and associated businesses? This week the competition watchdog said it might force Intercontinental Exchange to sell Trayport, a utilities trading venue bought for $650m last year. It has also taken a hard line on the merger of ICAP and Tullet’s voice broking arm, with the result that ICAP has offered to distribute a 20 per cent stake in the combined business.The CMA would doubtless riposte that independent panels review the impact takeovers might have on competition. However, the regulator appears to have been toughening its stance on M&A across all sectors. Andrea Coscelli, super smart former head of markets and mergers, is now acting chief executive of the whole organisation.Sheldon Mills continues as mergers boss, so the flurry of activity cannot be ascribed to new broom syndrome, unless someone excited by such arcana as OTC rate swaps has been recruited at a lower level.Perhaps the CMA is just perfecting its chops for a post-Brexit UK? Here it would get to rule on the largest deals, such as the combination of Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange, instead of meekly turning them over to the European Commission. It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good.Vicious cycleThe priorities of the UK seem a little skewed. The nation has more medal-winning cyclists than trade negotiators. The grand total for the latter is zero, according to Oliver Letwin. We had 14 Olympian pedallers at the last count. It’s all very well winning that race where cyclists try to keep up with a Deliveroo guy on a scooter. But we’re hurtling towards trade relations with Europe defined as “Albania Minus” rather than the “Switzerland Plus” arrangement sought by the City.Out to grassFormer Barclays banker Roger Jenkins is said to be investing in a US marijuana business, Bloomberg reports. Mr Jenkins ran the structured capital markets arm of Barclays, where growing your own dope was also remunerative. One generally referred to him as “the client”, though.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
75;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-08-18T09:19:55Z;Intercontinental Exchange refutes UK competition findings;;"Intercontinental Exchange has said it willing to commit to keeping Trayport, a UK trading platform it bought for $650m last year, open to rivals in response to UK antitrust authorities’ concerns the deal could reduce competition in European energy trading.The US-headquartered group said on Thursday a potential sale was not “necessary, appropriate or in the best interests of Trayport’s customers” and it did not agree with the findings from an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority, published on Tuesday, writes Philip Stafford.The CMA laid out a series of potential remedies to its concerns. The most drastic was a sale, although it added that it would also consider changes to ICE’s behaviour or structure to prevent customers and rivals from suffering from a lack of competition.“ICE does not agree with the findings which do not align with ICE’s vision for continuing to operate Trayport as an open and autonomous software provider,” it said in a statement.“This was ICE’s original statement of intention and reflects how the business has operated since the acquisition was completed in December 2015. ICE is committed to retaining ownership of Trayport and is willing to memorialize its intentions with regard to Trayport’s future operation with formal CMA remedies.”Other market participants including Nasdaq and EEX, the energy exchanges; energy suppliers Centrica and RWE and interdealer brokers Tradition and ICAP have told the regulator that they fear being shut out of the market.London-based Trayport is recognised as the pre-eminent platform connecting energy traders, brokers, utilities and resource companies to the market’s electronic trading and clearing systems.Read the full statement here."
76;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-08-16T13:21:52Z;UK regulator raises red flag on ICE-Trayport deal;CMA could order clearinghouse to sell energy trading venue bought last year;"Intercontinental Exchange may be forced to sell Trayport, an electronic trading venue it bought last year, after UK antitrust authorities raised concerns that the $650m purchase could give ICE a commanding position in European energy trading.The investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority found the deal may lead “to a substantial lessening of competition” and laid out a series of potential remedies. The most drastic would be a sale, although it added that it would also consider changes to ICE’s behaviour or structure to prevent customers and rivals from suffering from a lack of competition.London-based Trayport is recognised as the pre-eminent platform connecting energy traders, brokers, utilities and resource companies to the market’s electronic trading and clearing systems.Energy markets such as gas, coal, power and emissions are often hybrids of voice and electronic trading. Agreements are often negotiated over the phone by brokers, but the deals are traded electronically in blocks of futures. ICE, headquartered in the US, already has a dominant position in energy futures trading in the UK.ICE completed the deal in six weeks last December, paying BGC Partners, the US interdealer broker, about 2.5m of common ICE shares.The CMA’s report on Tuesday represents its preliminary findings from a deeper “phase 2” investigation of the deal. It has until mid-October to make a final decision.“At this stage, the [CMA panel] considers that a complete divestiture of Trayport by ICE would be likely to be an effective remedy to the substantial lessening of competition and the resulting adverse effects that it has provisionally identified,” the regulator said.Other market participants including Nasdaq and EEX, the energy exchanges; energy suppliers Centrica and RWE and interdealer brokers Tradition and ICAP have told the regulator that they fear being shut out of the market.Until now ICE has not had the opportunity to respond to specific market concerns. “Whilst the findings are not final, they do start a consultation on potential remedies. If remedies are ultimately required, ICE is confident that they will be line with how ICE intends to operate Trayport as an open and autonomous software provider,” it said in a statement.The CMA said that instead of a sale, it could also opt for remedies that ensured all customers had “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” access to Trayport’s platform and software.UK deals do not have to be approved in advance by the CMA although companies can submit their mergers before completion to avoid the risk of a retroactive adverse decision. The CMA launched the investigation this year and approached market participants with a questionnaire.The UK regulator has already issued a stay that prevents ICE from integrating Trayport or transferring ownership to ICE. The main parties have until September 6 to respond to the provisional findings."
77;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-08-16T09:57:20Z;Competition watchdog sounds alarm over ICE/Trayport tie-up;;The UK’s competition watchdog says Intercontinental Exchange may need to scrap its tie-up with Trayport, the $650m electronic energy trading platform it agreed to buy in November.ICE beat its rival, the CME, in snapping up Trayport, lining it up for a dominant position in hybrid energy trading. But the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority opened an in-depth investigation into the merger in April.Now, the CMA says “complete divestiture” would be one good way to relieve competitive concerns.In a statement, it says:A group of independent panel members investigating the merger has provisionally found that it may be expected to lead to a substantial lessening of competition. They found that not only traders, but also the brokers, exchanges and clearinghouses that compete with ICE depend on the Trayport platform to carry out their energy trading activities effectively.The CMA is therefore concerned that ICE could use its ownership of Trayport’s platform to reduce competition between ICE and its rivals for wholesale European utilities trades. This loss of constraint could lead to increased fees for execution and clearing, and worse terms offered to traders. The merger could also result in a loss of competition between ICE and its rivals to launch new products, find innovative trading solutions and enter markets with new offerings.The CMA is inviting input from industry participants to find a solution.
78;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-08-08T22:10:04Z;Fed okayed to hold futures customer deposits;;"Futures traders unsettled by the financial crisis and brokerage scandals of the past decade may soon deposit margin money with the safest bank on earth.
The Federal Reserve’s regional banks will be permitted to accept customer funds from big derivatives clearinghouses operated by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Monday. The commission’s order exempted the Fed from liability under federal law, writes Gregory Meyer in New York.Derivatives customers post margin collateral to back trading positions at clearinghouses, which act as the buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer. But Lehman Brothers’ collapse in 2008, followed by the implosion of futures brokers MF Global and Peregrine Financial Group, shook confidence in the security of customer funds.Clearinghouses had previously received approval to place their own “house” cash with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, but until now customer money has been held at commercial banks or in US Treasury bonds.Timothy Massad, CFTC chairman, said:We hope that with today’s action, accounts for customer funds can be opened soon. Doing so will help protect customer funds and enhance the resiliency of clearinghouses.Sharon Bowen, a CFTC commissioner, said:I have long believed that, in order to protect customer funds, we need to keep that money at our central bank. In the event of a major market event, I, and I believe the rest of the American people, would feel much better knowing that investors’ money is at the Federal Reserve instead of at multiple central counterparties."

ICE has a market capitalisation of more than $33bn.But Mr Sprecher admitted that Brexit uncertainty was the reason ICE did not proceed with a planned bid for the LSE in May, or attempt to break up the UK group’s planned all-share merger with Deutsche Börse.“The way the deal was lining up, it was orchestrated so that we were going to, if we entered the deal, have to put a number on the table right ahead of the Brexit vote,” said Mr Sprecher, citing the influence of ICE’s UK board members, who include former UK foreign secretary William Hague, in its calculations.“So we went out and started talking to our UK colleagues to try to gauge where we thought the vote was going to come up.” he explained. “And, honestly, we came to the opinion that the UK was probably going to leave. And so we decided . . . that it was not an appropriate time for us to do that transaction.”In spite of the referendum result, LSE and Deutsche Börse shareholders have voted in favour of their deal, which is set to go before antitrust authorities in the UK, Germany and Brussels.Some German regulators and politicians are unhappy about the prospect of the merged group’s headquarters being located in London, outside the EU.ICE will hold a meeting to obtain shareholder approval for its stock split in October. It will also require approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the move. ICE shares rose 6 per cent to a record high of $280 on Tuesday.For the six months to June 30, the Atlanta-based group said total revenues rose from $1.6bn to $2.3bn, boosted by its $5bn purchase of Interactive Data Corp last year. Net income for the period rose from $612m to $740m.ICE, which moved heavily into debt with the IDC purchase, said it generated over $1bn in the half year, which cut its debt by nearly $800m to $6.5bn.

It will also require approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission for the move. ICE shares closed on Tuesday at $263.93, reports Philip Stafford in London.ICE had mulled a potential bid for the LSE but pulled out in May blaming a lack of co-operation from its UK rival for ICE’s decision to walk away.For the six months to June 30, Atlanta-based ICE said total revenues rose from $1.6bn to $2.3bn, boosted by its $5bn purchase of Interactive Data Corp last year.

81;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-07-25T13:54:49Z;Brent falls below $45 as short positions rise;;Brent crude, the international oil marker, has fallen below $45 a barrel for the first time since May as data showed hedge funds adding to wagers on falling prices.As fears about a glut of refined products such as gasoline intensified last week, speculators increased their short positions in Brent and WTI, the US oil benchmark, by the equivalent of 36m barrels, reports Neil Hume in London.This reduced the overall net long position in Brent and WTI fall to 453m barrels, down 210m from its peak at the end of April, according to the latest reports from the CFTC and Intercontinental Exchange. Hedge funds have also cut their net long position in US gasoline to the lowest level since November.“The global crude oil glut seems to have turned into a product glut mainly driven by gasoline,” said Tamas Varga of PVM, a London-based oil brokerage. “The abundant availability has scared away speculators and it shows in the latest report.”ICE September Brent fell as much as 72 cents to $44.97 a barrel, while Nymex September WTI dropped 72 cents to $43.36.Oil dropped 4 per cent last week as investors continued to fret about a huge surplus of gasoline. US stocks of the motor fuel have ballooned to the highest seasonal level in at least two decades, putting pressure on prices.“As margins continue to fall, refiners will look to cut back on utilisation, leading to lower crude demand,” said Adam Longson, analyst at Morgan Stanley. “Ultimately this should lead to distressed cargoes, deeper contangos, inventory builds and lower prices.”Morgan Stanley has lowered its global refinery demand forecast to 625,000 barrels a day from 800,000 b/d previously in the expectation of run cuts.Oil almost doubled between January and June, briefly rising above $50 a barrel supported by a string of supply disruptions and production cuts. As some of the outages were resolved prices started to come under pressure again. Concerns about the state of the global economy have also weighed on the oil.Data released late on Friday also showed US oil explorers had increased the number of rigs in operation by 14 to 371 last week, the longest run of gains since August. The rig count report shows how US oil companies are adapting to a lower price environment.
82;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-07-13T21:34:40Z;US trader guilty of ‘spoofing’ sentenced to three years in prison;Michael Coscia made illegal profits by flooding futures markets with small orders and cancelling them;The first person to be found guilty of disrupting US financial markets by “spoofing” was sentenced to three years in prison on Wednesday, sending a sober message to others in the electronic trading industry.Michael Coscia, 54, was convicted last November of making illegal profits by flooding futures markets with small orders and then cancelling them in an effort to trick other traders. The ruse, known as spoofing, was outlawed by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act.Exchanges, regulators and prosecutors have sharpened their focus on spoofing in recent years amid frustration over erratic behaviour in increasingly automated markets.In a separate case on Tuesday, a judge rejected an attempt by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to shut down Igor Oystacher, a well-known Chicago trader facing civil charges of spoofing. In another case, London-based trader Navinder Singh Sarao is fighting extradition to the US after he was criminally charged with spoofing in stock index futures.Coscia, of New Jersey-based Panther Energy Trading, had already settled civil spoofing charges with the CFTC and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority in 2013, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, when he was indicted in 2014.His conviction by a Chicago federal jury raised the stakes in the spoofing fight.“Traders contemplating sophisticated scams will think twice if they know that there are more significant consequences than a civil lawsuit or a regulatory action,” Sunil Harjani, an assistant US attorney, argued as he recommended prison time for Coscia.“Hedge funds and proprietary trading firms will closely review their trades, and strike down get-rich-quick manipulation trading schemes because the cost is not worth the benefit.”Coscia’s lawyer, Stephen Senderowitz, said his client planned to appeal against the conviction and would seek permission to remain free on bond until the appeal was adjudicated.Traders contemplating sophisticated scams will think twice if they know that there are more significant consequences than a civil lawsuit or a regulatory action.“The sentence imposed was less than half of what the government requested,” Mr Senderowitz said. “Also, the government conceded at the sentencing hearing that it could not calculate a specific loss suffered by alleged victims and that some may have made money.”Prosecutors said Coscia spoofed gold, soyabean oil and currency futures markets on exchanges run by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, pocketing $1.4m in ill-gotten profits in 2011. They said he designed two different computer programs to carry out his scheme.Dan Waldman, head of the derivatives law practice at Arnold & Porter, called three years “a pretty substantial sentence” compared with past criminal market manipulation cases. “That’s a pretty strong message.”The sentence came down one day after another Chicago court turned down the CFTC’s attempt to bar Mr Oystacher from futures markets. The CFTC filed civil spoofing charges against him and his company, 3Red Trading of Chicago, in 2015. He has not been criminally charged.Judge Amy St Eve wrote that 3Red’s self-imposed compliance tools, along with additional court-ordered restrictions, rendered an injunction unnecessary before the case goes to trial.
83;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
84;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-07-13T07:33:53Z;Oil traders’ love affair with Yahoo Messenger nears end;Alternatives sought to replace dominant instant messenger service;An unsettled oil market is grappling with a new challenge: the retreat of Yahoo’s smiley-faced instant message service.Yahoo Messenger has long been oil traders’ favourite tool for blasting out orders and gossip. But Yahoo on August 5 will change the service in ways that inhibit monitoring chats as required by financial rules. Other message platforms are now wooing traders searching for compliant alternatives.“It’s a land grab,” said Morgan Downey, a former oil trader who is chief executive of Money.net, a financial information company. “Chat is like oxygen flowing through Wall Street. If you are able to capture that information flow, it’s very difficult to undo.”The financial world uses a hodge­podge of messaging tools such as Instant Bloomberg and the bank-backed Symphony. Yahoo Messenger, with its jangling chimes and grinning emoticons, debuted in 1998 and quickly caught on with oil traders.The redesigned version will allow users to “unsend” messages, which troubles energy compliance officers. The London Energy Brokers’ Association said the new Messenger “encrypts all communications such that firms are unable to record this media in a straightforward manner”, adding that its members were “reviewing specialised third party solutions”.Companies waiting in the wings include Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of London’s oil futures bourse. ICE said users on its instant messaging platform have increased 30 per cent this year to more than 11,000. The oil trading division of Glencore, the Swiss-based commodities company, recently selected the service, ICE said.CME Group, which also runs an oil exchange, and Thomson Reuters plan to announce they have agreed to connect their two messaging networks to allow traders on each to communicate with one another, the companies said. They identified a “surge” in new messaging account registrations in June as traders prepared for Yahoo’s switch.ICIS, a market research group, surveyed 58 energy trading companies and found they leaned towards the ICE platform for oil and Thomson Reuters’ Eikon Messenger in European power and gas.But as August 5 approaches, which service wins is an open question.Yahoo links banks, brokers, producers, consumers and others in the oil market. Victoria Attwood Scott, global head of compliance at Swiss-based energy trader Mercuria, said: “At the moment it’s not clear what is going to be the best system to enable communication with all those different parties. Anything we use needs to be surveillable and recordable.”Yahoo is neutral on the structure of oil markets. The California-based company — which is exploring a sale of its core business as part of a separation from its $29bn stake in Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba — said oil traders constituted “a small fraction” of Messenger’s users.ICE and CME derive hundreds of millions dollars of revenue from their oil markets. While their message services allow unfettered negotiations, each eases the execution of orders on its own exchange. For example, CME’s Pivot message system has a feature called parsing, which for certain markets allows users to click on a message to fill in a CME trade ticket.Yahoo may yet survive in the oil market. GreenKey, a technology company, has developed a computer “skin” that wraps around Yahoo and other message platforms and removes the ability to delete messages.Paul Christensen, GreenKey chief executive, said: “What everybody wants is a platform that is open, neutral and compliant. That would be nirvana, but it doesn’t exist.”
85;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-07-06T16:22:50Z;Trading: What happened when the pit stopped;The Nymex floor brought wealth for many without pedigree but electronic trading has blocked the path;Cindee Rifkin was a 19-year-old babysitter when her employer, a commodities trader, invited her to lower Manhattan’s oil exchange. In the din of the floor a broker gave her a card scrawled with the arcane terms of a futures deal.“He said, ‘Can you read this?’” Ms Rifkin recalls. “It was this jumble. I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘You’re hired.’”She quit babysitting for the job as a clerk on the New York Mercantile Exchange, at the time the world’s dominant oil bourse. Days later, Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded Kuwait and crude prices shot up 90 per cent. She learnt to use hand signals to relay phone orders to traders screaming in Nymex’s pits. By her twenties, Ms Rifkin, who did not finish high school, was earning six-figure pay.“It was such an amazing place to work, as crazy as it was,” she says. “No matter what job you had down there, you were part of a tribe.”The place where Ms Rifkin found fortune is set to vanish by the end of the year. Nymex’s owner, CME Group of Chicago, says it will close down its New York commodities trading floor, the last of its kind in a city once full of them, after all but 0.3 per cent of its energy and metals volumes shifted to computers. Nymex will exist as a legal entity and a brand, but the action will unfold in a secure data centre next to a bike path in Aurora, Illinois.Its disappearance into the virtual realm testifies to the technological disruption reshaping markets and threatening vast segments of the workforce, from taxi drivers to bankers. In New York City the number of jobs in securities and commodity contracts fell to 98,700 in May, the lowest for that month since at least 1990, state labour department data show. Trading on automated systems now accounts for more than half of US crude oil futures volumes, according to a Commodity Futures Trading Commission study.Markets have become increasingly placeless, regulated by national laws but open in any timezone. A quarter of CME’s total volumes now originate outside the US. Money that once sluiced through the chokepoint that was the Nymex floor now spreads across a much broader area, enriching some and stranding others. A Nymex seat last month sold for $180,000, down from a recent high of $350,000 in 2012.The commodities floor was once a route to Wall Street for New Yorkers without the pedigree, connections or schooling to be a bond trader or banker. “Harvard MBAs were standing shoulder to shoulder with former hot dog and pretzel street vendors,” says Gene Rozgonyi, chief risk officer of natural gas distributor AGL Resources, who started on the floor as a teenage runner. In the early 2000s the Nymex building beside the Hudson river housed 6,000 people who worked in jobs connected to the exchange, recalls Bo Collins, a former Nymex president.Those opportunities are gone, says Terrence Martell, finance professor at Baruch College and a director at the Intercontinental Exchange, whose all-electronic energy bourse is Nymex’s main rival. The death of the Nymex floor forced some traders back into the middle or working classes, or even poverty. “They were making like $10,000 a day,” says Jack Cappello, a barber on the ground floor of the Nymex building. “After they went electronic, they were coming to me to borrow money. I wasn’t a bank. I had to refuse them.”For much of its history, the Nymex dwelt in an unglamorous corner of New York’s financial world. Established in 1872 as the Butter and Cheese Exchange, it was one of several commodity venues in Manhattan including the Coffee & Sugar Exchange, the Hide Exchange and the Produce Exchange. A newspaper account from 1893 reported how exchange leaders met “to discuss the question of oleomargarine and butterine, which have lately been sold in this city in large quantities, under the guise of butter”.Until the late 1970s clerks updated futures prices on chalkboards and recorded them on Polaroid film, says Jan Marks, a former trader and broker. The exchange was rocked by scandal in 1976 after futures sellers failed to deliver nearly 50m pounds of Maine potatoes.After the potato debacle, Nymex reinvented itself as an energy futures and options exchange, listing heating oil in 1978, crude oil in 1983 and natural gas in 1990. Trading moved from Nymex’s brick building on Harrison Street to a space shared with other futures exchanges inside the World Trade Center, the setting for the frenetic climax of the 1983 film Trading Places.Electronic futures trading arrived in 1992, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched its Globex technology. Nymex followed a year later with Access, short for American Computerized Commodity Exchange System and Services. But access to Access was confined to hours when pits were closed, to protect the value of seats on the floor, Mr Collins says.The prospect of electronics conquering the floor seemed farfetched at the time. In 1997, when the ribbon was cut on its current building, the premises included what Nymex called “state of the art trading facilities” — two 25,000 sq ft floors. As late as 2005, after ICE bought and unceremoniously shut down the trading floor of London’s International Petroleum Exchange, Nymex opened a new floor in the UK capital. “Coming soon to London, a champion of open outcry trading,” it announced in an advertisement placed in the Financial Times. “Our floor will be fitted with the latest in technology — humans.” (It failed within months.)The traders and brokers jostling on the floor did meld into a kind of machine for price discovery.“It was like one giant computer, where each moment everybody was saying what their bids and offers and quantities would be,” says Henry Jarecki, former board member of the Commodity Exchange, acquired by Nymex.But the human computer had limitations, notably that it gave occupants a first look at shifts in market flow. “You’re in a situation where your benefit is seeing things that the world at large can’t see,” says Dr Jarecki, who is also a psychiatrist.This privileged perch could breed scams. In 2008 a former broker who had served as Nymex’s compliance review committee chairman pleaded guilty to front-running customers’ natural gas orders so he could allocate profitable trades to himself.Danny Masters, a former banker and hedge fund manager who spent 2001-08 in the pits, says: “The floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange is like a cross between Goldman Sachs and a maximum-security prison.”Getting a position on the floor did not require extensive training. Stephen Ardizzone says he visited a relative in the gold pit in 1981 after his first year of university and never returned to school. In 1986 he asked his father, a homicide detective, to mortgage his house so he could buy an exchange seat. Alongside his broker business, Mr Ardizzone owned a restaurant — and he made a point of offering jobs at Nymex to his waiters and bartenders. Ms Rifkin, now teaching yoga, suspects she was hired because she was a “pretty girl”.Nymex lists futures and options contracts on energy and metals. Both are used by companies and speculators to guard against or bet on price moves.Futures are simpler, obligating holders to buy or sell a commodity at an agreed price by a certain month. Options tack on complexity, as they convey the right to buy or sell these futures.The futures pits dried up first. After years of resistance, Nymex adopted CME’s Globex system and allowed electronic futures to trade simultaneously with the pits in September 2006.The shift was swift and severe. Electronics rose from 17 per cent to 70 per cent of Nymex volumes by June 2007. Total volumes also soared, with the West Texas Intermediate crude benchmark doubling between 2005 and 2007.Some veterans were bewildered. On the floor, a trader might know which broker did business for a big bank or aggressive hedge fund and could buy on signs that a broker was in the market. “On a screen, you don’t know who’s on the other side — or if it’s a person at all,” says Mr Ardizzone, who now runs an electronic trading group.Craig Weinstein was trading heating oil and crude in a combination known as a crack spread (a refinery’s profit margin from “cracking” crude oil into distinct fuels) when the computers took charge. In his best years he was earning $900,000 and owned a house in suburban New Jersey, a Porsche and two Harley-Davidsons.“No one ever told you this market was going to end,” Mr Weinstein says. “All of a sudden it was lose, lose, lose. I would lose a thousand, two thousand, three thousand. The first month I lost 30 grand I was like, OK, I’m losing money, this is not working any more. I just stopped.”Since leaving Nymex, Mr Weinstein has pinballed between jobs including speculating on houses, hawking shoes on eBay and dealing Lexus cars. He just found a new job selling fertiliser to golf courses in Arizona. “I’m down to probably my last 50 grand at this point,” Mr Weinstein says.Former floor traders recount stories of colleagues now laying bricks, selling stationery, inspecting construction sites or slicing lunch meat, in addition to the handful who successfully navigated the electronic world. Raymond Carbone of Paramount Options, a broker who closed his floor operation last year, says: “A friend used to say, ‘If I weren’t trading gasoline, I’d be pumping it’. Well, some of them are.”“One guy put a gun to his head and killed himself. It’s pretty amazing what technology has done to that market,” Mr Weinstein says.Options clung to the floor longer, owing to their sometimes tricky structures. As recently as 2012, US crude oil options volumes were roughly balanced between floor and screen, with each trading about 10m contracts, plus another 10m in private deals brokered by phone or instant message.In the first six months of 2016, only 184,000 WTI crude options had changed hands on the floor, compared with 16.5m on screens, as CME pushes to globalise its options business.Mark Vonderheide has no nostalgia for a dying floor. He calls it “middle school with money”. Among the trading groups to fill the gap left by the floor-based market makers of old is the one he founded in 2008, Geneva Energy Markets.GEM’s 17th floor office off Columbus Circle in midtown Manhattan contains just five traders on a recent afternoon, with a few more patched in by video feed from offices in Chicago and Dublin. The room is quiet but for the hum of the air conditioner, brokers quoting oil structures over speaker phones and the bleep of trades being executed, often driven by algorithms.Mr Vonderheide’s employees studied physics, economics, chemistry and finance at top US universities. He says there is no reason for GEM to be in New York other than his wife’s love of the city. “Look how many people it took to run the floor and push paper around. This business is all about productivity right now. Computers don’t ask for a raise. They don’t ask for a bonus. It would have been unheard of 10 years ago to do the kind of volume I do with the headcount I have,” he says.The demise of New York’s trading floor is an ominous sign for traders lingering on CME’s floor in Chicago, where most futures pits were closed last year but options carry on. In a recent investor presentation, CME executives touted the fact that volumes of options on eurodollar contracts, an important interest rate benchmark, had now gone 23 per cent electronic.Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, worked in the pits for more than 20 years but says he “can’t get too worked up” about their extinction. He adds that in the pits, someone with his 6ft 1in frame had an advantage over a shorter person. “The computer puts us all at the same height, the same weight and everything else,” he says. “It puts us all on a very level playing field.”
86;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-07-04T12:24:17Z;LSE shareholders back Deutsche Börse deal;;Shareholders in the London Stock Exchange Group have voted in favour of its merger with Deutsche Börse, aware that their vote may be the easiest hurdle to overcome in their bid to create a pan-European exchanges champion.An overwhelming majority of shareholders, which include the Qatar Investment Authority, Blackrock and Invesco, backed the deal which would give them a 46 per cent stake in a new London-based holding company headed by Deutsche Börse’s Carsten Kengeter, writes Philip Stafford.More than 99 per cent of votes cast were in favour of the deal.A combination of Europe’s two largest exchange operators by market capitalisation would create a derivatives and securities trading powerhouse able to rival the world’s largest market operators CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.The future of the deal has been thrown into doubt by the UK’s vote to leave the European Union, which has left politicians in Germany concerned that oversight of part of their critical market infrastructure could be headquartered outside the EU.The final decision in Germany will be taken by the economics ministry in the state of Hesse, where Frankfurt is located. The deal must also pass antitrust scrutiny in Brussels, the UK and the US.In spite of the UK’s “leave” decision, both companies are pressing ahead with the deal. The referendum “does not impact the compelling strategic rationale of the merger,” the companies said in the aftermath of the vote.Owing to the structure of the deal and local regulations, Deutsche Börse will not hold a shareholder meeting but will make a tender offer for shareholders that closes on July 12.
87;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;CBOE takes stake in rival Eris Exchange;Chicago group injects equity into crosstown rival to develop a range of interest rate contracts;CBOE Holdings, the US derivatives exchange, is to take a minority stake in Eris Exchange, providing a capital injection for its fledging rival to develop a series of new contracts for trading interest rates.Chicago-based CBOE will provide new equity and join Société Générale, State Street, Fidelity and Morgan Stanley as investors in its crosstown rival. John Deters, chief strategy officer at CBOE, will also join the Eris board.The two parties will work together on the development of proprietary futures and indices contracts that could mimic or supplement trading in the over-the-counter markets. The two did not divulge further details about the kinds of products they would develop but indicated it would be contracts that offer cheaper alternatives to tailored instruments that hedge interest rate risk.Banks face tougher rules on trading derivatives after the financial crisis, which has raised the overall cost of trading bespoke products like swaps. CBOE is best known of its ownership of the Vix volatility indices and the two already work on CBOE’s S&P 500 Variance Futures.Eris has made some headway in recent years with listed futures contracts that trade like off-exchange swaps, although volume has flattened. Open interest on the exchange is around 159,000 contracts, unchanged on a year ago.“Our alliance with CBOE provides Eris with growth capital for strategic initiatives and aggressive product expansion,” said Neal Brady, chief executive and co-founder of Eris.The deal extends CBOE’s strategy of the last year to purchase immaterial stakes in new ventures. Last year it also invested in CurveGlobal, a European interest rate futures venture run by the London Stock Exchange Group and large banks that will launch in the autumn.This year CBOE bought a majority stake in Vest Financial, an asset management firm that provides options-based investments.Other exchanges are also interested in OTC products. Last week Intercontinental Exchange said it was working with DRW Holdings, a Chicago high-frequency trading group, on a contract to help stimulate the repo market, which provides a crucial source of short-term funding for banks.
88;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-05-10T18:02:57Z;Russian gang suspected of scam in ICE market;Two arrested and £22m frozen over alleged money laundering;Intercontinental Exchange’s London futures market has been used as a front for Russian organised crime, according to police who have made two arrests for suspected money-laundering.The City of London Police revealed that they had arrested two men — one a Russian broker — over suspected money-laundering as part of a global alleged scam spanning Switzerland, the Caribbean and Russia. The police did not name the broker, but people familiar with the situation said it was Dzimitry Niadzvetski, who worked at a London unit of Archer Daniels Midland, the US agricultural trader and producer.Mr Niadzvetski has been released on police bail, without charge. His lawyer declined to comment.A Russian oil firm, and Swiss and British Virgin Islands-headquartered investment firms are suspected of being used as a front for a Russian gang to launder gains, City police said, adding that they had frozen $22m so far as a result of its probe.ICE, which routinely monitors for suspicious trading, presented its concerns to the police and collaborated closely with the probe.“Our investigation points towards a suspected Russian organised crime group using London’s futures market to launder millions of dollars worth of criminal revenue,” said Detective Inspector Craig Mullish.The revelation is a further blow to the City days before the prime minister, David Cameron, is due to host a global anti-corruption summit. The government wants to clamp down on offshore finance and tax havens following a global furore sparked by the release of the Panama Papers.Mr Cameron has been criticised by campaigning groups for not doing enough to clean up his own back yard.ADM Investor Services, the futures brokerage arm of ADM, said: “We can confirm an employee was suspended following an investigation by the City of London Police. [ . . .] There is no tolerance for improper behaviour and we will take action if it transpires he has broken the terms of his employment.”Our investigation points towards a suspected Russian organised crime group using London’s futures market to launder millions of dollars worth of criminal revenueAs part of its probe around ICE Futures Europe, the financial district’s police force arrested the 43-year-old Russian broker just before Easter. He was interviewed again this month, according to people familiar with the situation. A British trader has also been interviewed under caution, which is when suspects are read their rights.Authorities were initially tipped off about the alleged extensive network via suspicious trading in crude oil futures on a London market operated by ICE, according to people familiar with the situation. ICE said: “We notified the authorities immediately upon detecting suspicious trading activity.”The FCA has also been informed.The Russian broker’s trading accounts valued at $22m were frozen by a clearing firm for being suspected proceeds of crime, the police said.Companies and traders use ICE Futures Europe’s exchange to speculate and hedge their exposure to fluctuating crude oil prices. The venue is one of the world’s most liquid markets for energy futures trading, with big users like electricity and power providers, banks and high-frequency traders making up the majority of the exchange’s members.Additional reporting by Neil Hume and Philip Stafford in London
89;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-05-06T20:58:04Z;Week in Review, May 7;Burberry, Europe’s airlines, ICE and LSE, UBS and Takata featured;A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Burberry looks to back up BaileyA £4,500 Burberry suede coat can be glimpsed on the cover of this month’s British Vogue, draped around the shoulders of the Duchess of Cambridge. The luxury goods group’s shareholders will also be hoping to gain an insight into chief executive Christopher Bailey’s strategy for growth, which he is due to outline later this month, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.After a disappointing year, Burberry is considering the appointment of a senior commercial manager to back Mr Bailey, according to two people familiar with the situation. Burberry declined to comment.Two years after becoming chief executive, in addition to his previous job as creative director, investor criticism of Mr Bailey’s dual mandate is once again growing, especially during the current tough market for luxury goods sales.A 32 per cent fall in the share price over the past 12 months, and the likelihood of lower pre-tax profits this year compared with last, have prompted concerns that Mr Bailey is spreading himself too thin.“Bailey needs back-up,” said one shareholder this week, who has sold down Burberry shares in the past year: “He needs someone to help him on the marketing and retail side, who has a good understanding of the business and knows exactly where they want to take the company.”Burberry has been beefing up its senior management. Last year it created a new head of people and corporate affairs and a chief information officer. However, some analysts believe more radical change is needed.Luca Solca, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said Burberry was not coming up with enough new products to tempt consumers and noted that Mr Bailey had been creative director for a long time.“The best way to inject novelty into a brand is to change the creative director,” he said. “One possibility is for Mr Bailey to continue as chief executive and hire someone to create a new chapter for Burberry.”Mario Ortelli, analyst at Bernstein Research, said it was unclear where the Burberry brand sat along the luxury scale.“The priority should be to have a clear strategy about the positioning of the brand. Prices have been raised a lot but it’s not clear that consumers’ perception of the brand has risen similarly.”● Related Lombard note: Bailey’s blurred roleOvercapacity hits Europe’s airlinesShares in two of Europe’s largest airlines tumbled this week as they warned about weaker passenger demand this year, in part due to the fallout from the Brussels terrorist attacks, writes Michael Stothard.Franco-Dutch carrier Air France-KLM and Germany’s Lufthansa warned of overcapacity on a number of routes leading to pricing pressure in 2016, sending shares in each group down more than 6 per cent.This followed a similar warning the previous week by International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways, which again cited the Brussels terrorist attacks in March.All three groups said that they were benefiting from lower fuel prices but this was being offset by overcapacity on certain routes.However, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM said they would maintain 2016 performance targets, while the results in the first quarter were also better than analysts had expected.Air France-KLM reported a net loss of €155m for the first three months of 2016, better than the €559m loss one year earlier, and helped by a drop in its fuel bill.Lufthansa swung to a net loss of €8m compared with a €425m profit a year earlier, though last year’s profits were lifted by the sale of its stake in US carrier JetBlue.Both groups are struggling to reduce their cost base to deal with the weaker environment and competition from budget airlines in Europe and Gulf carriers.Both are also having to take on powerful unions and have suffered from crippling strike action in recent years.● Related Lex notes: Air France— the hair shirt and Air Berlin— long haulICE goes cool on LSEIntercontinental Exchange backed away this week from making a bid for the London Stock Exchange Group and hit out at its UK rival for rebuffing attempts over the past year to discuss a possible deal, writes Philip Stafford.The US exchanges operator had been weighing a cash-based offer to rival the LSE’s agreed merger with Deutsche Börse. However, ICE struggled to put a valuation on LCH, the clearing house controlled by the LSE.LSE shares fell more than 5 per cent to £26 on the news.Relations between ICE and the LSE — cool for several years — fell a few more degrees after Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said it had encountered a “disappointing level of engagement” from the LSE, which prevented it from doing deeper due diligence.ICE had already been irked by comments by Xavier Rolet, the LSE’s chief executive, about US trading fee rises and its record in Europe. The LSE said ICE had received the same information as Deutsche Börse.Mr Sprecher also doubted some of the touted benefits of the LSE-Deutsche Börse deal, such as combining their two clearing houses — among the biggest in the world — across different bankruptcy jurisdictions.Owen Jones, an analyst at Citi, said ICE’s withdrawal was designed to put pressure on LSE management by shareholders.“Many LSE investors, whom we have engaged with over recent weeks, can see the rationale for the LSE-Deutsche Börse deal, but felt that the implied valuation of LSE assets was not sufficient,” he said.Takata recalls doubles in sizeThe safety recall that was already the biggest in history more than doubled in size on Wednesday when US regulators ordered Japan’s Takata to recall a further 35m to 40m more potentially faulty vehicle airbags, writes Robert Wright.The extra recalls come on top of 28.8m airbags that had already been recalled over fears they could rupture on deployment in a crash. Such ruptures have been blamed for 10 deaths and around 100 injuries in the US.While agreeing to carry out the recalls, which will be undertaken in phases between now and December 2019, Takata insisted there were no new data or scientific analysis to suggest the latest batch of airbags presented any “substantial risk”.The move means the that National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has now recalled all Takata airbag inflators in the US that use ammonium nitrate to inflate the bag but that lack a desiccant to keep the accelerant dry. Takata must also undertake research to show ammonium nitrate inflators with desiccants are safe, although there is no history of their rupturing.The NHTSA ordered the recall based on research that showed ammonium nitrate inflators became more likely to rupture with age and deteriorated more rapidly when exposed to high temperatures and humidity. Priority will be given to older vehicles and ones that have been kept in high-humidity hot areas.Takata said it had accepted the recall out of respect for public safety and to restore confidence but it was not aware of any ruptures in the inflator products that would be covered by the new orderWealth woes at UBSUBS reported global financial market turbulence had paralysed activity by its wealthy clients in the first three months of the year, hitting profits and sending its share price sharply lower, writes Ralph Atkins.The Swiss bank’s shares were among the sector’s worst performers in another bad week for Europe’s banks, which are having to rebuild business models, improve cost competitiveness and combat the impact of negative interest rates on profitability.Since 2012, UBS has put wealth management at the centre of its strategy — a decision that head Sergio Ermotti believes will allow it to keep outperforming weaker rivals even if market conditions deteriorate further.UBS’s wealth management operations attracted SFr29bn ($30bn) of net new money in the first three months of 2016 — the strongest inflows since early 2008. Inflows were particularly strong from the Asia-Pacific region and from wealthy individuals.However, UBS said heightened economic and geopolitical uncertainty, as well as market volatility, had led to “more pronounced” risk aversion in the first quarter. Client activity had been “exceptionally low,” said Mr Ermotti.UBS’s net profits fell by a larger than expected 64 per cent to SFr707m in the three months to March. The fall was exaggerated by the strength of the comparable period a year ago. Then, business was boosted by the Swiss central bank’s decision to abandon its cap on the franc’s value against the euro, which led investors to rethink positions. This year, UBS complained of the “wrong sort” of market volatility.
90;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-05-04T18:06:14Z;ICE attacks London Stock Exchange over shelved bid;US group blames lack of engagement from UK bourse;Jeffrey Sprecher, the head of Intercontinental Exchange, has lashed out at the leadership of the London Stock Exchange, blaming a lack of co-operation by the UK group for ICE’s decision to walk away from a potential takeover bid.ICE’s unexpected move sent shares in the LSE’s owner tumbling and ended months of speculation over whether the US group would launch a bid to challenge the merger between Germany’s Deutsche Börse and the LSE.Mr Sprecher on Wednesday said that ICE’s board and advisers had tried and failed to arrange meetings through Donald Brydon, LSE’s chairman, over the past year before publicly confirming its interest in a deal in March.“The disappointing level of engagement of the LSE ultimately did not allow us to make a complete determination of the integration benefits and their related risks that ICE would require to support a bid,” Mr Sprecher said.He added that the US company would turn its attention to other transactions.The LSE said it had complied fully with all legal requirements and had not received an approach from the US group. “ICE was provided with all the information that Deutsche Börse had,” the UK exchange said.Shares in the LSE Group dropped 4.2 per cent in London to close at £25.76 trading. Deutsche Börse shares jumped 5.8 per cent in Frankfurt, raising questions over the deal’s valuation and description as a “merger of equals”.Analysts at Citigroup said: “By stating publicly that the LSE has not engaged with it sufficiently, we believe ICE is putting pressure on LSE shareholders to demand answers from LSE management.”ICE, which also reported results on Wednesday, climbed more than 7 per cent to $258.49 in New York.The US group’s decision was in part influenced by an inability to come up with a valuation on LCH, the clearing house controlled by the LSE, according to people familiar with the talks. ICE was once a user of LCH but grew so frustrated with the company’s service that it decided to set up its own clearing house.ICE executives have also doubted some of the touted benefits of the LSE-Deutsche Börse deal. Among them include up to $7bn of capital efficiencies that could be generated by pooling collateral requirements across the combined derivatives platforms, people familiar with the planned deal have said.LSE and Deutsche Börse are continuing to prepare their merger documents, including the antitrust filings and prospectus for shareholders.Votes on shareholder approval for both companies may take place before Britain holds its referendum on whether to leave the EU. A decision by the UK to withdraw from the bloc would probably affect the deal’s governance structure, German politicians have warned.Analysts doubted that ICE would have been able to match the annual €450m cost savings trumpeted by the LSE and Deutsche Börse as ICE ran a much leaner IT operation than its rivals.ICE, which started as a natural gas and power trading platform less than two decades ago, has been one of the most acquisitive companies in a rapidly consolidating global exchange industry. In 2013, it bought the New York Stock Exchange, the marquee equities bourse in the US.The company said that it reserved the right to make or participate in an offer for the London exchange within six months.The announcement came as Atlanta-based ICE reported $441m in adjusted net profit in the first quarter, or $3.68 per share, up 20 per cent from $344m, or $3.06 per share, in the same quarter a year before. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected $3.65 per share.
91;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-05-04T11:46:59Z;LSE shares drop as ICE rules self out of bid;;One to cross off the list.Intercontinental Exchange has ruled itself out of a bid for the London Stock Exchange, hitting the UK group’s share price.The LSE’s plans to merge with Germany’s Deutsche Börse, revealed in February, have hit a speed bump, with concerns about the UK’s impending vote on European Union membership proving to be a potential problem for some German lawmakers.But ICE is not going to step into the breach.In a statement on Wednesday, the US group said:ICE determined that there was insufficient engagement to confirm the potential market and shareholder benefits of a strategic combination.Still, it added:ICE reserves the right to make or participate in an offer… within the next six months following the date of this announcement.Shares in the LSE dropped by 8.2 per cent after ICE issued its statement to £24.68.The announcement came as Atlanta-based ICE reported $441m in adjusted net profit in the first quarter, or $3.68 per share, up 20 per cent from $344m, or $3.06 per share, in the same quarter a year before. Analysts polled by FactSet had anticipated $3.65 per share in earnings.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive, called it the best quarter in the company’s history. “This strong performance reflects our team’s ability to deliver strong operational results, even as we consider potential strategic opportunities,” he said.
92;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-04-29T16:09:59Z;Europe’s clearing houses pass stress tests;;Europe’s clearing houses have passed their first continent-wide stress tests as regulators tighten their analysis of the risk management houses’ ability to withstand major shocks and maintain market stability.The utilities have become the keystone of authorities’ efforts to underpin markets after the financial crisis and mandated billions of dollars of swaps trades be processed through the utilities. The venues stand between two parties and ensure a deal is completed in the event one side defaults.“We judged them to be resilient with respect to counterparty credit risk,” said Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma), the main European regulator, confirmed late on Friday. He added that the test did not include liquidity risk, writes Phillip Stafford in London.By law, European clearing houses are required to stress test their operations daily but a continent-wide test had never been carried out before. The regulator wanted to assess the impact of a shock across the entire market as often banks, trading houses and asset managers are members of several clearing houses.Esma tested for multiple defaults and price dislocations at 17 clearers who held more than €150bn worth of default resources, and collectively have more than 900 clearing house members. The majority of those resources were held at just five main houses, operated by LCH Group, Clearnet, Intercontinental Exchange, Italy’s CC&G and Eurex.Esma said that clearing houses faced small amounts of residual uncovered losses, of up to €4bn, under severe stress scenarios. That number was a collective number for all clearing houses and applied once all other lines of defence at the clearing house had been exhausted. Clearing houses operate via so-called default waterfalls, a series of financial resources that can be drawn on when crises hit.The scenario assumed that the two largest clearing members defaulted at the same time, leading to more than 25 other clearing houses defaulting.However Mr Maijoor said that scenario was “extreme” and “that is also a number that we hadn’t seen during the financial crisis.” He added that Esma would not be asking clearing houses to contribute more of their own capital to a default fund
93;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-04-27T13:21:30Z;ICE’s Trayport deal faces in-depth competition probe;;Intercontinental Exchange’s $650m purchase of Trayport, an electronic energy trading platform, last autumn faces in in-depth antitrust investigation by UK authorities.The acquisition from interdealer broker BGC Partners gave ICE a dominant position in the hybrid energy trading markets in Europe, in which markets such as oil and coal remain brokered over the phone although they are traded in blocks of futures, writes Philip Stafford.Trayport is a London-based software platform that allows traders, brokers, utilities and resource companies to conduct both voice and electronic trading and clearing of gas, coal, power and emissions markets. It is widely recognised as the pre-eminent platform by which those markets price and execute trades.The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday:The CMA is concerned that ICE could use its ownership of Trayport’s software to raise prices and/or reduce the quality of its service to rival exchanges, brokers and clearing houses in order to divert its rivals’ trades to ICE’s exchange and clearinghouse and/or to protect its market position from increased competition.The deal will be referred for an in-depth investigation by an independent group of CMA panel members unless ICE is able to offer undertakings which address the CMA’s concerns.ICE beat US rival CME and UK data provider Markit to the purchase last November. ICE already owns extensive energy assets in Europe, including the venue that was once the International Petroleum Exchange.
94;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-04-22T11:22:52Z;Quick View: Bats follows exchange playbook with data push;US’s newest listed stock market looks like copying rivals as it maps out long-term growth plans;Bats Global Markets has banished memories of its ill-fated IPO four years ago. Now investors have to weigh up what the investment case is.Early share price moves have put Bats on a forward price/earnings ratio of about 18 times, according to Bloomberg data. Compared with other listed US exchanges, it is on a chunkier valuation than Nasdaq (17 times) but marginally lower than CBOE (18x), Intercontinental Exchange (19x) and CME Group (24x).Bats has changed considerably since 2012. Positions in both US and European equities trading have been consolidated — the former by merging with Direct Edge in 2013, the latter by launching over-the-counter trade reporting.Chris Concannon, chief executive, has moved into new markets, namely US equity options, exchange-traded products and foreign exchange trading. The latter was via a $365m purchase of Hotspot from KCG, which has pushed out debt to $937m, although $687.5m is long-term debt, and it will pay dividends.These markets are likely to provide the growth. Bats’ 20 per cent share of the US equity market is its highest ever and is likely to face new competition from a regulated IEX Group, and renewed attacks from Nasdaq and NYSE. European equities only account for less than a fifth of earnings, and trading volumes on the continent have been dire this year.That creates a potential weak point. Net transaction fees were 44.6 per cent of Bats’ revenues — less cost of revenues — in the year to December 31. And it noted turnover “may be reduced due to declines in our market share, trading volumes or regulatory changes”. Furthermore, nearly half of its total transaction fees were generated by affiliates of its principal investors, some of whom are selling down.Bats’ answer is to follow the exchange playbook and move into new markets or more stable and lucrative revenue streams.Mr Concannon calls the changes in the FX market a “once-in-a-career structural change” as banks withdraw from some aspects of trading. Bats estimates that even if banks give away just 5 per cent of their business, that would unlock close to $100bn of FX daily turnover that electronic venues could fight over. FX swaps and forwards are also on the agenda. Here Bats faces a battle with other venues like CME, EBS and Thomson Reuters.Subscription to market data and access/connectivity was 55 per cent of net revenues last year and has had compound average growth rates of 30 per cent in the last five years. Nasdaq made $282m market data, Bats just $21m. Tellingly, Mr Concannon said: “We will continue to monetise this position and close this sizeable gap.”Further pushes into ETFs, where Bats has a third of the market in the US, is also possible. NYSE Arca is the market leader. Soberingly, Mr Concannon predicts there are likely to be more ETF listings than corporate ones this year. Bats’ play here is to pay issuers to list on its market, hoping it will be a thrust at the heart of NYSE’s model.Making Bats the home for the main symbol would give it the lion’s share of trading fees. It may well also begin calculating its own intraday net asset values for its exchange-traded listings. At present it relies mainly on NYSE Arca, whose parent ICE has just strengthened its market position with the $5.2bn purchase of Interactive Data Corp.But that will probably take several years as customers get used to/complain about annual data fee increases. In the meantime Bats appears to be following the path led by Bob Greifeld and Nasdaq, the former colleagues that Mr Concannon likes to gently rib in public.Nasdaq’s share price has comfortably outperformed all of its rivals and the S&P 500 in the past 12 months. But Nasdaq is distinguished by its technology division, which provides corporate solutions and market technology and accounts for 27 per cent of revenues. That makes it more truly insulated from the vagaries of market volumes to which Bats is exposed. Bats is on its way but not there yet.
95;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-04-20T06:15:08Z;Deutsche Börse and LSE plan to link clearing houses;Two sides are working on common risk management and default frameworks for their market utilities;Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange Group are planning to link their clearing houses at the heart of their €20bn merger by creating a framework to oversee bank defaults.The two sides are working on common risk management and default frameworks for their market utilities, which risk manage billions of dollars of derivatives trades on the market every day.The exchanges’ long-term aim is for each customer to become a member of both the LSE-controlled LCH and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex clearing houses. The customers, which are typically banks, would agree to hand over their trading data in return for better risk management of their derivatives, according to two people familiar with the talks.The planned London-based holding company would instruct the two clearing houses on how to proceed with a default after consultations with central banks, one of the people said. The two sides are discussing their plans with their regulators and customers, one person said.The framework would serve as one of the bedrocks of the Deutsche Börse-LSE all-share merger, which would create one of the world’s largest market infrastructure operators, and a competitor to US duo CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange.New banking and markets regulations have added heavy capital charges to their main customers, the investment banks. Traders must post margin, or insurance, to back their trades in over-the-counter and futures markets.The exchanges argue that netting the totals, called cross-margining, would be a more efficient use of capital. However, the proposed deal has met criticism that merging the clearing houses could create a new “too big to fail” market institution. LCH and Eurex would handle a combined near €150bn of customers’ money.The two parties have promised to keep the clearing houses separate but operate under different risk monitoring systems. One person familiar with the talks highlighted problems created by February’s default of Frankfurt-based bank Maple, which was a member of both exchanges’ clearing houses.“Right now what you have is a blind process — the liquidation of positions is conducted without co-ordination,” the person said. “Therefore it has a negative price impact in the market as you have two guys running out liquidating positions in the name.”Senior executives on both sides have emphasised that banks and investors could save billions of dollars arising from higher trading costs. People close to the deal have suggested that the total savings would be as high as $7bn but the two companies have given scant details as to how it would work in practice.The new system the two parties are working on is similar to an agreement that the CME and ICE already have with the Options Clearing Corp, a US equity options clearing house, one person said.It calculates the amount of margin investors need to post, based on end-of-day prices. With the US link, traders save millions although the agreement only covers derivatives contracts that are correlated.
96;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-04-14T13:41:18Z;Europe to conduct clearing house stress tests;Move underscores risk management utilities’ growing role at centre of market stability;European markets regulators are to conduct their first stress tests for clearing houses at the end of April, underscoring the risk management utilities’ growing role at the centre of market stability.The European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) will test the effects of multiple defaults and price dislocations on entities like ones operated by the London Stock Exchange Group, Deutsche Börse, London Metal Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange.The exercise, which will be published on April 29, will assess the ability of new market risk management buffers to withstand major shocks. The utilities have become the keystone of authorities’ efforts to underpin markets after the financial crisis.Clearing houses, also known as central counterparties (CCPs), stand between two parties and ensure a deal is completed in the event one side defaults.“CCPs are also highly interconnected — both with financial institutions and markets — and the increasing volumes cleared through CCPs make them even more important for the financial system,” said Steven Maijoor, Esma chair.The tests will assess the outcome of multiple defaults by clearing house members, such as banks and other big market traders. It will also assess the effect of severe price volatility and the impact on the clearing house’s resources to fund losses. Clearing houses mutualise risk between members.Regulators will also examine how the region’s network of nearly 30 clearers would be hit. It will become an annual test and authorities are expected to use the first to test their stress models.The European Association of CCP Clearing Houses, which represents 20 clearers in the region, has warned that standardised stress tests could be difficult as each company processes different products and is governed by different rules.Esma has not set a standardised test throughout Europe but will work with the European Systemic Risk Board and national regulators. The clearing houses have not been informed how they are being tested, only that the tests have started.“We’re still trying to find out what Esma’s methodology is. People aren’t really thrilled about it,” said one clearing executive.The results will be aggregated and presented anonymously, bowing to clearing houses’ concerns that their operations and market confidence could be damaged by the publication of sensitive customer data. The results will be published after the market close.Global authorities are also pushing for more testing of systems but as yet there is no worldwide standard or framework for testing.www.ft.com/tradingroom
97;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-04-13T19:25:55Z;Mercuria cuts out the futures middleman;Energy trader becomes a clearing member as new capital requirements bite;Mercuria, a leading energy trading house, is cutting ties to the middlemen of futures markets as they raise costs in response to tougher regulation.The Swiss-based company, active in markets from oil to power, has become a member of the European clearing house run by Intercontinental Exchange and plans to join the clearing house of CME Group, executives said. In doing so, it will no longer use outside clearing brokers.Clearing houses act as a buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer in derivatives markets, spreading the risk of a trader default among its members. Most members are clearing brokers, which collect good-faith margin deposits from traders.But Mercuria executives said new European capital requirements were set to make more expensive to clear trades through third-party clearing brokers. Instead, it chose to become a clearing member itself.Guillaume Vermersch, Mercuria’s chief financial officer, told the FT Commodities Global Summit on Wednesday that the company would move all of its futures and over-the-counter derivatives positions “in-house”.The move is a sign of the upheaval across derivatives markets as regulators impose changes in response to the financial crisis. Banks, which own the biggest clearing brokers, face new capital requirements and are passing some of the costs on to customers.Low interest rates have also depressed what clearing brokers can earn on customer collateral, forcing them to find other sources of revenue. In the US, the number of registered clearing firms has plummeted in recent years.Mercuria will only handle its own trades and does not plan to offer clearing services to customers. As a member, the company must contribute to clearing houses’ guarantee funds.Victoria Attwood Scott, Mercuria’s global head of compliance, said: “We have the expertise. We looked at self-clearing, and over time it will create efficiencies and save on costs after the initial investment.”Mercuria is not the only non-broker to be a clearing member. ICE Clear Europe’s membership includes companies as diverse as Mars Chocolate and Jump Trading, a Chicago-based proprietary trading firm, as well as bank-owned brokers such as Goldman Sachs and Société Générale.Glencore, the commodities trading house, last month resigned its membership at ICE Clear Europe, according to a regulatory notice. A reason wasn’t given.Derek Sammann, global head of commodities and options products at CME, said: “As commodity trading firms look at their rising cost of capital, we are looking at a form of access model that preserves the agency of the [clearing firm] but provides capital efficiencies to the firms as well.”http://www.ft.com/intl/indepth/ft-commodities-summit
98;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-04-08T09:03:21Z;BM&F Bovespa sells CME stake ahead of planned Cetip purchase;Brazilian exchange ends nine-year cross-shareholding agreement with Chicago peer;BM&F Bovespa has sold its 4 per cent stake in CME Group, the US futures exchange operator, as the Brazilian group prepares a formal offer for Cetip, a rival domestic market infrastructure operator.The sale of 13.6m share “was to raise funds to meet the company’s financing needs in the context of the proposed business combination with Cetip”, the regulatory filing late on Thursday said. Based on CME’s closing share price, the sale netted Bovespa about $1.3bn.The two parties have been talking for six months but disagreed on price. Local media in São Paulo has reported a deal between Bovespa and Cetip, the country’s largest fixed income clearing house, is imminent, with Bovespa offering R41 per share for its rival.A combination would create a company worth R$40bn ($10.9bn) and consolidate Bovespa’s position as Latin America’s largest exchanges operator. It would also provide a windfall for Intercontinental Exchange, the US derivatives exchange, which owns a 12.5 per cent stake in Cetip.The CME stake sale also brings to an end a near decade-long cross shareholding agreement between the two exchanges. Following the disposal Edemir Pinto, chief executive of Bovespa, resigned from his position on the CME board, although the two exchanges will continue to work together on technology and developing and cross-listing products, the statement said. The CME will not reduce its stake in Bovespa.The move would extend Bovespa’s strategy of increasing its influence across the continent. It is seeking to acquire large enough stakes in the national exchanges of Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru and Argentina to ensure a seat on the board of each one.On Wednesday it bought a 4.1 per cent stake in Bolsa Mexicana de Valores for 640 million Mexican pesos (R$136m).
99;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-04-04T14:30:04Z;Investors shun ICE world cotton futures;Production of the commodity is global, but futures trading is staying very local;The cotton market may be global, but international commodity merchants are showing a preference for cotton futures contracts that are local.Volume in Intercontinental Exchange’s world cotton futures, backed by bales from nine countries, has evaporated since their debut five months ago. Four in five trading sessions saw no transactions in February and March.The flagging activity reflects the difficulty in establishing new derivatives markets. ICE envisages changes to the contract in the coming year “to make sure it’s meeting the needs of participants,” Trabue Bland, president of the ICE Futures US exchange, said in an interview.ICE launched the world cotton futures in November at the request of merchants who complained of flaws in its existing contract, which allows only deliveries of cotton grown in the US. The limitation has squeezed some traders when supplies were tight.The new world contract reflects the global nature of production, permitting cotton grown in locales from west Africa to Brazil to be delivered to warehouses in Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan and the US.The contract would “provide a new price discovery and risk management vehicle for the large volume of commercial cotton that moves from key origins to the multiple Asian consuming countries that dominate global exports/imports of cotton,” ICE said in a filing last year.ICE took years to develop world cotton futures, and was even forced to get US law changed to list them. The Atlanta-based exchange operator created incentive programmes for merchants and proprietary traders and last year an executive invited willing cotton merchants to dinner on the floor of the ICE-owned New York Stock Exchange — a comment a spokesman said was made tongue in cheek.But while trading of US cotton futures often tops 20,000 contracts per day, volumes in the world contract totalled just 38 contracts over the entire month of March, exchange data show. World cotton was $0.67 per lb last week.Cotton merchants and brokers offered a variety of explanations for the lack of interest thus far. Herman Kohlmeyer, a cotton broker at Michael J Nugent in New Orleans, said the world contract was a “sellers’” contract, as it gave them a wide choice of delivery points.“It never made sense to a number of people in the industry, and the odds of any new contract becoming successful are not terribly high,” he said.Cotton executives said they have been cautious ahead of the first delivery month in May. Among their concerns: that lower-quality bales would be sold from countries where cotton bolls are still picked by hand.Mr Bland said: “The reason we’re seeing low volumes is because these guys are taking a risk on our delivery process. They’re not going to take big positions in this because they’re testing how everything’s going to work.”
100;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-27T17:06:55Z;City of London split over LSE-Deutsche Börse merger;Lord Mervyn Davies calls for a public interest test to be applied to proposed transaction;The prospective sale of the London Stock Exchange Group to a foreign rival has split the City of London elite, with stark differences of opinion emerging over whether it matters that the exchange’s 300 years of independence are poised to come to an end.Shareholders of both the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse are weighing the merits of a proposed merger outlined this month that would create one of the world’s largest exchange operators. Intercontinental Exchange of the US is considering making a rival bid for the LSE.Lord Mervyn Davies, a prominent banker and former Labour trade minister, told the FT City Network that it should not be solely up to shareholders to sell the LSE. A government “public interest test” should be applied, he told the panel of top financiers.“[This] is a key part of our infrastructure,” said Lord Davies. “And whilst shareholders must have their say, as must the board, it is also necessary for the UK to ensure its infrastructure is protected.”Jean-Pierre Mustier, who previously headed the investment banking operations of both Société Générale and UniCredit, was similarly outspoken. “The City needs an independent London Stock Exchange for the good of the United Kingdom,” he said. The more distant an exchange became from its national base, the less likely it was to serve its core purpose of giving companies access to capital, he warned.It is unclear whether the proposed merger between Deutsche Börse and the LSE, or any potential alternative deal, would clear regulatory hurdles. But analysts believe the flurry of interest in the LSE almost certainly spells the end of the exchange’s three centuries-long independence.Other members of the FT City Network — which comprises more than 50 financiers and policymakers — expressed concern during an online debate about other potential disadvantages of a deal.Manny Roman, Man Group’s chief executive, warned of the risks of “too big to fail” exchange groups levying “monopolistic” charges.But the dominant view among members of the network was highly positive about the potential advantages of a Deutsche Börse-LSE combination.Robert Swannell, a former banker who is now chairman of Marks and Spencer, was widely commended for his analysis that the LSE should be part of a bigger successful group, “rather than obsess about its ownership or the nationality of its CEO”.He said that with electricity, water, phone networks and airports under the control of a multitude of non-British owners, it was illogical to apply a crucial infrastructure test to the LSE.Xavier Rolet, the LSE chief executive, is also a member of the FT City Network, but he did not participate in the debate.However, in an interview he disputed the idea of a loss of independence: “The shareholding point is something that actually we’re quite a bit puzzled by,” Mr Rolet said. “Today there are more British shareholders in Deutsche Börse than German shareholders.”Under the terms of the proposed merger, Deutsche Börse shareholders would own 54.4 per cent of the combined group. LSE shareholders would own the remainder.The City needs an independent London Stock Exchange for the good of the United KingdomThe new holding company would have its base in London, and Carsten Kengeter, Deutsche Börse’s chief executive, is due to have the same title at the enlarged group.Meanwhile, criticism of the deal is growing in Germany, where local politicians and industry experts have expressed concern that it will undermine the status of Frankfurt as a global financial centre.Manfred Zass, a former member of the Deutsche Börse supervisory board, told Boersen-Zeitung, a German business newspaper, that the deal contained a “perceptible tilt away from Frankfurt”.Additional reporting by Philip Stafford and Guy Chazan
101;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-21T18:45:47Z;IHS deal moves Markit away from credit market origins;The two companies hope to create new products to challenge Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters;Lance Uggla, Markit’s irrepressible chief executive, has long spoken of his ambition to be “the best of the biggest financial data providers”.So it was with great disappointment that he lost out in a last minute $5bn bidding war with Intercontinental Exchange for Interactive Data Corp last October.However, in the background he had already begun talks about a combination with US data provider IHS, a company he had long admired and held brief discussions with more than two years ago before Markit’s listing in New York. Soon after the IDC defeat, Mr Uggla intensified negotiations with his counterpart Jerre Stead at IHS.The two deals could not be more different. If Markit had acquired IDC, it would have emboldened the company’s march on financial data and reliance on selling to big banks, its largest customers. The $13bn combination with IHS, announced on Monday, moves Markit into an array of corporate data and analytics removed from its credit market origins.The two companies are betting that armed with IHS’s specialisms in energy, automotive, commodities and chemicals data, London-based Markit can create new products and form the basis for a new $30bn-$45bn challenger to Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters.The deal is the largest in a spree of financial and corporate information deals over the past two years as the value of market intelligence — with billions of dollars of trades and loans tied to proprietary data — has soared.In addition to ICE, the London Stock Exchange Group bought Russell Investments for $2.7bn, Bloomberg bought Barclays’ index benchmarking business for about £520m and Verisk Analytics’ bought Wood Mackenzie for £1.9bn in March.“In the world we live in, information is key. How you value an asset, create indices, do valuations . . . it can help people to make decisions,” said Mr Uggla. “Every time you have a piece of content, you can make money in different ways. And what’s more important is that our customers demand this content.”The deal is also being cast as another alternative to Bloomberg. People familiar with the talks said IHS, with its 50,000 corporate customers, had looked at every option in financial services and “liked the contrarian nature to Markit”. Mr Stead said he “was fascinated by what [Mr Uggla] was doing, so impressed with what we had found as an attack mechanism to a huge market growing quickly”.The combined company, IHS Markit, would make about $3.3bn in revenue, producing $1.2bn of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. It will be headquartered in London.“Each company offers unique, sophisticated, decision-making information that should enhance each other’s product lines and be appealing to each other’s client base,” said Douglas Taylor, managing partner at Burton-Taylor International Consulting. “This deal could create a significant and major future player in the space.”In particular Markit can sell its managed IT services to new clients. “It would have taken me a decade to build 5 per cent of their customer base,” said Mr Uggla.Nevertheless it will also have to assure analysts and investors about the combined company’s long-term growth. In the last year organic growth at Markit has fallen from 8.9 per cent to 3.8 per cent as it instituted price reductions in its derivatives processing product and recorded lower primary loan issuance volumes. IHS recorded organic growth of just 2 per cent last year, although the subscription-based business that accounts for the majority of revenues was a more healthy 5 per cent.The new company expects to realise cost synergies of $125m over time. In comparison, the LSE’s all-share deal with Deutsche Börse is expected to realise €450m in three years. Shareholders will instead be offered a $1bn share buyback in both 2017 and 2018.To that end, US management will dominate in the early years. The 74-year Mr Stead will be the chief executive until his retirement in December 2017, when Mr Uggla steps up from president. IHS will also have a majority on the board, allowing IHS to control the integration process.One person familiar with the talks said that there will be $3bn-$5bn in cash flow available over the next three years.Equally, if Mr Uggla was looking to expand, he has also been wary of becoming prey to a big exchange. The industry has been pursuing its own frenzied merger and acquisition activity since last summer. Deutsche Börse, for one, had briefly considered a bid before it pursued merger talks with the LSE.“Exchanges are not happy being just exchanges any more. They want to be in the content space,” said Mr Uggla. Already traders are speculating that a rival exchange will launch a counterbid and Markit shares rose 11 per cent to $32.75 in New York. But while exchange attention is turned on the LSE, Mr Uggla has stolen the first move.
102;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-21T17:14:18Z;IHS and Markit merge in $13bn all-share deal;The merger is the latest in a flurry of transactions in financial information and data analytics;Data providers Markit and IHS are to combine in a $13bn stock deal to create a financial and corporate information powerhouse to challenge Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters.The merger is the largest in a wave of takeover activity among market intelligence companies over the past two years, bringing together Markit’s proprietary credit market data with IHS, which is best known for its energy, commodity and transportation sector analysis.Shareholders in US-based IHS will own 57 per cent of the combined company, while investors in London-headquartered Markit will hold the remainder.It will also allow IHS to relocate its corporate tax base to the UK, in a politically controversially manouevre known as a tax inversion. A feature of the boom in mergers and acquisitions, the move allows a US company to capture a lower tax rate by using a takeover to move its domicile overseas.IHS said some operations would remain in Englewood, Colorado, where it is based, but added that its anticipated tax rate would be in the “low-to-mid 20 per cent range” after the deal.For Markit and its founder Lance Uggla, the deal is the latest step in its remarkable rise from a start-up formed by a group of credit derivatives traders at TD Securities in 2001 from a shed in St Albans, the leafy London commuter belt town.After Markit listed in New York in 2014, it intensified a hunt for further acquisitions, but its most recent effort failed in October after a last-second bid by Intercontinental Exchange during a $5bn battle for Interactive Data Corp, a valuer of illiquid credit products.Talks between Mr Uggla and Jerre Stead, chairman and chief executive of IHS, intensified soon after that, according to people close to talks.“Markit is perfect for IHS. It’s not anchored to a specific desktop product in the way that Bloomberg or Reuters are, so it won’t be hit by the cost cuts taking place at banks,” said one person close to the deal.The companies said they expected cost savings to be as much as $125m within three years of closing. The merger is also a bet that Markit will be able to write new products to sell to banks with access to IHS’s data.If successful, the companies intend to use future cash flow to make further acquisitions in attempt to challenge larger rivals such as Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. The companies added that they would repurchase $1bn in shares in 2017 and 2018.Mr Stead, who will be chairman and CEO at IHS Markit until his retirement at the end of 2017, said: “In all my years of business experience, including leading seven public companies and serving on 35 public company boards, I have never seen a transaction with as much value-creation potential as with this merger.”“At the heart of our shared vision is the opportunity to offer our customers a broader and richer content set through both existing and new products that will support their critical decision making and manage regulatory change,” said Mr Uggla, who will serve as president until Mr Stead’s retirement and then assume his chairman and CEO roles.A new 11-member board will include six IHS representatives and five from Markit. The deal is structured so that IHS shareholders will receive 3.5566 common shares in IHS Markit for each share they own.Shares in Markit jumped 10.7 per cent to $32.64 just after midday in New York, while IHS climbed 6.7 per cent to $118.13.At least one adviser, not involved in the deal, suggested Markit might be a more natural takeover target for ICE, which has said publicly that it is considering a rival bid for the London Stock Exchange Group. There is a break fee amounting to 3.5 per cent of each company’s market capitalisation at the time of signing the deal.Other big acquisitions in the market data space over the past year include Bloomberg’s £520m purchase of Barclays’ index benchmarking business, Verisk Analytics’ agreement to buy Wood Mackenzie for £1.9bn, and McGraw Hill Financial’s $2.2bn deal for SNL Financial.IHS was advised by M Klein and Company, a boutique bank founded by former Citigroup dealmaker Michael Klein, and Goldman Sachs. Markit was advised by JPMorgan Chase.
103;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-21T12:14:21Z;Algo rules could catch commodities trades;Regulators’ efforts to tighten up on high-speed trading have wider reach;Olam is nobody’s idea of a high-frequency trading firm. The Singapore-based agricultural commodities merchant grows almonds, processes cocoa and deals bales of cotton.But Olam worries it may soon be classed alongside the world’s fastest market participants as the US government tightens controls on computerised trading. That is because it uses automated systems to trade futures. “Requiring a human interface in all instances in the 21st century trading environment is impractical,” Olam’s chief compliance counsel wrote to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week.Olam’s comment reveals the extent to which automated trading has spread beyond the high-speed trading firms of Chicago. More than 70 per cent of all futures trading is now automated, according to Tim Massad, CFTC chairman. So it was no surprise that letters came from far and wide ahead of last week’s deadline on Regulation Automated Trading, the CFTC’s plan to create a more defined risk and trading regime for all futures contracts traded using algorithms on US exchanges. Mr Massad’s goal of completing the rule this year will be tested by critics. Automated systems have occasionally set off earthquakes, as when an algorithm’s massive sales of S&P 500 stock index futures reverberated in stock markets during the “ flash crash” of May 2010. “There is a real risk that can happen when operational systems malfunction. It’s appropriate to have safeguards around those systems,” Sebastian Pujol Schott, associate director of the CFTC’s market oversight division, told last week’s annual meeting of FIA, the futures industry group. The proposed rule would impose new obligations on market participants. Automated traders would for the first time have to register with the commission if they trade directly on an exchange. CTC Trading Group, a Chicago-based proprietary trading firm, said most of the CFTC’s recommended risk controls had already been adopted by the industry and that exchanges, not the commission, should oversee traders. “It is the primary business of exchanges to stay abreast of state of the art technology, acquire a deep knowledge of the characteristics of market participants, and recognise and nimbly respond to new risks in the marketplace,” wrote Eric Chern, CTC chief executive. Likewise, the National Grain and Feed Association warned that grain merchants could wind up being required to register as automated traders, as some have invested in direct exchange access “simply to attempt to respond to the speed of today’s marketplace”. Exchanges and FIA raised questions about a CFTC provision which would require exchanges to have tools to prevent a firm from trading with itself. Such trading can be illegal if it is intentional. CME Group, the exchange group, said that the percentage of self-trades was less than 0.2 per cent of its total volume, while Intercontinental Exchange — which mandated self-trading blockers for proprietary traders since 2013 — said the proportion was even less. “These numbers clearly signify that the impermissible self-trading the proposal seeks to prevent is an inconsequential portion of the market,” CME said. The rule would also enable the CFTC to examine proprietary traders’ computer “source code” without a subpoena — a prospect that horrifies traders. Citadel, the Chicago hedge fund, compared code to a secret recipe. “Disclosure of a firm’s source code to other market participants would reveal not only the firm’s current investment portfolio, but also its expected future trading activity, exposing its most sensitive proprietary information and leaving it defenceless against the rest of the market,” it said in its letter. Chris Zuehlke of DRW Trading, a big Chicago trader, said source code was “how we make our money”. He warned an audience at the FIA meeting that Reg AT’s source code language as proposed “may not jibe with the fourth amendment”, the US constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. To overcome the issues, some are looking at examples from Europe, which has gone further than its US counterpart in crafting tighter rules for automated and high-speed trading.Many of the rules proposed by the CFTC are similar but there are nuanced differences. While both the US and EU also focus on testing and pre- and post-trade risk management, the US is unique in wanting traders to store their source code and make it available to regulators. Jaffray Woodriff, chief executive of Quantitative Investment Management, a commodity trading adviser with $2.2bn in assets under management, called for the US regulator to follow Europe’s approach in making a clear distinction between algorithms used for investment and those used in more automated trading. The former tend to be entered into trading systems by a human and present less systemic risk, he argued.
104;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-18T00:01:48Z;ICE shakes up scandal-hit Libor;Intercontinental Exchange seeks to restore confidence in benchmark rate;The new administrators of Libor are overhauling the way it is calculated, reducing its reliance on banker estimates in an attempt to restore faith in the scandal-hit rate.US markets operator Intercontinental Exchange took over administration of the London Interbank Offered Rate in 2014 after a global investigation found traders were influencing the daily rate calculations to benefit their own books.The 30-year-old rate has traditionally been calculated by averaging daily estimates of short-term interbank borrowing rates supplied by bank employees. But a 2012 regulatory review found the rate “not fit for purpose” and a series of banks paid more than $9bn in fines in the manipulation scandal.Now ICE is planning to root the daily rate in market transactions “to the greatest extent possible”. It will use a “waterfall” process that starts with transactions, but relies more on human estimates when the volume of trading falls.This shift to transactions is made possible by expanding the calculation beyond bank-to-bank lending. The new calculation will also include short-term funding that comes from central banks, corporations, non-bank financial institutions and other counterparties.“It’s which data are relevant, how it’s used — that’s prescribed by us and published to all users,” said Finbarr Hutcheson, president of the ICE Benchmark Administration. “That was a complete black hole before. Now it’s explicit to all users, what the banks do and how they do it,” he added.ICE said the decision to include non-bank lending reflects the fall in interbank lending. “The banks have consciously reduced their exposure to other banks and the regulators have been pushing very hard for banks to get longer term and more secure funding, from sources that are less likely to chop and change their behaviour from day to day,” said Mr Hutcheson.Over time, ICE hopes to develop a computer process that could calculate Libor without human estimates, even when transaction volumes are low.“The next generation would be ‘just give us the trades, we’ll work out the algorithm’,” said Mr HutchesonThe changes are the result of 18 months of consultation with regulators, central banks and market participants around the world. ICE says that it has received legal advice that the changes to Libor would not affect existing contracts and are “unlikely to give rise to issues of legal continuity”.ICE administers three UK-regulated benchmarks including London’s century-old gold fix, which it replaced with a new electronic system in late 2014.
105;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-16T08:43:43Z;Exchange merger set to raise temperatures in Florida;Fallout from deal will fuel consolidation considerations at global derivatives industry gathering;"The redrawing of the global exchange landscape and its potential fallout is set to dominate the agenda as the global derivatives industry gathers in Florida this week.The announcement of London Stock Exchange Group’s merger with Deutsche Börse — the market’s biggest deal in many years— is likely to add further spice to its biggest annual gathering, the Futures Industry Association conference.The event has long had a history as a hotbed of dealmaking as senior exchange executives mingle with each other and their main users such as hedge funds, asset managers and high-frequency traders, as well as bankers and lawyers.After years spent fretting about industry profitability, customer protections and the impact of new markets and capital rules, executives have seen their world upended in recent weeks.News of the LSE-Deutsche Börse merger to create a European champion was followed by indications that US group Intercontinental Exchange could launch a rival bid; the German group also exited the US options market by agreeing to sell a subsidiary to Nasdaq for $1.1bn.On a smaller scale, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing and SGX, the Singapore exchange, are circling London-based Baltic Exchange, a critical utility in the global shipping market.“The question for us is whether we’re at a turning point in the industry,” said Carl Gilmore, president of Integritas Financial Consultancy and former co-head of Wedbush Securities. “There aren’t many big deals left to try. It feels like everyone is getting their ducks in a row before we see real competition in global trading.”Yet this year the biggest action is taking place 3,000 miles away with the LSE and Deutsche Börse formally unveiling their merger. Many London-based bankers have been restricted from travelling to the event to finalise the deal.“It is on everyone’s mind and it’s not just a European issue . . . it’s a global exchange issue,” said Richard Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill.The two groups have confirmed that London will be the location for the holding company and the German exchange’s Carsten Kengeter will take on the mantle of chief executive. However, customers and rivals are keen to see the impact on trading and whether any unwanted assets might become available.Besides ICE, CME Group has also been linked with a bid for one of the two European companies. Both managements will be there although few expect even the merest of details to emerge officially. Adviser chaperones are “shutting down any question even remotely connected to exchange consolidation”, said one banker.The conference, now in its 41st year, has played many supporting roles in the history of the market. In 2007 Intercontinental Exchange launched an unsolicited bid for the Chicago Board of Trade, which had already agreed to a merger with the CME, by slipping an offer under the hotel door of the-then CBOT chairman.Five years later the London Metal Exchange held discussions with a range of potential bidders in the bar in full view of other suitors, in an effort to draw out other offers. That finished with HKEx as the winner six months later, paying £1.38bn to beat ICE to the deal."
106;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-10T17:49:02Z;Nasdaq shares fall after deal to buy options business ISE;The $1.1bn acquisition is the exchange’s largest in nearly a decade;Investors greeted Nasdaq’s deal to buy International Securities Exchange, the US options business of Deutsche Börse, with some scepticism on Thursday, sending Nasdaq’s shares down as much as 3.5 per cent.The acquisition for $1.1bn in cash and debt is the largest for the US exchanges operator in nearly a decade and will extend its leading share in the highly competitive US options market.It comes as Deutsche Börse is closing in on a merger with the London Stock Exchange Group, although Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange has signalled that it may make a bid to try to break up the deal. Chicago’s CME Group has also been linked with bids for its two European rivals.The deal gives Nasdaq about 40 per cent of the market for US equities options where more than a dozen exchanges fight for business. ISE operates three equity options markets with a combined market share of 15 per cent. Nasdaq said bringing the two options businesses together will mean more competitive pricing in the industry.“The main concern here is that this is the options market and, at the end of the day, it has been very competitive,” said Ashley Serrao, market structure analyst at Credit Suisse. “Other competitors are on the horizon who may be entering the space and are we going to trigger a price war.”Rivals are competing over a shrinking pie. Options volume in 2015 totalled 4.14bn contracts, a 2.9 per cent decrease from 2014, even as volatility returned to the stock market, according to Tabb Group.Mr Serrao said these concerns were somewhat mitigated by the potential to exceed cost savings projected in the deal, which Nasdaq targets to be at least $40m on an annualised basis by the time the deal closes in 18 months.At midday in New York, Nasdaq shares were down about 1.5 per cent.The purchase is Nasdaq’s biggest acquisition since it bought Nordic stock market operator OMX for $3.7bn in 2007.Nasdaq said that it did not expect the deal to have a significant effect on its leverage, dividend or share buyback programmes, but some analysts were unconvinced.The deal will raise Nasdaq’s leverage to 3.1 times gross debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation, but the company has put a priority on reducing that to 2.3x to 2.7x.Nasdaq “has a strong history of deleveraging and we expect it to reach its target within a year of transaction closure, but until then we do not expect any meaningful shares repurchases”, said Peter Lenardos, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a note.The exchanges operator suspended share buybacks in 2013 when its leverage rose after acquisitions, but resumed them the following year.As part of the deal Nasdaq will double its stake in The Options Clearing Corporation, the world’s largest equity derivatives clearing corporation, to 40 per cent. The deal excludes Deutsche Börse’s stake in Bats Global Markets, the exchanges operator, and Digital Asset Holdings, a US blockchain start-up.
107;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-09T23:58:54Z;D Börse sells ISE options unit to Nasdaq;Deal comes as German group closes in on merger with London Stock Exchange;Deutsche Börse has agreed to sell the International Securities Exchange, its US options business, to rival Nasdaq for $1.1bn, as global exchanges swap assets in an industry shake-up.The deal will extend Nasdaq’s leading share of the highly competitive US options market, in which more than a dozen exchanges fight for business. ISE operates three equity options markets with a combined market share of 15 per cent.The move comes as Deutsche Börse is closing in on a merger with the London Stock Exchange Group, although Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange has signalled that it may make a bid to try to break up the deal. Chicago’s CME Group has also been linked with bids for its two European rivals.The ISE sale will mean a loss for Deutsche Börse which paid $2.8bn in 2008. However, the German group has already taken impairment charges of more than €800m on its investments after a downturn in trading after the financial crisis.“We are pursuing the goal to become the number one or two player in every business in which we operate. This goal requires an active management of our business portfolio,” said Carsten Kengeter, chief executive of Deutsche Börse. “In areas where we are not able to meet this goal, we are evaluating other options.”Deutsche Börse said it expected to register a gain of hundreds of millions of euros with the deal.The transaction will give Nasdaq a market share of around 40 per cent in a battle with Bats Global Markets and the CBOE.“We are number one with respect to market share [in US equity options],” said Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive. “For us to extend that lead, that …is a great opportunity.”We are pursuing the goal to become the number one or two player in every business in which we operate …In areas where we are not able to meet this goal, we are evaluating other optionsMr Greifeld said Nasdaq had had its eye on the ISE for several years but that it became “actionable” in the past few months. The sale was not conditional on the LSE-Deutsche Börse deal going through, he said.Nasdaq will pay with a mix of debt and cash, but does not expect the deal to have a significant effect on its leverage, dividend or share buyback programmes.The deal will yield at least $40m of annualised cost savings within 18 months of closing in the second half of the year.The acquisition is Nasdaq’s largest in nearly a decade. It bought Nordic stock market operator OMX for $3.7bn in 2007.As part of the deal Nasdaq will double its stake in The Options Clearing Corporation, the world’s largest equity derivatives clearing corporation, to 40 per cent. The deal excludes Deutsche Börse’s stake in Bats Global Markets, the exchanges operator, and Digital Asset Holdings, a US blockchain start-up.Perella Weinberg advised Deutsche Borse on the deal.
108;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-09T22:02:49Z;Nasdaq to buy options operator ISE for $1.1bn;;Nasdaq OMX Group on Wednesday revealed plans to buy an options exchange operator from Deutsche Börse for $1.1bn as its ramps up its exposure to the derivatives market.The purchase of the International Securities Exchange gives New York-based Nasdaq control over three electronic options exchanges that account for 15 per cent of US options trading, the exchange operator said.“The equities options business has been core to our long-term strategy, and we believe an essential component to the strength of the Nasdaq franchise,” said Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive.Exchange operators, including Nasdaq rival IntercontinentalExchange, have benefited from the trading of derivatives, which is more lucrative than equities trading.The move also comes as Germany-based Deutsche Börse looks to merge with the London Stock Exchange in a deal that could face tough antitrust challenges.
109;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
110;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-07T13:09:03Z;Investors push bullish oil bets to new record;;Hedge funds and money managers increased their bets on a higher oil price to a new record.Weekly futures and options data from InterContinental Exchange published on Monday showed they increased their net long positions in Brent crude by 22,171 lots to 342,460 for the week to March 1. This is the highest since records began in 2011, reports Anjli Raval, oil and gas correspondent.Prices have rebounded since hitting 2003 lows of below $30 a barrel in January. On Monday, prices rose 59 cents to $39.31 a barrel by 1pm London time.“More and more speculative financial investors are jumping on the bandwagon, thereby reinforcing the upward trend,” said analysts at Commerzbank.Oil market sentiment has improved on the back of chatter about a meeting of Opec and non-Opec prouducer countries in the next several weeks. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela agreed last month to freeze their output at January levels providing other producers joined them, in an effort to tackle the global oversupply.Additionally, US crude production dropped for a sixth consecutive week in the week ending in February 26, to just over 9m b/d, the lowest level since November 2014, according to US government data. The number of rigs drilling for oil in the US has continued to decline.“US shale producers continue to pull rigs from the ground in an effort to conserve capital,” said analysts at ANZ.Speculators unwound bearish bets in US crude West Texas Intermediate as anxiety about the prospect of $20 a barrel oil eased.Hedge funds reduced their short positions in the week ended March 1 by 25,639 contracts of futures and options to 150,718, according to US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. This was the fastest pace since April.
111;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-04T07:19:53Z;LSE reiterates case for Deutsche Börse tie-up;;The London Stock Exchange is putting on a handsome display while it is circled by potential suitors, with its results for the whole of 2015 boasting a hefty rise in revenues and profits.LSE chief Xavier Rolet says today that a proposed merger with German counterpart Deutsche Börse, which has been a live possibility since the end of last month, represents a “compelling opportunity to strengthen each other.” There was no mention of the potential rival bid from Intercontinental Exchange.It said:The combination of LSE and Deutsche Börse’s complementary growth strategies, products, services and geographic footprint would be expected to deliver an enhanced ability to provide a full service offering to customers on a global basis. LSEG and Deutsche Börse believe that the potential merger would offer the prospect of enhanced growth, significant customer benefits… as well as substantial revenue and cost synergies and increased shareholder value.All key businesses of LSEG and Deutsche Börse would continue to operate under their current brand names. The existing regulatory framework of all regulated entities within the Combined Group would remain unchanged, subject to customary and final regulatory approvals.While talks with Deutsche Börse rumble on, the LSE says “one thing is certain – we remain committed to delivering enhanced service and products for our customers and value for our shareholders.”On that note, it today reported a 78 per cent rise in total revenues, to £2.28bn, with information and technology services leading the pace of growth while revenues from post-trade services dipped somewhat. Adjusted pre-tax profits rose by 31 per cent to £643.4m.
112;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-03T10:34:47Z;ICE move for LSE could include spin-off of Borsa Italiana;US exchange’s potential bid may involve the divestitures of Italian and French businesses;A potential bid by Intercontinental Exchange for the London Stock Exchange Group could include spinning off the UK company’s Italian business and French clearing arm, say two people familiar with the matter.The Atlanta-based group is exploring divestitures of two eurozone-based assets as it considers launching an offer to rival an all-share merger that the LSE is working on with Deutsche Börse, the German group.The US company this week confirmed it was considering an offer for the LSE but had neither decided nor approached the UK group. A move would dramatically solidify its position running a powerhouse for derivatives trading in London, one of the world's biggest hubs for off-exchange markets. ICE already owns futures trading, clearing and data businesses in the City.If it bids, ICE may expand on plans being considered by the LSE and Deutsche Börse to spin off the French arm of clearing house LCH.Clearnet, say people familiar with the discussions. ICE may also dispose of Borsa Italiana, which the LSE bought for €1.6bn in 2007. The latter comprises equities, derivatives trading and post-trade businesses.The LSE is already considering spinning off Paris-based Clearnet SA, said those familiar with the talks. ICE declined to comment.A spin-off would echo ICE’s treatment of Euronext, the owner of the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon exchanges. ICE bought it as part of its $11.2bn deal for NYSE Euronext in 2012 but included plans to float Euronext. The value of the shares, listed in Paris, has doubled during its 21 months as an independent company.A move by ICE for the LSE would focus on capturing LCH.Clearnet, the largest clearer of interest rate derivatives, say people familiar with the talks. The group would, like Deutsche Börse, look to offer banks and investors billions of dollars of savings, reducing margin costs of trading by netting them under one organisation.Selling Borsa Italiana as well as Clearnet SA would also help ICE finance a move for the LSE.Rich Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill and Partner in New York, said: “Based on various assumptions, including the Deutsche Börse deal price, we think ICE can generally do a deal for the LSE at a slight premium to where it’s currently trading, but much above that would require divestitures or other creative financing.”Some users have been concerned that change of ownership at LCH may reduce competition for derivatives clearing in the market. Michael Spencer, chief executive of ICAP, the interdealer broker, said: “We need clarification on whether ICE would maintain LCH as an open-access clearing platform.”The disposal of eurozone-based assets is likely to interest Euronext, which is working on a strategic plan under Stephane Boujnah, the new chief executive, to increase revenues. Clearnet SA is its main clearing house. It also has more cash than debt.Putting Clearnet SA under the control of a Eurozone-based business would be an attempt to allay concerns about regulation if the UK votes to leave the EU this year. It would keep the euro-dominated business under the supervision of the European Central Bank.www.ft.com/tradingroom
113;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-01T21:57:14Z;ICE interest pours cold water on LSE-DB love-in;US group could trigger counterbid with cold, hard cash attached;Special relationship or ever closer union? The choice between a transatlantic or European partnership recurs in British politics and could be posed in financial form as Intercontinental Exchange of the US considers a bid for the London Stock Exchange. That would likely kill off a nil-premium merger between LSE and Deutsche Börse.LSE investors should be grateful for the intervention of ICE, owner of the venerable New York Stock Exchange. The merger looks like a takeover on the cheap to some of them. Popular LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet was to stand down, leaving DB’s relatively untried Carsten Kengeter to run the combined group and investors in DB with 54 per cent of the shares.Now there is the prospect of a takeover battle, spiced up by the complexity of the UK’s forthcoming Brexit referendum. The poll has been interpreted as shark deterrent and helpful to the proposed LSE-DB merger. ICE founder and chief executive Jeff Sprecher appears inclined to call that bluff.ICE will have to work out whether it is willing to shoulder the risk of bidding for LSE when the value of the company might be reduced by hostile European financial regulation in the wake of Brexit. If euro-denominated securities clearing was restricted to the eurozone, it could, however, route the business through its Holland Clearing House. Antitrust objections would probably be on a par with those facing DB-LSE.ICE, which has an effective tax rate of about 21 per cent, according to S&P CIQ, might also contemplate a tax inversion. This would help the group finance a decent cash component in its offer for LSE. ICE’s net debt is on the steep side at three times historic earnings before nasties, though expected to drop with the integration of previous acquisitions.DB and LSE have doubtless been working up a synergies number that is both credible and big enough to persuade sceptical investors of the benefits of a merger. This may now prove to be of little use except in supporting a share component in a counterbid from DB that also includes cold, hard cash.It appears that Google’s driverless cars are like flesh-and-blood drivers: deeply fallible yet convinced that their skills surpass those of other road users.Last week, one of the vehicles pulled out into the path of a bus in California in the belief that the bus driver would slow down. When do they ever? Buses are big and heavy. This gives them a right of way over all other road users, apart from black Range Rover Discoveries doing the school run in Battersea.The driverless car crash has been attributed to deficient “road etiquette programming”, which is a good example of how fancy terminology can make a stupid decision sound less stupid. Google says that the car confronted a “tricky set of circumstances”. That could happen to anyone. Lombard once reversed into a bollard while attempting to placate an infant by putting on a Wind in the Willows CD.The autonomous vehicles have had several prior crashes, but Google says they were never at fault, which is uncanny. Because all bangs, scrapes and collisions suffered by Lombard have been the fault of other drivers, too.Driverless technology may be achieving human levels of self-belief. Where it will struggle is in simulating theory of mind. This is the ability to intuit thoughts and feelings to others. We expect a young man in a pimped hatch back to drive differently to a granny in a Fiesta. Blue neon underlighting and a filling-rattling sound system are danger signals that it still takes a human driver to pick up.Michael Dobson, who is to step down, has become a City landmark in his 14 years as chief executive at Schroders. As determinedly old-fashioned as anything Lutyens built, he has towered over flashier fund managers. His career has been buttressed by traditional virtues of discretion and client service and a close relationship with the Schröder family, which controls 48 per cent of the company.Mr Dobson’s disinclination to leave earlier resulted in heir apparent Peter Harrison acquiring the nickname “the Prince of Wales”. Dobbo is at least as posh as the Queen, if not quite as elevated as the better class of French maitre d’hotel.On his watch, Schroders shares have produced a total return of about 450 per cent, and assets have risen to almost £300bn. The bulk of this has been achieved without acquisitions, of which Mr Dobson disapproves. He made an exception for Cazenove Capital in 2013. Something to do with that blue-blooded name, maybe?Mr Dobson has a reputation for prickliness. His enjoyment of a joke is a closely guarded secret. Colleagues who fancy tweaking the old lion’s tail as he goes should stage a huge leaving party. If there’s one thing he hates, it’s a fuss.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
114;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-01T19:59:46Z;ICE eyes bid for London Stock Exchange to rival Deutsche Börse deal;US exchange offer would scupper planned ‘merger of equals’ with German operator;European ambitions to establish a dominant exchange to rival the US were thrown into doubt after Intercontinental Exchange said it was considering bidding for the London Stock Exchange, just days after Deutsche Börse revealed friendly merger plans with the UK bourse. ICE, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, said on Tuesday it was looking at a proposal, but had not yet approached the board of the LSE and that “there can be no certainty that any offer will be made”.The LSE is already in advanced talks with Deutsche Börse over a £20bn deal, which would create a globally competitive European champion in derivatives, clearing and financial market data.News of ICE’s interest also fuelled speculation that other leading exchange operators, including Chicago’s CME Group and Hong Kong’s HKeX, could also enter the fray and spark a transatlantic bidding war.“We are in the endgame for the LSE. The question now is how we manage the process,” said one top 10 shareholder in the London bourse.Shares in the LSE soared 7.8 per cent, adding to a recent surge in its stock price and marking the first time the company has been valued at almost £10bn.ICE’s entry could ignite a political storm over who should own the LSE and regulate its activities. A deal with the German bourse would increase London’s prominence as a financial capital, creating a UK-based holding company with dual headquarters in the UK capital and Frankfurt.The LSE said in a statement it had not received a proposal from ICE and that discussions between it and Deutsche Börse were progressing.A takeover by Atlanta-based ICE would hand LSE’s desirable clearing house to the Americans, which bought Liffe, the derivatives exchange, in 2013. The potential deal would also unite two of the world’s most high-profile venues for stock market listings.ICE, which was established in 2000 to challenge the now-defunct energy trader Enron has grown at an astonishing pace under chief executive Jeff Sprecher. The company is now worth $27.8bn after a series of deals, most recently paying $5.2bn for Interactive Data Corp.Shares in ICE were down 4.1 per cent just after midday in New York.Deutsche Börse deliberately launched its bid for the LSE amid the political uncertainty surrounding Britain’s “Brexit” vote to steal a march on US rivals.Under rules guiding UK takeovers, Deutsche Börse has until March 22 to table a firm offer for the LSE or walkaway and ICE has until March 29.“Never to be left out, ICE has taken a half-step forward for the LSE, though there is not much downside to letting the public know of their interest,” said Rich Repetto at Sandler O’Neill.Owen Jones, an analyst at Citigroup, added Deutsche Börse would not want to find itself in a bidding war.“Its balance sheet is stretched already . . . and a revision to its offer would see either a higher proportion of the combined entity go to LSE shareholders, or it would involve an equity raise, we think.”Listen to the podcast2000 — Intercontinental Exchange founded in Atlanta by a group of seven banks and energy companies as an online electronic market to trade over-the-counter energy, metals and other commodities contracts2001 — ICE buys London-based International Petroleum Exchange2005 — Floats on the New York Stock Exchange2007 — Acquires New York Board of Trade, a physical commodities exchange trading futures and options on sugar, cotton, coffee, cocoa and orange juice, in addition to interest rates, currencies.

115;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-01T17:31:52Z;ICE may have to make hefty offer in potential bid for LSE;LSE purchase would make the US group London’s dominant market infrastructure;If as expected Intercontinental Exchange launches a bid for the London Stock Exchange Group, it would mark a return to the city that is one of the pillars of the US company’s $30bn empire.Executives and analysts alike say the LSE is officially “in play” after it revealed last week it was in talks about an all-share “merger of equals” with Deutsche Börse. On Tuesday ICE indicated it too may make a bid. “The LSE is a pretty hot target and is a massive foothold in European financial markets. Now the LSE is in play you can’t afford not to be a bidder,” said Niki Beattie, head of Market Structure Partners, a consultancy.From the outset the 16-year old ICE has looked to the UK capital to help give its business scale, purchasing assets such as the International Petroleum Exchange and Liffe, whose names have disappeared under the ICE brand.However, Atlanta-based ICE faces political and regulatory hurdles and may have to make a hefty offer if it is to walk off with London’s biggest exchange asset.Analysts said that the rationale for a bid is much the same as the one that drives the Deutsche Börse deal. Global regulations have forced banks to place billions of dollars of collateral and margin as insurance to back their derivatives trades. As a result, billions of dollars of capital are being held at clearing houses such as Deutsche Börse’s Eurex, ICE Futures Europe and LCH. Clearnet. Bringing the clearing houses under one roof would allow customers to net their margin for swaps and futures.Ms Beattie, a former bank head of electronic trading, thinks a deal for the LSE will happen after years of unconsummated bids. “I think that’s why the banks won’t lobby against it this time — the cost savings [from netting margins] will be too great for banks exhausted by regulatory issues.”Adding the LSE would make ICE London’s dominant market infrastructure. Besides Liffe and the IPE, it has also bought emissions trading platform Climate Exchange, energy trading platform Trayport and also opened the first new clearing house in London in more than 100 years, in 2008.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, has been a vocal critic of several of Europe’s planned markets regulations, but his interest in the LSE indicates the continent is still his target.However, the LSE and Deutsche Börse have an agreement and have been working for several weeks on getting political and regulatory support from London, Berlin and Brussels. They want to use their deal as a bridge to Europe and help kick-start regional economic growth and lessen the reliance on banks for corporate fundraisings. “The company is continuing its merger talks with LSE with no change,” Deutsche Börse said in a statement.Moody’s, the credit rating agency, said an LSE-Deutsche Börse tie-up would be positive for bondholders and a credible rival to CME and ICE, “albeit at lower relative margins”.But ICE’s approach came as investors began to anticipate a competing bid, either from ICE or Chicago’s CME Group, the ICE rival that is closely watching developments.LSE shares “had begun to trade above the implied level of the [Deutsche Börse] agreement, after adjusting for dividends,” noted Owen Jones, an analyst at Citigroup.CME is also rumoured to be looking at an approach but declined to comment. People close to the LSE said a US approach would likely be a different type of bid, “with a proper change-of-control premium”.“If we assume 50 per cent of the LSE’s expenses could be eliminated and each transaction was structured as an all-stock deal, we calculate ICE could pay up to £34 while CME could pay up to £44 [for LSE],” said Christopher Harris, an analyst at Wells Fargo.A bidding war would be bad news for Deutsche Börse, Mr Jones said. “Its balance sheet is stretched already, judged on a gross debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation basis . . . and a revision to its offer would see either a higher proportion of the combined entity go to LSE shareholders, or it would involve an equity raise, we think.”Inevitably, the size and diversity of the LSE’s business — from indices, data, clearing and trading, creates potential issues for all bidders. Nevertheless European exchange executives are hoping it could mean parts of the LSE are spun off to ease the deal, such as Clearnet, the French clearing house and Millennium IT, the LSE’s technology business. Euronext, which ICE spun off two years, ago is understood to be interested in purchasing Clearnet.Shareholders, who may be asked to decide between two different bids, may take their lead from Xavier Rolet, the LSE chief executive, who could lose out come what may.“The fact that Xavier wanted to go put a whole different complexion on the [DB] bid. That was very disconcerting for us — disappointing and surprising,” said one top 10 shareholder. “He is the one that knows the market.”Equally, shareholders may see a US bid as more disruptive. “Perhaps that indicates that the proposed merger of equals with two open access derivatives groups, one in London, one in Paris, could be quite compelling,” said Jake Pugh, an independent consultant.Additional reporting by Kate Burgesswww.ft.com/tradingroom
116;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-01T16:15:26Z;London Stock Exchange: the ICE men cometh;A rival bid for the UK stock market would be a straight takeover;"It is always nice to be courted. And the London Stock Exchange often is — no fewer than four different suitors have asked for its hand in marriage in the past 15 years, some more than once. This time is no different.Last week, the LSE and Deutsche Börse confirmed they were in talks. On Tuesday, Intercontinental Exchange said it was considering a bid for LSE. No further detail was provided.A deal involving the LSE and ICE would offer similar attractions as one with Deutsche Börse. It would combine two big clearing houses, which should mean cost savings for both owners and the users. LSE shareholders would gain exposure to Liffe, the derivatives business that they have long coveted, rather than Eurex. And it would bring together two major stock markets. LSE’s index business would also dovetail neatly with Interactive Data, which ICE acquired last year.If the industrial logic of the two deals is broadly similar, then success will come down to price and structure. There could be no pretence that an ICE/LSE combination is a merger of equals; the US company’s market value is double that of its UK target and its earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) are almost three times higher. An ICE bid would be a takeover.Take the company’s 2013 acquisition of NYSE Euronext as a blueprint. The same 37 per cent premium to the undisturbed price would equate to £31.70 a share for the LSE, against Tuesday’s price of £28.60. If ICE structured a bid along the same lines — one-third cash and two-thirds shares — and consolidated the LSE’s borrowings within its own, then its end-December net debt of $6.6bn could easily double (taking it to almost six times ebitda). Its shares trade at a lower multiple of profits than the LSE’s, so a deal may initially dilute earnings.That is not necessarily a reason to demur. ICE has been adept at bringing debt down after previous deals; this strong record means investors may well support a cash call. It is less certain that Deutsche Börse, with a relatively new chief, could do likewise. More radically, it could divest London’s cash equities business, as it did with Euronext, or structure the deal as a tax inversion in order to reduce its tax bill.None of which means ICE holds all the aces. Deutsche Börse could sweeten its own offer. CME Group or Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing could enter the fray. Get set for an intense courtship.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
117;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Jeff Sprecher: exchange dealmaker;Possible bid for LSE by ICE founder and chief shows why he is one of sector’s biggest risk-takers;Jeff Sprecher has rarely seen a deal he does not like — as long as it has the potential to disrupt.By considering making a bid for the London Stock Exchange Group, the founder and chief executive of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has once again demonstrated why he is one of the biggest risk-takers in the world of exchanges.Few could have imagined that an Atlanta-based businessman who started his career in electricity generation in California in the 1980s would end up as the owner of the venerable New York Stock Exchange.Exchanges — long seen as stuffy, slow-moving businesses — were run until not so long ago by their members, not by profit-driven dealmakers. ICE was founded as an obscure online gas and power trading platform in 2000.But in late 2012 Mr Sprecher pounced on NYSE Euronext, the then owner of the Wall Street icon. His aim? To get hold of the lucrative, London-based derivatives trading platform known as Liffe, then owned by the US-based group.That deal followed an even bolder — ultimately unsuccessful — move to break up an attempted combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse. While that saw Mr Sprecher team up with Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, the ICE chief has never embraced the clubby world of exchange leaders. He is nobody’s friend across a boardroom table.“We spend every day fighting with CME Group, [ICE’s main US rival], working out how to bash them over the head . . . if Nasdaq want to join the market, we’ll see them outside,” Mr Sprecher once said.Five years earlier, Mr Sprecher launched an audacious bid for the Chicago Board of Trade — which was in talks with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange — by slipping an envelope with his offer under the hotel room door of the CBOT’s then chairman while the two were attending an industry event in Florida.While Mr Sprecher’s strategy has seemed opportunistic — even pugilistic — it has always been driven by a keen understanding of market structures. His chess moves have been a powerful driver of change in the derivatives and clearing business, and he has negotiated the shifting sands of post-crisis global regulation nimbly, often outwitting the CME with its roots in Chicago’s storied futures trading markets.That has allowed Mr Sprecher to amass 11 exchanges and seven clearing houses in a portfolio that makes ICE the dominant global operator in key financial products that influence everything from the crude oil price and the price of jet fuel used in aircraft, to credit default swaps and the price of soft commodities such as coffee and cotton.Yet while Mr Sprecher has been one of the most opportunistic and active consolidators in the exchange industry, the 61-year old native of Wisconsin has always been the ultimate industry outsider.He rose to prominence not from an exchange, nor at one of the investment banks from which exchanges typically recruit their chief executives these days.Instead, Mr Sprecher ran a power generation business for 17 years before persuading a group of Wall Street banks to fund an online power trading platform designed to compete with the now-defunct Enron.He and his wife live in Atlanta, preferring charity work and a quiet social life in the city to the glitzy potential of New York and London. The pair can often be found meeting friends at a favoured steak restaurant in the city’s Buckhead district. Watches and fast cars are among his passions.Nor does Mr Sprecher indulge in other common routines of the C-suite — such as regular exercise. “My work is my gym,” he once said.Whether Mr Sprecher proceeds with a bid for the LSE — and succeeds in breaking up the planned deal with its German partner — may be unclear. But judging from his record, the temptation to press the “disrupt” button may just be too great.
118;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-01T14:17:13Z;Boom time for exchange options trading;Human factor being reduced as the market embraces an electronic approach;Investors and traders are increasingly buying and selling options on futures contracts for managing their portfolios, rather than spending precious cash reserves, spurring a boom in activity for the sector.Along with other areas of finance, technological change and deep-seated structural reform is sweeping through the listed options market.For many investors, the use of options represents a cheaper and more flexible method of altering their portfolio exposure to various asset classes, without moving the market price against themselves.Option contracts provide investors with the ability to pay an insurance-like premium that can protect their portfolios against changes in asset prices within a defined period.Sellers of options receive the premium and are required to pay out should the underlying market price move in favour of the buyer.“For the most part, regulatory reserve requirements for options on futures contracts are lower than for regular futures contracts,” says Andy Nybo, partner and global head of research at Tabb Group, a capital markets consultancy.“For example, asset managers seeking to effect rebalancing programs will have greater costs when purchasing a basket of underlying equities or bonds in terms of fees and market slippage.”The use of options has long followed activity in futures contracts — however, that relationship has been subverted in the last year.Electronic options volumes on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, including trading in the vast eurodollar interest rate options market, has climbed 15 per cent to more than 1.4m contracts a day.In January alone, the numbers soared 37 per cent year on year to an average 4.3m contracts per day, marking an acceleration of a trend across other exchanges in recent years.“That mix — always goes up and down, but this is something that I have never seen in my 36-year history to see the options growth outpace the futures growth,” said Terry Duffy, executive chairman of CME Group on a recent analyst call.Options on futures contracts in all instruments — interest rates, energy and equities — have seen a compound annual growth rate of 12.8 per cent since 2009, according to Tabb Group.Options markets have long been a haven for the human trader, as the instruments entail a greater complexity than other markets — like Black-Scholes modelling — and are often only part of a trade that can include many components.But inexpensive computer software that is able to crunch vast quantities of data has reduced the human factor.As the market embraces an electronic approach, traders across the world can transact outside of regular US business hours.Indeed, electronic trading on CME and Intercontinental Exchange accounted for 56 per cent of total trading in the first nine months of last year, up from just 18 per cent in 2009.In turn, greater activity also begets more options trades, bolstering growth within the sector.“Synthetic long futures requires two option positions [long call and short put] in order to establish the same exposure. More complex option structures would just enhance the pattern,” says one options trader in Chicago.The effect of the Basel capital rules on banks’ balance sheets is beginning to have an effect on the market. Increased electronic market activity is encouraging new market makers to sidestep banks and quote to wholesale counterparties.Start-ups like Akuna Capital, XTX Markets and Dash Financial are beginning to move in alongside bigger and more established options trading firms like Spot Trading and Wolverine Trading.But whether that means that the market is replacing the role historically taken on by banks’ market-making desks is another question.Thomson Reuters says there are equally radical changes on bank-dominated foreign exchange markets. Trades on its options platform between banks and their customers soared 166 per cent last year to record volumes. The number of market makers on its dealer-to-client venue rose 38 per cent last year to 36.It attributes the growth to scandals over the FX market and Libor lending rates, together with tougher requirements that force both banks and fund managers to show they got the best price for their trade.“Over the past two years, banks have reached the point where they can make an electronic price,” says Phil Weisberg, global head of FX, rates and credit at Thomson Reuters. “Customers are at the point where many need to compare prices from more than one source.”He argues that the rising numbers are not representative of overall OTC market volumes, but that “there are more exchange things happening, it’s more automated”.While liquidity and pricing may change, off-exchange markets may remain different. “People using exchanges are alternative market makers,” says Mr Weisberg. “Trading listed versus OTC is very different. Corporate hedgers would prefer an OTC transaction.”

With oil prices showing signs of stabilisation, shares in Anglo American and BHP Billiton moved up 4.2 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively.But the leader of the pack is the LSE itself, now up by 7.5 per cent, after the Intercontinental Exchange confirmed it is pondering whether to submit a bid for the UK group to rival Deutsche Börse’s.At the other end of the spectrum is Barclays, down by 11 per cent after the UK bank cut its dividend by more than half in 2016 and 2017 to boost its capital buffer, and Ashtead, down by 14 per cent.

121;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-03-01T08:18:06Z;ICE confirms potential rival bid for LSE;;Intercontinental Exchange confirmed on Tuesday it is considering making a bid for smaller rival London Stock Exchange Group and breaking up the UK group’s planned merger with Deutsche Börse.The US group said it was considering making a bid but “no approach has been made to the board of London Stock Exchange Group, and no decision has yet been made as to whether to pursue such an offer”, writes Philip Stafford.It added that:There can be no certainty that any offer will be madeThe story was first reported by Bloomberg. The news comes amid growing speculation that either ICE or its big US rival CME Group was considering a rival offer to that of Deutsche Börse, which is set to be in the form of an “all-share merger of equals”.“Neither comes as a huge surprise,” said Owen Jones, an analyst at Citigroup. “The LSE is an asset that has received rival bids before and, despite the Brexit risk, it is a sought after asset.”However Mr Jones said that Deutsche Börse would not want to find itself in a bidding war:Its balance sheet is stretched already…and a revision to its offer would see either a higher proportion of the combined entity go to LSE shareholders, or it would involve an equity raise, we think.A move by ICE for the LSE would also see the US group again return to London for a high-profile deal.ICE chief executive Jeff Sprecher has frequently purchased the city’s financial market infrastructure as he has built ICE over the last 17 years, including the International Petroleum Exchange in 2001, Liffe, the London derivatives exchange in 2013, and Trayport, the energy trading platform last year.Purchasing the LSE, would, like for Deutsche Börse, allow ICE to offer investors billions of dollars of savings on their derivatives trades.Global regulations have forced more deals to be backed by collateral and margin as insurance.As a result, billions of dollars of capital are being held at clearing houses such as Deutsche Börse’s Eurex, ICE Futures Europe and LCH.Clearnet. However, bringing them under one roof would allow customers to net their margin for swaps and futures.ICE is currently integrating its $5.2bn purchase of Interactive Data Corp, which it bought at the end of December. However it may receive a windfall in coming months from its 12.5 per cent stake in Cetip, a Brazilian fixed income clearing house. Brazil’s BM&F Bovespa may return with a bid for Cetip in coming days. ICE paid $512m for the holding, although took a $190m impairment charge two years ago.Shares in LSE are up 7.8 per cent at publication time to £28.71.
122;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-02-12T03:04:50Z;BATS Global Markets withdraws support for IEX exchange push;Exchange operator claims start-up trading venue misrepresented the operations of other traders;BATS Global Markets has withdrawn its support for efforts by IEX, the start-up trading venue, to become a registered exchange, in the latest sign that the fracas over IEX’s application shows no sign of dying down.In a letter submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, BATS claimed that IEX has repeatedly misrepresented the operations of other exchanges to preserve aspects of its own business that may not meet the legal requirements for a registered exchange.The second-largest US exchange operator said it had “serious concerns about entrusting a registered national securities exchange licence — a licence which conveys self-regulatory and quasi-governmental authority — to an applicant whose repeated misrepresentations of facts to the SEC and the public …call into question the applicant’s professional judgment”.BATS argued that IEX had falsely characterised parts of BATS’ business as well as that of rivals Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange either deliberately or by not doing enough homework to verify its claims. It also said IEX has launched “a public relations campaign” of similar distortions and “gross omissions of fact” about its own business.Brad Katsuyama, chief executive of IEX, responded: “IEX will vigorously defend our market, even if it means pointing out double-standards, duplicity and other practices that harm regular investors. It is clear that any exchange that prioritises and sells speed will seek to block a new entrant that is creating a level playing field.“When you compare the broad support that IEX has received to the narrow interests of exchanges and certain high-speed traders, it has never been more obvious why true competition is needed in the US stock market.”IEX’s bid to become an exchange has sparked a heated debate in the industry with the SEC fielding more than 400 comment letters from both supporters such as asset managers and critics such as NYSE, Nasdaq and the hedge fund Citadel.As chronicled in Flash Boys, the book by Michael Lewis, IEX launched in 2013 as a “dark pool” and marketed itself as a cure for unequal US markets, where ultra-fast traders buy data feeds from exchanges and exploit market movements.IEX will vigorously defend our market, even if it means pointing out double-standards, duplicity and other practices that harm regular investorsA successful exchange application would put IEX on an equal footing with BATS, NYSE and Nasdaq.The linchpin of IEX’s strategy is a 350 microsecond delay it says is to offset advantages enjoyed by high-frequency traders.Some industry participants have argued that the delay could threaten the sanctity of the price quotes from the exchanges that form the basis of official market prices.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange, last week said IEX’s plan to become an exchange was “not fair” because it was in effect seeking an exemption from a federal rule that requires such venues to provide instantaneous price quotes. He also called the plan “un-American”.BATS had previously supported IEX’s application, but opposed the structure of IEX’s affiliated broker-dealer router which is not subject to the 350 microsecond delay.
123;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-02-05T14:00:00Z;Chinese group to buy Chicago Stock Exchange;;The Chicago Stock Exchange, one of America’s oldest stock exchanges, is set to be bought by a group of investors led by China’s Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group, the exchange said on Friday.The buyout, which is subject to US regulatory approval, would mark the first time a Chinese company took control of an American bourse.While the Chicago Stock Exchange accounts for a minuscule amount of trading volume relative to rivals like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market — it processes around 0.5 per cent of US trading volume — it would give Casin a foothold in the American equities market since trades legally need to take place on the exchange offering the best price.Shengju Lu, the founder of the Casin Group, said that the acquisition will help “develop financial markets in China over the longer term and … bring exciting Chinese growth companies to US investors,” writes Adam Samson in New York.China has been gradually opening its markets to outside investors. For instance, it launched the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect in 2014 in a move that paved the way for foreign investors to access Mainland China stocks with fewer restrictions than was previously the case.At the same time, there has been consolidation among US financial exchanges as new regulations in light of the financial crisis have made the trading business less lucrative. The IntercontinentalExchange Group, a derivatives marketplace, for example, bought the parent of the New York Stock Exchange in 2014.John Kerin, the chief executive of the Chicago Stock Exchange, said that it agreed to the sale following a strategic review. The terms of the sale weren’t disclosed.Founded in 1882, the Chicago Stock Exchange is working a new product called CHX|snap an on-demand auction that can be performed during the regular trading session that seeks to pull business back from so-called dark pools, exchanges that are operated by investment banks outside the public market.Mr Kerin said the buyout by Casin would allow the exchange to roll the product out by this spring. The IEX Exchange, another group, has made waves in the exchange marketplace with the introduction of a product that would create a “speed bump” that would slow down high-frequency traders who are accused of exploiting open markets.
124;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-02-04T18:46:39Z;ICE chief calls IEX speed bump plan ‘un-American’;NYSE owner says upstart trading venue is seeking monopoly status;IEX, the upstart stock-dealing venue, is taking an “un-American” approach to slowing down high-speed traders, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange has charged in comments that will further inflame debate over markets.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) said on an earnings call that IEX’s plan to become an exchange is “not fair” because it is in effect seeking an exemption from a federal rule that requires such venues to provide instantaneous price quotes.IEX launched in 2013 as a “dark pool” private trading venue and marketed itself as a cure for unequal US markets, where ultra-fast traders buy data feeds from exchanges and exploit market movements.After gaining fame in Flash Boys, the book by Michael Lewis, IEX has now applied to the US Securities and Exchange Commission to become a registered exchange. That status would allow it to provide equity trading on an equal footing with ICE’s NYSE, Nasdaq and BATS Global Markets.But IEX’s application has drawn fierce opposition because it wants to continue using its much-discussed “speed bump” system. IEX says its 350-microsecond delay, one thousandth of the time it takes to blink an eye, offsets the advantages currently enjoyed by high speed traders.On Thursday, Mr Sprecher said he did not oppose IEX becoming an exchange, but rather the idea of allowing it to use the speed bump without changing the rules for its competitors as well. Current regulations require equity price quotes to be immediately accessible in order to be counted toward the official bid and offer in the market.Mr Sprecher, who is based in Atlanta, blasted what he said would be “a one-off deal that benefits somebody that’s trying to patent and receive a regulated monopoly. I don’t think it’s fair. It is un-American, and it’s not fair and it’s not the way that our system should work.”Mr Sprecher said he supports instead a broad reassessment of rules on equities markets dominated by high-speed and automated strategies.“The ideas that they [IEX] are promulgating are not bad ideas at all. But the method that they’re going about it, we’re objecting to,” Mr Sprecher said. “This is solely for their benefit, not for the benefit of the industry. Frankly, if that were to go forward, IEX would actually hurt the other people in the industry.”But IEX says it believes its speed bump system is allowed by existing rules and that the other exchanges impose their own delays in different ways.“We think it is legal and don’t think we are asking for any special treatment or exemption,” Matt Trudeau, IEX head of product, told the Financial Times.IEX chief executive Brad Katsuyama argues that the NYSE and its other critics have been lobbying to stall its application in Washington. “It’s ironic that the supposed centrepiece of American free-market capitalism is using behind-the-scenes political pull to obstruct a new entrant from competing,” Mr Katsuyama said in an email.The IEX exchange application has prompted hundreds of comment letters from supporters and detractors, including a letter of support from Mr Lewis. ICE reportedly looked at buying IEX before Flash Boys catapulted the trading venue into the public eye.Mr Sprecher spoke after ICE reported net profit of $370m in the fourth quarter, up 28 per cent from $288m the same period a year before. Per-share earnings of $3.29 handily beat estimates, aided by a $100m drop in income-tax expense. ICE was down 6.7 per cent to $245.41 at midday in New York.The stock exchange represents a relatively small corner of ICE’s markets empire, which includes derivatives exchanges and market data vendors. Of $875m in fourth-quarter revenue, 7 per cent came from cash equities trading and 12 per cent was from listings.
125;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-02-04T14:51:02Z;Credit default swaps activity heats up;Record $15.7bn in gross notional positions of single name CDS cleared by investors in January;Asset managers and hedge funds are reviving a corner of the credit derivatives market, with a record number of cleared trades reflecting higher transactional volume so far this year.Credit derivatives — tarnished by the financial crisis and a subsequent tougher regulatory regime for banks — are experiencing renewed growth after a long period of decline. Recent market volatility has bolstered their appeal as investors use credit default swaps, which track the likelihood of default of a company, to insure their bond portfolios from specific losses and also implement derivative based trading strategies.A record $15.7bn in gross notional outstanding positions of single name CDS was cleared by investors during January according to the Intercontinental Exchange, the largest credit derivative clearing house. ICE effectively stands between trades in the market, a process that aims to reduce the counterparty risk of market participants such as banks, asset managers and hedge funds.ICE said the majority of the volume had come from new business, as opposed to investors pushing longstanding positions through the clearing house for the first time.The rise in activity comes after a group of 24 big asset managers and hedge funds, including Blue Mountain, Citadel, BlackRock and Anchorage, recently pledged that they would clear their own single name CDS trades in an attempt to bolster trading in the product. “A considerable amount is coming from the US but it’s also coming from around the world . . . because the pain that is felt is felt by all,” said Peter Borstelmann, head of corporate development at ICE Clear Credit in the US.Regulators have sought to push more of the opaque over-the-counter swaps market through centralised clearing houses, mandating certain interest rate and credit products to be cleared. Single-name CDS is not required by regulators to be cleared but investors are hoping the shift will help return liquidity to the product, even if the cost of clearing trades is initially higher.Citadel have submitted a comment letter to the Securities Exchange Commission that became public on Thursday, calling on them to mandate central clearing for the most highly traded single name CDS contracts.The advent of higher capital requirements has weighed on bank participation in the market. Central clearing is seen as mitigating some of the impact, with the aim of encouraging banks and new dealers to provide liquidity to the market.“The product has had some reputational issues that may have deterred some investors from taking it up,” said Steven Kennedy, head of public policy at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. “But there are also issues around capital efficiency that are weighing on it. That is what we are engaged in now.”Cleared trades last month represent more than the combined amount for the last three months of 2015, taking the total notional cleared to $47.5bn. January set daily and weekly volumes records, added ICE.In spite of the uptick in cleared volumes, the CDS market remains a fraction of its size before the financial crisis, reflecting tougher capital standards for banks and fallout from being blamed for helping inflate the global credit bubble.The current outstanding gross notional for all single name CDS is currently around $6.8tn compared with $14.8tn at the end of 2008, according to data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.
126;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-02-01T12:23:54Z;Hedge funds cut back on short oil positions;;Did hedge funds cover short positions because oil rallied or did oil rally because hedge funds covered?Nobody knows, is the short answer, but what the latest exchange and regulatory data undoubtedly shows is that hedge funds were closing out bets against the oil price at an astounding rate last week, reports David Sheppard in London.In North Sea Brent, the international benchmark, funds’ so-called net long position – the difference between bets on rising and falling prices – leapt by 52,801 futures and options contracts to a net long of 260,954 last week, data from the IntercontinentalExchange showed. That is a paper position equivalent to almost 261m barrels of crude.That move was led by the closing out of almost 25 per cent of all bets by funds against the price, with short positions shrinking by 34,179 futures and options contracts in the week to January 26.After hitting a 12-year low on January 20 of $27.09 a barrel, Brent prices have since rallied by almost a third, trading back above $35 a barrelFunds had amassed a near record bearish position in crude oil in New York and London at the start of the year, leading to warnings from some commentators that the market could snap back if traders moved to take profits on bets against the price.The exchange data only covers until last Tuesday, after which oil continued to rally, so it is likely the short position has shrunk further.Funds have also been building a bullish position in Brent in anticipation of a snap back in prices. Long positions in Brent have now reached the highest on record at the equivalent of 365m barrels of crude.
127;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;NYSE acts to improve equity market structure;Controls under scrutiny after China fears spark August flash crash;The New York Stock Exchange has called for co-ordinated changes to market controls for stocks in the wake of extreme market volatility last year.The exchange, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange, identified on Thursday some areas to improve market structure following an external review by McKinsey, the management consultancy.NYSE has come under pressure since concerns about an economic slowdown in China sparked a disjointed opening hour to trading on August 24.As some large stocks fell more than 20 per cent, wide gaps opened between the net asset values of exchange traded funds and their underlying securities. Nearly 1,300 products — mostly ETFs but also some stocks — were suspended for sharp moves.The episode highlighted NYSE’s role as a price-setter for a range of equities and exchange-traded products and weaknesses in controls put in place to safeguard investors in times of market stress.NYSE has been tweaking some of its own processes, but it also hired McKinsey to survey market participants regarding their experience on August 24 and potential solutions.Among the changes, NYSE will no longer accept stop-loss orders that many retail investors use to manage risk, as the orders “have a higher risk profile than they historically had, especially during volatile periods”.NYSE also has applied to regulators to widen the collars — or limits — on trading in securities when they reopen after suspension, a feature that market participants have said impeded rebounds in shares on August 24 without triggering new suspensions.In a 38-page report it published on Thursday, NYSE outlined a series of recommendations to further shore up market structure.The day’s events marked the first real test of so-called “limit up limit down” rules, which require trading suspensions for large price swings, implemented after the flash crash.NYSE said that the sheer number and rapid-fire nature of the halts reduced transparency and impeded rebounds in securities, and it has called for the rules to be amended, including aligning the way securities reopen after suspensions.It also called for rules for trading suspensions and cancelling erroneous trades to be better aligned as well as protections for investors around stock loss orders.Others have criticised NYSE’s opening process, which still includes the input of human traders. The exchange believes the hybrid approach damps volatility but rivals say it exacerbated it on August 24.“I do have one simple recommendation for them,” said Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, NYSE’s rival. “They should open their market at 9:30. All of those downstream problems would go away.”NYSE has already revised its opening processes to allow human traders to open more stocks electronically in times of market-wide stress, allowing them to focus on securities with the biggest anticipated moves.“The changes we are making will continue to have the benefit of human oversight but include more automation,” said Stacey Cunningham, NYSE’s chief operating officer.The report also called for further study of aligning halts in equities, exchange traded funds and futures markets. It follows similar assessments from BlackRock, one of the largest ETF providers, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
128;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2016-01-22T17:49:33Z;Oil climbs as exit from bearish positions begins;Traders have started to increase bets on a recovery by year end;Traders have started to increase bets on a recovery in oil by the end of the year, backing the view that recent selling has been overdone and the downturn in prices cannot last with so many producers burning through cash.Since hitting a 12-year low on Wednesday, Brent crude has jumped by more than 16 per cent as hedge funds have started to bank profits on positions designed to gain from the crash in prices and tentatively rotate into bullish strategies.There has been a flurry of buying of derivative contracts which give the owner the right to buy oil at $50 a barrel in December, according to exchange data, a move that suggests some traders and hedge funds believe current prices are “irrational”.Figures from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) show the number of $50 call options outstanding has increased to 46,233 — the equivalents of 46m barrels of oil — from 27,315 at the start of the year.There has also been a sharp rise in the number of $40 call options for December 2016.“The open interest in crude options continues to increase at a very strong pace and more on calls than puts,” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, a consultancy in Zug, Switzerland.While some of the contracts may have been purchased by large oil consumers such as airlines seeking to lock in prices for the year, they also reflect a more positive view on oil.Many analysts and industry executives cannot be sustained and are not justified in the medium term by the fundamentals of supply and demand.On Thursday, Khalid al-Falih, the chairman of Saudi Arabia’s state oil company and one of the most influential voices in the industry, described the collapse in oil prices to below $30 as “irrational” and predicted they would be higher by the end of the year.“The market has overshot on the low side and it is inevitable that it will start turning up,” Mr Falih, told the World Economic Forum in Davos.The 18-month downturn in prices has left US drillers and other high cost producers teetering on the brink, while oil majors have shelved nearly $400bn of spending, pushing back millions of barrels a day in future output from areas including the Gulf of Mexico, Africa and Kazakhstan.On top of that, the number of countries calling for action to counter low prices has started to rise. This week Venezuela called for an emergency Opec meeting, while Oman said this week it was ready to cut production by 5-10 per cent.“The list of producer countries that are hyperventilating about the low price is however starting to get longer and with that the geopolitical premium should not be discounted,” said Mr Jakob.Brent crude, which fell to a 12-year low of $27.10 a barrel on Wednesday, was trading at $31.50 on Friday. West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark was $31.65, up $26.19 a barrel on Wednesday.In spite of the rally, oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic have still fallen sharply this month. Brent is down more than 15 per cent and WTI almost 14 per cent. Many commentators reckon the rally will be shortlived because supplies are still excessive.“The price strength we are experiencing now is viewed as a healthy profit-taking and nothing more for the time being,” said David Hufton of PVM, an oil brokerageIn its monthly report published on Tuesday the International Energy Agency said supply would outpace demand for another year and the oil market was at risk of “ drowning in oversupply.”If Iran adds 600,000 barrels a day to the market by the end of June and other Opec members maintain current output, the Paris-based organisation reckons global oil supply could exceed 1.5m b/d in the first half of the year.“While the pace of stock building eases in the second half of the year as supply from non-Opec producers, unless something changes, the oil market could drown in oversupply.”

131;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-11-24T16:26:26Z;US traders’ algorithms face tougher scrutiny;Regulator seeks to curtail market disruptions from increased use of automated strategies;As many as 100 trading groups that generate more than a third of volumes on futures exchanges would have to register and let the government inspect their secret source code under a US regulator’s plan to patrol the frontiers of electronic markets.“Reg AT,” or Regulation Automated Trading, would impose further rules for transactions in derivatives amid concerns that if a computer program went awry it could spread chaos in benchmarks such as oil or stock indices.The regulation was unanimously released for public comment on Tuesday by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Tim Massad, the CFTC chairman, said automated strategies constitute more than 70 per cent of all trading. They are usually undertaken in split-second increments.While the rise of such trading has lowered costs for market participants, it has also led to mishaps, such as in 2011 when a Chicago firm’s automated system mistakenly generated more than 6,000 crude oil orders in three seconds.“We know that a faulty algorithm at a single firm, regardless of size, can potentially cause a significant problem,” Mr Massad said.The proposal would place more requirements on trading groups, futures clearing brokers and exchanges such as those run by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange.Aspects of the proposal, such as controls on the frequency of order messages, are already standard practice.But other features of the proposal are new. One looming point of conflict is that the rule would require traders to maintain source code repositories that are open to examination by authorities.“It is highly unusual for this intellectual property to be shared with anyone,” said Leslie Sutphen, president of Financial Markets Consulting in Chicago.Chris Giancarlo, the lone Republican on the three-member commission, raised concerns that the repositories could be examined by both the CFTC and the US Justice Department without a subpoena.“I am unaware of any other industry where the federal government has such easy access to a firm’s intellectual property and future business strategies,” he said.‘Systems risk’ arrives after black-box trading lifts speed of marketsRead moreExchanges would be required to publicly disclose certain aspects of their electronic trade matching systems, which have replaced floor-based pits as the futures market hubs of the 21st century. Exchanges would also have to disclose more about incentive rewards for high-volume traders.These schemes “could have the potential to spur market participants to trade in ways designed to collect programme benefits, independently of any contribution they may be making to liquidity or price discovery,” the CFTC said.For the first time, the CFTC provided a legal definition of algorithmic trading, though it refrained from trying to define a more controversial subset known as high-frequency trading.Algorithmic trading, it said as part its more than 200-word definition, is when “one or more computer algorithms or systems determines whether to initiate, modify or cancel an order, or otherwise makes determinations with respect to an order”.The proposal comes more than two years after the CFTC outlined possible reforms for automated trading under a “concept release”.

So if you passed the selection you could lead the UK’s biggest telecoms infrastructure company into independence.“It’s very high profile.

It’s a shambles.”His MajestyRowan Gormley, newish boss of Majestic Wine, is showing less brash new-world panache than you might expect from a South African accountant who named his first wine venture “Orgasmic Wines”, his second “Naked Wines” and raised money from investors he called “angels”, writes Kate Burgess.But Majestic paid a lot in April for Mr Gormley’s upstart style. Buying the barely profitable Naked Wines cost about £70m. The annual interest, plus a rise in costs associated with new store openings, dripped through to a 70 per cent fall in Majestic’s first-half earnings per share. Some analysts cut earnings forecasts by as much as a quarter to about £14m for the year.Unsurprisingly perhaps, Mr G’s language has become, well, more majestic. A few months ago the talk was all about raising Majestic’s online presence. Now it is all about rebuilding customer loyalty in store and investing in staff, marketing and IT to restore Majestic’s returns on capital to above 25 per cent. The goal is to lift sales to £500m, or by about 10 per cent annually, by 2019. The South African is cutting down on opening new stores, but not the store estate. And he refuses to break out how much of Majestic’s sales should come via the web. He says “that is irrelevant in a multichannel environment”.He may be proved right — in time. But the forward earnings multiple for the shares of 20 times earnings today is higher than most stock market investors should be prepared to pay.To paraphrase an old proverb, you can lead the bourse to liquor but you can’t make it partake.The persuaderHoward Lutnick has burnished his credentials as a deal-doer with the disposal of Trayport, a London-based platform for trading energy securities. The chief executive of rufty-tufty brokerage BGC is selling to exchanges group Intercontinental Exchange for $650m, just seven months after buying Trayport’s parent GFI for $750m.Cue gnashing of teeth at Chicago’s CME Group, ICE’s rival. Its hopes of buying GFI were blocked by shareholders, allowing Mr Lutnick to steam in and take control.The disposal means BGC got the voice broking arm of GFI, which it will retain, for a slim multiple of sales. Admittedly, ICE is paying for Trayport in shares rather than cash and BGC’s voice broking arm is losing money. But if BGC turns the operation round by combining it with its own voice broking unit, the GFI purchase will look smart.Mr Lutnick has a knack of extracting high prices for disposals. In 2013 he sold an electronic US Treasuries trading business to Nasdaq OMX for $1.2bn, which was around BGC’s market capitalisation at the time. Wall Street legend insists Mr Lutnick persuaded Nasdaq’s Bob Greifeld to send advisers out of the room before agreeing a price. A rare case, if true, where bankers might have discouraged a client from overpaying rather than encouraging them to do so.jonathan.guthrie@ft.comMajestic: kate.burgess@ft.com
133;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-11-05T11:09:11Z;Regulators step up efforts to stop spoofing;Michael Coscia found guilty of market disruption;Only months after the first trader was found guilty in court of manipulating a key reference rate for over-the-counter derivatives markets, the futures market now has its own criminal conviction.New Jersey-based Michael Coscia, of Panther Energy Trading, on Tuesday joined Tom Hayes, the former UBS trader, in being found guilty by jury of disrupting some of the world’s most important and closely scrutinised markets.Mr Hayes’s crime of manipulating the Libor interbank lending rate — the benchmark on which around $350tn of derivatives contracts are referenced — led to a global multiyear investigation, billions of dollars of fines for banks and a profound overhaul of the system.However, in the futures industry, long known for its freewheeling and aggressive behaviour in the trading pits, that period of introspection may only be about to begin. Mr Coscia had been charged with fraud and so-called “spoofing”, which involves rapidly entering and cancelling orders to intentionally trick other traders into buying above or selling below the market price.Exchanges had long prohibited disruptive behaviour but spoofing was explicitly banned by the US Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010, as authorities grew concerned that anonymous computers could repeat it hundreds of times a second.Indeed, Timothy Massad, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said on Wednesday the agency had made it “a priority” to look at spoofing.“We’ve been very aggressive in going after situations that we feel are violations of the law, and implementing our new authority in this regard. We will continue to do that,” he told reporters on Wednesday at the FIA Expo conference in Chicago.Last year, futures exchanges also issued new rules formally proscribing spoofing. “We can prevent spoofing now that we have a legal definition of what that is,” Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange, said on a conference panel.But many traders were dumbfounded as news of Mr Coscia’s conviction spread. Mr Coscia had already settled civil charges with the CFTC, the main derivatives regulator, as well as CME Group, which operated some markets he traded such as gold, copper and soyabean oil. The speed of the verdict, issued after just an hour of deliberation, surprised many.“Ultimately, an hour is barely enough time to elect a foreman, take a straw poll on 12 counts and fill out the jury-verdict form. Clearly, no one in the jury found the defendant’s narrative to be compelling. There are lessons in that for both prosecutors and defence lawyers going forward,” says Trace Schmeltz, a lawyer with Barnes & Thornburg not involved in the trial.For some, the practice is hard to distinguish from legitimate trading dominated by rapid-fire computers that spit out numerous prices instantly.On a trading screen, traders are presented with the buying price, known as the “bid”, and a selling price, known as the “ask”. The difference between the bid and ask is the spread. To complete a trade, a buyer or seller must bridge the spread to fill the order. The market goes back and forth before meeting somewhere in the middle. Such activity also explains why market prices can jump around, typified by buy and sell prices being quickly adjusted or cancelled.Walt Lukken, chief executive of FIA, the futures association, says the industry would welcome more precise guidance on what constitutes spoofing. “Clarification by enforcement is not the ideal way to clarify regulations,” he says.Mr Coscia’s lawyer, Steven Peikin of Sullivan & Cromwell, has indicated his client would pursue all of his legal options.Gregory Mocek, lawyer at Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft and a former CFTC enforcement director, says: “If this goes up on appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals has proved in the past that it is not fond of government cases filed pursuant the Commodity Exchange Act, and it may find a way to overturn this decision.” The Commodity Exchange Act is the law that governs futures markets.Clarification by enforcement is not the ideal way to clarify regulationsTerrence Duffy, CME executive chairman, declined to comment on the facts of the case but said of the verdict: “I think there’s a lot of lawyers, a lot of back office people and others who want to understand this to make sure everybody’s in compliance.”Asked if traders would need to change their practices in light of the verdict, Mr Massad responded: “It depends if they’re engaging in spoofing, doesn’t it?”He added: “Look, if they’re entering a lot of orders without intention to consummate then they should go talk to their lawyers.”www.ft.com/tradingroom
134;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-10-29T22:19:12Z;Commodity indices split on crude oil weighting;Brent to overtake West Texas Intermediate in Bloomberg index;The world’s two main commodities indices have staked out diverging views on the price of oil, with one elevating Brent crude in its weighting scheme and the other demoting it to second place.The Bloomberg Commodity index and the S&P GSCI index have a large impact on money flows in futures markets, together attracting more than $100bn in assets, according to Barclays.Bloomberg said on Thursday the target weight of Brent, the international oil benchmark, would next year overtake West Texas Intermediate, the US indicator, in its index for the first time since Brent was included in 2012.By contrast, managers of the S&P GSCI index have outlined plans to restore WTI’s status as the biggest component of that index in 2016 after trading volumes rebounded in the US contract.The contrary moves reflect the somewhat different rules by which each index is constructed. Both take into account volumes in underlying futures markets and the scale of world production, but the Bloomberg index — launched in 1997 as the Dow Jones-AIG — caps the weights of individual commodities and commodity groups.The rivalry between Brent and WTI intensified as US shale production surged, temporarily depressing the price of the American benchmark and prompting some global oil groups to turn to Brent to hedge their energy risks.CME, whose New York Mercantile Exchange is the main venue for trading WTI futures, touted GSCI’s planned shift on a conference call on Thursday.Phupinder Gill, CME chief executive, said: “The WTI futures are now the largest component and represent 23 per cent of the total index, which clearly reflects our client’s choice in risk management tools among our crude oil liquidity pools.”Nevertheless, both WTI and Brent would shrink relative to the overall size of the GSCI, with the WTI target of 23 per cent down from a target of 24.5 per cent this year, and Brent falling to 20.4 per cent from 24.7 per cent.S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the GSCI, is a joint venture of McGraw Hill Financial, the controlling member, and CME, the minority partner.The Bloomberg index’s targets would raise Brent crude’s weight from 7.16 to 7.53 per cent, surpassing WTI crude as it declines from 7.84 to 7.47 per cent.In the nine months to September, volumes in WTI futures on the Nymex were up 46.3 per cent from same period of 2014. Brent volumes on Intercontinental Exchange’s ICE Futures Europe exchange were 19 per cent higher.The footprint of index investing in futures markets has faded with the collapse of commodities prices.Barclays estimated $139bn tracks indices today, down from a peak of $221bn in 2010. The GSCI — formerly the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index — has a 47 per cent share. The Bloomberg index has 44 per cent.
135;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-10-28T20:44:42Z;Starwood Hotels jumps on news of Hyatt talks;Other hotel stocks rise on hopes of further consolidation in sector;Shares in Starwood Hotels jumped 6.3 per cent on news that rival Hyatt is in advanced talks to buy it.Starwood’s stock is down nearly 2 per cent since April when the luxury hotel owner said it was bringing in Lazard to explore a “full range of strategic and financial alternatives”, sparking speculation about a possible sale.News of Hyatt’s interest comes just a day after a separate report said that at least three Chinese companies are eyeing the company, prompting investors to bid up the stock 9 per cent on Tuesday.Starwood, which operates brands like Westin, W Hotels and St Regis, said net income slipped in the latest quarter, although results still exceeded analyst forecasts.Profits fell from $109m, or $0.59 a share, to $88m, or $0.53 per share, compared with analysts’ estimates of $0.72 a share. Starwood also said it had sealed the sale of its timeshare business for $1.5bn.Other hotel stocks were also up on speculation that the sale of Starwood could herald a new wave of consolidation in the hotel sector. Shares in InterContinental Hotels Group, the world’s largest hotel operator by number of rooms, climbed 0.9 per cent to $39.07 in New York, while shares in Hyatt fell 1.8 per cent to $49.63.In July, the Financial Times reported that IHG had held early stage talks with Starwood over a union to create the world’s largest hotel group, as a part of Starwood’s search for a solution to its lagging growth.Elsewhere in the food and beverage sector, shares in Hershey dropped 6.5 per cent as the US sweets company, already toiling with a slowdown in sales in China, said US sales came in shy of its forecasts thanks to a weak showing from its candy, gum and mints business.As a result of the twin challenges in China and its domestic market, Hershey trimmed its outlook for full-year revenues, excluding currency swings, to growth of between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent on last year. That is down on its previous forecast of 3 per cent to 4 per cent.The chocolate maker said that earnings per share will be about $4.10 for the year, which is at the low end of its forecast range.Meanwhile, Diamond Foods, the California-based food producer behind Kettle Chips, agreed a $1.9bn takeover from rival US snack food manufacturer Snyder’s-Lance.The two companies have agreed to what they describe as a cash and stock “merger” but under the terms of the deal, shareholders in Diamond will receive 0.775 Snyder’s-Lance shares and $12.50 in cash for each of their existing shares.Diamond Foods’ stock jumped 8.9 per cent to $38, a three-and-a-half year high, while Snyder’s-Lance was down 7.8 per cent to $33.25.Intercontinental Exchange, owner of a constellation of futures exchanges and the New York Stock Exchange, reported sharply higher profit that narrowly missed Wall Street expectations.The Atlanta-based company reported net income of $306m, or $2.76 per share, in the third quarter compared with $206m, or $1.80 per share in the same quarter of 2014.Adjusted for certain items, ICE earned $2.91 per share — a penny shy of forecasts in a FactSet poll. Revenues totalled $816m, up from $745m a year before.ICE’s consolidated data services revenues were $209m, up 24 per cent on the year. ICE deepened its investment in market data services with the acquisition of Interactive Data in a deal worth $5.2bn, announced this week.
136;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Intercontinental Exchange to buy Interactive Data for $5bn;Deal heralds expansion into US fixed income markets;Intercontinental Exchange, the US exchanges operator, is making an aggressive push into fixed income markets, long dominated by investment banks, with the purchase of Interactive Data (IDC) in a deal worth $5.2bn.Atlanta-based ICE has agreed to pay Silver Lake and Warburg Pincus, IDC’s private equity owners, $3.65bn in cash and $1.55bn in common stock for IDC, which provides analytics and reference data for banks and hedge funds for hard-to-value off-exchange financial instruments.The deal will throw ICE, best known as a commodity futures exchange operator and owner of the New York Stock Exchange, deep into the market for pricing illiquid bonds. New global banking and markets regulation, such as the Dodd-Frank act, Basel III and Mifid II, is set to usher in more electronic quote-driven trading and clearing in fixed income markets in America and Europe.IDC evaluates prices for 2.7m financial securities every day, including 46,000 corporate debt issues, 1.1m US municipal bonds and 45,000 high-yield bonds. ICE’s purchase will make it the third-largest data provider behind Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters, according to Burton-Taylor, a US consultancy.The deal also reflects a growing interest among exchanges in purchasing rare industry assets. Last year, the London Stock Exchange bought Frank Russell, the US stock index provider, for $2.7bn to expand into the US and the exchange traded funds markets, while Deutsche Börse bought the 50 per cent of Stoxx it did not own for $697m.ICE has been pushing into the market with ventures such as the administration of Libor and IsdaFix and the purchase of UK-based SuperDerivatives for $350m last year. Its market data service revenues have risen from about $100m in 2010 to an expected $700m this year — before the IDC deal was announced — according to UBS. A deal for IDC will make ICE the world’s largest exchanges operater by revenues.In an analyst presentation to UBS earlier this year, the US group indicated that it hoped to have organic revenue growth of 5 to 7 per cent in its data business, in line with larger market peers such as Markit.However, ICE shares fell 1.7 per cent in morning trade in New York amid some concerns about cost and growth. Christopher Harris, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said the deal would mean 40 per cent of ICE’s group revenues would come from market data, up from just over a fifth. However some issues remained.“IDC’s business has fairly attractive margins (40 per cent earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) and a likely sticky customer profile but appears to be slower growing, with revenues rising in the 2-3 per cent range over the last several years,” he said.$945mIDC’s expected revenues for the 12 months to SeptemberSilver Lake and Warburg acquired IDC in 2010 in a buyout that gave the company an enterprise value of $3.4bn. The two had been exploring a possible sale or a potential initial public offering for several months.For the 12 months to September 30, revenues for IDC are expected to be $945m and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation estimated at $378m.Global spending on financial data, analysis and news increased 4 per cent to $26.5bn last year, according to consultants Burton-Taylor.That growing appetite has led to a number of large deals in the sector, such as Markit’s $1.3bn flotation, Verisk Analytics’ £2.8bn purchase of Wood Mackenzie, and the $700m sale of Dealogic late last year to private equity.Additional reporting by Richard Blackden in New York
137;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-10-25T17:36:06Z;Oil traders threaten London market exit over EU ‘position limits’;Companies say EU rules would limit ability to hedge price swings;Some of the world’s largest oil traders are threatening to pull their business from London’s derivative exchanges because of tough new European rules that would place limits on their ability to manage price swings.Oil majors including BP and Royal Dutch Shell, and large independent traders such as Trafigura, may be unable to hedge their financial exposures to the contents of more than a handful of oil tankers under current proposals from the European Commission.The rules, which are making their way through Brussels, seek to clamp down on speculation by imposing “position limits” that cap the number of futures contracts each company can hold.Under the rules, physical oil dealers will be stripped of so-called “real world” exemptions to the caps unless they can prove the majority of their trading is not for speculative purposes. They could also be asked to hold as much capital as a bank under a revamped version of Europe’s flagship market rule book.Oil traders are threatening to move their derivative business to either Singapore or New York, just as the UK government attempts to renegotiate its relationship with the EU ahead of a planned in-or-out referendum on membership. UK chancellor George Osborne has made defending the City of London one of his priorities.“[This] has the potential to damage the City’s position as the leading global centre for commodity derivative trading and will limit the ability of physical commodity traders to hedge using EU market trading venues,” said Christophe Salmon, chief financial officer of Trafigura, which ships about 3m physical barrels of oil a day or almost 4 per cent of global oil demand.“Given the more proportionate approach to regulation being taken by other major financial centres, there is a very real risk that we will start seeing liquidity moving out of Europe,” he said.Shell has said it might relocate some of its London-based trading activities if it is not able to manage its risk in a “sensible way”.Given the more proportionate approach to regulation being taken by other major financial centres, there is a very real risk that we will start seeing liquidity moving out of EuropeDebate over the regulation of commodity markets has intensified since the European Securities and Markets Authority published the final rules in September, which will have to be approved by the EU before it becomes law at the start of 2017.Traders captured by the rules will be limited to holding positions equivalent to between 5 per cent and 35 per cent of a commodity’s deliverable supply. For London-traded Brent crude oil, a 5 per cent cap would limit traders to holding positions equivalent to 1.5m barrels of crude — less than it takes to fill a single supertanker.David Lawton, director of markets at the Financial Conduct Authority, which will set the UK limits, said traders “simply” doing physical business will be exempt if they can show the vast majority of their oil derivatives trades are hedges for commercial transactions.But they would need to be able to show a precise breakdown of their derivatives trading, something large oil traders say is difficult because they hedge on a group-wide rather than cargo-by-cargo basis.Critics say this approach — known as portfolio hedging — can be used to mask the level of speculation unrelated to directly protecting against price swings.Intercontinental Exchange, which operates the Brent contract in London, said it was hopeful regulators would listen to traders’ concerns. “We are optimistic that concerns over position limits are something that will be addressed by the European Commission,” said David Peniket, president and chief operating officer of ICE Futures Europe. “The approach they have been taking is constructive.”
138;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-10-16T08:10:34Z;LSE aims to secure place in interest rate futures market;£30m bank-backed drive is attempt to break rival’s hold on sector;The London Stock Exchange Group is to launch an aggressive push into the European futures markets dominated by Deutsche Börse and Intercontinental Exchange with a £30m bank-backed venture.The project, called CurveGlobal, has been two years in the planning and represents the biggest push by the LSE into interest rate futures.It will be backed by six banks — Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Citi, JPMorgan and Société Générale — and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US bourse that owns the Vix volatility indices. The LSE will contribute £9.5m to the venture and the banks and CBOE a further £20.5m. Although the LSE has a derivatives business, CurveGlobal is the LSE’s most ambitious attempt to break into a market it has long coveted but missed out on since it was beaten to the £550m sale of Liffe, the London futures market, by Euronext, the European group, in 2002. Euronext has subsequently been bought by Intercontinental Exchange, the US group. Around 3.3bn contracts were traded globally in 2014, according to the Futures Industry Association.However, pulling liquidity in established contracts from one exchange to another has frequently failed in the futures industry.“What makes this attempt different to build a credible and sizeable derivatives platform is that CurveGlobal has secured large sell-side derivative players as not only customers but also investors,” said Peter Lenardos, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.The LSE will look to undercut the trading costs of its main rivals in both long-term and short-term fixed income futures. ICE Futures Europe dominates liquidity at the short end of the curve with Libor-pegged euribor futures. Deutsche Börse’s Eurex controls the longer end, with its Bund, Bobl and Schatz futures pegged to the prices of German government bonds.Most of the potential savings lie in offsetting the amount of margin that has to be posted by traders against trading both futures and over-the-counter derivatives. The margin is held in a clearing house, which sits between trades to reduce counterparty credit risk.Some banks and the LSE have argued the so-called “vertical silo” model operated by Deutsche Börse and ICE, in which contracts can be traded and cleared only at their own venue, has inhibited competition and prevented costs from falling. European rules are set to break open that model, although they will not become mandatory until 2019.The LSE is betting it will be able to exploit the vast amount of swaps business at LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house it controls. The utility is the world’s largest interest rate swaps clearer, frequently processing more than $1tn notional per day.“New rules [for banks] are forcing different ways of trading things. We will be about to offer margining against OTC products of some scale in SwapClear,” said Michael Davie, who will move across from his role as chief operating officer at LCH.Clearnet to be chairman of CurveGlobal.The LSE will hold an initial 31.67 per cent stake but will look to cut its holding to 25 per cent by adding more shareholders. The service is expected to go live around May next year.
139;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-09-30T11:44:22Z;Incentives in futures markets attract scrutiny;Calls for greater transparency over volume discounts, rebates and payments offered by exchanges;If the energy market was a vast sea, Nasdaq’s new futures exchange would be a puddle: it handles one in 500 US oil futures transactions.Nasdaq wants to improve its status. It is doing so partly through a fee holiday and, for a select group of 20 market-making companies, monthly payments for volume.Such incentives may be the only way to wrest business from established exchanges that enjoy powerful network effects.But incentives in futures markets such as volume discounts, rebates and payments are now attracting scrutiny. Sharon Bowen, a commissioner at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, recently said exchanges should reveal more about them.Among her concerns: incentives could induce a firm to trade with itself just to rack up exchange payments. The CFTC “should set more concrete restrictions on market maker programmes”, she says in the text of a recent speech in New York.The stakes of the debate are huge. A total of 21.87bn futures and options contracts were traded worldwide in 2014, according to FIA, the industry body — more than double the volume of 10 years before. At exchange operator CME Group, $1,100tn worth of derivatives changed hands last year.“We understand the CFTC will be issuing a new rule designed to further improve transparency, and we look forward to reviewing it and responding,” CME says.Exchanges commonly offer incentives to bring liquidity into a fledgling contract. CME offers them to customers ranging from electronic trading firms to central banks, in products from innovative interest rate “ swap futures” to grain.The existence of incentive programmes highlights the interdependency of exchanges and traders.Exchanges need market makers to provide an attractive “spread” between prices at which they would buy or sell a commodity or financial index. For example, an Intercontinental Exchange programme in US oil futures obliges applicants to show the bid-ask spread they would maintain and commit to trading 20,000 contracts of the product.For market makers, the opportunity to collect incentives comes with a cost. Prices can move violently against them in thin, erratic markets.“Market making is a risky and complex activity that requires significant time, resources and skilled human capital,” says Jim Overdahl, partner at lobbyists Delta Strategy Group and an adviser to the FIA PTG, an industry group of proprietary traders. “Exchange incentive programmes aren’t perks — they are one of a variety of tools that exchanges use to encourage the activity required to build and sustain healthy, successful markets.”Not all activity has been healthy. To capture rebates from ICE, a manager at Chicago-based Gelber Group directed his stock index traders to “trade opposite each other until they reached the necessary volume”, then had an employee create a computer program that automatically matched the two traders’ orders, the CFTC said in 2013. Gelber was fined $750,000 over the so-called “wash sales” and other alleged abuses.“The main concern is that the programmes don’t lead to non-bona fide trading, where there are just people executing trading for the sole purpose of getting the incentive and not really assuming risk,” says Richard Shilts, who was director of CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight between 2004-13.Mr Shilts says commission staff discussed putting out rules or guidance on what might constitute an acceptable incentive programme. “That wasn’t done,” he adds.Participants in exchange incentive programmes are required to comply with exchange rules that prohibit wash sales and other violations. After the Gelber case, ICE imposed mandatory self-trade prevention functionality for proprietary traders.The use of incentives is not limited to new contracts such as the energy futures Nasdaq launched in July to challenge CME and ICE. ICE recently extended two dozen oil market maker and liquidity provider programmes that date as far back as 2006, an exchange notice shows.A proprietary trader says that participants who back nascent contracts will sometimes do so only if incentives are guaranteed for years, so they can reap the benefits if a contract succeeds.Ms Bowen of the CFTC called for more public transparency on exchange incentive programmes. She said exchanges should provide the public with “fairly granular” information including who is and is not eligible.Exchanges already file basic details of programmes to public databases, though they withhold juicier nuggets such as who participates and how well they are compensated.ICE says: “We currently file details for our market making programmes with the CFTC and will work with the commission as they consider any changes to that process.”
140;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-09-17T22:32:24Z;Former UK minister Hague to become ICE Futures Europe chairman;London derivatives exchange chooses former politician to replace long-serving Sir Bob Reid;Former UK Foreign Minister William Hague is to become the new chairman of ICE Futures Europe, the London derivatives exchange.Mr Hague, who also joins the board of ICE’s US parent company Intercontinental Exchange, was a member of the UK parliament from 1998 to 2015, serving as Conservative party leader and foreign secretary from 2010-2014. He has also worked at McKinsey, the management consultancy.He will succeed the retiring Sir Bob Reid, who has held the position for 16 years. Sir Bob will continue as chairman of ICE Clear Europe through 2015.Sir Bob became ICE Futures Europe chair amid ICE’s purchase of the International Petroleum Exchange in 2002. He was drafted in when Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the former chairman, and chief executive Lynton Jones resigned after failing to get a large enough majority to sell the IPE to a consortium of buyers, including BG Group. He retained the role after ICE — then just a two-year old company — stepped in and took over the exchange.Since then the US group has extensively built up its European operations from the UK capital, including the purchase of Liffe in 2013 and building the first clearing house in London in 100 years in 2008.“On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Sir Bob for his tireless energy, commitment and dedication to the exchange, our customers and shareholders over the last 16 years,” said Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive.Mr Hague “brings a unique combination of governmental experience and a deep understanding of business. Our markets will benefit from Mr. Hague’s private and public sector expertise as we seek to continue to grow by serving our customers in new ways,” Mr Sprecher added.
141;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-09-14T17:21:01Z;3Red set for ‘spoofing’ legal battle;Proprietary firm queries market expertise of CFTC lawyers as it tests rules on disruptive trading;3Red Trading, a proprietary trading firm, is girding for a court battle with a US regulator as it awaits charges over “spoofing” — duping other traders by quickly entering and cancelling orders.The Chicago-based firm active on futures exchanges expects to be charged by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission even as it questions the market expertise of the agency’s lawyers, according an internal note seen by the Financial Times.3Red’s defiant stance will test new rules against disruptive trading as exchanges and regulators begin to crack down. The note blasted exchange rules as “vague” and the investigation process as “one-sided”.“Because we have decided to fight, the charges that will be listed against us will attempt to cast us in the worst light possible,” Steve Strohmer, 3Red’s chief operating officer, wrote in the note emailed to employees last Friday.If charged, 3Red would join an expanding group of traders accused of disrupting bona fide deals in futures, where values of things from stock indices to oil are negotiated in millions of daily transactions. Both 3Red and the CFTC declined to comment.Spoofing involves the rapid placement and cancellation of orders to trick others into making trades. London-based trader Navinder Singh Sarao is contesting an indictment alleging his spoofing hastened the 2010 “flash crash” of US stocks.In the US, Michael Coscia of Panther Energy Trading is fighting criminal spoofing allegations brought after he had already settled a civil case brought by CFTC, the derivatives regulator.3Red’s co-founder and head trader, Igor Oystacher, settled disciplinary cases from CME Group-operated futures exchanges in 2014 and Intercontinental Exchange in June, paying a total of $275,000 in penalties and agreeing to a one-month trading ban at CME.The exchanges said Mr Oystacher had entered orders in crude oil, gold, silver, copper and the Russell 2000 stock index, only to cancel them when his orders on the opposite side of the market had been filled. He neither admitted nor denied the rule violations.The note from Mr Strohmer said the previous settlements, media attention and “pressure from Washington to attain results” will make CFTC legal charges “inevitable”.“In some ways I empathise with the CFTC,” he wrote. “They are a group of ambitious lawyers trying to do the right thing with inadequate resources and limited to no experience in trading. It’s a broken process. As we all know trading is complicated and without experience in market dynamics you end up with oversimplified analysis about complex trading”.3Red, Mr Oystacher and Mr Johnson were subpoenaed by the CFTC in 2012, Bloomberg News has reported, citing filings in a Chicago state court.In the past year, both CME and ICE exchanges have enacted new rules banning spoofing in their markets, after the Dodd-Frank financial reforms of 2010 explicitly outlawed the practice.“We have put processes in place in an effort to continually align our trading with the current interpretation of the vague rules of each exchange and the new language under Dodd-Frank,” Mr Strohmer wrote.
142;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-09-09T10:32:05Z;ICE sets November date for delayed Singapore launch;US exchange’s Asian trading hub to pull back from cotton futures;Intercontinental Exchange will open its delayed Singapore trading business in November but without the planned commodities futures contracts that led to a legal threat from a Chinese rival.The US exchanges operator, one of the world’s largest by market value, set November 17 as the new launch date for its Asian hub in a statement on Wednesday. It had originally aimed to begin trading from there in March but pushed back the opening as new customers struggled to finish the extensive regulatory paperwork.At the same time ICE also kicked off a furious response from the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange for planning to offer cotton and white sugar futures contracts that were copies of contracts offered in China.Although common practice for exchanges to other countries to offer “lookalike” contracts in other markets, the Chinese exchange demanded the US group halt its plans, and regulators also intervened.The pushback led to industry concerns that China would not tolerate foreign exchanges copying its own futures contracts. ICE already has cotton contract, but which only allows for delivery in the US, and has tried to get a “ world contract” off the ground. The two exchanges and their regulators had been in discussion over how to resolve the dispute.The new exchange will open on November 17 offering mini Brent futures, mini Gasoil futures, kilo gold futures and mini onshore and offshore renminbi futures, subject to approval from Singapore authorities. ICE has also applied to operate a trade repository, to store details of trades.ICE’s Asian platform was based on an extensive renovation of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange, which it bought in 2013 for $150m.The venue underlines how Singapore is emerging as a key financial hub for exchanges as demand grows from regional commodities customers for hedging and risk management services, and because of its relatively low tax regime, English-based legal system and extremely low political risk, compared with competing Asian financial centres such as Hong Kong. Deutsche Börse is expected to launch its Asian exchange in the second quarter of next year.
143;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-07-28T14:25:35Z;Investors boost clearing of credit swaps;ICE says $5bn of trades so far this year overtake the $4.4bn for all of 2014;Hopes of a revival for a languishing area of the credit derivatives market are being bolstered by an increasing number of investors voluntarily adopting a risk management practice advocated by regulators.So far this year, investors have placed $5bn of old and new single name credit default swap trades on US companies into a clearing house, surpassing the $4.4bn seen during 2014, according to Intercontinental Exchange.The exchange, which operates the largest credit derivative clearing house, stands between trades in the market, a process that aims to reduce the counterparty risk of market participants such as banks, asset managers and hedge funds.The acceleration of investor clearing reflects a push by the industry to revive trading activity for credit swaps on specific companies, a once booming market that has languished in recent years, due to tougher capital rules for banks and a benign credit environment.Banks and investors are looking to revive single name CDS, which track the likelihood a company or sovereign will default on its debt and payout like insurance if they do, keen to retain an alternative market for implementing credit trades and a means of insulating corporate bond portfolios against adverse changes in price and yield.Investors have stepped up clearing activity, despite the fact that the industry is still waiting for regulators to finalise rules for single name CDS. In contrast, regulators brought in rules for clearing index trades in 2013, an area of the market that has experienced robust activity in recent years.“This momentum, which is taking place on a voluntary basis and not at this time mandated, demonstrates the value of clearing,” said a spokesperson for ICE. The exchange has more than doubled its clearing membership from non-bank firms in 2015 from 18 at the end of last year to 37 currently.Increased clearing of single name CDS helps reduce the amount of capital held by banks for transacting in derivatives. Investors are hopeful that lower capital costs for banks will result in greater support from dealers for trading single name CDS.“I think most banks will certainly come back to CDS if it clears,” said Michael O’Brien, global head of trading at Eaton Vance. “Bilateral contracts carry heavy capital charges that can make CDS trading for banks unattractive. I think this is one if the largest obstacles to a revival of single name CDS.”Banks say they have seen a particular uptick in investor appetite for clearing in the past two weeks, with more mid-tier investors coming through the door.The push follows ICE’s addition of single name CDS clearing for more company names, with further launches billed during August. Investors had complained that without more names, especially those included in the indices like General Moters, clearing would be held back.“We are definitely seeing an increase,” said a clearing head at a US bank. “We are seeing movement across client sectors, from banks to asset managers to hedge funds.”
144;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-07-23T19:39:51Z;Robusta coffee in biggest ‘squeeze’ in 3 years;‘Contango’ is sign of high demand in contracts for immediate delivery;The robusta coffee market is witnessing the biggest so-called “squeeze” in more than three years, where a dominant holding by one player could leave some investors and traders with multimillion dollar losses.The “July squeeze” — as it has come to be known in the coffee market — has driven up the front contract for robusta, the lower quality bean used mainly in instant coffee, compared with the following month.The structure, known as “backwardation” or “inverse”, is a sign of high demand in contracts for immediate delivery.July robusta coffee has fallen 2 per cent this week to $1,802 a tonne, dragged down by the commodities rout, but the difference between the July and September contracts widened as much as $146 a tonne, the widest since February 2012.The market for robusta, traded in London, has had occasional bouts of sharp volatility as hedge funds and trading houses have built up large positions.Traders and analysts said the moves were technical, with active buying by one or more players at the start of July taking traders and investors who had taken bearish bets by surprise.“It’s a very smart position play based on the short-term dynamics of the exchange,” said one trader.The open interest — or contracts held by investors or traders — against July deliveries stood at 2,569 contracts on Wednesday.Normally the open interest for a contract will fall to almost zero the closer it gets to the expiry date.With only a few days left to trade the July contract, which expires at the end of the month, there were people “still waiting until the last second to pull the trigger and to get out”, said the trader.The last prominent squeeze was orchestrated in 2009 by Anthony Ward, the head of coffee and cocoa hedge fund Armajaro, when the price difference between two contracts jumped to $360 a tonne. Two previous squeezes in 2007 and 2006 drove the premium to $520 and $430 a tonne, respectively.This month’s robusta squeeze comes amid heightened awareness over market manipulation after the scandals in Libor, foreign exchange and gold markets.Commodities trading regulation is also one of the issues debated among US and European regulators.Over the past few years, commodities exchanges have been imposing limits in the number of contracts that any single trader could hold at any given time. These would make the squeezes more difficult or even impossible.Analysts pointed out that there was a large difference between the limits on the coffee contracts traded in London and New York.Both are now owned by Intercontinental Exchange since it bought the New York Stock Exchange, the owner of Liffe, in 2013.The position limits for New York and London coffee trading are not identical, but the front month limit for ICE arabica coffee traded in New York is 500 lots, while the delivery limit for Liffe robusta coffee in London is 7,500.This article’s description of the futures structure has been amended.
145;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-07-09T19:04:39Z;NYSE outage fails to speed up IT upgrade;Switch to new system still two years away, despite new glitch;The New York Stock Exchange has no immediate plans to speed up a planned technology upgrade, despite revealing that it was a software update that halted trading on some of its markets for more than three hours.The exchange suspended activity on Wednesday on its famous trading floor after encountering problems with a new software release, intended to test new requirements for trade timestamps. Trading in the securities listed on its markets, and via its electronic platforms, continued to function normally although the exchange had to cancel thousands of open orders.However, even after this high-profile outage, the exchange will maintain its plans to upgrade to a new system gradually over the next few years, said people familiar with the situation.Intercontinental Exchange, the NYSE’s owner, had acknowledged that the exchange’s technology needed to be upgraded shortly after purchasing it for £11.bn in late 2013. It is working on an extensive plan to bring the five NYSE equity and options exchanges on to one “matching” engine — the part of the system where trades are executed.NYSE Arca, the electronic equity securities market, will be the first venue to move on to the new platform, known as Pillar, in the next few months. Other NYSE markets, including the one shut down on Wednesday, will be migrated to the Pillar trading technology platform “throughout 2016-2017”.Previous exchange outages — such as the three-hour disruption to trading on Nasdaq two summers ago — prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission to demand tougher standards for technology infrastructure. Critical operators, such as NYSE and Nasdaq, are to be required to reduce the occurrence of problems and improve their resiliency when glitches occur. They have until November to comply with the standards.However, some traders pointed out that a bigger concern would have been an outage affecting the exchange’s opening or closing auction. Business gravitates to the big exchanges at the start or end of day, as they provide benchmarks for thousands of investment funds and stocks.Trading glitches from 2007 to the present day.Continue readingCredit Suisse has estimated that the NYSE captures about 18 per cent of daily US equity volumes in the last 15 minutes of trading. During the day, that level dwindles to less than 2 per cent.Other traders suggested that the system’s ability to cope with the NYSE outage highlighted the benefits of a fragmented system, in which daily trading is shared by more than 40 exchanges, alternative trading venues and bank desks.Nevertheless, the system has drawn criticism for its complexity, and the difficulty in easily applying technology upgrades. NYSE began to notice issues early in Wednesday’s trading but chose to shut down activity at its own venue — rather than trading in the securities listed on it.Many barely noticed a change as business migrated to other venues — notably Nasdaq and Bats Global Markets. “We stopped trading on the NYSE and just traded with other venues,” said Jonathan Kellner, chief executive of Instinet, an agency brokerage. “The system seemed to function normally. The technology we and others put in place was working pretty well.”
146;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;NYSE resumes after glitch halts trading;Exchange blames ‘technical issue’ rather than cyber attack for rare suspension;The New York Stock Exchange managed to reopen shortly before its closing bell, more than three hours after an “internal technical issue” halted trading in all $28tn worth of stocks listed on the bourse on WednesdayNYSE — owned by Intercontinental Exchange — said there was no reason to suspect that a cyber attack lay behind the highly unusual disruption. Chief executive Tom Farley told CNBC “it’s not a good day”.The bourse, which has a 25 per cent share of the cash US equity market, suspended trading at 11.32am New York time, adding that all open orders would be cancelled. Trading resumed at 3.10pm, slightly after the exchange’s earlier target.The stock exchange said it had chosen to suspend trading because of the “internal technical issue”, and that the halt was not the result of a “cyber breach”, a danger that has concerned security experts in recent years.The exchange later attributed the fault to a “configuration issue” and said NYSE-listed securities had traded on other exchanges during the outage.White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that President Barack Obama had been informed of the situation but there was “no indication that malicious actors were involved”.Mary Jo White, chair of the Securities Exchange Commission, echoed a Treasury spokesman in saying that the regulator was also “closely monitoring the situation”. The SEC has introduced rules to require exchanges to strengthen critical market systems by November this year.Technical glitches that paralyse entire markets are rare, but Nasdaq, one of NYSE’s main rivals, broke down for more than three hours in 2013, abruptly halting trading in 2,500 US companies including Apple, Google and Microsoft. That was one of the biggest stock market trading disruptions since Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the September 11 attacks of 2001.$28tnValue of stocks listed on NYSE in September 2014Nasdaq attributed the 2013 halt to a disruption at a feed that disseminates all quotes and prices for stocks listed on its exchange, but it was not immediately clear what had caused Wednesday’s suspension at NYSE. The biggest US exchange also suffered a glitch in 2012 , but that only led to trading in 216 companies’ stocks being suspended for most of the trading day.The NYSE’s market share has tumbled as technology and regulation have allowed competitors into the market. From being the dominant venue for Dow Jones and S&P index components at the turn of the century, it now trades less than a quarter of all US share trading volume.US equity exchanges have proven increasingly prone to technical mishaps in recent years, ranging from the “flash crash” of 2010 to periodic outages, as the technology underpinning stock markets has grown more complex and fragmented.Nevertheless extended technical glitches on the NYSE are rare as it has humans on its floor working to help determine the price of shares. Those traders’ handheld devices take data from banks to the floor.The exchange added that its electronic trading venues, NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex/Arca Options, were unaffected.NYSE’s suspension is far from the first “technical issue” the industry has faced.Continue readingNasdaq and BATS, two other exchange operators, declared self-help against the New York Stock Exchange — a move to direct orders from the respective exchanges to bypass the NYSE to maintain the flow of trading. Nasdaq said its systems were operating normally and were trading all stocks.Frederic Ponzo, chief executive of GreySpark Partners, a financial markets consultancy, said it was still quite exceptional for the NYSE to halt trading in all of its securities.“The matching engines [where trades are executed] at NYSE are split by groups of securities. Normally they’d halt just one of them. The one thing they all have in common is the client gateway that connects all the customers to the market,” he said.In 2013 ICE took over NYSE Euronext in a $13bn deal, including debt, that included the New York Stock Exchange. US cash equities now make up 6 per cent of revenues for the Atlanta-based company, whose main business is in trading and clearing commodity and interest rate derivatives.Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said: “ICE is known for having top technology and emphasising it as much or more than any other exchange operator.”Mr Repetto said that stock prices had not gyrated after the outage because of the availability of other trading venues, including NYSE’s own Arca exchange.ICE shares had already been under pressure before the NYSE suspension, but were down 2.3 per cent shortly after trading resumed.
147;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-07-07T23:03:31Z;CFTC stays ICE’s plan to raise position limits in power contracts;US futures regulator rejects request for eight futures contracts tied to deliveries in NY state;The US futures regulator has pushed back against an effort by Intercontinental Exchange to give speculators more leeway in electricity markets, a rare move in an area where exchange decisions generally go unchallenged.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Tuesday it would stay ICE’s request to increase position limits — caps on speculative holdings — in eight futures contracts tied to wholesale power deliveries in New York state.Outside of some agricultural commodities, US exchanges are empowered to decide position limits based on estimates of deliverable supply with the consent of the CFTC. In 2014, both ICE and rival CME Group dramatically loosened position limits for dozens of power contracts without drawing any objection from the regulator.This time, the CFTC determined ICE’s explanation for its proposed rule change was “inadequate” and “potentially inconsistent” with commodities law. Before approving the change, the agency seeks public input on ICE’s method for estimating the deliverable supply of electricity.The action comes as CFTC plods through the process of passing a new rule tightening position limits in 28 other commodities, excluding electricity. Under the proposal, the commission would take over the job of setting limits from exchanges. Market participants have criticised the CFTC’s own deliverable supply estimates as out of date.ICE proposed to raise position limits in eight power contracts for delivery in Nyiso Zone G — in the Hudson river valley north of New York City — in some cases by sevenfold. The exchange has said it set the spot month speculative position limits for Zone G contracts at 25 per cent of deliverable supply, estimated at 14,105 megawatts.Electricity is a notoriously volatile commodity where supply must equal demand because of the lack of affordable storage. This makes estimating deliverable supply a highly technical endeavour.“It is essential that the estimated delivery supply of these contracts effectively link futures trading to the underlying cash markets,” CFTC said.
148;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-06-25T14:31:49Z;ICE signs new Singapore clearing members;Delayed launch for derivatives exchange expected before the year- end;Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has signed up a further two clearing members for the delayed launch of its Singapore derivatives exchange, adding United Overseas Bank and Phillip Futures after admitting KGI Ong Capital last month.The development is a sign that local banks in Singapore appear to have some confidence that there will be sufficient client demand for the products that ICE will offer when its platform goes live before the end of the year.The lack of bigger international banks so far is in part due to the more complex set of compliance issues they face as compared with Singapore banks, a person familiar with the matter said.Until ICE set in motion plans for a Singapore exchange, global banks’ only prior experience of becoming a clearing member of an exchange in the Asian city state would have been SGX and later — for the few that did choose — the Singapore Mercantile Exchange, which ICE bought in 2013.Matthew Png, chief executive of UOB Bullion & Futures, the futures broking arm of UOB — Singapore’s third-largest bank by assets — said that one reason why UOB was joining was that his bank had seen interest from Asian investors and corporates seeking to diversify their investments through futures and options listed on ICE in the US and Europe.That was one indicator of future demand for ICE’s benchmark products in Asia amid the prospect that ICE may launch them at some stage in Singapore well.ICE has not commented on whether it will do so. But plans by rival Deutsche Börse to kick off its own planned Singapore-based Asian futures exchange will start with offering benchmark futures products already on Eurex, its derivatives arm, in Frankfurt, London and the US.ICE is expected to begin in Singapore with three futures products, on oil, gold and a product tied to the Chinese currency.Ong Ka Thai, chief executive of KGI Ong Capital, said: “As we are witnessing a growing demand for ICE products from Asia, we are pleased to offer these products to our clients and we are committed to be part of this dynamic growth.”ICE said that the establishment of ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore, as its exchange and clearer are respectively known, would “support an expanded customer base and the further development of the derivatives markets in Asia with a local exchange and clearing presence”.ICE has had a presence in Singapore since 2000 serving customers in the global energy markets.
149;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-06-23T10:46:29Z;Moody’s to reassess clearing house risks;Industry worries about new ‘too big to fail’ entities;The credit quality of clearing houses involved in derivatives and whether they are a potential source of systemic risk is triggering a reassessment of the industry by Moody’s, the rating agency.Clearing houses have assumed a crucial role within the massive over-the-counter derivatives industry in the wake of the financial crisis. Regulators have mandated that derivatives move into clearing houses, so that the central authority can collect collateral from entities involved in a trade. This helps cover potential losses should a counterparty default, with the aim of reducing credit risk and averting the kind of derivative market turmoil that erupted with the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008.But some observers have warned concentrating risk in one place increases the systemic consequences should a clearing house fail, leaving taxpayers on the hook in a crisis. With some in the industry calling clearing houses “too-big-to-fail” institutions, regulators are on a fact-finding mission with the intention of eventually introducing global standards for stress tests, to assess their ability to cope in difficult market conditions.Against that backdrop, Moody’s has put out a request for comment from industry participants to create a new methodology and rating for clearing houses.“We believe these institutions have always had a very elevated systemic risk profile,’’ said Ana Arsov, associate managing director at Moody’s, who spearheaded the development of the methodology. “But now with the mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives their profile is even more elevated.”The agency currently produces ratings for some of the exchanges’ holding companies that also run clearing houses, such as CME Group, the London Stock Exchange, which owns LCH.Clearnet, and Intercontinental Exchange.But all of these ratings use existing securities standards and are not specifically designed for rating clearing houses that process large amounts of OTC derivatives trades.“[The new methodology] will reflect our opinion first and foremost on the ability of the clearing house to meet its clearing and settlement obligations to its members and then to determine the financial loss that could result if clearing houses were unable to meet these obligations,” Ms Arsov said.It divides the assessment of a clearing house into four broad categories: intrinsic credit strength, operating environment, qualitative adjustments and affiliate and systemic support.The last of these seeks to address the issue of a clearing house requiring government support if it failed.“What is the significance of the products being cleared, what is the market impact if a clearing house defaults and what kind of public involvement would be required,” she said. “These are all things that we would take into consideration to decide if a systemic support uplift in the rating is warranted.”
150;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-06-17T17:04:14Z;Global cotton futures contract clears hurdle;Bill takes step towards removing obstacle on where bales are grown;Intercontinental Exchange moved a step closer to listing a new cotton futures contract linked to delivery points around the world after clearing a legislative hurdle in Washington.A bill amending the US Cotton Futures Act to remove an impediment to the global contract passed the House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday.Atlanta-based ICE is home to benchmark cotton futures used by farmers, merchants and textile mills. But the contract dating to 1870 requires bales of cotton grown in the US, limiting its usefulness as other countries widen their share of the world market.Last year market participants agreed the outlines of a “world” cotton futures contract to be listed on ICE, accepting bales grown in Australia, Brazil, India, the US and several countries in west Africa. The new contract would allow deliveries to the US, Australia, Malaysia and Taiwan.But US law was an obstacle as it required cotton tendered under any US-listed futures contract to be sampled and graded by the US Department of Agriculture. ICE’s soft commodities exchange is regulated in the US.The legislation advanced by the committee would give ICE more flexibility, allowing different laboratories to inspect cotton at foreign ports and giving the exchange leeway in deciding how much cotton needs to be sampled when it arrives, congressional and industry officials said.“This is a market-oriented initiative reflecting the modern realities of the global cotton market,” said Austin Scott, a US representative from Georgia state.A similar measure passed the House last year but was stripped out of a Senate spending bill late last year by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, people familiar with the legislative process said. Mr Cruz’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Bill May, president of the American Cotton Shippers Association, said a world contract had become necessary as US farmers planted soyabeans and corn on land once devoted to cotton. The bill “offers another opportunity for cotton merchandisers to have a vehicle to hedge their risk”, he said.Global cotton trading is led by commodities houses such as Louis Dreyfus Commodities’ Allenberg Cotton division, Cargill, Glencore, Noble Group and Olam.US law was not the only reason the world cotton contract has been slow to get off the ground. ICE officials have had to deal with Malaysia’s requirement for permits for all inbound cotton shipments and strict new sanitary and phytosanitary rules on the import of agricultural goods.Taiwan was added to the list of delivery points since traders first agreed the outlines of the new world cotton contract.Cotton merchants have at times struggled to secure US bales to meet futures delivery obligations. In early 2011, prices reached records above $2 per pound amid a perceived cotton shortage, leading to losses, defaults and lawsuits. ICE July cotton was 63.98 cents/lb on Wednesday, down 0.7 per cent.
151;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-06-15T16:27:32Z;US crude futures volumes eclipse Brent;WTI trading volumes top daily average of 1m;West Texas Intermediate crude, once derided as a broken oil benchmark, is enjoying a comeback.Volumes of futures tracking the yardstick have averaged 1m contracts a day this year through May, up more than 45 per cent from the same period of 2014, exchange data show. WTI has also sped ahead of volumes in rival Brent crude, less than two years after Brent unseated WTI as the most heavily traded oil futures market.The resurgence of WTI trading follows a 44 per cent plunge in oil prices from a year ago. Big price swings invigorated trading in both Brent and WTI, but the latter has attracted more.WTI has also regained a more stable connection with global oil prices after suffering glaring discounts because of transport constraints at its delivery point of Cushing, Oklahoma. The gap led some to question WTI as a useful gauge of oil prices.“I guess the death of the WTI contract was greatly exaggerated,” said Andy Lipow of consultancy Lipow Oil Associates.But in the past two years, new pipeline capacity of more than 1m barrels a day has relinked Cushing to the US Gulf of Mexico coast, narrowing the discount between Brent and WTI to less than $4 a barrel.Mark Vonderheide, managing partner of Geneva Energy Markets, a New York trading firm, said: “With WTI once again well connected to the global market, there is renewed interest from hedgers outside the US to trade it. When the spread between WTI and Brent was more than $20 and moving fast, WTI was much more difficult to trade.”Futures exchanges CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange both list WTI and Brent. CME registers more than 80 per cent of WTI volumes, however, while ICE is dominant in Brent.CME said it’s “seen robust growth across all of our energy products,” particularly WTI. ICE declined to comment, but a first-quarter financial report noted its share of the total crude futures market had slipped to 50 per cent from 55 per cent in the same quarter of 2014.Atlanta-based ICE blamed the shift on “increased volatility in WTI crude oil prices relative to Brent crude oil prices, which drove more trading by non-commercial firms in WTI, as well as increased financial incentive schemes offered by competitors”.ICE and CME both offer fee discounts and other incentives to entice high-volume traders. Timothy Massad, chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said in a recent speech he was “looking at the adequacy of disclosure by exchanges” of incentive programmes.The exchanges will face a third competitor when Nasdaq launches energy futures including WTI and Brent in coming weeks. Nasdaq plans to undercut the incumbents on costs and is offering nine months without fees.In the first five months of 2015, average daily volume in WTI totalled 1m contracts on CME and ICE combined. Combined volume in Brent was 876,000 contracts a day, up 35 per cent from the same period a year before.The shale drilling boom that pushed the oil market into glut has also been driven by small and middle-sized energy companies that need to lock in forward sales with futures contracts.“The bulk of those are US companies with WTI-related risk,” said Paul Horsnell, head of commodities research at Standard Chartered. He said WTI “is still weak in terms of suitability as an international marker”.

They use commodity derivatives to hedge the costs of the materials they buy.Under Mifid II, however, buyers and sellers of commodity derivatives face tougher restrictions on trading in capital markets. The changes would remove exemptions for commercial users that use instruments such as swaps to offset their risks, forcing them to raise the amount of capital they must hold on their balance sheets.Many companies dealing in commodities complain that would be tantamount to treating them as banks, even though they do not pose the same risk to global markets.“At no time has the commodity sector required direct or indirect support from government tax receipts,” the letter said.Europe’s financial authorities are scheduled to deliver draft regulations in September. They would come into force at the start of 2017.The letter echoes concerns voiced by several leading commodities traders over the past several months.Paul Reed, BP’s chief executive of integrated supply and trading who is also a signatory of the letter, told the Financial Times’ commodities conference in April, that the regulations could have “very worrying” side effects on commodities prices.Trafigura and Louis Dreyfus, leading commodities trading houses, have also voiced worries.
153;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-05-20T21:33:17Z;CFTC takes aim at Isdafix manipulation with Barclays case;Settlement is the first over interest rate swaps benchmark;Barclays has become the first bank to be fined in the long-running investigation into alleged manipulation of US interest rate swap contracts, through a global derivatives benchmark known as Isdafix.On Wednesday, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined Barclays $115m for attempting to manipulate the benchmark over a five-year period ending in 2012. At that time, the benchmark was owned by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, an industry trade body.Isdafix is used by traders to set the prices for interest rate swaps — traded derivatives contracts that can be used to manage potential exposure to interest rate moves. They allow two parties to exchange one stream of interest payments for another, over a set period of time.Without the Isdafix benchmark, traders would have to call active dealers for price quotes on these swap contracts.Isdafix was also used to help dealers mark their swaps portfolios and other trades to the market price, for financial reporting purposes. It was established in 1998 by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and has grown to be the leading industry benchmark.Isdafix was set based on submissions from a panel of 16 banks, which submitted the rate at which they would buy and sell a benchmark swap with a notional value of $50m, each day before 11am US Eastern time. It provided rates for the euro, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, sterling, the Swiss franc and the US dollar.Beginning in 2002, ICAP, the UK interdealer broker, collected the US dollar quotes and the rate was calculated by Thomson Reuters, which eliminated the four highest and the four lowest submissions and took the average of the remaining submissions. For all other currencies, Thomson Reuters did both the collection and the calculation of rates.Barclays was fined by the CFTC in part because its traders made false submissions to the rate setting process.On Wednesday, the CFTC used several examples to highlight how the benchmark could be manipulated to the bank’s advantage. One related to options settlements from 2008.A senior Barclays trader told the bank’s broker to buy the spreads in swaps at higher levels. “On this day, Barclays stood to receive more in cash settlements from its counterparties the higher the 10-year US dollar Isdafix,” the CFTC said.Global regulators began issuing subpoenas to market participants over Isdafix in 2013. As they deepened their investigation, Isda took administration of the US dollar rate away from ICAP in early 2014.It subsequently awarded control of the benchmark to Intercontinental Exchange, the US derivatives exchange operator that also took over responsibility for administration and surveillance of the Libor bank lending rate.ICAP and other banks are still being investigated by the CFTC for their role in the alleged rigging of Isdafix.“ICAP continues to co-operate with information requests and the CFTC’s wider inquiry into this area but as it is ongoing we cannot comment further,” the UK group said in a statement.Moving oversight of the benchmark to a regulated exchange is in line with global regulatory standards published in July 2013.The rules were updated to enable regulators to fine traders and institutions for manipulation of benchmarks in several markets, as well as take into account the broader industry trend of trading more interest rate swaps electronically rather than over-the-phone. ICE will change the way the rate is calculated, relying on tradable quotes from execution venues, rather than bank submissions.
154;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-05-20T10:05:33Z;Jean-François Théodore, architect of Euronext, 1946-2015;Frenchman combined the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels markets, and beat London to Liffe deal;Jean-François Théodore, who has died aged 68, had a dream to create a single continental bourse to trade stocks and derivatives. He went a fair way towards achieving it. As investors increasingly began trading across borders, he became the architect of the Euronext exchange.Euronext called him a “market man and a confirmed European”. The gentlemanly Frenchman spent decades on a quest to turn the Paris stock exchange into a world financial player.He had taken charge at that national exchange in 1990 and, by the turn of the millennium, bourses were beginning to shake off their sleepy past as stock trading utilities to embrace derivatives and commodities. As exchanges began to adapt to this changing customer base, Théodore, a classic product of the French establishment, became one of the most respected industry consolidators: a consummate dealmaker.During his first 10 years in the role, a combination of self-deprecating Gallic charm and dogged perseverance enabled him to combine the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels stock markets, as well as the French commodity and derivatives markets, into a single trading venue. Called Euronext, it added Lisbon shortly afterwards.But his next big move, in 2001, shocked the rest of the industry: Euronext acquired Liffe, the fast-growing London interest rate derivatives exchange, from under the nose of the London Stock Exchange. His £550m deal — which was worth slightly less than the LSE’s cash and shares bid — was considered a masterstroke of negotiation and a blow that the London exchange still calls “the one that got away”.However, Théodore’s grand vision of uniting the enlarged Euronext with the German and London markets failed to become a reality as bourses spent years squabbling while seeking other consolidation deals. Euronext merged with NYSE in 2007 and Théodore, by then one of the longest serving exchange chief executives in Europe, retired shortly afterwards.Market man and a confirmed EuropeanFollowing this deal, the two companies failed truly to integrate, and a plan to merge the company with Deutsche Börse was blocked by European antitrust regulators. That opened the door for Intercontinental Exchange to step in with an $11bn takeover of NYSE Euronext. When the US derivatives bourse operator then split the business and kept the Liffe operation, Euronext returned to independent ownership, based in Paris.Despite the short life of NYSE Euronext, investors recognised that the jewel in the crown — accounting for up to half of the purchase price — was Liffe, at a stroke justifying Théodore’s persistence in pursuing the deal.Théodore, the son of a civil servant, was born on December 5 1946 and grew up in Paris, attending Sciences Po university before going on to the even more prestigious ENA — the elite training ground for France’s senior civil servants, where only around 80 students a year graduate.He began his career at the French Treasury, where he worked under Jean-Claude Trichet, later head of the European Central Bank, helping to oversee a wave of privatisations of French companies, most notably that of television channel TF1 in 1987.A classic polymath in the best French traditionMaking the well-trodden path in France from government to the upper echelons of business, he was appointed head of the bourse three years later.After retiring in 2009, he remained part of the Paris business and political scene, working for instance to assist companies such as Total adjust to tougher US rules on compliance. Last September, however, he was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He is survived by his wife Claudine and three children.Théodore “was a classic polymath in the best French tradition”, according to a former employee. Passionate about opera, he was often seen walking the aisles of the majestic Palais Garnier in Paris — yet he loved to travel and was equally at home talking about obscure films. He was a regular at the Cercle des Economistes conference in Aix-en-Provence where the French establishment goes once a year to network, drink chilled rosé and listen to classical music.
155;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-05-12T11:15:06Z;Mooted clearing of options on credit indices raises concern;Potential move by ICE represents shift to riskier derivative products;Intercontinental Exchange is aiming to expand its role in safeguarding derivative products, a key objective of post-crisis regulation.ICE, a major credit clearing house, is looking to be the first clearer to bring options on credit default swap indices into its remit with this move.In theory, this will protect the financial system against the failure of a major user of credit derivatives, such as a bank or hedge fund, but critics say these are riskier products and the move could backfire.Regulators pinpointed derivatives, particularly credit vehicles, as a key component of the most recent crisis and have mandated that trades for standardised products be processed via centralised clearing.A keystone of financial reform, clearing houses stand between two parties transacting swaps, and such pooling of counterparty risk is seen as preventing a repeat of the turmoil sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.In the wake of regulators pushing for greater clearing of derivatives, some in the industry have expressed concern about a race to the bottom, whereby clearing houses, focused on profit growth, include products that are less liquid than so-called plain vanilla derivatives such as interest rate swaps and credit indices.“I am an advocate of clearing but one of the main risks is that you end up clearing products that are illiquid, without broad market support, that bring in serious risks from a liquidity and default management perspective,” says Athanassios Diplas, former credit risk manager at Deutsche Bank and former member of ICE’s risk committee.Clearing houses and market participants are able to voluntarily clear trades, subject to regulatory approval, and some banks are keen to see more products pushed into clearing to allow for capital and netting efficiencies, saving money.ICE declined to comment on whether it is looking at clearing credit default swap options, or swaptions, but four market participants with knowledge of discussions, including two members at the clearing house, said it planned to make a decision by the end of the year.“We are in constant communication with our customers about the products and services they are looking for to meet their risk management needs, and any new products we offer would be based on feedback from our customers and clearing risk committees,” said ICE.Credit default swaptions give market participants the right but not the obligation to enter into a credit default swap (CDS). The gross notional value of CDS index swaptions outstanding stood at around $450bn for the week ending May 1, according to figures from the Depositary Trust Clearing Corporation. By comparison, underlying CDS indices, which reflect a broad basket of company credit exposure, have an outstanding notional value of $6.3tn.Credit default swaptions are a bifurcated market — dealers tend to sell contracts that give the buyside the right to buy protection at a later date.Because dealers tend to be on the same side of the market, it makes hedging trades between banks difficult. Instead, dealers hedge using other products, such as the underlying CDS, which is already required to be cleared.“You do not want an unbalanced portfolio. You want to get your hedges in the same place,” said a senior credit expert at a US bank. “There are some products we wouldn’t advise be put into clearing because of the liquidity issues. That’s what you have to worry about. But in some index swaptions I think there is enough liquidity.”But some fear that this ignores the risks involved in clearing some products.“It is a tricky product,” says Mr Diplas. “Most dealers are often long or short at the same time, so if one of them defaults it could be challenging to find someone to take the other side of the trade.”
156;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-05-03T13:48:58Z;Nasdaq tempts energy traders with extended fee holiday;Exchange launches aggressive challenge to win share from rivals CME and ICE;Nasdaq is planning an extended fee holiday to tempt traders to its new energy market, mounting an aggressive challenge to the two reigning oil and gas futures exchanges.The upstart Nasdaq Futures exchange plans to launch 28 energy contracts at midyear as it diversifies beyond stock trading. Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, has argued energy markets are a “monopoly” dominated by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange.“The exchange will assess no transaction fees for energy products to any market participant during the initial nine months,” Nasdaq disclosed in a regulatory filing. Options Clearing Corporation of Chicago, which will settle the trades, will also suspend clearing fees for nine months, the filing said.According to FIA, the futures industry association, 1.16bn energy futures and options contracts were traded worldwide last year. CME and ICE together generated about $1.2bn in energy revenue last year.Nasdaq’s efforts illustrate the difficulty of grabbing market share from established futures exchanges. Traders tend to flock to the deepest markets where they can enter and exit without moving prices. CME and ICE also require contracts executed on their exchanges to be processed at their own clearinghouses, inhibiting movement across venues.CME and ICE are locked in a battle already in the energy market, both listing identical contracts such as Brent crude, Henry Hub natural gas and gasoline.Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said of Nasdaq’s venture: “It’s got an uphill battle. You have two strong incumbents in one of the few highly competitive product lines in futures.”A top CME executive told analysts last week he was “absolutely, acutely concerned” about the threat from Nasdaq. But Derek Sammann, CME’s global head of commodities and options, added that Nasdaq was moving into a sector “with two very robust, competitive, dynamic market participants already”. ICE declined to comment.Nasdaq will also pay a stipend to market makers committed to buy and sell energy futures above certain volumes, according to another filing. Exchanges commonly use incentives, such as volume-based rebates, to attract market participants.Energy futures tend to generate higher fees for exchanges than financial futures tracking interest rates and stock indices. The collapse of oil prices in the past year has also spurred airlines, energy companies and hedge funds to add positions. Open interest in ICE’s Brent listing last month topped 2m contracts.When Nasdaq announced its energy futures market in March, Mr Greifeld said he would halve costs for traders. More than a dozen brokers, proprietary trading firms and physical commodity traders including Goldman Sachs and Virtu Financial have signed on to support the exchange.“We certainly believe monopolies are against the natural order of competitive forces,” Mr Greifeld said in March.This article has been amended to correct the spelling of the surname of Derek Sammann.
157;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-04-28T18:19:42Z;Centralised risk raises systemic worries over derivatives;Clarity needed on liquidity and clearing models;Six years after the financial crisis exposed the systemic dangers of derivatives, the industry faces questions as to whether risk management systems will contain the next major bout of market turmoil.On Tuesday FIA Global, the futures industry trade association, will add its voice to a growing debate about the role of clearing houses, the centralised risk managers charged with bolstering market stability. FIA will call for greater transparency and disclosure from clearers for banks and broker-dealers to help identify credit and operational risks.This comes after regulators put pressure on the global market since 2009 to push more swap trades into clearing houses, entities that stand between investors and banks, tasked with ensuring a deal is completed should one side default.However, uneasiness pervades this fundamental market shift, with some worried that global regulations have not created a resilient framework that could function in the event of a major financial institution failing. While the risk associated with derivative trades is being collected in one place, via clearing houses, the potential for systemic pressure, however remains in place.The Bank of England, for one, has expressed concerns that clearing houses are being asked to take on risk management for market liquidity, when they were built for managing counterparty credit risk.“It’s largely the reshuffling of risk — it’s not gone away,” says Craig Pirrong, an academic at the University of Houston in the US. “Regulators have not taken a truly systemic approach to analysing risk.”Market participants say that clearing houses’ differing and opaque risk models mean risks cannot be consistently compared. Chief among them is that clearing houses’ risk models are “procyclical” — meaning they require more margin for derivatives portfolios during times of market stress, which is also the most difficult time for traders to find more stable liquid assets.Neither regulators nor market participants want a replay of Lehman Brothers, whose failure in 2008 exposed a huge interlinked world of trades across the market and thus threatened other institutions.But now the majority of the world’s derivatives trades will be handled by just four clearing houses, owned by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange of the US, Germany’s Deutsche Börse and LCH.Clearnet, controlled by the London Stock Exchange Group.To insulate themselves against the next financial meltdown, two issues persistently dominate industry debate — greater financial participation by clearing houses and more transparency in their risk management models.Dennis McLaughlin, chief risk officer at LCH.Clearnet, the world’s largest swaps clearer, says customers worry: “What if Lehman happened again tomorrow?”He adds: “Customers want to know two things: how safe is my money in the default fund, and are you going to ask me for any more?”Users of clearing houses are “members” who contribute to a mutual default fund and are prepared to share losses. The clearing house also contributes to the fund — so-called “skin in the game” — but it grows increasingly expensive for large users. JPMorgan and Citigroup are leading the calls for more direct contributions, although it has been strongly resisted by CME, LCH and Eurex.“Clearing house skin in the game is generally a negligible percentage of the overall default fund,” says Mariam Rafi, US head of OTC clearing at Citi. “However clearing houses are for-profit entities. They decide the risk model, they determine what new products are going into the clearing houses. It brings up the question of misalignment of incentives.”Behind the FIA’s warning is a nagging fear of another Hanmag Securities. The South Korean futures broker went bankrupt in late 2013 when an errant algorithm racked up nearly $45m in losses in just 143 seconds. The local clearing house, KRX, dumped the losses on other users.Regulators are beginning to address concerns. Next year the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organization of Securities Commissions will require clearing houses to publish their models for calculating their users’ risk, in the hope it will assuage customers’ worries.“The bankers should be reassured as to the risk modelling when the quantitative disclosures are introduced. They’re going to go from a black box to southern French nudist colony,” says Thomas Krantz, senior adviser, capital markets at Thomas Murray, a markets consultancy.He, like the FIA and others, warns of the need for more vigilance. Banks and brokers are also calling for standardised stress tests, so they can compare the risks. CPMI-Iosco has promised a review, but it has only started a new debate as to which model would be deep and transparent enough to give users reassurance, without publicising sensitive market positions.Still, others worry that about a homogenised market in which the majority of derivatives trades are among a handful of clearing houses all using similar risk models, and deciding which instruments are introduced into the mutual default fund.“It’s never going to be an easy mix when you take an interbank market and stick it into capital markets,” says Mr Krantz.www.ft.com/tradingroom
158;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-04-20T08:13:35Z;Clearing houses hit back at European plans;Risk managers say Brussels’ markets proposals underplay risks to financial stability;A group of seven European derivatives exchanges operators have hit back at regulators’ plans to give investors greater choice to trading futures and options, saying law drafts underplay risks to financial stability.The seven warned that advanced European plans to require derivatives clearing houses to link to each other — intended to stimulate competition and lower trading costs — pose a threat to market stability and customer protections, “especially in distressed conditions”.The warning was delivered to the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) by Deutsche Börse, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Euronext, the London Metal Exchange, Bolsas y Mercados Españoles, the Athens Exchange and the ICE-owned Holland Clearing House. They also warned that plans clashed with European rules and global standards.Clearing houses, which act as counterparties to trades, concentrate markets risk and have moved to the forefront of global policy makers’ plans to underpin world markets.In Europe their elevated role has created tension between two camps as Brussels also looks to finalise markets rules for transparency, competition and investor protections over the summer.Europe has already mandated that exchanges and clearing houses allow rivals to connect to their venues, but policy makers have included a caveat that allows operators to deny access if integration threatens market stability.Regulators are still debating the precise conditions that would allow operators to shut out rivals. Critics, led by many in the City of London, have argued stringent conditions would be tantamount to allowing a market monopoly.The seven warned that “commercial concerns should not cloud the potential risks” created by forcing the interlinking of clearing houses with different risk management models and capital buffers.Their response was also a riposte to a letter by the London Stock Exchange Group, Nasdaq, interdealer broker ICAP and LSE-controlled LCH.Clearnet, to Esma two weeks ago that called on regulators to open up markets and inject more competition.The seven said European drafts did not yet fully meet the mandate set out by European policy makers to guard against systemic risk. “The ability of . . . [EU regulatory authorities] to deny access is disproportionately and unreasonably limited.”It also countered the charge made by the LSE, ICAP and Nasdaq that the changes would help the European economy.“A fragmented market is not what the real economy needs. The end users of markets — from pension funds to asset managers, from miners to industrial companies, from farmers to manufacturers — want deep, liquid markets where they can effectively and efficiently manage price risks,” the letter said.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

China’s exports slumped 15 per cent in March, raising the prospect of disappointing first-quarter economic growth.The market capitalisation of Hong Kong-listed shares set a new record on Monday, passing the HK$30tn mark for the first time to close at HK$30.55tn. The Hong Kong share market has risen 17.6 per cent in the past month, making it the best performer in the world this year outside the Chinese mainland.The surge in valuations comes as investors, wary of increasingly frothy valuations in Shanghai and Shenzhen, switch into lower priced Hong Kong stocks. A move by the Chinese authorities to give mutual funds access to the Hong Kong market via Stock Connect has also boosted share volumes in the territory.As a result, a host of companies now eclipse their global rivals. CCB, China’s second largest lender by assets, has risen by a fifth in the past month, giving it a market capitalisation of US$248bn. It is now the 15th biggest company on the FTSE All World index, and the third ranked bank after local rival ICBC and US-based Wells Fargo.Other price changes have been equally impressive. Online games maker Tencent — up 27 per cent over the past month — is now larger than Amazon, Oracle, and Samsung Electronics, while Air China has a bigger market cap than Singapore Air and Cathay Pacific combined, following a 42 per cent rise.Citic Securities, China’s leadering brokerage, has gained 45 per cent over the past month. At $61bn, it now has a significantly larger market cap than either Blackstone or Credit Suisse. China Merchants Bank rose by 25 per cent on Monday alone, putting it ahead of Barclays, Mitsubishi UFJ, and Royal Bank of Canada, with a market cap of $91bn.The arrival of billions of dollars from mainland China has triggered a 65 per cent appreciation in the share price of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, valuing the operator at $44bn, comfortably above global rivals.The HKEx has now displaced the US’s CME Group, with a market capitalisation of $31bn, from its long-held position as the world’s largest exchanges operator in the past month.The Hong Kong bourse also outstrips fellow US derivatives exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange which owns the New York Stock Exchange and has a market valuation of $25bn. The London Stock Exchange Group is worth $13bn and Deutsche Börse $16bn (see chart below).The increase in activity has raised expectations for the earnings performance of HKEx and the Hang Seng index is now up 12 per cent since the start of the month, a rally that shows little sign of ending.Hong Kong’s benchmark index closed above 28,000 points for the first time since 2007 on Monday. At that time, China’s GDP growth had hit 14.2 per cent, whereas currently, data set for release on Wednesday are due to show GDP growth of 7 per cent for the fourth quarter of last yearSuch has been its success in recent weeks that HKEx executives are already talking about boosting the daily quota to allow more Chinese money to flow in.Illustrating the importance of China to its business, HKEx also said on Monday it had established a new corporate unit devoted to trading with the mainland.
161;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-04-08T09:43:58Z;Japan’s annual coal benchmark influence on the wane;Spot prices gain appeal in an oversupplied market, and premium will please Australian miners;Japan’s annual supply agreements, which run from April, the start of the country’s financial year, remain one of the most important events in the thermal coal calendar.But trying to pick a winner from this year’s negotiations is not straightforward.Is it the Japanese utilities, which saw their call bill fall by 17 per cent compared with last year, or Rio Tinto, which outmanoeuvred its bigger coal rival Glencore in signing the first agreement?That deal, struck at $67.80 a tonne, was the lowest in eight years but the fall in the Australian dollar means the miners are getting slightly more than last year’s contract.Moreover, looking at what the Japanese are to pay over the market price, the premium of almost $10 a tonne “is bigger than any point over the past 15 years”, says Macquarie analyst Stefan Ljubisavljevic, even though the market is oversupplied.“Over the past six years, the contract has been set at an average premium of $7 a tonne and $4 to spot and the forward market, respectively. This year’s settlement substantially exceeds these levels,” says Mr Ljubisavljevic.But for all the frisson around this year’s negotiations, there is a sense in the coal market that the importance of this annual ritual its gradually waning.The Japanese are among the world’s biggest consumers of seaborne thermal coal, used to generate electricity.The April settlement is used by other Japanese utilities and Australian miners, their suppliers of choice, to price their deals. They also acted as a reference price for contracts across the Asia-Pacific region.The April-March contracts have historically accounted for about half of Japan’s annual coal imports of 140m tonnes. However, that figure has fallen in recent years as some Japanese buyers have switched to quarterly supply agreements and shorter-term deals that reference indices such as GlobalCoal NEWC.The changes come against a backdrop of oversupply and weak prices— coal shipped from the Australian port of Newcastle has dropped 30 per cent in the past year to $58 a tonne — that has made thermal coal a buyers’ market.Even the Japanese, who revere tradition, and more importantly understand the need to secure high-quality Australian coal for their boilers, realise they are in a stronger negotiation position and in a falling market may not necessarily fix all their needs through longer-term contracts.Ted O’Brien, chief executive at coal research firm Doyle Trading Consultants, says: “The Japanese are cognisant of the quality needs but they will not pay a price above what they think the market is worth just to lock in their volumes.”This situation is expected to continue until the glut is cleared and the market balances itself. This could take several years as the producer reaction to the fall in prices has been relatively slow because of lower oil prices and falling commodity currencies. The Australian dollar, for example, has fallen 20 per cent in the past year against the US currency.“There is too much capacity in the market. The fall in prices has not resulted in rationalisation so far,” says Andy Roberts, director of international thermal coal at Wood Mackenzie. “We think it will be five-six years before you see any turnround.”It is still not clear how many tonnes will reference this year’s first deal between Rio and Tohoku Electric. Talk in the market is that it could be around 10m-20m tonnes, according to traders and analysts.Apart from sluggish prices, structural changes in the coal market are also eroding the importance of the April negotiations.Contractual tonnage is still the main method of pricing coal into Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. But for Chinese buyers, spot market transactions have become more commonplace over the past couple of years, says Matthew Boyle, analyst at consultants CRU.That is also reflected in the rising volumes of swaps on the open market as buyers use derivatives to hedge their physical coal exposures. Data from Intercontinental Exchange show the volume of the Newcastle futures market represents 230m tonnes in 2014, up from 112m in 2011. In the first three months of this year, volumes stand at almost 90m tonnes.The volumes are still modest but are increasing steadily, says Carlos Fernandez Alvarez, senior coal analyst at the International Energy Agency.Most market participants agree the benchmark is not going to disappear immediately as the Japanese utilities will need to feel some security in their coal supplies. The “nuclear phobia” that has gripped Japan since the Fukushima earthquake means that most nuclear power plants are unlikely to come back online soon.Nevertheless, another factor that will further push the Japanese utilities to spot or shorter contracts is the liberalisation of the retail electricity market in 2016. It is unclear how much immediate competition in retail prices there will be, but Japanese traders say it would be politically unacceptable for utilities to be seen to be buying coal at the same benchmark price.On a practical level, once full liberalisation starts, utilities will need to compete by looking for low procurement costs. One way to do that would be to buy less on annual contracts.
162;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-03-23T09:49:52Z;CME and ICE to go head to head with new cocoa contracts;Market players say Big Chocolate will ultimately decide;Let the cocoa wars begin. On March 30, rival exchanges — the CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange — will go head to head in the cocoa futures market as they both launch their new euro denominated contracts.The winner will be responsible for one of the key commodity benchmarks, which affects the price of the chocolate bar as well as the incomes for millions of smallholder cocoa farmers.With almost 70 per cent of the world’s cocoa used by the $150bn chocolate industry coming from west Africa, cocoa is subject to high levels of volatility. This raises hedging needs as well as trading opportunities in the futures market.One large cocoa trader says it will ultimately be the big chocolate makers such as Nestlé, Mondelez and Mars at the end of the cocoa supply chain that decide the winner of the euro contracts.Cocoa, which is a relatively niche commodity compared with other agricultural contracts such as corn or soyabean, is already traded in two futures markets. In 2013, ICE, which operates the New York cocoa contract, took over NYSE Liffe, owner of the London cocoa futures, ending up with both products.But CME will introduce a new physically delivered euro cocoa contract — and another in dollars, which is settled in cash — while ICE, keen to protect its market position, is to also introduce a euro contract.The CME’s move is its first into physically settled “soft” commodities, which include coffee and sugar. If the launch is a success it would pave the way for the exchange to break ICE’s stranglehold on those markets.Jeffry Kuijpers, CME’s executive director of agricultural commodities, says the exchange had been in discussions with market participants, such as cocoa processors and chocolate makers, over the past 18 months.“The driver of the new contract is to fix the issues that affect the cocoa market,” he says.Users of the existing London sterling contract have been concerned about the lack of competition to ICE. They have also been frustrated over the queues in the physical warehouses, a situation that has dogged the metals markets, says the CME. The existing contract also represents bagged cocoa rather than loose lower grade cocoa, which comprises 65-70 per cent of the commodity traded in Europe.The CME’s new physically delivered contract will have an innovative prepayment of “delivery-out” charges, meaning the seller pays the costs when the cocoa is taken out of the warehouse, unlike in many other commodities where the buyer has to pay the fees.The CME contract will also have a 21-day load-out limit, compared with ICE’s 60-day limit, which was introduced last April. It will be priced against bulk cocoa and there will be a new grading process for the beans to guard against quality deterioration in the warehouse.A euro contract will also make trading easier for the big European chocolate makers, and many of the African producers whose currencies are linked to the euro, says Mr Kuijpers.ICE, meanwhile, says it has brought in changes to the existing contract since it took over Liffe, introducing new warehousing rules and building relationships with its contract users through “product committees” — something that large users also acknowledge.“We’ve made a concerted effort to spend time with the product committee and made significant changes in a very short period of time based on their feedback,” says Ben Jackson, chief operating officer of ICE Futures US.I am not looking forward to next week. The big fear is that there will be less trading due to the uncertaintyWith the new contracts coming into the market on top of the existing two, some are concerned about the impact on overall trading.Jonathan Parkman, co-head of agriculture at commodity brokers Marex Spectron, says: “I am not looking forward to next week. The big fear is that there will be less trading due to the uncertainty.”There have been plenty of new commodities contracts that have been launched only to fall by the wayside, the latest being the new Paris-based milling wheat contract introduced by Euronext this month.The CME acknowledges the difficulty in trying to change established habits, and has introduced an incentive scheme for users who commit to trading the new contract. Eight users and five market makers have signed up for the programme, where they will be offered incentives including fee discounts.“We have 13 companies who have a vested interest in making this contract work,” says Mr Kuijpers.Nevertheless, it is the big chocolate makers who are likely to dictate which contract comes out on top.“The critical mass will only come when chocolate companies show their support by referencing their prices against the new contracts,” says one cocoa trader, adding that he would not move his hedges on the existing ICE contract unless his customers demand a price against a new euro contract.Some market participants predict that the size of the cocoa market will mean here will probably be enough liquidity for two contracts — one in euros and another in dollars. Many expect the existing sterling contract eventually to cease trading.The big question is whether the new CME contract is attractive enough to take trading away from the incumbent operator ICE.Says Mr Parkman: ”Every dog has its own fleas. There’s no such thing as a perfect contract.”
163;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-03-20T09:44:54Z;ETFs pour into top US oil contract;Nearly a third of WTI futures owned by exchange traded funds;Almost a third of the most active US oil futures contract is now controlled by exchange traded funds, turning smaller investors into a muscular force on global commodities markets.ETFs track baskets of securities or commodities in a convenient wrapper that trades on a stock exchange. Money has flooded into funds tracking West Texas Intermediate crude this year as investors try to pick a bottom. The benchmark was $45.75 a barrel on Friday, less than half the price of a year ago.Analysts at ETF Securities said oil ETFs now hold between 175m-180m barrels equivalent of WTI for delivery in May, the most active futures contract. This is about 30 per cent of combined open interest in May WTI on the New York Mercantile Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange, the main energy futures bourses.The funds’ new heft in the global oil market is “attracting more and more attention” from professional oil traders, said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix, a Swiss-based consultancy. After oil staged a modest rally earlier this month, Goldman Sachs argued that “the key force pushing commodity markets higher has been retail investor inflows into oil ETFs”.Investors this year have pumped more than $2bn into the US Oil Fund, the largest oil ETF, bringing assets to $3.1bn. The fund now owns contracts for 64m barrels of WTI, a 10-fold increase from a year ago.Only a fifth of the fund’s shares are held short, or as bets on a decline, suggesting the “bulk of USO investors are either long or have some sort of complicated trade or hedge”, said John Hyland, the fund’s chief investment officer.Oil ETFs are not limited to retail: among the investors with a large recent position in the US Oil Fund was Kynikos Associates, the hedge fund founded by Jim Chanos, according to a filing.Investors buying and holding an oil ETF have the odds stacked against them. This is because WTI prices slope upward for future delivery dates, meaning the funds can afford fewer barrels of oil each time they sell an expiring month’s contract and buy a new one. Goldman Sachs warned that “any upside to price returns is being significantly eroded by losses on roll yields”.Oil ETFs last ballooned in early 2009 as crude prices bottomed out during the financial crisis. While the spot price of WTI more than doubled that year, the US Oil Fund rose only 50 per cent because the upward sloping price pattern, known as contango, ate into returns.“Contango is deadly. If you’re going to own one of these things that’s susceptible to contango you’ve got to be a trader,” not a long-term investor, said Herb Morgan of Efficient Market Advisors, a US money manager specialising in ETFs.The boom in oil ETFs has also boosted participation numbers on futures exchanges. The number of outstanding May 2015 WTI contracts on Nymex is 53 per cent higher than open interest in the May 2014 contract a year ago.
164;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-03-16T17:47:56Z;US regulator CFTC fines ICE $3m for data reporting violations;Exchange misstated prices and omitted daily reports for nearly two years;Intercontinental Exchange reported erroneous trading data — including natural gas prices 1,000 times their actual level on one occasion — to its main US regulator for more than a year, according to a government order fining the exchange group $3m for data violations.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s case against the ICE Futures US commodity exchange underscores the watchdog’s tougher stance on exchanges, which act as self-regulatory bodies that enforce market rules. A 2013 CFTC lawsuit against the New York Mercantile Exchange, a unit of CME Group, over leaks of secret customer trading information is being litigated in federal court.Between October 2012 and at least May 2014, the ICE futures exchange in New York submitted trading reports containing “thousands of errors and omissions” to the CFTC, the agency said in the order, which was approved on Monday. These mistakes included missing daily reports on ICE’s energy markets and incorrect prices in futures contracts including coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton, orange juice, and the US dollar index. Natural gas settlement prices in October and November 2012 were reported at 1,000 times their real value, CFTC said.When the commission staff first notified ICE in 2012 about the errors and omissions, the exchange responded that the problems would be fixed with a conversion to a new data-reporting format. But many problems persisted into 2014, CFTC said.Aitan Goelman, CFTC enforcement director, said: “Today’s action makes clear that registrants who fail to meet their reporting obligations will be held accountable and that the CFTC takes a particularly dim view of reporting violations that continue over many months, especially after CFTC staff has repeatedly alerted the registrant in question to the problems in its reporting.”ICE, which neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, declined to comment.The violations began just after ICE moved its large over-the-counter energy swap derivatives market on to its regulated US futures exchange in a pioneering move towards what is now known as “ futurisation”, the order said. Other OTC swaps derivatives contracts have since been converted to futures, helping traders escape the burdens that come with trading swaps under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.The CFTC order is a black eye for ICE, known as a technological innovator in the exchange industry. The order also requires ICE to create a chief data officer and hire three additional quality assurance staff dedicated to regulatory reporting.The CFTC case against Nymex has entered a court-ordered mediation programme for settlement purposes ahead a trial scheduled later this year.
165;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-03-13T18:10:09Z;NYSE owner warns of cyber risk to high-frequency trading;ICE chief warns new electronic sentries may slow down the markets’ flash boys;The owner of the New York Stock Exchange has warned that its efforts to fend off cyber hackers could reverse the momentum towards ever-faster markets, piling fresh pressure on the “flash boys” of high-frequency trading.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange, said that the growing risk of cyber attacks would force traders to pass new electronic sentries as they connect to his exchanges, which include the landmark equity bourse and important futures exchanges.His comments introduce a new complication for automated traders, who have been under fire from regulators, particularly since the Michael Lewis book Flash Boys accused them of benefiting from “rigged” stock markets.The markets had undergone an “arms race for speed,” Mr Sprecher told the FIA futures industry conference in Boca Raton, Florida this week.But with the emerging threat of cyber attacks: “We’re going to need to authenticate people. We could go to encryption, which takes time and capacity. So the idea that this is going to get faster, faster, faster and more and more open — because of ‘cyber’, the pendulum is going to have to go the other way,” he said. “The industry is going to have to follow that lead and get used to this.”The comments come as hacking metastasises into a more serious problem for large companies and exchange operators. CME Group, a rival futures exchange to ICE, disclosed it was hacked in 2013. US authorities have been investigating cyber attacks against American financial institutions, and Sony Pictures suffered a damaging hack, allegedly at the hands of North Korea.The idea that this is going to get faster, faster, faster and more and more open — because of ‘cyber’ the pendulum is going to have to go the other wayTim Massad, chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told the FIA conference cyber security was “perhaps the single most important new risk to market integrity and financial stability”, even as the regulator reviews the effects of automated trading strategies.Exchange executives outlined how they had tried to keep up with the main cyber threats, which Richard Clarke, the former White House security adviser, coined as CHEW — crime, hacktivists, espionage and war. Andreas Preuss, chief executive of Eurex, the derivatives exchange of Deutsche Börse, said that if exchanges did not work together to get cyber attacks under control they would pose “big systemic risks”.Mr Sprecher said ICE’s 2013 purchase of NYSE — whose colonnaded building is perhaps the ultimate symbol of capitalism — made the company “a much more front and centre target”.He added that ICE board’s risk committee used to be primarily preoccupied with financial risks to its clearing houses, which serve as a crucial backstop for derivatives trades. Now, “the bigger risk to the company is more likely a cyber attack. So when the risk committee meets, they still deal with economic risk, but it’s increasingly about cyber risk,” he said.
166;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Nasdaq looks to halve energy trading cost;Stock market operator plans low cost futures exchange;Nasdaq plans to halve the cost of trading energy with the launch of a new, low-cost futures exchange that executives believe will challenge the current dominance wielded by the CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange.The US exchange group, best known as a stock market operator, took aim at what it called a “monopoly” as it formally announced the launch of Nasdaq Futures, a commodity market that will list contracts in oil, natural gas and US power.Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, explained his view of the commodities market with a joke about Hillary Clinton, who is facing intense scrutiny over her personal email exchanges while serving as US secretary of state.“What do CME, ICE and Hillary Clinton all have in common?” he said at the annual Futures Industry Association conference. “They all think they have a monopoly on their exchanges. We’re here to disabuse people of that notion.”Energy futures are a rare market where competition does exist, albeit between two behemoths. CME and ICE battle over market share in oil and gas, with CME offering free trading in Brent crude, the global benchmark. However, energy is a lucrative business for futures exchanges. CME’s average rate per contract in energy is $1.272, compared with $0.711 for equity indices and $0.474 for interest rates.Volumes in oil are also picking up as big price swings return. CME reported record daily energy volume in February, including all-time high volume in its flagship West Texas Intermediate crude contract. Energy volumes on Intercontinental Exchange also rose in February from a year before, including a 61 per cent increase in volumes in its Brent crude contract.Energy futures are a rare market where competition does exist, albeit between two behemoths. CME and ICE battle over market share in oil and gas, with CME offering free trading in Brent crude, the global benchmarkTrades executed on ICE and CME are sent to clearinghouses owned by each exchange operator, an arrangement known as a “vertical silo”. Clearinghouses act as the buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer on an exchange, spreading the risk of a default across its members.Nasdaq’s trades will be cleared at the Options Clearing Corp of Chicago, which already offers clearing for other exchanges. Mr Greifeld said its “horizontal” clearing model would help deliver a “greater than 50 per cent reduction” in the cost of trading energy. Nasdaq hopes to gain 10 per cent of overall energy volumes, executives said.CME cast doubt on Nasdaq’s strategy, with Phupinder Gill, chief executive, saying it was hard to compete “if your value proposition is simply price”.Nasdaq has been aggressively trying to spread beyond equities trading, where profits have contracted amid tough competition. Previous initiatives include the $750m purchase of eSpeed, a government bond trading platform, and the launch of NLX, an interest rate derivatives platform in Europe. It also has a European power business.Nasdaq said a total of 19 brokers, proprietary trading firms and physical commodity traders had committed to support the exchange, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley as well as Virtu Financial, the proprietary trading firm.The Nasdaq contracts would be “lookalikes”, settling against physically settled energy contracts listed on CME and ICE.
167;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-03-11T15:24:51Z;Clearing houses get insurance policy;Potential ‘too big to fail’ entities gain extra protection;"A consortium of 20 top-rated global insurance companies are underwriting a policy for clearing houses that would limit losses for users of derivatives and possibly taxpayers in the event of market turbulence.The scheme aims to create an extra layer of protection for clearing houses, which have become a critical component of the global derivatives industry since the financial crisis.Clearing houses mutualise the risk between individual buyers and sellers of various derivatives and ensure deals are completed in the event of a default. They are viewed as being the next “too big to fail” entities in the event of a future financial crisis, potentially requiring a bailout from taxpayers.The insurance policy would create liquid securities in a bankruptcy-remote trust, and they could be drawn on immediately. GCSA, a US-based consortium, has been working on the plan for more than a year, and described it as a way to help resolve simmering tensions between market participants and operators that have grown out of new responsibilities for clearing houses.“It’s catastrophic risk that the insurance industry is well adept at providing,” said David Hardy, chairman. “Deploying the willing resources of the global insurance market rather than the finite resources of the members seems the most logical way forward.”The centrality of clearing houses at the heart of the financial system has not only fanned fears that they are a source of future vulnerability. Big customers like JPMorgan and Citigroup are fighting with clearing house operators such as LCH.Clearnet, CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange over how much each side should contribute to a mutual fund for defaults, while large asset managers like Vanguard are worried a failing clearing house could take a slice of the margin they post for their trades.It’s catastrophic risk that the insurance industry is well adept at providingThe issue of funds for clearing houses was among the chief topics at the annual Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton, Florida. Clearers also rely on “assessment powers” that allow them to call on members to stump up additional billions in a crisis — creating large and unquantified liabilities for banks such as JPMorgan and Citigroup.Emily Portney of JPMorgan said the assessment powers at CME’s clearing house totalled $19bn but the clearing house had only $100m of regulatory capital backing it. “Will the assessment layer be there in time or not? Is that enough to align incentives?” she asked. The CME disputed the figures.The GCSA scheme is called CoCo insurance but it is not a contingent convertible. “Ironically it’s about committed certainty of cash,” said Chris Cononico, co-founder. ""It’s a more cost-effective way than using a clearing house’s equity and it’s much better than leveraging up.”None of the insurance companies in the consortium are members of clearing houses and they are capable of offering up to $10bn in protection. Although not a new idea, it has not been tried on such a scale before.Under the intended scheme, the policy is written by the insurance consortium to the clearing house to cover losses if they exceed the monies in the default fund. The claim benefit is then sold by the clearer to a bankruptcy-remote trust via a sale and repurchase, which then issues securities to the clearer. The clearing house can sell the securities into the market immediately for cash. If a claim occurs, the insurers pay the cash amount of the claim and the clearer has no further liability."
168;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;China turns up the heat on ICE;CSRC resistance challenges futures industry;China has often been a haven for copycatters despite governments efforts to crack down on the phenomenon.That has led to a perception that China is the world’s copycatter-in-chief of everything from mobile phones to industrial processes.Now Beijing has turned to the global futures industry and said: “You know these copycat contracts you’re so fond of launching for time to time? Don’t even think about doing that — anywhere, never mind in China.”Let’s back up a bit. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) was due to launch two commodity futures contracts on its new Singapore exchange this month — one on cotton, and the other on sugar, They were based on similar contracts already offered by the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE).It was a cheeky move, especially since I understand that ICE did not ask ZCE to negotiate a commercial agreement to do this — presumably because there was a high probability that the Chinese exchange would refuse.Not only did ZCE send a “cease and desist” letter to ICE, but the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country’s securities regulator, got in touch with the Monetary Authority of Singapore to reinforce what a dim view it took of the plans.I do not know how often the Chinese regulator gets on the phone to other regulators in Asia to express concern about an issue, but I imagine it is not very. And only when someone is pretty keen to make a point.Yet surely such a stance flies in the face of global futures industry norms.Launching so-called “lookalike” contracts has become standard practice — witness the Osaka exchange’s Nikkei-225 contract that was launched after Simex invented Nikkei-225 futures in Singapore the 1990s.Not only that but there is legal precedent for it in the US. In 2006 ICE launched a WTI contract in direct competition with the CME’s Nymex contract. Nymex sued, but lost in court.Doing lookalikes can be a way to disrupt the competitive mix in a particular contract — as in the case of ICE’s WTI contract — or it can help to drive liquidity, or both. The two Nikkei-225 contracts coexist quite happily and are heavily arbitraged by traders who like to play one off against the other in their trading strategies.The issue that has been forced into the open by the ICE situation in Singapore therefore poses a real challenge to the futures industry.What does this mean for other exchanges that had thought offering lookalikes on Chinese contracts might be a viable strategy?Presumably it changes their perspective.Second, Singapore is now off limits for offering lookalike Chinese contracts. That is not the best news for a city-state that is looking to build itself up as a hub for risk management, centred on a growing community of exchanges and clearing infrastructure. Deutsche Börse is due to launch its Asia clearing house on the island next year. And Singapore is growing as an offshore centre for the renminbi.What about avoiding Asia altogether and launching such lookalikes in the US instead? Possible. But that probably presents a dilemma for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when it comes to approving such contracts.Would it really want one of those calls from the CSRC in China?
169;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;China legal threat dents ICE’s Singapore plans;Zhengzhou bourse demands that US group stop launch of new platform;Intercontinental Exchange has been forced to delay the launch of its new Singapore platform after a Chinese exchange threatened legal action to stop the US group launching two commodity futures that are copies of contracts offered in China.The move by the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange is likely to send shockwaves through the global futures industry because it signals that China will not tolerate foreign exchanges copying its futures contracts, and comes despite the practice of offering “lookalike” contracts being accepted around the world for years.It also highlights how China appears determined to challenge a long-accepted industry norm in the way futures markets function, just as big global banks are assessing plans by China to open up its Shanghai futures markets to foreign participation.The country’s futures markets are seen as offering enormous potential for growth as Beijing relaxes capital controls and as big Chinese companies’ appetites grow for hedging and risk management.ICE had planned to launch its Singapore exchange, based on the Singapore Mercantile Exchange which it bought in 2013, this month. Two of the launch contracts were to have been cotton and sugar futures similar to those already traded on the ZCE.However, upon learning of the plan, ZCE in December sent ICE a “cease and desist” letter, demanding that the US group halt its plans for those contracts, according to people familiar with the situation.The China Securities Regulatory Commission then contacted the Monetary Authority of Singapore to ask the city-state’s watchdog to ensure that such contracts were not launched.One person said ZCE threatened legal action if ICE did not drop its plan, which it has since done.ICE declined to comment. But Jennifer Ilkiw, ICE Asia-Pacific vice-president, said: “Our customers have expressed an interest in being better able to manage their exposures in China.”Neither ZCE nor the CSRC responded to requests for comment.The MAS said: “MAS is aware of the delay in the launch of Intercontinental Exchange. As a matter of policy, we do not comment on our confidential dealings with individual financial institutions.”The intervention of the CSRC in a case beyond China’s borders is a signal that authorities in Beijing are determined not to allow any copycat contracts to be offered on exchanges even if they are outside the country.In recent years exchanges have increasingly copied contracts offered on rivals’ platforms as a way of grabbing market share.ICE challenged CME Group, owner of the New York Mercantile Exchange, in 2006 by launching a version of Nymex’s West Texas Intermediate crude oil future. Nymex failed in a legal challenge against the move in a US court.The Osaka Securities Exchange in the 1990s launched Nikkei-225 index futures in competition with an existing Nikkei-225 contract that was invented by Simex, the former Singapore commodity exchange that is now part of SGX, the Singapore bourse.The move by China to stop foreign exchanges listing copycat contracts “does seem to set a new paradigm”, said a senior exchange executive in Singapore.ICE is set to launch its Singapore exchange in May, starting with futures on Brent crude oil and on gold.
170;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-03-08T16:22:42Z;ICE chief Jeff Sprecher warns London risks losing derivatives lead;Shift to other markets likely to accelerate unless forthcoming EU rules are toned down;London risks losing its position as the world’s leading centre for derivatives trading amid an onslaught of new European regulations, one of the world’s biggest exchange operators has warned.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of New York-listed Intercontinental Exchange, said business was already moving to the US and Asia. That shift would accelerate unless new rules, such as the European Union’s Mifid II rule book, were toned down.“Europe is going one step further in trying to inject a new [competitive] market structure into trading . . . that will be different from the rest of the world,” he told the Financial Times. “I think it really competitively hurts Europe.”ICE, which has its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia but the bulk of its operations in London, was founded by Mr Sprecher 15 years ago. It has become one of the world’s top three exchange groups, with a market capitalisation of $25bn and ownership of the New York Stock Exchange.Over the past decade, Mr Sprecher has spent millions of dollars developing London-based trading benchmarks, such as the industry-standard Brent oil contract. “I would never do that again in Europe,” he said. “I’m betting that a lot of business will gravitate towards Asia.”The cumulative effect of the regulations means London-based contracts could in future “easily be 80 per cent more expensive” in terms of the “margin” or collateral that trading clients are required to deposit to underpin a trade, Mr Sprecher said.The US and Europe have similar rules on derivatives, but Mifid II will add an extra layer of European regulation in 2017. Clients would vote with their feet, he predicted. “It’s amazing how sensitive the market is to these changes in collateral. Europe immediately becomes non-competitive,” Mr Sprecher said.London hosts a wide range of derivatives trading, from commodity futures to over-the-counter interest rate swaps. Nearly half of the world’s OTC interest rate derivatives trading takes place in London.But the City’s grip on European credit default swaps, another traditional area of strength, is already weakening. About $3tn of the $19tn CDS market has been routed through ICE’s US operation, rather than London, in recent months.In April, ICE will launch a handful of futures contracts in Singapore, including a copycat version of its flagship Brent crude contract.Any hit to the City’s dominance in derivatives would come amid a bitter debate about its future as a banking centre. Last week it emerged that both Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland were considering big cutbacks in their investment banking operations.The predicted cost inflation around London-based derivatives trades is founded in a complex interplay of new rules, designed to make the system safer.In part, the rules address the knock-on effects of separate bank regulations imposed in the wake of Lehman Brothers’ collapse. These force banks to process trades through clearing houses, the post-trade outfits that guarantee safe delivery of contracts and payments, rather than conduct them bilaterally with clients.The European Market Infrastructure Regulation has obliged clearing house clients to deposit more “margin” as a safety buffer, while Mifid II would add further capital requirements.ICE last week submitted critical comments on the minutiae of the proposed rules to regulators at the European Securities and Markets Authority. Mr Sprecher said he was drafting a personal letter to Esma to express his dismay at the big-picture ramifications.
171;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Last shout looms for US option traders;Open outcry is giving way to electronic trading for these derivatives;CME Group is consigning its futures trading floors, once home to thousands of noisy traders, to history. But one section of the floor will shout on: the options pits.The question on the minds of options floor brokers and traders is how long they will last. Electronic trading is gaining ground for these derivatives, which entitle holders to buy or sell shares or futures contracts at a given price by a certain date.Options markets are buoyant overall. At CME, which lists options on markets such as interest rates and grain, options volumes rose 38 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter to a new record.At exchanges that list options on US stocks, stock indices and exchange traded funds, volumes rose 3.4 per cent to 4.3bn contracts in 2014, their second highest level ever, according to a survey from Tabb Group, a capital markets consultancy.Conditions are propitious for options trading as uncertainty grips US interest rate markets and oil prices have plunged, bringing back volatility.Despite this trend, there are some ominous signs for the floor. At CME, half of options are now traded electronically — up from 13 per cent in 2009. At futures markets run by rival Intercontinental Exchange, no options on futures have traded “open outcry” since its New York soft commodities pits closed in 2012.Options can be far more complex to trade than securities or futures, however, which accounts partly for the continued presence of the human trader. Phupinder Gill, CME chief executive, has signalled he is in no hurry to push all trading on to screens, saying the floor is popular for complex options structures.“The integrity of the marketplace is paramount for us,” Mr Gill told analysts. CME estimates the annual cost of running trading floors at around $50m ahead of the futures pit closures.CME’s crosstown peer CBOE Holdings, which operates the largest US options market, says simple retail trades have already gone fully electronic but large and complex orders remain the domain of open outcry. More than 60 per cent of CBOE’s proprietary products — including popular options on the Vix volatility index and the S&P 500 — are traded on the floor.“When our customers say [they] get no value add from bringing that trade on the floor, those pits will close — but we have not seen any of that yetWe have a massive amount of interest in Vix, SPX [S&P 500] and Russell options that really need and require those face-to-face negotiations — the floor from that perspective has many years ahead of it,” says Ed Tilly, chief executive.Still, Mr Tilly says the company is agnostic when it comes to floor trading. “We’ve built our systems so that our customers can view us as 100 per cent screen-based or . . . take orders outside the electronic format,” he says. “When our customers say [they] get no value add from bringing that trade on the floor, those pits will close — but we have not seen any of that yet.”Even so, some argue that the options floor is still likely to go the way of futures as the marketplace becomes global and technology improves.“Options use a lot of complex maths modelling, like Black Scholes. They also trade a lot more complex strategies, like butterfly trades. Some can have trades of up to 10 legs,” says Hazem Dawani, chief executive of OptionsCity, a Chicago-based software company that provides tools for electronic trading. “Previously, you would send the trade to the floor and a specialist would price it for you. Now there is software that can calculate it.”60%Percentage of CBOE’s proprietary products that are still traded on the floorTabb estimated asset managers routed 32 per cent of their total contract volume electronically, more than double the amount the year before. But it acknowledged that hedge funds were keen to maintain voice trading, to keep themselves at the forefront of brokers’ attention.Nik Miczek, managing partner of 312 Capital, has been on the CME floor since 1996 and his firm trades eurodollar and Treasury options in the pits. Mr Miczek says they remain viable because of “the type of trades done — many are bespoke combinations that are invented by the brokers and created that day, and they change day to day”.Even if the floors closed, Mr Miczek says it is likely some trading would move to the so-called “call-around market”, which involves traders and brokers using the telephone to work out trades rather than communicating face to face.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York
172;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-02-10T08:41:46Z;CME pit closure sparks member buyout call;Fee structure too complicated, existing members say;The demise of futures trading pits in Chicago and New York has triggered debate over exchange membership, a privilege some now view as a burden in an era of electronic markets.A membership gave traders and brokers access to the once-bustling trading floors of CME Group, the biggest futures exchange operator. CME last week announced it was closing most open-outcry futures trading, abandoning a tradition dating to the 19th century.But memberships are to survive, prompting pointed questions to CME executives at a member meeting last Friday, attendees said. More exchange members are scheduled to see the executives in New York on Wednesday.Ray Cahnman, chairman of TransMarket Group, a prominent Chicago-based proprietary trading firm, told the FT that memberships were a “throwback to when the pits were the main thing. Now they’re not. So you should find a way to reduce them.”Pat Mulchrone, a founding partner of broker Advantage Futures, said CME should buy out members’ stakes.“I think it’ll make the exchange stronger in the long term,” Mr Mulchrone said.Buying out all 8,500 “class B” memberships across CME’s four US exchanges could cost $2bn-$4bn based on recent sale prices, CME estimated. The company said in response to an FT query: “Like all of our customers, class B shareholders provide important liquidity.”Members are still entitled to discounts on exchange fees even if they trade electronically. But memberships can cost millions of dollars as traders must buy or lease at least one for each CME exchange they use, including the Chicago Board of Trade and New York Mercantile Exchange.Mr Cahnman said the membership system gave CME a “more complicated fee structure” than competing exchanges such as Intercontinental Exchange and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex, threatening its appeal as a trading venue.The decision to close futures pits will reduce demand for memberships as individual floor traders exit, said Mr Cahnman, a member and CME shareholder.It would be a big plus to CME stockholders if access to the lowest exchange rates was available without requiring the added burden of owning memberships“With only limited demand for memberships offset by a very large supply of unleased memberships, the CME board has an opportunity to make a tender offer for memberships at prices that are viewed as beneficial to CME stockholders,” Mr Cahnman said. “It would be a big plus to CME stockholders if access to the lowest exchange rates was available without requiring the added burden of owning memberships.”As CME became a for-profit company and acquired other exchanges, it compensated members as they ceded some of the rights of owning a seat. Each member of the Nymex got $750,000 when CME took it over in 2008, for example.Dozens of memberships are available for lease on the CME website, while only a handful of applicants were recently seeking new memberships. A full membership on CME’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange sold for $720,000 on Friday, down from $785,000 in mid-January.
173;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-02-05T19:24:15Z;ICE commits to NYSE for at least 2 years;;The owner of the New York Stock Exchange has indicated it will give the institution at least two years to deliver better performance, batting down speculation its recently acquired bourse was for sale.Intercontinental Exchange said on Thursday it expected the “ Big Board” to be a major contributor to earnings in coming years, although warned it would be prepared to jettison an underperforming division.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of the US exchanges operator, acknowledged the fragmented, regulated world of equities trading was not “ever going to be wildly profitable”, but added the value of the NYSE lay in its listings franchise and data business.“I don’t know why we would get rid of that. I think our shareholders want to participate in the earnings growth of those businesses,” he said on an analysts call.However, he added that “we hold ourselves to growing earnings. If that business is a drag on us and then we can’t use it to grow earnings, then it’s completely insignificant. And unlike a lot of people in the exchange space, you’ve seen us shed businesses.”The comments came as ICE revenues soared from $1.6bn in 2013 to $3bn in 2014, boosted by a full year’s ownership of NYSE and the London-based Liffe derivatives exchange, purchased together in late 2013. Net income in the same period rose from $270m to just over $1bn.A fraction of the revenue came from NYSE, which generated $188m in trading revenue, up 6 per cent, and $367m in listings revenue, up 9 per cent, as the New York exchange attracted top offerings such as Alibaba of China.ICE became one of the world’s biggest exchange groups by focusing on energy futures trading but has pushed into clearing of over-the-counter derivatives as new rules overhaul the market.I don’t know why we would get rid of that. I think our shareholders want to participate in the earnings growth of those businesses [listings franchise and data business]Regulators want clearing houses to risk-manage more OTC derivatives. Risk managers stand between two parties in a deal, ensuring the trade is completed in the event of a default.Clearing house operators are eyeing the new rules as an opportunity to offer their biggest customers — mainly big banks and asset managers — huge savings in trading costs. Offsetting the collateral and margin investors use in the futures and over-the-counter derivatives deals could save customers millions of dollars a day.ICE is the largest clearer of credit default swaps. While the new rules have been in place for nearly two years in the US, persistent delays have plagued their implementation in Europe.Mr Sprecher said consequently many European customers — required to clear their trades for the first time — were moving across the Atlantic.ICE estimated 40 per cent of the $7tn gross notional outstandings clearing last year came from Europe through its US operations, and ICE has opened its US clearing house from 3am eastern time to meet the demand.www.ft.com/tradingroom
174;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-01-27T13:02:34Z;CME to launch two cocoa contracts in challenge to ICE;Exchange group’s move into commodity breaks rival’s stranglehold;The battle over cocoa intensified on Tuesday when the CME Group announced it would launch two new contracts, challenging the dominance of rival Intercontinental Exchange in exchange trading of the key chocolate ingredient.The CME said it was responding to demands from cocoa traders and the chocolate sector for a euro-denominated contract that is physically deliverable, where cocoa will be delivered to warehouses when the contract is settled.The exchange group is also introducing a dollar-denominated contract that is cash settled. Both contracts will be launched on March 30.The move is the exchange group’s first move into cocoa, breaking ICE’s stranglehold in that market. There are two existing ICE cocoa benchmarks — the dollar-denominated contract traded in New York, and a London benchmark traded in pounds.Earlier this month, ICE announced a new euro-denominated contract to be launched in April. The statement was regarded as a pre-emptive move ahead of CME’s announcement. CME officials revealed in June their intention to launch a new Europe-based cocoa contract.Although cocoa is a relatively niche commodity, with far lower trading volumes than the bulk of agricultural products such as grains and oilseeds, the market will be served by five contracts.The CME said it was responding to users’ wishes. “Customers have told us they have concerns about the existing cocoa contracts,” said Jeffry Kuijpers, executive director, agricultural commodities at the CME.He added that in creating the physically delivered contract, the CME had been working with physical cocoa traders, chocolate manufacturers and financial investors for the past 18 months. “We’re confident that we’ve created something the market has asked us to do,” he said.Europe is the largest consumer of chocolate and confectionery, with many of the large trading houses, processors and chocolate manufacturers based in the region. A euro-denominated cocoa contract may attract traders and manufacturers looking to hedge their positions.The currency of the world’s largest cocoa producer, the Ivory Coast, is the CFA franc, which is also pegged to the euro.The new physically delivered contract will have an innovative prepayment of “delivery-out” charges, meaning the seller pays the warehouse load-out fee as opposed to the receiver, as is currently the case in many commodities.This means the traded price will include the load-out charge and will be more transparent and convenient for the buyer, said the CME.
175;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-01-26T23:21:56Z;ICE to change Isdafix calculation;Exchange to use tradeable quotes for key market benchmark;Intercontinental Exchange will next month switch the way it calculates Isdafix in a bid to bolster market confidence in one of the key benchmarks for the interest rate swaps market.The US derivatives exchange said on Monday that it would change from mid-February to publishing rates based on tradeable quotes rather than submissions by a panel of banks.The move is a central part of ICE’s efforts to bolster the integrity of the rates, which serve as key benchmarks and underpin thousands of contracts in the $400tn over-the-counter swaps market.Global regulators have sought to remove conflicts of interest and improve the governance and accuracy of a host of benchmarks that provide critical yardsticks for opaque and thinly-traded markets. In the process, banks have relinquished operating widely-used market benchmarks, such as Isdafix and ones for gold, silver and the Libor bank lending rate. Exchanges like ICE and CME Group have taken over their daily running as they are mandated to monitor for potential manipulative behaviour.Isdafix provides the average prices at which investors would buy and sell benchmark euro, sterling and US dollar-denominated swaps.US regulators have also been investigating potential manipulation of the Isdafix rate for more than 18 months but as yet no charges have been brought against companies or individuals. ICE took over administration of the rate from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association last year.Historically banks would submit their estimates Isdafix to the administrator, which would then publish it for benchmark users. From next month it will take tradeable quotes used by counterparties, as well as order book data on regulated electronic trading venues, to compile the benchmark.“The new calculation methodology for Isdafix is an important step in ensuring market confidence in the integrity of the rate,” said Finbarr Hutcheson, president of ICE Benchmark Administration.
176;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Deutsche Börse takes step nearer Singapore clearing house;Exchange’s expansion in city state is approved ‘in principle’;Efforts by Deutsche Börse to establish a physical beachhead in Asia took a step forward on Tuesday when Singapore approved the European exchange operator’s plans for a clearing house in the city-state to be launched in 2016.The “in principle” approval is another sign of moves by western exchanges to build market infrastructure in Singapore, which has become their focal point for expansion into Asia.Intercontinental Exchange, one of Frankfurt-based Deutsche Börse’s US rivals, last month said it would launch a new commodity and energy futures exchange and clearing house in Singapore in mid-March.Both exchanges, as well as CME Group of the US, are expanding in Asia which, in spite of slowing economic growth, is still seen as offering rich pickings in exchange-traded derivatives as appetite increases for risk management and hedging.Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse’s outgoing chief executive, said in Frankfurt on Monday that the expansion of the group’s activities in Asia reflected the region’s “shift in economic importance and growth”.“Asia has seen a correspondingly rapid rise in demand for safe and integrated exchange services,” he said at an event in Germany.The Börse said the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which acts as both central bank and securities regulator, had approved what will be known as Eurex Clearing Asia, named after the German group’s Eurex derivatives arm.Eurex Clearing Asia would clear “selected European benchmark derivatives listed at Eurex Exchange which are traded during Asian market hours”.This means that German Bund, Bobl and Schatz government bond futures, as well as Dax and Euro Stoxx 50 index futures will all be tradeable in Asia for the first time in the Asian morning. Currently they are only available from after lunchtime, Singapore time.Derivatives listed on “Asian underlying assets” would be added later.Andreas Preuss, Eurex chief executive, said that with the move, Deutsche Börse was “becoming an integral part of the financial centre of Singapore”.“We aim to contribute to its further development and internationalisation,” he added.Last year Singapore’s United Overseas Bank has become the first bank in Asia to obtain membership with Eurex Clearing, the Frankfurt-based clearing house operated by Deutsche Börse.Earlier Eurex took a 5 per cent stake in Taifex, the Taiwan futures exchange, and provided the Bombay Stock Exchange — in which it has a 5 per cent stake — with a new trading system.
177;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Nasdaq plans challenge to energy futures duopoly;Exchange group seeks to undercut CME and ICE fees;Nasdaq OMX plans to break into global oil and gas derivatives markets, invading the turf of established commodity exchanges by offering traders lower fees.The New York exchange group has signed up brokers, trading firms and banks including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to back a new energy futures venture to launch in 2015, industry executives said.Tentative products would include futures and options on West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude as well as US natural gas.The move would make Nasdaq a third contender in an already fierce fight for energy market share between CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, which together list the benchmark oil and gas contracts. Despite the dramatic fall in oil prices and wild swings in gas, energy volumes on both exchanges shrank in 2014.Nasdaq has been aggressively trying to spread beyond equities trading, where profits have contracted amid tough competition. Previous initiatives include the $750m purchase of eSpeed, a government bond trading platform, and the launch of NLX, an interest rate derivatives platform in Europe. It also has a European power business.Nasdaq re-registered its US futures exchange last November after a lapse, a regulatory filing shows. In a notice posted online, the exchange said it planned to add “core benchmark products in crude oil, natural gas, and US power” to its offerings, allowing traders to “access liquidity at below current published market rates”.A person familiar with Nasdaq said executives believed current energy trading and clearing fees did not reflect the efficiencies of what is now a largely electronic marketplace. “The pricing is generally wrong. It’s a lack of competition,” the person said.While executed on Nasdaq computers, trades would be guaranteed by the Chicago-based Options Clearing Corporation, whose executive chairman is Craig Donohue, former chief executive of CME.Javier Loya, chief executive of energy broker OTC Global Holdings, said his company will back the new exchange.“I think it’s a good opportunity for a third party to come in and challenge the vertical silos of both CME and ICE with a different market structure,” Mr Loya said. “Ultimately, clients want to see competition. They want to see fee reductions.”An executive at a large energy trading group uninvolved with the venture was sceptical, however. “They don’t have a competitive advantage,” he said. “They’re trying to enter into a market that is largely dominated by two incumbents that do a very good job, CME and ICE.”Nasdaq’s products would be “lookalike” contracts with prices based on futures at CME and ICE.One potential lure for the exchange is looming position limits on energy speculators. By spreading positions across a few exchanges, a trader could maintain larger bets than if all were kept at one exchange, a futures executive said.Nasdaq said it “works closely with customers to understand the demands of the marketplace and opportunities to provide customers with competitive alternatives and greater efficiencies that leverage our technology and expertise”.
178;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-01-08T09:09:46Z;US still the dominant superpower in derivatives trade;CME’s lead over ICE will continue until Europe’s economy recovers;"Like two cold war superpowers, US derivatives exchanges CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange are turning asset classes and geographies in the world’s markets into their own private duel.ICE’s launch of a new euro-denominated cocoa contract ahead of its rival marks the latest skirmish in an ongoing battle, which encompasses the flagship crude oil futures contract and emerging fights over credit default swaps clearing in the US, swap futures in Europe and new business in Asia.Yet a different story emerges from the world of interest rate futures, used by investors to speculate and hedge against rate moves by central banks and therefore among the most traded derivatives by value in the world.CME this week reported a 19 per cent year-on-year growth in average daily volume to 7m contracts. By contrast, ICE recorded a 28 per cent fall on the same measure, to 1.6m contracts.For ICE, the figures represent a tough start to its first full year offering interest rate futures after it acquired NYSE Euronext for $11bn two years ago to get hold of Liffe, the London derivatives exchange. It turned to Europe to break into the market after being effectively shut out of the US market by ‘Fortress Chicago’, as CME’s near-monopoly in the local market is sometimes known.For the moment that citadel looks as strong as ever, and is underpinned by a regulatory regime that forces investors to close their futures contracts on the same venue they open them.The CME’s volume numbers were a reflection of its dominance in products related to movements by the Federal Reserve, such as Treasury and eurodollar futures. The winding down of the Fed’s quantitative easing programme in October, and expectations of rising interest rates, stimulated demand in two-year and five-year notes on the exchange. Overall interest rate open interest — the total number of derivative contracts still running or ‘open’— increased 28 per cent last year at CME.ICE ascribed the decline on Liffe, now renamed ICE Futures Europe, “to continued low volatility in continental European short-term interest rates”. Demand for short-term hedging products has tumbled as the European Central Bank cut its deposit rate below zero. Not only did volumes fall, open interest was down from 18m contracts to 13m.ICE maintains that “we continue to believe we acquired our interest rate franchise at the bottom of an interest rate cycle”.Intercontinental Exchange has announced the launch of a new euro-denominated cocoa contract ahead of rival CME Group’s entry into the market. The new contract adds to ICE’s existing contracts — the dollar-denominated cocoa contract traded in New York, and a London contract traded in pounds. It comes as CME is preparing to enter cocoa trading with a contract in Europe.Continue readingIndeed, there were bright spots, as evidenced by its distinction between the UK and “continental” trading. Rising expectations that the Bank of England may begin raising rates in the UK meant the bourse twice set daily volume records in its 10-year gilt futures contracts during the year, and surpassed 1m contracts one day in August. It also smashed a five-year old record in daily volume in euro swapnote futures.“The more interesting battle is going to be the one in clearing and over-the-counter open interest — which is the bigger place to attract investors to offset their margin positions,” says Steve Grob, director of strategy at Fidessa, a UK trading technology company. “The story is a bit more subtle than just looking at trading volumes.”Even so, breaking out of the box may prove difficult for ICE. For a start, it is held back by a different market structure in Europe. At the CME investors can trade all along the yield curve, a line that plots interest rates for bonds of different maturities but the same credit quality.In Europe it is split. ICE Futures Europe dominates liquidity at the short end of the curve with Libor-pegged euribor futures. Deutsche Börse’s Eurex controls the longer end, with its Bund, Bobl and Schatz futures pegged to German government bonds.The eurodollar market — so central to the CME’s volumes — is unique. Furthermore European antitrust regulators blocked a merger of Liffe and Eurex three years ago, meaning ICE will have to grow by developing new contracts.ICE last year launched contracts based on the repo-based US Treasury market to compete in the US with CME, and in long-term European government debt to compete with Eurex. Neither initiative has yet gained traction, illustrating the difficulty in futures markets of attracting liquidity from one venue to another. ""I do think the dominant effect is the ECB basically going into “on hold at zero for a long time” mode while the Fed is potentially hiking in a couple of quarters, give or take,"" says the head of fixed income trading at an electronic market maker.The coming year may be another one of dominance by CME until Europe recovers.www.ft.com/tradingroom"
179;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-01-07T10:18:17Z;Sterling a thing of the past in commodity pricing;Cocoa the last bastion of the pound faces new euro contract;"Sterling — once the dominant currency of commodities markets during the golden years of the British empire — now only keeps its status in a handful of raw materials, the largest being cocoa. If some traders get their way, the British pound could become a thing of the past there too.As recently as 1993, sterling was still playing a major role in commodities markets.The London Metal Exchange copper contract was denominated in the UK currency until then and shifted to dollars after the ERM crisis; aluminium traded in sterling until 1987, as was tea until 1992 and robusta coffee, the lower quality coffee bean used for instant granules.That makes cocoa the last bastion of sterling. While the key ingredient in chocolate production trades also in US dollars in New York it is the London-based, sterling denominated contract that still dominates the trading of the physical cocoa market.The role of the UK currency is something of an anachronism, however. Consumption is centred in continental Europe, and a large part of the cocoa processing industry is based in the Netherlands and Germany.With that in mind, Intercontinental Exchange is set to launch a new cocoa contract in London — but priced in euros. The contract appears to have the support of the big traders and processors including Cargill, Barry Callebaut and Olam, which is set to buy processing operations of Archer Daniels Midland.The move by ICE is regarded as a pre-emptive move ahead of rival exchange CME Group’s launch of a European-based cocoa contract. The end result could be that trading could ebb away from the London cocoa futures contract, which was launched in 1928.That said, does the currency a commodity is traded in matter in the age of technology where currency positions can be hedged on foreign exchange markets?Probably not in cocoa. But some countries buying or selling large quantities of raw materials may want to limit the amount they trade in US dollars due to geopolitical or foreign currency reserve management reasons.China is the largest buyer of many commodities and would probably want to be able to offer renminbi for its purchases of crude oil and metals. The country has also been launching commodities exchanges, trading energy, food and metals, which once liberalised could become global benchmarks.Full liberalisation is unlikely to happen soon and the renminbi is unlikely to become a commodity trading currency until it becomes freely tradable and convertible.The Commodities Note is an online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times"
180;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2015-01-06T16:59:55Z;ICE to launch euro cocoa contract;Pre-emptive move to head off movement by traders to CME;Intercontinental Exchange has announced the launch of a new euro-denominated cocoa contract ahead of rival CME Group’s entry into the market.The new contract adds to ICE’s existing contracts — the dollar-denominated cocoa contract traded in New York, and a London contract traded in pounds. It comes as CME is preparing to enter cocoa trading with a contract in Europe.The New York market is favoured by hedge funds and other financial investors while the London contract has been used by physical traders to hedge their positions as they trade their cocoa from west Africa to importing countries.The ICE launch, scheduled for April this year, is seen as a pre-emptive move to head off any movement by cocoa traders to the CME when it launches its new cocoa contract.CME officials said in June last year that it was preparing to launch a Europe-based cocoa contract, although no details have been released.David Peniket, chief operating officer at ICE Futures Europe, said: “Based on an extensive market consultation, there is meaningful market demand due to a commercial need for euro-denominated cocoa contracts.”Europe is the largest consumer of chocolate and confectionery, and a euro-denominated cocoa contract may attract hedging from traders and manufacturers looking to hedge their positions.The large processors, such as Cargill, Barry Callebaut and ADM are understood to be supportive of the new contract as it will help reduce currency hedging costs.The CFA franc, which is the currency of Ivory Coast, the leading cocoa producer, is also pegged to the euro.However, cocoa is a niche commodity and, unlike futures trading in other bulk agricultural commodities such as corn and soyabeans, has low levels of liquidity. Traders say the volumes may not support three contracts in Europe.Derek Chambers, head of cocoa trading at Sucden in Paris, said: “The market is absolutely split on it.”With most traders having the ability to hedge their currency exposure, “a lot of traders, me included, don’t see the need for a contract which would split liquidity between two markets”, he added.Many market participants will take a wait-and-see approach, watching on how much traction any new futures contract will get.It has traditionally been difficult for new futures contracts to gain acceptance among traders.For example, the CME’s Black Sea wheat contract has seen very little trading since it was launched in 2012.
181;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-12-30T09:36:27Z;ICE bans ‘disruptive trading’ strategies;Trades that are designed solely to mislead other traders are outlawed;Intercontinental Exchange has explicitly banned an array of market strategies — from flooding its systems with data to tricking others by cancelling orders — in a tougher stance towards electronic trading groups.Two of ICE’s commodity futures exchanges in New York and Canada late on Monday outlined rule changes that set out detailed lists of prohibited “disruptive trading practices”. They are to take effect on January 14, about four months after exchanges owned by rival CME Group adopted similar rules.Both ICE and CME are in a delicate position, seeking to keep markets fair without choking off volumes from proprietary traders. As self-regulatory organisations they are the first line of defence against abuse. As for-profit exchange operators, they depend on active trading groups for liquidity and revenue.Disruptive trading was made illegal under the 2010 US Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Last year, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued further guidance on banned types of trading including “spoofing”, or entering bids or offers with the intent to cancel them before completion.Such strategies can take place in millionths of a second as traders use algorithms to gauge the price level and depth of a market. One trader is fighting criminal charges that he designed computer programs to spoof commodity and currency futures markets for an illicit $1.6m in profit.ICE said it was now providing “additional clarification” on disruptive practices which were prohibited. These included entering orders with “intent to overload, delay, or disrupt the systems of the exchange or other market participants” and the “intent to cancel the order before execution”.A four-page document attached to the rule notices attempts to illuminate the changes, but an executive at one trading firm warned the rules appeared to rely heavily on judgment calls by exchange regulatory officials.ICE said that using a “momentum ignition” strategy to kick-start price movements was a potential violation of the rule, but only if a trader also intended to disrupt orderly or fair trading, was reckless or misleading or engaged in other shenanigans.Iceberg orders, which divide large orders into segments that are visible to and hidden from the market, would not violate the rules unless used to mislead other participants.The document adds that ICE market regulation officials “may consider a variety of factors”, including a trader’s historical pattern of activity and actions in related markets, as they weigh bringing a case.
182;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-12-16T10:59:27Z;ICE urges caution on European derivatives reform;ICE chief Sprecher warns European plans could damage innovation in futures market;"Intercontinental Exchange has urged Europe to give clearing houses leeway over what products they must accept, warning that lawmakers' plans to open up the derivatives market would remove operators' incentives for innovation.The New York Stock Exchange owner has again warned that trading could move away from Europe if the continent pursues new rules in the coming days to introduce more competition for derivatives.Lawmakers want to introduce competition and flexibility for listed derivatives. Among the changes will be a move that could break the link between some exchanges' control of both their futures trading and clearing products. It would allow customers like fund managers and banks the choice to open a position on one market and close it on another — a move known as “open access"".""One thing the market fails to understand between equities and derivatives is that the NYSE never invents or creates a product,"" Jeff Sprecher, chief executive told FT Trading Room. ""We don't make the decision about where companies want to list their shares. We run a utility business. It's very different from listed derivatives where the exchanges decide to list the products. The real solution is to leave it to exchanges to decide what to allow to be netted with others. Right now there’s tremendous competition for listed products.""His comments illustrate the importance to all exchanges of the final complex, technical language that will be used to underpin the daily workings of the latest Markets in Financial Instruments Directive.Some large fund managers, brokers and the London Stock Exchange Group have been among those calling for the changes. However, the policy is likely to depend in part on the final wording of the legislation, against which policy makers will balance clearing houses' need to manage risks in the financial system. Publication of the planned technical standards is expected in the coming days.The continent has been one of the strongholds for ICE's business during its emergence in the last 15 years, buying the International Petroleum Exchange, Climate Exchange, APX Endex and Liffe, the London derivatives exchange. The latter is one of the biggest assets in European market infrastructure.""If you make clearing a utility, the operator has to make a decision if it's worth it for them. The business that we're in is incredibly global — no one is contemplating netting in listed derivatives.""Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the LSE, has likened open access to the availability of generic drugs like aspirin.""In listed derivatives, that’s a separate conversation over access to indices,"" Mr Sprecher countered. ""That doesn’t mean that new aspirants should have access to the historical success others have invested in. Let the new aspirants take open access and build a new pool of open interest.""Mr Sprecher has invested more than $1bn in his operations in Europe in the last decade and expects ICE to be a winner from the changes as his London clearing house had extensive futures and over-the-counter clearing derivatives business.But he said it was ""unclear if we'll keep investing in London,"" he added, pointing out that ICE plans to launch a version of its closely watched Brent crude contract in Singapore next year."
183;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Euronext makes OTC market push;Exchange’s move reflects global overhaul of rules on equity derivatives;Euronext is to make a grab for the emerging market to clear over-the-counter equity derivatives as a regulatory overhaul takes effect.The European exchange operator will offer a service from next year that treats certain trades negotiated privately between brokers as exchange-registered deals. It will begin with equities but aims to add other asset classes at a later date.Its move anticipates new global rules for markets and banks intended to make derivatives trading safer and reduce leverage in the global financial system. It also underlines how Euronext is looking to reshape its derivatives business following its demerger from US parent Intercontinental Exchange earlier this year.At present OTC equity trades, like equity swaps or contracts-for-difference, are largely settled bilaterally between brokers although some deals have been cleared through LCH.Clearnet and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex.Those costs are likely to rise further as a result of new European rules that will push more OTC trading through clearing houses. New rules have also tightened the amount of capital banks must set aside against their derivatives trades.Policy makers have also introduced incentives for traders to use regulated venues for their deals while bulk of the margin that brokers must post in the clearing house can also be netted by offsetting positions.“What this will illustrate is our drive to build our derivatives business,” said Lee Hodgkinson, head of markets and global sales at Euronext. “It’s about bringing the over-the-counter business on to a regulated platform.”Euronext, which runs exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and London, will begin with equity derivatives from early next year.The technology will be provided by Cinnober, a Swedish trading technology company and registered deals will be cleared by LCH.Clearnet’s French operation. Cinnober also will provide OTC prices as a reference for investors.ICE integrated Liffe, Euronext’s own derivatives operations, but Euronext has sought out positions in undeveloped financial and commodity futures.Among the new initiatives include weekly index futures, rapeseed derivatives and futures and options as a market hedge for when EU milk quotas expire in March.
184;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-12-04T16:54:00Z;ICE to join Europe swap futures battle;US exchange to use licences from Eris Exchange for European trading push;Intercontinental Exchange is to join the emerging battle in Europe with rivals CME Group and Deutsche Börse to trade hybrid fixed income derivatives after finalising a licensing deal for the contracts.The US exchange, the world’s second largest by market capitalisation, will begin trading hybrid swap futures next year after agreeing to take a licence from Eris Exchange, a US start-up that operates in North America.Atlanta-based ICE will also use the licence as the basis for European and US credit default swap (CDS) futures from next year, the companies said on Thursday.Its move sets the stage for a battle among Europe’s largest exchanges to grab market share as new rules on derivatives and bank capital requirements reshape the market.Investors and brokers face mandatory clearing of derivatives trades under new global legislation, but some worry it will add extra cost to trading or force investors to use products that are not tailored to their needs.Swap futures have been touted as having the economic flexibility of a swap with the inexpensiveness of a future. Futures cost less in margin collateral than OTC swaps.CME and Eris in the US — and Deutsche Börse and CME in Europe — have already launched swap futures although take-up has been muted as investors assess and test their usefulness. The London Stock Exchange Group is also widely expected to launch its own products shortly.ICE’s CDS futures contracts in the US will be based on Markit indices. In Europe, the Eris-based swap futures will be euro and sterling-denominated. ICE will clear all of the new products. ICE is already the dominant market clearer for over-the-counter CDS swaps.The agreement will also allow Eris to use its intellectual property beyond its US heartland, although Eris will retain CME Clear to process all its US-based swap futures trades.“We believe we’ve found the magic formula that allows everyone to trade it,” said Neal Brady, chief executive of Eris. “We’re really gratified by the ratification of ICE, a major player in the market.”ICE’s adoption also creates two rival blocs vying for intellectual supremacy of the new swap futures products.Goldman Sachs and other dealers are supporting CME’s swap futures contract — which is also based on a Goldman patent — while the Eris swap contract has the support of Morgan Stanley. Eris is owned by Morgan Stanley and several proprietary trading companies, including DRW Trading.
185;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-11-07T16:33:12Z;ICE to run new gold benchmark;Overhaul designed to raise transparency after rigging scandals;London’s near century-old gold fix will be replaced by an electronic system run by US energy markets operator Intercontinental Exchange, in an overhaul designed to increase transparency in the wake of rate-rigging scandals.The global gold benchmark will be digitally fixed by participants from the first quarter of next year after banks opted out of a system that had been in place since September 1919.The auction will be in dollars, euros and sterling, with bids and offers published in real time and the price updated every 30 seconds.The gold fix is used by producers, consumers and financial institutions to trade bullion bars and value contracts.The overhaul was prompted by greater regulatory scrutiny over financial benchmarks after investigations into fixing of the Libor rate, used by banks worldwide to calculate lending rates.Barclays was fined £26m over alleged manipulation of the gold fix between 2004 to 2013.“This process of updating the fix has been driven by regulatory, not market demand,” said Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault, a physical gold and silver exchange for private investors.“Gold is very likely to follow those interbank lending rates in becoming formally regulated next spring. This should put London bullion ahead of the curve.”A consensus was reached through market consultation involving two surveys and a seminar, said the London Bullion Market Association, which administers the over-the-counter gold market.The association has 11 initial participants to take part in the fix, the LBMA said, without providing names.The gold fix is the third key market benchmark to come under the control of ICE in the past year.It took the responsibility to monitor Libor, the bank lending rate, when it bought NYSE Euronext last November.In April, it won the mandate to administer parts of Isdafix, an interest rate benchmark that underpins thousands of contracts in the $400tn over-the-counter swaps market.Using an electronic gold fix should allow submissions to be more easily traceable in the hope of preventing manipulation.Still, the Libor lending rate was manipulated and that is fixed electronically, said Brian Lucey, a professor of finance at Trinity College in Dublin.“If people really want to manipulate something they will,” he said.Unlike other commodities, gold does not trade on an exchange in London but over the counter by fixing members and investment banks.Before 2004, members of the gold fix used to meet in an oak-panelled boardroom with small Union flags on their desks.Four banks – Barclays, HSBC, Bank of Nova Scotia and Société Générale – announced in July that they would hand over responsibility for the gold benchmark to a third party.In the case of Barclays, the Financial Conduct Authority said former trader Daniel Plunkett sought to influence the 3pm gold fixing in 2012, and the bank thereby avoided paying $3.9m to a customer.The banks’ decision to abandon the gold fix followed a similar move in the silver market.Silver became the first precious metal to switch from a benchmarking procedure run by member banks in a closed teleconference in August.CME Group, whose Comex exchange offers the biggest silver futures contract, won the bid to run the electronic platform used to set the silver price.
186;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Euronext ahead of schedule with cost cuts;Group to deliver €60m cost savings 18 months earlier than forecast;Shares in Euronext moved above its float price after the European exchanges operator said on Thursday it had cut costs faster than expected in its first three months as an independent company.The Paris-headquartered group has been reshaping its business since demerging from Intercontinental Exchange in late June and listing on four of its European markets – Paris, Lisbon, Amsterdam and Brussels. A mixture of cost cuts in technology and relocations of offices meant Euronext hit a planned margin target earlier than anticipated.While the float allowed the group to regain its independence after a seven-year hiatus, its management acknowledged it would have to reorganise and slim operations. A year ago, the company’s figures were still part of the larger NYSE Euronext. Amid weak economic growth in the eurozone, the group’s shares have consistently traded below its €20-per-share listing price.Third-quarter results showed turnover for the three months to September 30 rose from €101.9m to €112.3m year-on-year, on an adjusted basis. The figures were adjusted to incorporate a new clearing agreement with LCH.Clearnet.The performance was driven by the rebound in trading on cash equity markets, sales of market data and a resurgence of listings on exchanges around the world. Turnover from listings fees rose 18 per cent to €13.2m, making it the second largest exchange in Europe by capital raised this year. Shares in the group rose 0.4 per cent to €20.73 in morning trade in Paris.As a result margins on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose from 38.3 per cent to 44.1 per cent. The group said it had subsequently exceeded its target of 45 per cent margin on ebitda.Operating profit, on an adjusted basis, rose 19.9 per cent to €50m year-on-year.Dominique Cerutti, chief executive, said the company was looking at areas where further cuts could be made, which would be “transformational”. He declined to elaborate further but confirmed it would move from its current Paris headquarters.Euronext said quarterly operational expenses, excluding depreciation and amortisation, fell 8.2 per cent compared with the same period a year ago. It added that it would meet a target to deliver €60m worth of cost savings by the end of June next year, some 18 months ahead of its indicated schedule.Mr Cerutti also shook off worries about a slowdown in the eurozone, where the central bank has cut its deposit rate and launched a private sector asset purchase programme to shore up the region’s fragile economy.“We remain confident that the long-term economic and regulatory cycle favourable for Euronext’s growth continues, despite some recent short-term market turbulence,” he added.
187;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-11-06T11:56:13Z;Europe attracted by US derivatives pull;Rise in interest rates trading and credit default swaps clearing to the States;European derivatives trading has had a distinctly American flavour in recent months.Earnings reports from CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, and Intercontinental Exchange, its close rival, have shown a rise in both interest rates trading and credit default swaps (CDS) clearing to the US from the old continent.First CME Group, owner of the actively-traded eurodollar futures contract, said electronic average daily volume from European clients was 2.1m contracts in the three months to September 30, up 22 per cent year-on-year. That outperformed North America, which rose 13 per cent.Then ICE reported that 40 per cent of the $4.9tn of buyside gross notional cleared came from European buyside customers clearing through its US CDS clearing house in September.Both trends are notable, albeit for differing reasons. The CME put the influx down to greater demand for its US interest rate products. Its eurodollar futures contract is widely used by banks to hedge their exposure with dollar swap interest rates and of course, the Federal Reserve has just ended quantitative easing. By contrast, the European interest rate curve is dead.What is perhaps more surprising is that traders appear to be ignoring the bickering between US and European regulators over equivalence of each other’s derivatives clearing rules.For European banks the non-recognition of US clearing houses could mean applying onerous capital charges to balance sheets. The CME has estimated the charges could be in excess of 30 times current levels for some deals. While nothing is official yet, traders expect regulatory sense to prevail (once every other avenue has been exhausted). Nevertheless, that transatlantic volume flow could easily flow back again should the European Central Bank – hopefully – one day raise rates.More revealing is what is happening with ICE. The Atlanta group said investors’ behaviour was down to uncertainty over plodding legislation such as the European Market Infrastructure Review and Mifid II, the review of Europe’s main capital markets legislation.Emir will be introduced first but only from late next year while Mifid II will not kick in until 2017. Some parts of it will not come in until 2019. By contrast much of Dodd-Frank is done, and that has allow the CME and ICE to invest and focus on their US clearing houses.Bryan Durkin, CME’s chief commercial officer, noted new services such as coupon blending, compression and portfolio margining were “really bearing fruit”.But there is more to it with ICE. Behaviour is driven by incentives and ICE has deliberately sought to entice more CDS business to its US operations. There, investors can clear both index and single names and give back huge savings to customers on their collateral requirements by cross-margining their portfolios. CME does it too, but its eurodollar clearing business has always been in the US. ICE’s CDS business has been supplemented by clearing in London.“It’s surprising to see the European business leaving Europe and coming to the US. That isn’t something we really could’ve predicted even two years ago,” said Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, on the analyst call.Behind this lies another consideration. Post-financial crisis, Europe mandated to make its markets more competitive. That included opening access to clearing houses, allowing investors to open contracts on one trading venue and closing them on another.This is fine in theory but brings hazards if no other country is doing it. Exchanges such as CME and ICE have warned that policy would discourage innovation, or rather, shift it to a more favourable jurisdiction. As an insurance policy exchanges such as CME, ICE and Deutsche Börse are investing in the US and Singapore, which do not have the same definition of competition in their markets.ICE’s experiment with CDS has perhaps provided the first illustration of how it can be moved.
188;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-11-05T02:54:51Z;Asia futures focus takes wind from Chicago’s sails;Region drawing attention away from Chicago as exchanges tap new customers, especially in China;Trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange hit a record high last month, but few in the Windy City are popping the champagne corks just yet.“People are cautious – they don’t want to get too ahead of themselves about [the recent uptick in] volatility,” says Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.For the past few years the industry has been hobbled by low trading volumes and a near-zero interest rate environment. New regulations introduced under the Dodd-Frank Act in response to the financial crisis have increased capital requirements, pushing some brokers toward consolidation or out of the business.In August 2009, 132 so-called futures commission merchants were registered with the US futures regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. By this August that figure had dropped to 83.“There’s quite a big regulatory burden on the FCMs [Futures Commission Merchants, who take orders to buy or sell futures contracts] and also on the exchanges and clearing houses,” says Lynette Lim, head of US operations for Phillip Futures, a Singapore firm that opened a Chicago office four years ago. “Volumes have picked up some but I think that’s [still] a bit of a gloomy situation.”Yet in Asia, where futures markets have existed for only a fraction of the 150 years they have powered Chicago’s trading community, the mood is quite different.While futures markets are not exactly sizzling they are at least busier than in the west. That highlights how a region once viewed as a backwater is starting to suck attention away from Chicago as exchanges rush to tap a wave of new customers in Asia – especially China.At the same time Asia’s brokers and exchanges are looking west to connect to the big liquidity pools of Chicago and London.“The big giants – CME, ICE – we’ve seen significant investment from them trying to expand liquidity from Asia,” says Robbie McDonnell, head of sales at Chicago-based Trading Technologies, which has seen Asia jump from under 1 per cent of users to nearly 20 per cent in the past eight years. “I think the mood in Asia is simply more bullish.”Last week, Phupinder Gill, CME chief executive, said the company was considering buying a stake in Korea Exchange as the two announced a partnership to trade KRX’s currency derivatives through CME’s trading infrastructure.Intercontinental Exchange, CME’s main US rival, on Tuesday revealed a launch date of March next year for its planned new exchange and clearing house in Asia. Based in Singapore, it will offer as yet undisclosed commodity derivatives on the former Singapore Mercantile Exchange, which ICE bought last year.Some of Chicago’s proprietary trading firms have opened up offices in Singapore too, including HTG Capital Partners, which set up in 2012. Singapore “kind of feels like the Switzerland of Asia – they’ll do business with everyone and the laws are very well enforced and very clear”, says Steve McNulty, head of HTG’s Singapore office.Meanwhile, local banks and brokers in Asia have spotted an opportunity to expand their futures business as larger global players have pulled back. UOB, Singapore’s third-largest bank by assets, has increased the number of staff at its futures business by 30 per cent to 150 people in the past three years.“This has created an opportunity for the regional players based out of Singapore and southeast Asia . . . tooling up to take on the big boys in terms of people and technology,” says Steve Grob, director of strategy at Fidessa, a UK-based trading technology company that opened an office in Singapore this year.Asia-based bourses are upgrading their systems to attract overseas trading. Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing recently increased trading hours, while Australia’s ASX this week established a connection for US traders at CME’s suburban Chicago data centre.However, Asia is not immune to the low volatility that has plagued the US and Europe. Trading in one of the most widely used futures contracts in Asia, Nikkei-225 index futures, fell by 8 per cent in September year-on year on Singapore’s SGX exchange.John Lin, founder of Grasshopper trading, a proprietary trading firm in Singapore, suggested that such “anaemic” activity showed Asia could experience a slowdown too.“The reason people are leaving the [United] States is that it is saturated,” he said. “They have no choice but to come here – but the same seeds of Chicago’s woes are already germinating here.”
189;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-11-04T20:00:59Z;Trading industry strives to find its form;Low volatility, new rivals and onerous rules are taking their toll;On retiring from Sanford Bernstein last month, veteran analyst Brad Hintz penned some observations about the capital markets in which had worked for 30 years.In a memo to clients, he pointed out that the trading businesses of Wall Street were still generating returns far below their cost of capital six years after the crisis. Even so, he noted, most investors expected returns to rebound once services had been repriced to reflect increased regulatory costs.“But this is far from certain,” wrote Mr Hintz, who spent 13 years at Sanford and was once chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers. “Are the new rules coming from Washington, London or Basel just the fine-tuning of already established regulatory models or is there a conscious strategy to shift the capital markets business from the universal banks to smaller and presumably less systemically important participants?”Noting the rise of electronic trading venues, clearing houses and interdealer brokers, he added: “It appears the invisible hand of economics is at play.”Banks, under pressure, have pulled back on commodities and fixed income trading, leaving a gap in the market to be filled by new actors, such as hedge funds and other lightly regulated entities. Regulation has boosted revenues at clearing houses, which are mainly owned by exchanges. Equally, the market structure industry, which includes exchanges, clearing houses, brokers, traders, banks and data providers, has had to deal with its own set of post-financial crisis problems.National pride and concerns about systemic risk and competition have slowed deal making by exchanges in the past few years, with the notable exception of Intercontinental Exchange’s $11bn cash and shares purchase of NYSE Euronext. The deal, in November 2013, transformed Atlanta-based ICE into one of the world’s largest exchange operators. It also broke up an underperforming cross-border conglomeration put together at the height of the 2005-07 financial bubble.Exchanges, blocked from making big deals and with their profits hampered by low market volatility, have been starting afresh with longer-term projects such as clearing and collateral management services. Deals have been more focused, such as the London Stock Exchange Group’s $2.7bn agreement to buy Russell Investments, the US benchmark provider.“I think we will see exchanges start to evolve away from each other a bit more,” says Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq. “Some will choose indexes, others will choose technology. I think we will see that exchange comparisons are harder to make.”One of the biggest focuses for the industry has been growth in Asia in general, and China in particular, as it opens its capital account and begins to integrate its markets with the rest of the world. “To date, most of the volume in derivatives has come from speculative domestic retail activity in China. We are now seeing the widespread introduction of market-based pricing, initially in the underlying commodities markets,” says William Barkshire, managing director of Agora Partners and a former co-president of the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange.In the US, the new breed of equities trading venues – dark pools – face fresh regulatory scrutiny.In the derivatives markets, toughened standards have been a two-edged sword for operators. The rules stipulate that where possible, trading of all standardised over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts be conducted on regulated trading platforms and that more bilateral swaps should be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs or clearing houses) to manage their risk better.Regulators, operators and market participants alike have recognised them as potentially the new central points of systemic failure, but have not come to agreement on what to do if a clearing house fails.Three weeks ago, global regulators called for CCPs to be given all the tools needed to keep this critical market infrastructure alive rather than close them and risk a future market disaster.Others worry that latitude could lead to widely differing standards for trading and clearing derivatives in a global market.The European Association of Clearing Houses, which represents 22 regional CCPs, has called for a consistent global approach to the regulation of recovery and resolution frameworks of CCPs.As it has pointed out, clearing houses are too interconnected with banks. Most of its members “serve clearing members and clients connected to several legal jurisdictions”, it said.The trade association is keen to avoid a repetition elsewhere of the strained and protracted discussions between the US and Europe over recognising clearing houses based in each other’s territory as being regulated to an equivalent standard.The two jurisdictions, which account for the majority of the world’s derivatives trading, have made differing interpretations of the same G20 mandate, and an agreement has so far proved elusive.The row affects CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange and various European banks, all of which all conduct extensive cross-border business.Negotiators remain hopeful of a breakthrough. In September, Chris Giancarlo used his first speech as a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to warn against the stand-off deteriorating into local market protectionism.Calling for a change in US approach, he noted that fragmentation of the global swaps market “means smaller and disconnected liquidity pools and less efficient and more volatile pricing for market participants and their customers”.That volatility can manifest itself strikingly. Some market participants had a scare this year, when the malfunction of an algorithm trading derivatives – lasting 143 seconds – caused the collapse of a small local broker in South Korea.At first the incident barely registered until it emerged that the clearing house’s rules allowed it to bypass using its own funds and go straight to non-defaulters to help repay counterparties in the $4.3m default.For some, the arguments have gone far enough. Lance Uggla, chief executive of Markit, a UK data provider, says: “Regulators and the market have recognised the need to work together to rebuild the economy.”As for Mr Hintz, he will join New York University’s Stern School of Business and write a book that examines how Wall Street has changed in the face of tighter regulation and new technologies.It promises to be a fascinating read.
190;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-11-04T19:09:03Z;ICE chief blasts rival’s tactics to lure users;Sprecher characterises CME strategy as ‘payment for order flow scheme’;The head of Intercontinental Exchange, the world’s second-largest exchange group by market value, launched an unusually explicit criticism of its bigger competitor’s business strategy as he touted growth in his flagship oil contract.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, said that the number of futures contracts outstanding in its benchmark Brent crude oil market had surpassed open interest in CME Group’s rival oil contract, West Texas Intermediate.Commercial customers such as refineries and airlines propelled this growth “as we see our competitors adopting incentives that attract the type of algorithm . . . trading that typically drives commercial users away,” Mr Sprecher said.Incentives such as rebates and payments to traders have a long history at futures exchanges trying to achieve critical mass as a centralised marketplace. Open interest and volumes in crude have climbed as oil prices slump close to $80 a barrel, forcing traders to reposition.Chicago-based CME Group two months ago revamped fee rebates for energy traders, with discounts that could top $16m annually for the biggest. It also offers free trading in its own Brent crude contract.Mr Sprecher said “payment for order flow schemes” such as CME’s expanded the market by “attracting traders that really don’t want to hold the risk of your products but just want . . . to get paid to be there.”ICE has expanded rapidly and raised its profile by acquisition, including the purchase of NYSE Euronext a year ago. But its roots as an energy exchange run deep. Brent crude housed at London-based ICE Futures Europe is its largest single source of revenue. Brent revenue rose 7 per cent year on year to $62m in the third quarter, ICE said.CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange, historically the biggest energy market, has been grabbing share in Brent trading, with volumes almost doubling this year to 70,000 contracts a day.CME said: “Our incentive programmes are designed to grow liquidity in our markets. Increased liquidity benefits all users.” It added: “We invest millions in policing our markets. Something our competitors should strive to [do] as well.”ICE also offers volume-based rebate programmes to traders, but not the cash bonus pool that CME has at times provided, a person familiar with the company said.Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston, said: “ICE really has no need to offer inducements because it is already the leader in Brent and bigger markets tend to be more liquid”.ICE said net profit in the third quarter was $206m, up 46 per cent from $141m a year ago. Adjusted for items related to the NYSE acquisition, net profit was $245m and earnings per share totalled $2.15, topping Wall Street forecasts.
191;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-11-04T13:45:55Z;NYSE boss Thomas Farley sees value in trading floor;Thomas Farley pins exchange’s future on courting more young and tech-focused companies;The venerable trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange, the daily backdrop to television business news reports, has found an unlikely champion.Thomas Farley this year took the helm of NYSE after its acquisition by Intercontinental Exchange, a much younger Atlanta-based exchange. The 38-year-old embodies the new era of electronic trading, with a CV that includes shutting down commodity futures markets on the floor of the New York Board of Trade, a move that embittered some traders.But Mr Farley touts the merits of NYSE’s 111-year-old equity trading floor, capitalism’s big show. He spends most mornings there chatting with traders or on the balcony overlooking their dwindled ranks for the opening bell that kicks off trading for the world’s largest stock market.“When we agreed to acquire the New York Stock Exchange back in 2012, one of the questions was, how valuable is that floor? And what is the future of that floor? And I’ve seen first-hand how valuable that floor is,” he says.Keeping a human element has helped NYSE land big initial public offerings since technical problems with Facebook’s listing left Nasdaq with a black eye. But with most shares changing hands at data centres in New Jersey, doubt has been cast on the need for physical exchanges and trading floors. Some analysts question whether ICE is committed to long-term stewardship of NYSE or perhaps fine-tuning it for sale.The growth of off-exchange venues and dark pools has left NYSE with just a fifth of US share trading. Mr Farley has arrived at a time of controversy, too. High-speed, electronic trading has raised concerns about a repeat of the 2010 “flash crash” and the allegation in Michael Lewis’s book Flash Boys that equity trading is “rigged”.To confront that, Mr Farley will need to live up to his nickname. A former Georgetown University baseball player, he mostly plays basketball now and was dubbed “Solid” by John Strickland, a famous street ballplayer. He rises at 5.30am for a workout with a group that includes Olympic swimmers Conor Dwyer and Matt Targett as well as the actor Hugh Jackman.Before joining ICE, he was chief financial officer at Kiodex, a web-based commodities trading platform co-founded in the dotcom boom by Raj Mahajan.Now chief executive of proprietary trading firm Allston Trading, Mr Mahajan calls Mr Farley “a rational decision maker”.The two were close friends, but that did not stop Mr Farley from giving sobering advice when the dotcom bust took its toll: sell. The group went to SunGard. “He didn’t let the dream get in the way,” Mr Mahajan says.ICE chief Jeff Sprecher hired Mr Farley in February 2007 from SunGard as president of the New York Board of Trade, a venue for “soft” commodities that ICE had just acquired. In early 2008 ICE ended open-outcry trading in its US commodity futures markets.In the first week of the electronic-only regime, ICE cotton markets surged, prompting the exchange clearing house to make hundreds of millions of dollars of margin calls – demands for additional collateral – to merchants. Some of the industry’s oldest names were pushed out of business.“ICE swung a wrecking ball at the industry by raising margin requirements in early March 2008, and a lot of us have always held Tom responsible for that,” says Jordan Lea, co-owner of Eastern Trading, a cotton merchant.Mr Farley has defended his leadership of NYBOT, now known as ICE Futures US. In Congressional testimony, he attributed the price swings to markets rather than exchanges, which he called “the messengers of price information”.At NYSE he stresses the importance of the combination of human trader and technology, which he says means more predictability and less volatility, including for IPOs – a business the NYBOT pits were not in.In recent years, NYSE has taken share in technology IPOs and it snagged the September listing of China’s Alibaba, the world’s largest listing. Mr Farley hopes to court more young and tech-focused companies.While computers dominate, having humans to stabilise and use their judgment in trading lends a level of comfort and helps in price discovery, NYSE believes. Companies also have the media exposure that comes with ringing the opening bell.Not to mention: “It’s really fun,” he says. Dick Grasso, a former NYSE head, calls it “the greatest show on earth”.The question is whether ICE shareholders see it that way. NYSE was a side note in the group’s acquisition of NYSE Euronext. ICE coveted Liffe, a European derivatives bourse, and cash equities trading is a much lower-margin business than futures.“For right now they believe in it, but if they cannot make it more profitable in a few years they aren’t married to it,” says Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill.Mr Farley has cut costs, halving headcount. Plans to simplify market structure and boost confidence include a streamlined system for matching trades and reducing the number of order types available to traders. Some $80m will also be spent modernising NYSE’s landmark building itself.“To some extent, we have a civic duty to preserve this place,” Mr Farley says.
192;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-11-04T08:49:57Z;Intercontinental Exchange to launch in Singapore from March;US energy markets operator to open exchange and clearing house;Intercontinental Exchange, the US energy markets operator, has set a launch date of March 17 next year for its new Singapore-based exchange and clearing house, marking a new era for exchange competition in Asia.The group also said on Tuesday that it had applied to the Monetary Authority of Singapore to launch a foreign trade repository in the Asian city-state.ICE is the first western exchange to establish new market infrastructure in Asia, a region ICE and its rivals CME and Deutsche Börse hitherto have served through sales offices tapping demand from Asian traders.But Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, surprised the industry at the end of last year by signalling his intention to build a physical presence in the region as well, with the purchase of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange from India’s Financial Technologies, for $150m.Since then ICE has been rebuilding SMX’s platform and its small clearing house, in preparation for a relaunch that is expected to involve as yet unnamed energy or commodity contracts. SMX last traded gold, forex and black pepper futures.The announcement of a launch date comes in the same week that Singapore was among four jurisdictions recognised by the European Commission as having clearing house rules that were deemed “equivalent” to those for clearing houses in the EU. The others were Japan, Australia and Hong Kong.This means clearing houses in those jurisdictions can now obtain regulatory recognition in the EU, and can therefore be used by market participants to clear standardised over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives as required by EU legislation “whilst remaining subject solely to the regulation and supervision of their home jurisdiction”, the commission said.The move is a boost for SGX’s Asiaclear clearing house, as well as the clearers of ASX in Australia, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing’s recently launched OTC Clear clearing house, and Japan.It is also a step forward for Deutsche Börse as it also prepares to launch its first clearing house in Asia – based in Singapore – early next year.If approved by regulators, ICE would become the second foreign group to operate a trade repository – or electronic data system – for OTC derivatives in Singapore after the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation of the US.ICE said it would reveal which products it would launch on ICE Futures Singapore “shortly”. Market participants say they expect early contracts to in some way be linked to the range of physical commodities already traded and financed out of Singapore, such as liquefied natural gas, crude oil and jet fuel.ICE also said its “Asian hub” would be co-headed by Jennifer Ilkiw, ICE vice-president for Asia-Pacific, and Lucas Schmeddes, chief operating officer of ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore – as the SMX clearing house has been renamed.
193;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-10-28T05:42:39Z;CME eyes Korea Exchange stake;Deal to open a new avenue for investors seeking to adjust their exposure to the South Korean won;CME Group is considering buying a stake in the Korea Exchange (KRX), the US company’s chief executive said, amid fierce competition among leading exchange operators to expand their presence in Asia.“It would make sense for us, if allowed, to participate in the upside of the exchange, particularly as we are planning to help the exchange on an international expansion,” said Phupinder Gill, CME chief executive.“We have a firm belief in aligning our interest with that of the exchange partners with whom we deal,” he said at the annual meeting of the World Federation of Exchanges.The two exchanges were set to deepen their partnership on Tuesday by announcing a deal that will allow trading of KRX’s currency derivatives through CME’s trading infrastructure.The deal will open a new avenue for investors or companies seeking to adjust their exposure to the South Korean won outside Seoul market hours, who must currently rely on the offshore non-deliverable forward market.A 2.5 per cent stake in KRX is set to come on to the market when the South Korean brokers NH Investment & Securities and Woori Securities merge, in a deal due to be completed by the end of this year. The pair together own 7.5 per cent of KRX, above the 5 per cent limit imposed on financial companies by South Korean law.Although it is owned mostly by local brokerages, KRX has been under state control since 2009 when the government designated it a “quasi-governmental institution” citing the company’s effective “monopoly” of its market.Ahn Sang-hwan, an executive director of KRX, said in August that there was “some concern about possible management interference if a foreign exchange buys a stake”.However, Mr Gill played down concerns about opposition to foreign ownership. “It’s not uncommon to see that [discomfort] anywhere in the world,” he said.CME may face competition for a stake in KRX: Standard & Poor’s and Deutsche Börse have also expressed interest. The German group’s Eurex futures arm, a key rival for CME in the global derivatives market, has since 2010 had a partnership with KRX allowing Eurex members direct access to Kospi 200 options, among the most heavily traded options contracts in Asia, after Korean trading hours.Deutsche Börse is also building a clearing house for Asia based in Singapore, where CME’s US rival IntercontinentalExchange is also set to revive an existing clearing house in the wake of its acquisition last year of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange.Some market participants argue that an Asian clearing house would reduce problems for CME’s Asian clients in the event of a default outside the region. But Mr Gill said that, when the company considered the challenges facing its clients, the option of building an Asian clearing house “falls out”.“It’s our view that . . . Asian clearing needs can be very comfortably met either from London or from the US,” he said. “We’ve seen exchanges putting the cart before the horse and we don’t think that’s the right thing to actually do.”
194;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-10-20T08:00:55Z;Intercontinental Exchange unveils plans for Libor reform;US exchange calls for more bank data to underpin the scandal-hit lending benchmark  ;Intercontinental Exchange wants to rehabilitate Libor by proposing that submitting banks include transactions they conduct with central banks as part of their daily calculations.In a paper released on Monday, the US derivatives exchange proposes the introduction of a more standard, prescriptive formula for banks to make their submissions to Libor – the lending benchmark on which around $350tn of derivatives contracts are referenced and which was at the centre of a manipulation scandal at the height of the financial crisis.To toughen the new rate-setting process, ICE proposes establishing a system in which a wide range of data from around the world is used as a basis for submissions. It also wants to force banks to flag up more clearly those submissions which have been supplemented with human judgments.The proposals form a key part of the long-term effort to rehabilitate Libor. A regulatory investigation into alleged manipulation of the benchmark has already resulted in billions of dollars of fines for banks and brokers, and sparked investigations into other market benchmarks in foreign exchange, metals and interest rate derivatives.A clean-up has already begun with many tenors of Libor discontinued and its administration moving from the British Bankers’ Association to an ICE subsidiary in February.To restore Libor’s long-term viability, ICE is mandated to anchor Libor in more transactions data. However, there are few deals in the unsecured interbank lending market, which Libor references.Banks have continued to worry about the creditworthiness of the counterparties and demand has been curbed by tougher liquidity coverage ratios. Expansive monetary policies by the world's largest central banks have also increased the amount of liquidity available to banks.“To be consistent with the original purpose of Libor and reflect the changes in bank funding in recent years, all wholesale and professional entities should be as eligible counterparty types, including central banks and large corporates,” ICE said.It added that it wanted banks to anchor rates based on their unsecured wholesale funding deposits, commercial paper and primary issuance certificates of deposit. The approach follows guidelines recommended by the UK-backed Wheatley report in 2012.It found, however, that other types of rate the Wheatley report recommended referencing – including overnight indexed swaps, repo transactions, foreign exchange forwards, floating rates agreements and floating rate notes – should only be used when a dearth of deals means the submitter has to rely on expert judgment. The rates banks submit will be collected and validated by an ICE-built system.After eight months of administration, ICE found the 20 banks that submit to the benchmark had developed their own methodologies for establishing Libor, often using differing transaction sizes and types of trade as the basis for their submissions. Banks will have two months to comment on ICE’s proposals.The framework was developed after discussions with the world’s biggest central banks and regulators, including the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.
195;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-10-16T19:15:17Z;Record day for derivatives exchanges;CME, ICE and CBOE report high contract volumes;As fear swept markets on Wednesday, US derivatives exchanges hit record highs.CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and CBOE Holdings all reported record volume in various contracts on a day that saw the Dow Jones log its biggest intraday fall for three years as investor fears on global growth led them to exit trades and opt for the haven of highly rated government debt.CME reported daily volume hitting 39.6m contracts traded – the single-highest total in its 166-year history – eclipsing the previous record of 26.9m set on May 29 2013. The Chicago-based company had heavy volume in its flagship interest rate futures contracts while Eurodollar futures doubled the previous record, to 11.5m contracts. In all CME saw a record day in nine categories.Rival ICE beat its previous single-day record in its US dollar index futures by nearly 2,000 contracts, with trading in 118,291 contracts.CBOE, operator of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, also experienced record volumes on Wednesday in its options on the S&P 500 index, futures on its flagship volatility index (Vix) and options at its C2 options exchange.US banks placed most of the blame for the wild swings in US government bond prices on new bank regulations they say have reduced market liquidity. The rules, put in place since the 2008 financial crisis, are meant to make the banking system safer, but banks say Wednesday’s volatility shows the rules hamper their ability to absorb market stress.Some analysts have said high-frequency trading and other factors also played a part.
196;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-10-10T12:28:13Z;ICE Clear Europe resubmits Emir application;UK company to change margin calculations under new clearing house rules;ICE Clear Europe is likely to be one of the last clearing houses to be authorised in Europe under new tougher rules after the UK group made a significant change to its application.The UK company, part of US-based Intercontinental Exchange, is planning to change the mathematical model it will use to calculate the daily value of the margin investors must post to back their derivatives trades, according to two people familiar with the situation.Consequently it has withdrawn an application to the Bank of England and resubmitted a new one. It is expecting to be authorised to clear at the end of the year or possibly early next year, the people said.ICE’s non-authorisation stands out as all of the regions clearing houses reapply to operate in Europe under new legislation, known as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir).Presently 13 have been mandated, including most of ICE’s rivals such as CME Europe and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex. ICE has not, even though it is one of Europe’s largest clearing houses and its main hub for clearing credit default swaps and short-term listed fixed income derivatives.Its application has been bogged down by politics as European and US regulators have applied differing standards for clearing houses. With the new system, ICE Clear Europe aims to soften increased costs for investors and traders if ICE is authorised, as expected.Europe has tied its clearing rules to new rules to banking capital ratios, making the standards tougher than anywhere else in the world, but potentially making it more costly for investors to use ICE than rivals based outside Europe.ICE’s new model will be based on a methodology known at Value at Risk (VAR), a common way for banks to calculate the risk of their swaps portfolios. However, most of the listed derivatives industry uses a 25-year-old methodology known as Span.VAR is a more complex calculation but its advocates say a more accurate number potentially stops traders from posting more margin than necessary. Detractors point out that VAR has its flaws, particularly in stressed conditions, but global authorities prefer VAR as a methodology to measure risk. If it is approved by regulators, ICE Clear plans to roll out the new system next year, the people said.Differences between the US and Europe has meant Europe has been unable to recognise US-based clearing houses. The issue has become pressing because new capital requirement rules in Europe, due to come into effect on December 15, would add significant charges to local banks clearing their derivatives overseas.However, the US confirmed on Friday that Europe had delayed introduction of the capital rules while regulators continued their discussions.“I am pleased that they have decided to postpone the imposition of higher capital charges on European banks participating in our markets. It was this threat of higher capital charges that was going to fragment the market, not the existence of dual registration, which has existed for years and has actually been the foundation for the growth of the global markets,” said Timothy Massad, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in a prepared statement to a CFTC committee meeting.
197;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-10-03T16:44:05Z;Frazzled livestock traders given a rest;The change comes as US meat prices reach all-time highs as drought and disease cut herd sizes;Cattle and hog traders fatigued by a record run are about to get their lives back.CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, on Friday said it would shorten the electronic trading session for livestock markets from 23 hours a day to eight hours or less.The move is a reversal for CME, which depends on fees from trading volumes for the bulk of its revenue, after it expanded hours in 2007.Prices of benchmark cattle and lean hogs futures have surged to all-time highs this year as drought and disease cut herd sizes in the US. On CME’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange, trading volumes in slaughter-ready “live” and younger “feeder” cattle were up 9.2 per cent and 20.5 per cent in the year to date, respectively.The combination of round-the-clock trading and heavier volumes meant long days in the office and tiresome price monitoring in the middle of the night, said George Enloe, a cattle broker at Amarillo Brokerage in Texas.“People like us and our customers had to be on point virtually all the time,” Mr Enloe said.As computer screens replaced the exchange floor as the main futures trading venue, CME expanded hours and allowed traders to connect from around the world.“There was a period of time when everyone was expanding hours. Quite frankly, everyone believed that was the right strategy,” said Tim Andriesen, CME Group’s managing director of agricultural commodities and alternative investments.But meat is not internationally traded as much as grain and oil, meaning the core of CME’s livestock market still consists of US-based ranchers, processors and consumers.“A lot of the feedback we got from them was they felt shorter hours would more concentrate liquidity,” Mr Andriesen said.It is rare, but not unprecedented, for CME to cut back trading hours. In 2012, the exchange operator proposed to extend the trading day for grain and oilseed futures to 21 hours as it sought to fend off a competitive threat from IntercontinentalExchange.After complaints from traders, CME shortened the grain trading day to 17.5 hours, giving Chicago-based traders a long break in the afternoon.The livestock changes come as meat prices have been surging. CME October live cattle futures this week hit a record $1.64 a pound. The market has gained 21 per cent this year. The 95m head of cattle on US farms is the lowest population since records began in 1973.Lean hogs futures also broke records this year, as a piglet-killing virus swept through farms. The CME October lean hogs were $1.0525 a pound on Friday, with the market up 23 per cent in 2014.Mr Enloe said he expected the new hours, due to take effect on October 27, will “compress volume into shorter trading sessions and potentially increase liquidity a bit”.The 23-hour days have had a more personal impact, Mr Enloe added. “You’ve got people with young families and they’re missing the evening meal. There’s just no need for that,” he said.
198;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-09-26T02:23:40Z;CME loses Asia head following reshuffle;Departure comes as industry ramps up in Asia;CME Group, one of the world’s largest exchange operators, has lost its Asia head in a surprise departure that comes as industry rivals are ramping up in the region in a bid to capture growing demand for futures trading.The exchange said that Julien Le Noble, Singapore-based head of CME for the past three years, had submitted his resignation this week. He gave no reason.His resignation comes a week after a major reshuffle of top management at CME, which sees Bryan Durkin, chief operating officer, expanding his job to include oversight of international offices. CME has four in Asia beyond Singapore: in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul and Beijing, which the company opened this year.Mr Le Noble, a French citizen and former senior executive at broker Newedge, ran CME’s Asia business from the company’s regional headquarters in Singapore, which is also the regional hub for IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and Eurex, the futures arm of Germany’s Deutsche Börse.Singapore has become a magnet for global exchanges wanting to tap into a new customer base in Asia for their benchmark products as the region becomes an increasingly important battleground for derivatives trading and clearing.Mr Le Noble’s departure comes only weeks before CME’s arch-rival ICE, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, is set to relaunch the former Singapore Mercantile Exchange, which it bought last year for $150m.Atlanta-based ICE has been transforming SMX and its associated clearing house into a new exchange that will act as the company’s springboard for growth in Asia. While it has not said what derivatives products it will offer after the launch – expected within weeks – industry experts say gold, foreign exchange and possibly energy futures are likely.Deutsche Börse is meanwhile in the process of setting up a clearing house in Singapore, which will also help the company expand in Asia. In January, the exchange bought control of Cleartrade, a small Singapore-based trading platform that specialises in freight, fuel oil and metals derivatives.CME’s office in Singapore, which employs 50 of the company’s roughly 70 staff in Asia, promotes use of eurodollar futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which are one of the most widely traded exchange-traded derivatives globally, as well as CME’s energy, FX and commodities contracts.Singapore is growing rapidly as a location for proprietary trading groups, such as Chicago-based Jump Trading and Propex, a Sydney-based company, which are increasingly using the city-state as a base from which to trade futures electronically in the region and beyond.
199;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-09-16T00:23:29Z;Former Amaranth star fined over gas trades;;Brian Hunter, the natural gas trader whose large bets helped precipitate the $6bn collapse of Amaranth, the hedge fund, has agreed to pay $750,000 to settle attempted market manipulation charges.Amaranth’s spectacular failure in 2006 became a symbol of concerns over excessive speculation in commodities as the prices of materials from oil to wheat were racing to all-time highs.A Senate committee report published in the aftermath determined that Amaranth at one time controlled 40 per cent of all outstanding winter gas contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange.More recently, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has invoked the Amaranth saga as it tries to impose new limits on the size of trader positions.The CFTC sued Mr Hunter and Amaranth in 2007, claiming they had distorted wholesale gas prices on two occasions several months before losses sank the fund.Amaranth paid a fine of $7.5m to settle manipulation charges in 2009, but Mr Hunter, its former star gas trader, fought on in court.The $750,000 civil penalty agreed by Calgary-based Mr Hunter is a fraction of the $100m that Amaranth paid him in one year, according to an earlier CFTC court filing.A separate $30m fine against Mr Hunter, imposed by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, was rejected by a federal appeals court last year. The court determined his conduct fell under the CFTC’s exclusive jurisdiction. The CFTC had intervened in the case to confirm its exclusive role.Mr Hunter was accused of trying to manipulate prices on the last trading day of Nymex gas futures as they expired in February and March of 2006. Amaranth and Mr Hunter tried to push down gas prices on the Nymex to boost profits in much larger gas positions on the IntercontinentalExchange, which hosts a parallel gas contract, according to the original complaint.As part of the settlement announced on Monday, Mr Hunter neither admitted nor denied the CFTC’s original allegations. He will pay the cash penalty, and is permanently banned from trading during the settlement period on the last day of trading in all US commodity derivatives. The ban also covers trading gas futures just before the market closes.
200;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-09-07T15:24:41Z;CME revamps fee rebates for energy trading;;CME Group, owner of the world’s largest futures exchange, has launched a sweeping revamp of its opaque system of fee rebates for energy traders as it battles flagging volumes in oil and natural gas contracts.The new incentives replace a hotchpotch of perks with a uniform programme that sweetens traders’ rebates as their volumes surpass certain thresholds. Only the biggest high-frequency trading firms are likely to qualify for the most generous rebates, people familiar with the matter said.CME’s new incentives, which took effect last week [September 1], apply to energy futures created as many as three decades ago: crude oil, natural gas, diesel and gasoline. Energy has the second largest share of the exchange’s $2.5bn clearing and transaction fee revenue, comprising 23 per cent of the total last year.According to people who have seen the rebate programme details, proprietary trading groups would fall into one of eight tiers based on their average daily volumes in the energy products.Transactions of at least 150,000 contracts per day would place a trader in the top tier, eligible for $0.45 rebates from the standard $0.55-per-contract member trading fee. Top rebates could exceed $16m annually, assuming a normal trading calendar.The changes come nine months after CME raised trading fees. Volumes in the four energy contracts have declined in the year to August.Some traders praised the programme’s consistent criteria for rebates and a person close to CME said the new incentives level the field.However, others raised concern it would concentrate the market. “They are trying to incentivise people to trade more,” said an oil trader. “What they’re going to end up with is quite possibly fewer, but bigger, traders”.CME said: “We regularly review programmes relative to market and other developments and may modify program components or structures in an attempt to respond to those developments.”Rebates are a common way to build volume in new futures contracts. But they have recently caught the eye of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is reviewing how they work and who receives them.Virtu Financial, an electronic trading firm, disclosed this year that the futures commission was looking into its participation in some exchange incentive programmes. Virtu declined to comment.The exchange operator has kept details of the programme private, requesting an exemption from disclosure requirements when it informed regulators of the plan.Some traders say scarcity of public incentive information at CME and rival IntercontinentalExchange fosters suspicion certain parties get better deals.“How transparent should we require the exchanges to be about the types of participants that are actually reaping benefits and the amount of proceeds that are being paid as part of these market-maker incentive programmes?” Vince McGonagle, CFTC market oversight chief, asked at a recent public meeting.
201;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-09-04T23:09:53Z;ICE looks to crack financial data market;;IntercontinentalExchange, the transatlantic exchange and clearing house operator, has agreed to acquire SuperDerivatives, an Israeli financial technology group, as it seeks to penetrate the lucrative information market.ICE is expected to pay $350m in cash for the Tel-Aviv based business and a deal could be announced as early as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.SuperDerivatives provides data and analytics on over-the-counter derivatives but also has a chat platform similar to the one used on Bloomberg terminals.ICE has long wanted to crack the market for providing high-tech information terminals and has recently been under growing pressure to do so as Bloomberg and other financial information providers push into its core markets.With the acquisition of SuperDerivatives, the Atlanta-based company will also get access to the Israeli group’s DGX product, which allows traders to access live pricing and news in addition to analysing theoretical trades before they execute them.Other potential buyers who showed interest in SuperDerivatives include CME, Nasdaq and Markit, according to people familiar with the matter. It is unclear if any of those parties reached advanced discussions with SuperDerivatives and its advisers.ICE’s move to get a toehold in messaging comes as Wall Street firms push back against Bloomberg’s dominance. CME, the futures exchange operator, has invested in Wickr, a start-up that is in talks with banks to create an alternative to Bloomberg instant messaging, and Goldman Sachs has spearheaded efforts to create a rival Wall Street chat service.Other rival technology and data companies have attempted to break Bloomberg’s dominance in messaging with little success, and it is unclear whether new chat tools backed by financial services companies will flourish where others have failed.A competing chat service could also face an uphill battle given the degree to which Bloomberg terminals remain entrenched on Wall Street – the private company says 20m chat exchanges take place over its terminals each day.“Displacing Bloomberg is undoubtedly the ‘holy grail’ of the information services industry,” Jefferies analysts Dan Dolev and Trevor Young said in a recent note.David Gershon, SuperDerivatives chief executive, in 2008 estimated that the company would one day go public with a $1bn market value. The IPO never happened, however, and the company has been working with banks on a sale process since early this year.Earlier this year, ICE demerged Euronext, the European exchanges operator, for €1.4bn ($1.9bn) in cash. The demerger, via a listing, was planned when ICE bought NYSE Euronext for $11bn in 2013.Neither ICE nor SuperDerivatives was immediately available for comment.
202;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-08-20T16:44:25Z;CFTC and traders clash on cotton verdict;;A notorious episode of wild cotton price swings was “orderly”, a US regulator has said, a conclusion at odds with many traders’ views of the 2011 affair.The assessment by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been invoked by lawyers for Louis Dreyfus Commodities, parent of the world’s leading cotton merchant, as it fends off a price manipulation lawsuit brought by the former head of cotton at Glencore.In a report published last month, the CFTC’s division of market oversight revealed that the ICE Futures US exchange gave special scrutiny to cotton contracts for delivery in July 2011. When the contracts expired, Louis Dreyfus took large deliveries and the difference between the spot cotton price and prices for later delivery dates widened sharply.Mark Allen, Glencore’s former head cotton trader, alleges that Louis Dreyfus artificially inflated cotton futures prices in 2011 by demanding bales on the exchange rather than purchasing cheaper cotton available outside the exchange. Trading house Glencore is not involved with the case.The CFTC report said one trader with a large commitment to sell cotton “did not appear to have the capacity to deliver”. However, the report concluded: “The contract expiration culminated in an orderly fashion.”The statement marks the CFTC’s first public discussion of the cotton market in 2011, a period of extreme price moves that led to losses totalling hundreds of millions of dollars at Glencore, Cargill and other members of the cotton trading elite. It contrasts with the views of many market participants.“It was the greatest squeeze in history, pure and simple,” said John Bondurant, a veteran futures trader and former president of the Memphis Cotton Exchange. “It was terribly disorderly. It was chaos.”Lawyers for Louis Dreyfus have seized on the report as they fight Mr Allen’s case, which survived their motion for dismissal last year. The CFTC finding “undermines the plausibility of a key inference plaintiffs have asked this Court to draw”, lawyer Stephen Ehrenberg recently wrote to US District Judge Andrew Carter.In a response filed on Wednesday, lawyers representing Mr Allen and other plaintiffs said the CFTC’s conclusions “do not change or even touch in any way the detailed plausible fact allegations of specific manipulative conduct by defendants”.Louis Dreyfus and exchange parent IntercontinentalExchange declined to comment.The agency’s comments lie inside a 50-page “rule enforcement review” of the ICE exchange, home to the benchmark cotton futures market. The Financial Times in 2012 reported the CFTC’s enforcement division was investigating the alleged squeeze. That division is separate from the one that drew up the review.Philip McBride Johnson, a derivatives lawyer and former CFTC chairman who is not involved in the case, said evidence of orderly trading at a contract’s expiry does not automatically rule out manipulation. He added that the views expressed in a rule enforcement review were not binding on the agency.The review separately noted that the ICE market surveillance department has kept open one of 10 market investigations from the 2011-12 period because the CFTC enforcement division had launched a parallel probe into the matter. The subject of the investigation was not disclosed.
203;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-07-28T17:21:26Z;Greifeld warns on ‘perverted’ dark pools;;In his strongest statements on the need for overhauling the equity markets, Nasdaq OMX chief executive Bob Greifeld said on Monday that “dark pools” have become perverted, while a key regulation aimed at improving the markets by requiring investors to receive the best price has become meaningless.Mr Greifeld, who was speaking at a market structure roundtable, has not been as vocal as other industry players, such as Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of IntercontinentalExchange, who has called for the elimination of the prevailing maker-taker model .The integrity of the markets has become a controversial issue and the scrutiny has intensified since the publication of Michael Lewis’s book Flash Boys, which said the markets are rigged. Mary Jo White, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently announced sweeping recommendations to increase transparency in the markets.Dark pools have become a particular focus because prices are only posted after a trade has been executed. The venues serve a legitimate purpose in facilitating large block orders for institutional investors, but the average trade size in dark pools is 187 shares, Mr Greifeld said.“It’s a perversion. Something is not working,” he said, adding that the regulation for alternative trading systems, which include dark pools, “needs to be restored to its original purpose”.Maker-taker fees should also be overhauled in instances where the market maker is not providing liquidity and is instead charging fees and receiving rebates purely for profit, Mr Greifeld said.Philip Stafford explains what dark pools areMatt Andresen, co-chief executive of Headlands Technologies, said he was not sure he and his partners would have “high-fived” each other years ago when they invented the maker-taker model if they had known how markets would evolve. Mr Andresen helped start Island, an electronic stock market that was one of the early players in what has become the high-frequency trading scene.“We were trying to compete against Nasdaq,” he said. “Now every trade is electronically accessible. The reasons for it no longer exist.”Part of the problem has been what is known as Regulation NMS, which was implemented by the SEC in 2007 requiring that investors get the best price. But it has been blamed for helping to fragment the markets into dozens of dark pools and exchanges, and Ms White has said the SEC will look at provisions of the rule to see if they need to be amended.“Reg NMS was supposed to require best execution in the markets but no one knows what it means any more,” Mr Greifeld said. “It has become virtually meaningless.”He added that there seems to be a consensus on the SEC’s recently announced pilot programme for increasing tick sizes, which is aimed at boosting liquidity for smaller companies, and said a plan for implementation would soon be submitted to the SEC. But Daniel Coleman, chief executive of wholesale retail broker KCG, said the pilot programme could increase execution costs.
204;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-07-22T18:38:35Z;Regulators warn on Libor reform;;A powerful umbrella body for global regulators has criticised the administrators of Libor and two other interbank lending rates for failing to show that they have improved the reliability and accuracy of such benchmarks.The administrators of Britain’s Libor and its European and Japanese equivalents Euribor and Tibor have not provided the data and analysis to demonstrate whether they are anchored in real transactions, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions said in a review of its benchmark principles.Iosco last year introduced those principles after the scandal over widespread manipulation of Libor sparked an intense debate about radical reform of the way such benchmarks are compiled.Regulators are keen to ensure that benchmarks are rooted in real market transactions rather than just bank submissions which, since the Libor scandal, are seen as susceptible to manipulation.“None of the administrators has completed an analysis of methodologies to provide a basis for deciding whether the submissions are anchored in that market,” Iosco said in its report.The group gave administrators until the end of the year to set out concrete steps to address this issue.Iosco’s report comes shortly after IntercontinentalExchange, which took over the administration of Libor this year, began asking banks for internal transaction data and also started testing a new system to collect and validate rates the banks submit.Restoring the integrity of financial benchmarks has moved to the top of the global regulatory agenda after the Libor scandal led to billions of dollars of fines for banks.Major reference interest rates such as Libor, Euribor and Tibor should be “to the greatest extent possible” based on actual trade data, the Financial Stability Board said in an additional report on Tuesday.The FSB also called on market participants to investigate the feasibility of developing alternative, fully transaction-data based reference rates.
205;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Intercontinental Exchange starts hunt for interest rates chief;;Intercontinental Exchange is preparing to deepen its push into off-exchange derivatives markets in Europe, beginning with the search for a head of its interest rates business.The US derivatives operator has appointed Heidrick & Struggles to lead the search, according to three people familiar with the talks.The new recruit is expected to head exchange-traded derivatives, part of the Liffe London derivatives exchange ICE bought last year as part of its $11bn purchase of NYSE Euronext. They will also be expected to lead ICE’s push into clearing interest rate swaps in Europe in the next year. David Peniket will remain as president and chief operating officer of Liffe. ICE declined to comment.The group is in the middle of moving NYSE Euronext’s derivatives businesses to its own platforms from NYSE-owned systems. The shift will centralise ICE’s global interest rate portfolio on one exchange and cut the high cost for customers to connect to multiple venues.It would also provide the platform for a deeper push into clearing interest rate swaps and a challenge to LCH.Clearnet, the dominant local market player. In particular ICE could offer customers large savings on the margin they must post to back their derivatives trades by netting their futures and OTC positions.Rival CME Group, which offers the service in the US, has estimated saving one of its biggest customers $1bn a day by cross-margining positions.ICE is expected to move the trading operations for Liffe’s European interest rates business switching over in the autumn.Last year it transferred the open positions of fixed income, equity, currency and commodities trades made on NYSE Liffe to its own clearing house from LCH.Clearnet.
206;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-07-21T12:40:47Z;Speculators cut bets on higher oil prices;;Speculators cut their bets on higher Brent crude oil prices by almost a quarter in the week to July 15 after prices dropped to three-month lows.Hedge funds and other money managers curbed their net long futures and options positions to 151,981 – the lowest since April 8 – from 201,568 contracts, the IntercontinentalExchange said in its Commitment of Traders report on Monday.Concerns about supply disruptions eased, leading investors to unwind bullish positions and sell futures contracts.This prompted prices to fall to $104.39 a barrel – the lowest in three months – in the week ending July 15, after rising to more than $115 a barrel in mid-June.In the last four weeks, bullish bets on the price of oil have dropped by 76,694, which is equal to 76m barrels, said Abhishek Deshpande, oil markets analyst at Natixis.“These net long positions have fallen after being up mostly for geopolitical reasons, the fear around Iraq and Libya.”The latest data confirmed analyst comments and anecdotal evidence of an exodus of funds from oil markets and echoed numbers from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission that were published on Friday.The CFTC said speculators reduced their net-long positions on West Texas Intermediate by 304,366 to 259,259 futures and options contracts over the same period – the lowest level since the week ending January 21.Fears that lightning advances by militants and sectarian violence in Iraq could disrupt supplies from Opec’s second-largest producer, alongside other geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and north Africa, had propelled prices last month.But a ramp-up in Libyan exports, oil supplies from southern Iraq that remained unhindered combined with weakness in the physical markets resulted in a retreat of the price of Brent crude.This lasted until late last week when stricter sanctions on Russia and the crash of a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane spurred oil prices again as market watchers feared the two events could present another threat to global crude supplies.Also unsettling markets was the expansion of Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza.Although there was no imminent threat to oil supplies, markets have been watching the situation closely for any impact on neighbouring oil producing regions.ICE September Brent rose 0.2 per cent to $107.42 a barrel on Monday while Nymex August West Texas Intermediate increased 0.9 per cent to $104.07.Analysts had said it was likely the price of oil would not stay at the lower levels of a few weeks earlier as geopolitical fractions remained pervasive.Despite an excess of supplies in the short term, the global oil market is still relatively tight.“From the Middle East to Asia to Africa, the list of supply disruptions is hard to ignore,” said analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Against our initial expectations, these disruptions have not eased meaningfully in the first half of the year.“We are modestly revising our average Brent crude oil price expectations for 2014 and 2015 from $106 to $110 [a barrel] and from $103 to $108 [a barrel], respectively,” they said.
207;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-07-08T21:27:23Z;Exchanges urge overhaul of trading rules;;Market rules that have fuelled the need for speed in trading should be overhauled to restore investor confidence, stock exchange executives and high-frequency trading participants told US senators on Tuesday.“The markets are too complex,” said Jeffrey Sprecher, head of the IntercontinentalExchange, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange. “They’ve lost track of trying to get the best price for a company trying to raise money.”Thomas Wittman, executive vice-president of Nasdaq, told a Senate hearing that investor demand and regulatory complexity had made US markets “lightning fast, fragmented and deeply interconnected.” He added that: “This complexity has added many more friction points where mistakes can occur.”The hearing came as regulators and law enforcement officials are scrutinising high-frequency trading amid allegations that it is rigging markets against traditional investors. Much of the focus has been on the “dark pools” where investors can trade large blocks of shares anonymously off exchanges.Two weeks ago, the New York state attorney-general sued Barclays for allegedly favouring high-speed traders using its dark pool while misleading institutional investors. Senator Jack Reed told Tuesday’s hearing that such allegations contributed to scepticism in the market.The Senate hearing focused on what regulators could do to restore investor confidence. Mary Jo White, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in June announced several sweeping initiatives to bring more transparency to high-frequency trading, including examining SEC rules to see if they have contributed to problems in the market.While participants in Tuesday’s hearing said they supported Ms White’s proposals, some urged her to go further. They focused in particular on the regulation known as Reg NMS, which requires that investors be able to obtain the best possible price on stock trades. This has been blamed for complicating markets by spurring fragmentation, resulting in 13 exchanges and about 50 dark pools.Ms White said the SEC would examine certain provisions of Reg NMS, but some hearing participants said the SEC needed to look at the entire rule. Some SEC commissioners have suggested scrapping it all together.The markets are too complex. They’ve lost track of trying to get the best price for a company trying to raise moneyKen Griffin, chief executive of Citadel, one of the biggest high-frequency trading companies, called on the SEC to lower the “access fees” that exchanges can charge brokers to enter the market, which are part of Reg NMS.For certain stocks, exchanges can charge a maximum of 30 cents per 100 shares to access a stock quote. Exchanges often use those fees to offer rebates to brokers who increase liquidity in the market, which is known as the maker-taker model.Mr Sprecher has gone further by calling for an end to the maker-taker model, a suggestion he repeated on Tuesday.Senator Sherrod Brown, a fierce Wall Street critic, asked Mr Sprecher if he would eliminate more order types that allow high-frequency traders to jump ahead in the line to execute their orders.Mr Sprecher said he would work to reduce order types further, but said the computers used to route orders were part of the problem. He added that he was speaking publicly in the hope that other exchanges would also move in that direction.“I need to put pressure on all my colleagues to take my lead,” Mr Sprecher said.Mr Griffin also took aim at the exchanges, saying the special status of those self-regulated entities created conflicts of interest that needed to be reduced.“This conflict of interest in the dual role of regulator and competitor has led to inconsistencies in the manner in which the exchanges regulate their members,” he said.
208;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;ICE prepares deeper reform of Libor;;Intercontinental Exchange is preparing to ask banks that submit Libor rates for more of their internal transaction data as the derivatives exchange operator rehabilitates the scandal-hit benchmark.The US group has begun asking some banks for more details of deals they have conducted and has also started testing a new ICE-built system to collect and validate rates the banks submit, according to two people familiar with the situation.ICE’s push has caused some consternation with some of the panel banks required to submit Libor rates, concerned about turning over what they consider sensitive and proprietary data to a third party, bankers said.“Some banks do not have the data, others remain wary as to what ICE is doing with it,” said one person familiar with the discussions. ICE declined to comment on the move.Restoring the integrity of financial benchmarks has moved to the top of the global regulatory agenda after an investigation into Libor, a key bank lending rate. The five-year probe by global authorities has led to billions of dollars of fines for banks, and sparked investigations into benchmarks for other markets, including oil and foreign exchange.The tension illustrates the difficulties faced by market practitioners to implement reforms demanded by regulators. However ICE is mandated to anchor Libor, a rate that banks charge each other for short-term loans, in transactions and few banks are willing to commit to unsecured lending.ICE has sought to strengthen the governance committee overseeing the rate with the appointment of representative of the Swiss National Bank and the Washington Federal Reserve.It also appointed as Michel Prada, the former chairman of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, the French markets and securities regulator, as an independent non-executive to the governance committee. Mr Prada has also sat on committees for Iosco and the Financial Stability Forum and pushed for Europe to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards.The new technology system, currently being tested by banks, has been built internally by ICE and is set to replace and extend the rate-collecting service currently supplied by Thomson Reuters.ICE, which took over as administrator for Libor from the British Bankers’ Association in February, has also begun discussions with central banks and large pension funds around the world about the long-term development of Libor.The group’s root-and-branch overhaul of the Libor benchmark rate may go further than the recommendations laid out in last year’s Wheatley Review, which was backed by the UK government.The report called for the administrator to compare data provided by the panel banks with related markets, their own submission history and that of other panel banks.Earlier this year ICE won the mandate to administer the dollar, euro, Swiss franc and sterling rates of Isdafix, an interest rate benchmark that underpins thousands of contracts in the $400tn over-the-counter swaps market.
209;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Low volatility hits derivatives trading;;Prospects for interest rate rises in the US and UK brought isolated bursts of activity to an otherwise slack first half of the year on the world’s largest derivatives exchanges.Low volatility in markets from bonds to commodities has slowed volumes as investors feel less inclined to trade instruments that hedge risk. The Bank for International Settlements warned financial markets have become “euphoric”, with asset prices potentially overvalued.The torpor has affected shares of exchange groups such as CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and Deutsche Börse as well as profits at Wall Street trading desks.“When it comes to trading, more volatility is generally better,” said Gaston Ceron, analyst at Morningstar.One market where volume picked up in some places was interest rates, as traders bet on future monetary policy at the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Volume in CME’s flagship eurodollar interest rate futures rose 20.6 per cent in the first half from the same period last year, contributing to a 4.7 per cent increase in overall daily volume at the exchange, new data showed.Average daily volume in CME’s interest rates product line has been running at the highest level since 2007. However, it dipped 25 per cent in June from the same month of 2013, when uncertainty over when the Fed would begin curtailing its bond-buying programme unnerved markets.Liffe, the London derivatives exchange owned by ICE, reported a record number of trades in short-sterling futures and options contracts, used to speculate and hedge against rate changes, after Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the case for raising the UK base lending rate from a historic low “could happen sooner than markets currently expect”. CME had record volume in British pound futures.However, ICE said on Thursday that daily interest rate volume fell 26 per cent in the first half, citing “continued low volatility” for a further drop in June.Eurex, the derivatives bourse owned by Deutsche Börse, recorded a 13 per cent fall in daily volume for the first half, with volumes softening further as summer approached.The group’s fortunes are more tied to the euro yield curve. Investor appetite for risk-offsetting contracts has been suppressed by the European Central Bank’s decision to impose a negative interest rate on overnight deposits. Eurex’s long-term interest rate derivatives for German government bond futures – the Bund, Bobl and Schatz futures – also registered double-digit declines in June.A few other markets have accelerated, notably corn, wheat, live cattle and lean hogs futures at CME. At ICE and CME, volume in benchmark Brent crude jumped as a violent insurgency routed security forces in Iraq, a major oil producer.
210;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
211;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-07-01T07:17:17Z;Contenders line up for silver benchmark;Platts and ICE are among seven groups hoping to take contract;For a metal normally associated with second prize, silver is attracting a lot of interest. Seven contenders have entered the race to run the global silver benchmark once the 117-year-old London fix is abandoned in August.Last week at a seminar organised by the London Bullion Market Association, the companies presented their proposed solutions to market participants – from miners to banks and jewellers – who will help choose the winner. The Financial Conduct Authority sent observers and will also have a say over the successor to the fix, which currently involves three banks who meet daily via teleconference to match their buy and sell orders.The LBMA has helpfully uploaded the companies’ presentations, or outlines of their plans, on its website. In no particular order, here is a summary of the various proposals.Platts, which has a long history of providing commodity prices, stressed the need for continuity. It suggests moving the current auction-style process on to an open, transparent electronic system. An independent chairman will adjust the price based on supply and demand, and Platts would also provide an opening auction price.Similarly, Autilla, a London-based commodity firm, said it wants to keep the “spirit, tradition and prestige” of the present fix, but would automate the process using its cloud-based platform, supported by Sweden’s Cinnober Financial Technology. It will also provide a live commentary stream to market participants and the clients, as the banks currently do.By contrast, the IntercontinentalExchange, which operates 11 futures exchange in North America and Europe, wants to “evolve, modernise and de-risk” the fix. It offered little other detail, other than to say the benchmark would be electronic, auction-based and tradeable. The London Metal Exchange, the world biggest metals bourse, was also confident, describing itself as a “natural London home for silver”. It suggests leveraging the LMEselect trading platform, used for all of its industrial metal contracts, to run an electronic auction.Bloomberg, the financial news provider, offered two possible solutions via the electronic trading platforms on its Bloomberg Professional service. The first would be a closed auction where participants submit buy or sell interest at various prices during a set time, after which the trades are matched and the benchmark price published. Under the alternative method, Bloomberg would monitor all silver trades during a defined time, and then calculate the fix price.ETF Securities, which runs some of the biggest precious metal exchange traded funds, also wants to take advantage of a short window, in its case the existing five-minute auction used to determine the closing price of shares on the London Stock Exchange. The firm’s silver ETF, which tracks the spot price of the metal, trades on the LSE and would be the basis for the auction.The last solution comes from Thomson Reuters and the CME Group, which runs the biggest precious metals futures contracts. A summary of their proposal contained little detail, other than to say it was an “electronic, over-the-counter, transaction-based” system.The LBMA expects to announce the winner in early July, in time for launch on August 15. Whichever company emerges victorious will have double reason to feel pleased, for it will also be in prime position to bid for the gold fix, should that also be abolished.
212;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-06-25T22:59:05Z;Doubts grow over Davies report on Heathrow;;Lord Heseltine and Lord Adonis have warned that the disagreement over whether to expand Heathrow is unlikely to be resolved by the independent commission set up by the coalition to examine how to increase Britain’s aviation capacity.Ministers appointed Sir Howard Davies, former head of the CBI, in 2012 to examine how to expand aviation capacity in the southeast after a coalition fight broke out over whether to allow a third runway at Heathrow.The government had scrapped the former Labour government’s plans for a third runway, only for Tory chancellor George Osborne to become increasingly keen on reviving the idea.But Lord Heseltine, the former Tory deputy prime minister, said on Wednesday that there had been little progress on increasing airport capacity for the past 50 years. “The chances of getting consensus on the issue is very, very limited,” he told an audience of infrastructure experts in Westminster.Lord Adonis, Labour’s shadow infrastructure minister, echoed the view that the chances of Heathrow getting the green light in the next parliament were slim. The Davies commission will not report until after the general election, and party manifestos are unlikely to spell out their positions on the airport in any detail, he said.This meant there would be “another big row because the recommendations have not been put before the electorate. Meanwhile, we have a country that is closed for business,” the Labour peer, widely seen as the architect of the HS2 rail project, warned.Meanwhile, the CBI has urged all political parties not to “kick the can” further down the road on aviation, and business leaders have begged politicians to forge a consensus around the Davies findings.The Institution of Civil Engineers added its voice on Thursday, calling on the government to “get on with it” and make decisions on infrastructure. Four years after the coalition came to power announcing a £375bn pipeline for new energy, road and rail projects, there was evidence that the government was “good at drawing up plans, but not so good at delivering,” said Keith Clarke, vice president of the ICE.The ICE, which has 80,000 members, warned that the UK has dropped from 24th to 28th in the World Economic Forum rankings for quality of infrastructure, behind Barbados and Saudi Arabia. Three areas are of particular concern – energy, flood management and local transport, it said.Maintenance investment in local roads had declined by 11 per cent in real terms from 2011 to 2014/15, leaving one-third of local roads in urgent need of attention.In flood defences, the government is spending £1.4bn less than the Environment Agency estimates is required.Meanwhile, an increasing reliance on gas imports, the decline in production from the North Sea and a dearth of storage facilities have increased “vulnerability to unplanned outages”, ICE warned. In March 2013, for example, technical problems with the Langeled line supplying gas to the UK from Norway temporarily disrupted gas imports, resulting in price spikes and blackout warnings.Although the coalition has urged the private sector to invest in infrastructure, there are only two sources of funding: “tax, user charges or a combination of the two”, said Mr Clarke. “Clever finance is great, but it always comes back to who is going to pay it back.”
213;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-06-25T01:26:07Z;ICE raises €1.4bn from Euronext disposal;;IntercontinentalExchange confirmed on Tuesday it would receive about €1.4bn ($1.9bn) in cash from last week’s disposal of Euronext, the European exchanges operator.The US derivatives exchange operator said the sum included net cash from Euronext as it separated the business from its parent NYSE Euronext, and also split away Liffe, the UK derivatives exchange. However it excluded an option to allocate more shares to the banks underwriting Euronext’s IPO.The demerging of Euronext, via a listing, was a key part of ICE’s $11bn purchase of NYSE Euronext last year, with ICE keen to reassure shareholders that had bought ICE for growth that ICE would not end up holding a sizeable stake in a cash-generative but steady business.ICE’s outstanding debt rose to $5.2bn in the wake of the deal, with a debt-to-adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 2.56 times. ICE aims to reduce that ratio to 1.5 times within the next 18 months.“The proceeds will enable us to repay debt, invest for growth and return capital to shareholders,” said Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE.Shares in ICE fell 3.4 per cent to $191 following a downgrade by Wells Fargo.Although ICE sold the majority of the 70m shares, it has granted a 30-day overallotment option of 4.2m shares to Euronext’s underwriters. If ICE is left holding the rump, those shares will be subject to a 180-day lock-up.Euronext shares were priced at €20 on its debut last Friday and were trading at €18.81 on Tuesday afternoon.The IPO capped a busy few days for ICE in which it also sold off unwanted assets inherited from the purchase of NYSE Technologies. On closing its purchase, ICE immediately signalled it would break up NYSE’s IT business, keeping some parts but offloading others.Asset sales included the disposals of Wombat Financial Software, a data management software group, to SR Labs of the US, and the sales of Nyfix and Metabit to Ullink, a French group backed by HG Capital.NYSE had bought Nyfix, a US group that enabled communications between traders and brokers, for $144m, and paid $200m for Wombat. The sales are expected to close in the third quarter.Terms of the sales for the technology businesses were not disclosed.

It's the beginning of a new era, and we are excited to have a strong and powerful group of reference shareholders”.Euronext said potential conflicts of interest would be mitigated by the group having a formal shareholder pact to act as one, and by having three board seats. Consequently, they would also have fiduciary duties to act in the exchange’s interests.July 2013: NYSE Euronext, the transatlantic exchanges operator, has beaten London-based rivals to take over and reform the scandal-plagued Libor rate. The FT’s chief regulation correspondent Brooke Masters examines the implicationsThe formal publication of the prospectus is expected to be signed off by Dutch regulators in the coming weeks, with its debut to take place “before the summer”, he added.The group will begin by listing on three stock markets it owns – Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. A fourth, Lisbon, will follow before the fourth quarter of this year. Euronext has also applied for regulatory approval to operate as a UK-based exchange.It is not expected to raise much new money from the float and will look to fund its growth plans in derivatives, commodities and repo markets from existing cash resources.The group of financial institutions ICE has agreed to sell to include Banco Espirito Santo, BNP Paribas, ABN Amro, ASR Nederland, Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, Bpifrance Participations, Euroclear, Société Fédérale de Participations et d’Investissement, Société Générale and BPI Vida e Pensões-Companhia de Seguros. They have agreed not to sell any shares for three years.ABN Amro, JPMorgan and Société Générale will be joint global co-ordinators for the listing while Goldman Sachs, ING and Morgan Stanley will act as joint bookrunners. BBVA, BMO Capital Markets, BPI, CM-CIC Securities, Espírito Santo Investment Bank, KBC Securities and Mitsubishi UFJ Securities will act as lead managers.www.ft.com/tradingroom
215;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-05-08T18:04:32Z;ICE chief pledges to simplify stocks trading;;The new owner of the New York Stock Exchange has waded into the raging debate over high-frequency trading and promised to simplify trading in an effort to restore investor confidence in the world’s biggest equity market.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive at IntercontinentalExchange Group, which took over NYSE Euronext last November, said the company’s three US equity exchanges would unilaterally seek to drop some types of orders as part of efforts to reduce the market’s complexity.He also called on competing exchanges to impose a moratorium on new order types, which critics say are used by high-speed trading groups to fish for information about other investors’ orders.“What’s saddening about the US equity market is that when I go out and talk to my friends, they do not have confidence in those markets,” said Mr Sprecher, whose company originated as a commodities trading venue. “Trying to take a bigger piece of a shrinking pie is a silly business and we should all be trying in this industry to grow that pie.”High-frequency traders, which use algorithms and well-placed computer servers to dart across markets in millionths of a second, have come under increased scrutiny since the stock market “flash crash” unnerved investors, four years ago this week. The recent book Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, which said the stock market was rigged, has added to concerns.What’s saddening about the US equity market is that when I go out and talk to my friends, they do not have confidence in those marketsThe US Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Department of Justice and FBI all recently confirmed investigations into high-frequency trading, along with New York attorney-general Eric Schneiderman.Mr Sprecher’s provocative comments put him at odds with other exchange bosses who have sought to defend the status quo.Certain stock order types enable professional traders to execute deals on the market without showing their entire order to rivals. Critics also allege the proliferation of order types has made the market too complex.“The reality is if you look at the quality of people that are writing algorithms, these people are literally some of the smartest people in the world,” Mr Sprecher said. “Just from a societal standpoint, it seems like a misallocation of resources.”He made his comments as ICE reported first-quarter net profit of $262m, or $2.27 per share, up from $135m, or $1.85 per share, a year earlier. Shares fell 3.7 per cent to $194.25 as investors worried about company expenses.ICE took over NYSE Euronext in a $13bn deal, including debt, that included the New York Stock Exchange. The stock market has fractured since the US in 2007 adopted its National Market System regulation aiming to give small investors the best possible prices.Mr Sprecher said that the NYSE would “unilaterally” seek to reduce the markets’ complexity by seeking approval to eliminate more than a dozen order types. He added that “exchanges and dark pools should adopt a moratorium on creating any new types of orders”.Among rival US exchanges, Nasdaq and BATS Global Markets each had no comment.Mr Sprecher, who built his business in highly centralised futures markets where high-frequency traders are also participants, called equity market fragmentation “unnatural for the ultimate end-user” saying it “tends to be promoted by those who seek to benefit from access to better information”.Additional reporting by Philip Stafford in London
216;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-05-08T00:34:53Z;Euronext to list on three markets;;Euronext is set to list in France, the Netherlands and Belgium when the European exchanges operator formally demerges from parent IntercontinentalExchange in coming weeks.The group, which runs equities bourses and derivatives markets, is close to completing its prospectus ahead of a listing expected to take place before the end of the second quarter, according to two people familiar with the situation.A formal announcement may come as early as next week, the people said. Euronext will list on the market in Lisbon, a fourth European equity market it owns, after the IPO, the people added.The relisting of the exchange is likely to mean one of the most high-profile pieces of European market infrastructure returns to European ownership after it was bought by US-based ICE as part of an $11bn deal last year.The demerger was a key part of ICE’s integration, with the Atlanta-based group looking to sell at least a quarter of Euronext a way to circumvent regulatory requirements that it hold a long-term stake in the European group. However the flotation is not dependent on the stake being sold, the people said, and may not be completed before the listing.A group of up to 10 companies are interested in taking a stake, including BNP Paribas, Société Générale and Euroclear, the post-trade services group, although final terms and paperwork have yet to be completed.In preparation the group has overhauled its management team and is led by Dominique Cerutti, the former deputy chief executive of NYSE Euronext. It now sits as a fully-independent company within ICE. Euronext is not expected to raise much new money from the float and will look to fund its growth plans in derivatives, commodities and repo markets from existing cash resources.

Reuters, which collected data for all non-US dollar Isdafix rates.The Isdafix rates are used by traders and banks to provide the average prices at which they would buy and sell benchmark swaps in major currencies and as a reference rate for floating rate bonds.A long-running investigation into manipulation of the Libor benchmark in recent years sparked similar investigations into other markets where prices used to compile benchmarks are submitted by market participants rather than derived from exchanges.Isdafix itself has been under investigation by US authorities for a year for alleged rigging by traders. To date, no charges have been brought against companies or individuals.As a regulated exchange, ICE is mandated to monitor market abuse on a daily basis. Its winning pitch means ICE will be responsible for two of the world’s biggest benchmarks; it took over the administration of Libor when it bought NYSE Euronext last year.Global regulators want to move the benchmark compilation role away from banks to independent bodies, to limit the potential for manipulation.The International Organisation of Securities Commissions, a global body of central banks, has given the market till July to improve its practices.Isda undertook a full-scale review of the Isdafix process in January and plans to step back from ownership of the benchmark.It wants to automate the process and use live prices from transparent electronic trading venues. ICE, via its London-based Liffe derivatives exchange, already trades contracts based on live prices for the interest rate curve. It also runs several energy benchmarks.The transition of the euro Isdafix rate is expected to take place over the summer, with other currencies, including the dollar, to be completed by the end of the year.“This mandate shows that the industry has confidence in our ability to oversee and evolve benchmarks in a transparent, independent and neutral manner,” said Finbarr Hutcheson, president of ICE Benchmark Administration, the London-based subsidiary that will oversee Isdafix.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive, has hinted that ICE will look to develop other international initiatives around its benchmark operations.Isdafix is compiled from a survey of 16 banks for a range of currencies. ICE is currently moving the technology platform of Libor on to its own systems."
218;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;SGX and ICE signal hopes for closer ties;;The prospect of closer ties between two of the biggest exchange groups in the US and Asia has emerged after the chief executives of SGX, the Singapore exchange, and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) both said they could collaborate with each other on business in Singapore.The development is a sign that Singapore is poised to expand as a financial centre beyond commodity and foreign exchange trading as western exchanges rush to build infrastructure crucial to tapping trading opportunities in Asia.Any sign that SGX and ICE can work together not only holds out the prospect of a full-blown merger later, but could complicate efforts by Deutsche Börse, the European exchange group, to pursue its recently announced ambition to build a beachhead in Asia, also from Singapore.ICE is in the midst of building a new commodity and energy exchange in the Asian city-state out of the former Singapore Mercantile Exchange, which the US operator bought five months ago.The acquisition marks the first time any western bourse has set up infrastructure in Singapore and has been seen as a competitive threat to the incumbent, SGX, which has a fast-growing commodities and energy business.ICE is likely to kick off its new exchange by offering a range of energy derivatives, as well as clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) energy and commodity derivatives.However, Magnus Böcker, SGX chief executive, said: “I have no reason to believe we can’t work with ICE. We are complementary and our products have little overlap. I think that opens up a lot of opportunities.”His comments come only two weeks after ICE chief executive, Jeff Sprecher, downplayed any threat posed by his arrival in Singapore, saying he and Mr Böcker would “see what we may be able to do together”.Asked in an interview in Singapore if he had anything in mind, Mr Sprecher said: “Not specific. Right now we’re focused on getting our own infrastructure in place, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t opportunities for us together.March 12, 2014: Magnus Böcker, chief executive of SGX, the Singapore exchange, explains to FT Trading Room editor Philip Stafford why competition is critical if the city-state is to become the ‘London of Asia’.“He [Mr Böcker] and I have the kind of relationship where we can work things out. They [SGX] have a huge membership base and footprint that goes back for years that really is ingrained in the economy here and we’re starting with almost nothing. So there may be opportunities for us to find ways of working together.”SGX has been trying to grow its business organically since the failure under Mr Böcker in 2011 of an attempted takeover of ASX, the Australian exchange.However, the exchange is seen by analysts as lacking the scale of market infrastructure to support what many see as the next stage of Singapore’s growth as a financial centre based on its existing strengths in coal, iron ore, crude oil and liquefied natural gas trading and storage.“If we really want to be a [major] financial centre we need to see more exchanges in town,” Mr Böcker said.
219;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Deutsche Börse hopes that its philosophy has global appeal;Exchange’s breadth of operations is unrivalled;While EU and US policy makers press on with reforming markets in the wake of the financial crisis, Deutsche Börse (DB) stands apart.North Atlantic rivals may have more volume in particular products, but none has the breadth of operations of Europe’s largest infrastructure operator by market capitalisation.Thanks to long-term planning, its operations have mushroomed in the last 20 years from share trading to derivatives and commodities, and providing IT services and market data.It has built on extensive post-trade services, such as clearing and settlement, which, while not always attracting much attention, provide a critical market “plumbing” by offsetting systemic risks from trading.These units account for the majority of profits and create a highly integrated business the group sees as fundamental to a particular strand of capitalism.Reto Francioni, chief executive, told business leaders and politicians in January: “We share the same basic belief that the market economy also has to fulfil a social obligation, and that the ‘Rhine capitalism’ model of an economy buffered by corporations and focused on the long term, with strictly regulated markets – which are free for that very reason – is fundamentally superior to the Anglo-American capitalism model of deregulation.”Yet, perhaps surprisingly, few politicians and regulators see the bourse as a role model. Instead, it finds itself facing threats to its status, particularly from Brussels.The first blow came two years ago, when antitrust officials blocked its planned merger with NYSE Euro­next, the transatlantic exchange operator, saying the combination would have created a European monopoly in futures markets. The ruling had two ramifications say senior executives, who maintain it makes further acquisitions in Europe difficult and puts local companies at a disadvantage to US rivals.Chicago-based CME Group had been allowed by its regulators to pursue a combination that gave it a near-monopoly in interest rate futures in the US. Then, Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) swooped in to buy NYSE Euronext for $11bn.As ICE already had extensive London-based operations, this has created a bigger rival to DB’s Eurex derivatives business in the European heartland. CME plans to launch a futures exchange in London in late April.CME’s divisions will also square up in two of Eurex’s new developments, foreign exchange futures trading and over-the-counter (OTC) swaps clearing.For all three, the goal is to persuade investors to process more of their derivatives trades through their clearing houses, allowing customers to save on margin by netting out positions.Post-crisis, global regulators have sought to underpin financial markets by pushing more of the over-the-counter market through these risk managers, which guarantee a trade in the event of a counterparty default.But it is unclear how profitable this business could be, with regulators keen to avoid clearing houses competing by cutting prices or skimping on risk management processes.In February, Morgan Stanley said the market for OTC clearing in Europe could be worth an extra €160m in revenues.Even if Deutsche Börse won a quarter of this market, it would accrue only €40m in revenues, about 2 per cent of its group total, the bank said.Another threat comes from Europe’s review of its key markets legislation, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Known as Mifid II, it seeks to introduce competition in futures trading, clearing and ownership of market indices.Taken together, these moves could force open what is known as the “vertical silo” of integrated business that has played an important part in Deutsche Börse’s growth.But the rules are unlikely to come into force until 2019 and DB executives expect to win as much in new business as they lose in old.A European financial transactions tax, as pursued by its own government, may also hit profits.Faced with potential threats in its backyard, it is exploring new products and markets, such as corporate bond trading and interest rate swap futures. Central to its long-term vision is Asia, mirroring the trade flows between China and Germany.Europe’s largest economy is the biggest recipient of Chinese investment in the region. Germany took in €1.27bn in the first nine months of 2013, according to A Capital, a private equity group.Deutsche Börse has also bought a stake in the Taiwan Futures Exchange and will open a derivatives clearing house in Singapore.More than that, it hopes that its philosophy of a capitalism based on long-term careful planning will find a more receptive audience worldwide.In another notable win, Deutsche Börse beat the London Stock Exchange Group and Nasdaq OMX of the US to supply the technology to upgrade the Bombay Stock Exchange’s platforms. The Börse offered its code as open source software, which allows the BSE to tweak its technology to meet regulatory changes.“For me it is the correct way to look at the world,” says Ashishkumar Chauhan, chief executive of the BSE. “We are not customers, we are partners.”
220;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-04-16T08:28:56Z;ICE on the cutting edge of Asia pivot;;Sitting in the colonial-era Fullerton Hotel building, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange enthuses about the impression Singapore makes on visitors as they arrive in the tiny city-state by air.“We flew in at dawn this morning so it was dark. And just the number of lights on the ocean, which are all ships parked out there, it’s amazing,” says Jeff Sprecher, who is also chief executive of IntercontinentalExchange, one of the world’s biggest exchange companies and owner of the NYSE.Mr Sprecher spends most of his time either in Atlanta, where ICE is headquartered, or in New York, after his acquisition of NYSE Euronext last year made him chairman of the venerable Wall Street bourse.But his rare visit to Singapore signals an important shift not only for ICE’s business but for western exchanges in general and for the Asian country itself.ICE this week could win approval from the Singapore regulator for a new exchange and clearing house– marking the first time a western bourse has set up market infrastructure in Singapore.The new entity is the result of five months of work transforming the former Singapore Mercantile Exchange, which ICE bought for $150m last year, into a new business aimed at tapping into Asia’s – particularly China’s – swelling appetite for commodity and derivatives trading.ICE, founded by Mr Sprecher in 2000, operates 17 exchanges and six clearing houses globally. They offer trading and clearing of benchmark futures and options contracts including on Brent and WTI crude oil, coal, gas, jet fuel and frozen orange juice, listed on the New York Board of Trade, which ICE bought in 2007.So far, ICE and its rivals – CME Group, operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Deutsche Börse – have handled trading and clearing for Asia customers out of London or Frankfurt.But Mr Sprecher says Singapore’s emergence as a vibrant centre for commodities and over-the-counter (OTC) energy derivatives, coupled with its role as a shipping entrepôt – clearly visible from his aircraft window – means it is time to build a bricks and mortar presence in the region.He says that because of differences between US and European regulators on how to implement sweeping G20 financial system reforms such as the US Dodd-Frank Act, trading is becoming more regional.“We got this sense at ICE that our customers were going to be facing a ‘Balkanisation’ of trading. In other words, it was going to be hard to sit in any one location and trade around the world,” Mr Sprecher says in an interview.The collapse of US futures broker MF Global in 2011 illustrated that when big defaults happen, customers prefer to deal with clearing houses – which intermediate between trading counterparties – in their own timezone. In that situation many counterparties were Asia-based but the main clearing houses were in Chicago and London.“We could see that our customers here [in Asia] would get up in the morning and decisions would have been made on their positions. So you could see this …was already suggesting that people prefer to trade and clear in their own timezone,” Mr Sprecher says.ICE settled on Singapore as the location for its new exchange after a three-year study that concluded that in spite of Hong Kong’s proximity to China and its commodity demand, related trading activities would not all automatically shift there.“Clearly, at some point mainland China is going to have more [of an] outward reach and potentially we may have the ability to move in there. But I think right now our sense is, where we are strong – which is really in commodities and physical products – that Singapore is best positioned right now,” says Mr Sprecher.It is no coincidence that Deutsche Börse recently said it too plans to build a clearing house for Asia in Singapore.All this suggests the city-state is set to become a key Asia centre for exchange and clearing activity outside China and Japan, adding another dimension to a financial centre already known for wealth management and foreign exchange.“Everything is yen-based in Japan while China is a semi-closed market, so the opening is there for Singapore to take a leadership position for all other traded and cleared Asian OTC energy and commodity products,” says Bill Herder, Singapore-based head of the Asia chapter of the Futures Industry Association.ICE’s new venture will pit it against the Singapore Exchange, whose fastest-growing businesses are trading and clearing of commodity and energy derivatives.However, Mr Sprecher plays down any rivalry, holding out the prospect that the two exchanges could even collaborate: “Right now we’re focused on getting our own infrastructure in place, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t opportunities for us together.”The immediate challenge will be for ICE to come up with products that will ensure its fledgling Asian exchange will succeed. Asked what those might be, Mr Sprecher says: “We haven’t said yet but what we need are some early hits, a bit like a Broadway play. When the curtain opens we need people to say it’s good.”
221;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-04-15T11:42:31Z;ICE set to name Lucas Schmeddes as Asia chief;;IntercontinentalExchange is set to install Lucas Schmeddes, former chief operating officer of its Dutch gas and power derivatives business, as head of the group’s new exchange and clearing house in Singapore.The move comes as the Atlanta-based group prepares to use the city-state as a springboard for growth in Asia.Mr Schmeddes, a Dutch national who previously worked at ICE Endex, will become president of ICE’s Singapore exchange and clearing house, pending approval of his appointment by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said three people familiar with the matter.Jennifer Ilkiw, a Canadian who heads ICE’s operations in Asia at its office in Singapore, will be made vice-president for Asia and will handle sales in the region.ICE declined to comment.The new entity will constitute two separate legal entities, one ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore. Mr Schmeddes will head both.They will replace the former Singapore Mercantile Exchange, a commodity bourse, and its clearer, SMX CC, both of which ICE bought from Financial Technologies, an Indian group, in November for a total of $150m.The move gave ICE an initial head start over rivals – CME Group, operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Deutsche Börse – in gaining a physical foothold in a region that is rapidly becoming the main global battleground in derivatives trading.Buying SMX gave ICE a fully licensed derivatives clearing house in Singapore, making it the first non-Asian exchange to own a clearing house in the region.The acquisition of SMX will allow ICE to offer clearing in Asia directly at a time when Asian end-users and traders are increasingly concerned about managing risk in their own timezone as post-2008 crisis regulations fragment trading by region.Since the acquisition was announced in November, ICE has closed down SMX’s existing infrastructure, which includes a clearing house and a trading platform on which SMX offered gold and silver futures, as well as pepper futures.The US group has since been building its own infrastructure and expects the new exchange and clearing house to go live in the second half of this year.ICE has not yet revealed which contracts it will launch on the new platform but the appointment of Mr Schmeddes suggest that it will, at least initially, be related to the range of energy and commodity products already traded in Singapore, such as liquefied natural gas, jet fuel, crude oil, iron ore and coal.ICE Endex was established with a Dutch gas infrastructure company only last year and offers trading in UK, Dutch and German spot natural gas, and Dutch and Belgian power derivatives, from its base in Amsterdam.“In recent years, Asia-based trading activity in our benchmark energy and interest rate products has been rising as the region increases in importance in global markets,” said David Goone, ICE’s chief strategy officer, at the time of the SMX acquisition in November.
222;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-04-14T19:28:10Z;ICE Clear Europe wins European CDS approval;;IntercontinentalExchange will begin clearing European sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) after US clearance brought to an end an 18-month wait for the US derivatives exchange to win regulatory approval.The Atlanta-based exchange confirmed on Monday it would begin clearing on April 28, after receiving regulatory approval from both the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The group won UK regulatory clearance more than 18 months ago.ICE will become the first clearing house to process western European sovereign debt trades, beginning with Ireland, Spain, Italy and Portugal. “Subject to feedback from members and regulatory approvals, we will look to introduce additional sovereign CDS instruments in due course,” ICE said.The trades will go through its London-based ICE Clear Europe unit. Collectively ICE processed more than $50tn value of CDS in the past five years, with about $1.6tn of that total remaining as open interest.The group was the first exchange to offer clearing for corporate CDS – the over-the-counter derivatives widely blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis.The CDS market, which has a gross notional value of about $20tn, has fallen out of the favour with investors since the financial crisis, in part because Europe banned speculative trading in the swaps. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has estimated that the number of trades in the market has fallen by more than 60 per cent since then.Regulators want more of the vast $650tn over-the-counter swaps derivatives market to be processed through clearing houses and backed by collateral, or insurance. A clearing house stands between two parties, ensuring a trade is completed if one side defaults. Hitherto most OTC trades have been conducted privately and bilaterally. However only about $2.5tn of CDS swaps were cleared in 2012, according to Isda.That is in part as brokers have not pushed contracts on their own parent or the country in which its parent is based. CDS provide insurance against a default on bond payments and are used by investors to insure against risk and speculate on creditworthiness. Should the country default, the bank would then face making large payouts, increasing its own risk of default.ICE plans to denominate its dealings in US dollars and not euros. ICE said it had added considerations for country-specific exposure to its existing risk models.The group’s US unit already processes sovereign debt trades of several Latin American countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Russia and Venezuela.
223;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;CFTC steps up probe of ‘exchange for futures’ deals;Commodity regulator issues notices recommending civil action;The US derivatives watchdog has warned market participants of potential legal charges as it escalates a probe into more than a million energy, metals, foreign exchange and other swap transactions.Commodity Futures Trading Commission staff have sent “Wells notices” as they examine a broad category of transactions that includes “exchanges of futures for swaps,” or EFSs, three people familiar with the matter said.A Wells notice is an indication that CFTC staff intend to recommend commissioners authorise a civil action. It allows the recipient an opportunity to present evidence to try to dissuade the regulator from moving ahead with a lawsuit.Some Wells notices have been sent in the past two months, one person familiar with the matter said, although it was not clear how many notices were sent or to whom.The Financial Times reported last May that the regulator had issued a “special call” asking Wall Street banks and other traders to provide documents to prove their EFS transactions were legal.The CFTC division of market oversight subsequently referred the matter to agency enforcement lawyers responsible for investigating and prosecuting potential violations, people familiar with the matter said.EFSs are two-step transactions used by banks, energy companies and hedge funds to arrange specialised deals, often in illiquid markets where there are few counterparties and one trade could move prices dramatically.Industry lawyers and some traders say the CFTC is dwelling on a minor documentation issue in a market that has largely dried up. Volumes of swaps-to-futures transactions have declined sharply since October 2012, when exchange operators CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange changed their rules in response to new CFTC directives on swaps.Last month, CME announced penalties of between $10,000-$35,000 related to EFSs and similar transactions against nine parties including Deutsche Bank, Rabobank and Britannic Trading, a subsidiary of BP.Rabobank said it has not received a Wells notice. People familiar with the companies said that Deutsche and BP had not received one either.
224;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-03-11T22:47:02Z;Falling volumes lead to talk of broader Brent basket;;Slowing output from the North Sea may require IntercontinentalExchange to add oil grades from beyond the offshore European fields to underpin its flagship Brent crude contract, according to a senior exchange official.The comments from David Peniket, president of the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, echo growing industry concern that the global crude oil benchmark is backed by a declining source of supply. Brent trading generated $228m in revenue for ICE last year.While Brent futures volumes are climbing, the physical oil production from the North Sea that forms the basis of the market has fallen sharply in recent years. Critics contend Brent is “broken” as a marker for global oil prices.Mr Peniket called Brent the “world’s only truly global oil benchmark” at the annual gathering of the Futures Industry Association in Florida. But he said it was evolving, including recent changes to its trading calendar.“There are now discussions going on in the market around how Brent will need to continue to change. That will include adding further grades of North Sea oil, and may even include adding in grades from outside the North Sea. That remains to be seen,” Mr Peniket said.Mr Peniket’s comments echo others in the physical oil market. The head of Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil trading house, said in January that Brent should be widened to include grades from west Africa, Kazakhstan, Algeria, possibly Russia, and even the US.Jorge Montepeque, the global director of market reporting at Platts, also said in January that the agency, which assesses the prices for physical cargoes of Brent, might have to look outside the region if North Sea supply did not increase.Any additions to the crude grades that comprise the Brent benchmark could take years, market participants said.When Brent futures were launched in 1988, they were based solely on oil from the Brent field. The futures contract now encompasses four North Sea grades: Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk, all pumped from the North Sea.The crude market is one of the most competitive in the futures industry. Brent only recently captured the crown as the most widely traded contract from West Texas Intermediate, a US grade mainly traded on CME Group’s New York Mercantile Exchange. Unlike Brent, supplies of US light crude are rising rapidly due to the shale drilling boom.Nymex has its own Brent futures contract. Volumes doubled to 872,772 contracts in February compared to the year before. ICE Brent futures volume totalled 10.7m.In an interview, Mr Peniket said that Brent has “evolved through the years through adding new streams of oil within the North Sea. There is further potential within the North Sea for adding further grades, but naturally market participants are also looking beyond the North Sea”.
225;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-02-24T22:27:50Z;BME rules out buying a stake in Euronext;;Bolsas y Mercados Españoles is willing to explore partnerships with an independent Euronext but the Spanish exchanges operator has ruled itself out of becoming an investor in its rival exchange.Javier Hernani, BME general manager, said on Monday that the bourse would not be buying one of the stakes on offer for Euronext ahead of the latter’s initial public offering.Euronext’s parent IntercontinentalExchange is looking to sell a stake of up to 30 per cent in Euronext before a summer listing, with anchor shareholders allowed to buy a maximum 10 per cent holding.ICE is splitting up its parent company NYSE Euronext, keeping the New York Stock Exchange and Liffe, the London derivatives exchange. It has been keen on returning Euronext, which operates the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon exchanges, to a more continental-European shareholder base. Its plans have lead to speculation that Euronext could be bought by a larger regional exchange.Mr Hernani ruled out becoming one of the anchor investors. “BME is not a financial institution. We will never take financial stakes in anything,” he told reporters in London on Monday.“We’re watching with interest and observing,” he said. “When it becomes listed, let’s see what we can do in technology or outsourcing.” He added that the BME saw “a lot of future in sharing resources with other exchanges” and cited as an example its venture with Deutsche Börse to build a trade repository for new derivatives reporting requirements.Mr Hernani’s comments came as BME presented results, released on Friday, to investors. For the year to December 31, revenues rose 3.9 per cent to €307.7m Annual net profit rose 5.7 per cent to €143m, thanks in part to jump in business in the final quarter. For the three months to December 31, net profit rose 25 per cent year-on-year to €38m while revenues rose 22 per cent to €81.8m.Mr Hernani said many high-frequency traders had come back to the Spanish market, in part because a long ban on short selling in some European countries had been lifted. “The short selling ban was very damaging to us,“ he said. He also said people were attracted by narrowing spreads on the market, which had narrowed by five basis points since the summer.However he played down potential impact to BME from a review of the Markets in Financial Instruments, Europe’s flagship markets legislation. Policy makers are proposing to open access to exchange’s derivatives and clearing businesses.“The threat to the vertical silo is very minor thing. For us, derivatives is a small business.” However he said the group was “prepared to face many threats”.
226;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-01-29T23:45:57Z;Gas rise of 10.4% due to cold snap rivals hurricane rally;;This winter’s protracted cold now rivals strong hurricanes in its impact on the US natural gas market.Nymex February gas futures surged 52.4 cents to $5.557 per million British thermal units as they expired, the biggest absolute daily jump since hurricane Ike slammed into the Gulf of Mexico’s drilling rigs and pipelines in September 2008. Wednesday’s move brought benchmark gas to the highest level in four years.The 10.4 per cent rise reveals how new sources of gas demand have begun to offset new supplies from shale formations, at least during cold snaps.A boom in gas production in inland areas like the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania has largely insulated the market from the devastation that hurricanes periodically wreaked on coastal energy infrastructure.But more gas consumers have also appeared. Gas has gained market share from coal as a fuel for power plants. In the US northeast, the historic heart of the heating oil market, households using gas for heat have increased by 630,000 to 11.5m in the past five years, while households using heating oil have decreased by 900,000, according to the Energy Information Administration.Both electricity and gas heating demand rise during a cold snap. The persistently cold winter led to overnight temperatures of -27C in Chicago and -31C in Minneapolis this week.“This is our peak season,” said Teri Viswanath, gas analyst at BNP Paribas. “Combine this with the fact that we have witnessed pretty stellar [demand] growth in other sectors, notably power generation.”Wednesday was the last day of trading in the February futures contract, indicating a clamour for firm supplies at a fixed price next month.Nymex futures are delivered to the Henry hub in relatively warm Louisiana state, but industry executives said traders will use the contracts to lock in prices for sales made elsewhere under “alternative delivery procedures” sanctioned by the exchange.Gas at hubs in New York and Boston has surged above $100 per m Btu this month.Nymex March gas spiked 10.6 per cent, even though the delivery period is more than a month away. Traders and analysts said this reflected fears that prolonged cold will severely deplete underground inventories before spring warmth arrives. “Forecasts continue to call for below normal temperatures,” said Biliana Pehlivanova, an energy analyst at Barclays.A Reuters poll indicated US gas inventories would fall to a six-year low of 1.23tn cubic feet by the end of the heating season. The US government will update weekly storage estimates on Thursday.Ike followed hurricane Gustav in September 2008, shutting in 98 per cent of offshore gas production and knocking out power to gas processing plants and pipelines. Gas rose 63 cents to $7.91 four days after its landfall.The latest price gyrations may have been exacerbated by bets on the difference between the March and April contracts, a popular way for hedge funds to trade around inventory levels, traders said.IntercontinentalExchange, a rival to CME Group’s Nymex, next week plans to offer futures contracts whose value is tied to weekly changes in US stocks, not the price of gas.
227;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-01-27T22:39:21Z;CME and ICE warn on plan to force open European clearing houses;;The heads of the world’s two largest exchange operators by market value have warned against proposals to force open Europe’s clearing houses, arguing policy makers could undermine the stability of global markets.Phupinder Gill, chief executive of CME Group, and Jeff Sprecher, his counterpart at IntercontinentalExchange, hit out at European plans to require all derivatives platforms to connect to their rivals venues’ and process investors’ trades.In their first public comments since Brussels agreed a political deal earlier this month, the two US exchanges said the moves could both stifle innovation and interconnect the world’s clearing houses, which global regulators have made the centrepiece of plans to underpin the financial system post-crisis.Both CME and ICE could potentially be hit by an overhaul to the rules for Europe’s securities and derivatives markets. Policy makers want to open access to derivatives trading and clearing and break the “vertical silo” model that both exchanges operate, in which contracts are traded and cleared at the same exchange.ICE owns London-based Liffe, Europe’s second-largest derivatives exchange, while CME is planning to open its own derivatives exchange from London.The political agreement has yet to be officially confirmed but the regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority, is now assessing how to define “open access”. It may rule that clearing houses have to be interoperable, and allow customers to access their open interest positions in contracts at rival venues. Customers could have a swap open at one clearing house and have the position offset by a swap cleared at another clearing house.However, Mr Sprecher warned that that raised concentration of risk in markets.“What’s amazing is that the regulatory push to bring contracts into listed trading and clearing was very much to unlock the interconnection of the banking system,” he told delegates at a conference in Miami, Florida.He said ICE’s clearing operations had netted down around $50tn worth of credit default swaps to around $2tn.“What I don’t understand is why any regulator would want to now interconnect a bunch of clearing houses and re-link the very risk that they asked us to take on. It makes no sense to me from a risk standpoint. And if you’re going to do that, I don’t know why there should be a clearing mandate imposed on an industry. Because I’m not sure that the industry is going into a less risky environment than it would be if you just did everything bilateral.”Mr Gill said requiring contracts to trade on a multitude of exchanges would discourage investment. Unlike equities listings, “in the industry that we are in you are actually creating products”, he said at the annual conference of the Commodity Markets Council. “There’s IP [intellectual property] that goes into it. Then you’re listing it and someone else goes and trades it. It disincentivises the need to actually innovate.”www.ft.com/tradingroom
228;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-01-17T17:55:33Z;IntercontinentalExchange to take over running Libor benchmark;;IntercontinentalExchange will take over the administration of the scandal-tainted Libor benchmark from February 1 after receiving approval from UK regulators on Friday.The US derivatives exchange has also appointed André Villeneuve, a senior City executive, as chairman of the ICE subsidiary that will collate and monitor the data submitted by banks.The handover of administration to ICE from the British Bankers’ Association will mark the first steps to rehabilitate the benchmark, which has been tarnished after allegations it has been manipulated by banks around the world. More than €2bn has been collected in fines by regulators after a string of financial institutions, including RBS, UBS and Barclays settled charges.ICE has been in line to run the process since its purchase of NYSE Liffe, the London derivatives exchange, in November. NYSE won the contract to replace the BBA last year. It plans to move calculation of the benchmark away from the theoretical price quotes submitted by banks to a fixing based on real transactions.However, ICE said there would be no immediate change to the calculation of Libor. The group is currently moving the technology platform from a NYSE-owned system to one overseen by ICE.Mr Villeneuve was previously non-executive chairman of Liffe and has also been chairman of the City of London’s International Regulatory Strategy Group and Instinet, the agency brokerage, as well as an executive director at Reuters.ICE also appointed Joanna Perkins, chief executive of the Financial Markets Law Committee, as chair of the oversight committee of the subsidiary, which will be called ICE Benchmark Administration.
229;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Commodity exchanges miffed by Mifid;Worries heighten over EU position rules;The name of the legislation is a mouthful and its acronym captures the feeling of many European commodity players towards it. The EU’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, or Mifid (say it fast), could finally be agreed in Strasbourg today, after nearly four years of negotiations.Among other things, the rules will impose fixed position limits in European commodity markets, from agriculture to metals and energy. The aim is to prevent uncontrolled speculation by traders and hedge funds who through outsized derivative transactions may seek to corner the market for their own gain.Under the draft legislation, which is not likely to take effect for at least another two years, national regulators in European countries will be responsible for monitoring and enforcing the position limits for the various commodities. These limits have yet to be set.The spur for greater regulation came during the financial crisis, when some blamed speculative activity for the surge in food and oil prices. Nobody disputes that manipulation of commodity prices is a bad thing, since it can ultimately hit ordinary consumers in the pocket.But some of the main commodity exchanges in Europe believe the EU’s directive is misguided.They argue that imposing limits on the size of derivative positions that any market participant can hold for a particular commodity over a set time could in fact increase volatility, not reduce it. In an echo of the 2009 threats by hedge funds to leave London over proposed EU investment laws, there are now dark mutterings that the proposed new laws may push business – and perhaps even individual bourses – towards less regulated regions, especially Asia, where demand for some commodities, especially base metals, is greatest.The LME and ICE already have their own safeguards against market manipulation, and users say these “position management” techniques already work perfectly well. One prominent LME member points out that the metals business is by its nature dominated by large participants who make big trades, and that curbing this would reduce liquidity, one of the exchange’s main selling points. The laws may also complicate hedging transactions by producers and consumers of metals.“The political motivation for position limits comes from the idea that you have starving children in Africa because of speculators driving up food costs,” the exchange member says. “No one is complaining about the metals market but it is getting swept up in this. It’s collateral damage.”Even so, European legislators are not alone in wanting greater oversight over the broad commodities markets.“The idea of the commodities exchanges dealing with these issues on their own – that ship has sailed some time ago,” said Jonathan Herbst, partner at Norton Rose Fulbright. “The main concern now is more about the size of the limits that will be imposed in Europe.”The Commodities Note is a regular online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
230;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Euronext reshuffles management ahead of IPO;;Euronext, the European exchanges operator, has reorganised its business and management team in preparation for a demerger from parent IntercontinentalExchange later this year. The Paris-headquartered, Amsterdam-listed group promoted Amaury Dauge, its head of corporate planning, to the role of chief finance officer.Euronext, which operates equities bourses and derivatives markets, is likely to float in Paris or Amsterdam later this year, in a key part of ICE’s integration of its $11bn purchase of NYSE Euronext. The US derivatives operator is looking to to sell at least a quarter of Euronext a way to circumvent regulatory requirements that it hold a long-term stake in the European group.It also named Anthony Attia as chief executive of Euronext Paris, a role that will be independent of the holding company for the first time. Mr Attia was formerly senior vice-president and chief of staff to Dominique Cerutti, Euronext group chief executive.Lee Hodgkinson will head up Euronext’s markets and global sales teams in a newly-created division which will combine all the commercial activities of Euronext’s markets businesses. He will also be appointed as chief executive of Euronext London once it is granted a regulated exchange status by UK authorities.Cees Vermaas, Luis Laginha and Vincent van Dessel will remain as chief executives of the Amsterdam, Lisbon and Brussels markets respectively.Rolande Bellegarde, who had been group executive vice-president for European equities and equity derivatives, is to become a senior adviser to Mr Cerutti. The group added that it was currently recruiting for a chief operating officer.
231;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2014-01-06T20:30:15Z;ICE looks to sell part of Euronext ahead of IPO;;IntercontinentalExchange is looking to sell at least a quarter of Euronext, the European stock exchange group, ahead of an initial public offering that is expected this year, according to people familiar with the situation.A sale would allow the US derivatives exchange group a way to circumvent regulatory requirements that it hold a long-term stake in Euronext, which operates the main stock exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Madrid.Bankers are preparing to approach European-based funds and banks in the coming weeks about purchasing a stake in Euronext, two people said. ICE and Euronext declined to comment.Atlanta-based ICE secured regulatory approval for its $11bn purchase of NYSE Euronext, which closed in November, in part by assuring European authorities that it would hold a stake of at least 25 per cent for more than three years after a float of Euronext.ICE will be freed of the obligation if it can find other long-term investors prepared to hold the stake long after the Euronext float, due to take place over the summer.The company became the world’s second-largest exchanges operator by market capitalisation after the NYSE transaction closed and has long earmarked the remaining parts of Euronext for a sale or listing.ICE’s interest in NYSE Euronext was primarily to gain access into the European derivatives markets as it had never owned an equities business.While it is keeping the New York Stock Exchange, ICE plans to float the European operations once it has completed the integration of Liffe, the London-based derivatives exchange, in the first half of this year.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, has held extensive talks with bankers and stakeholders in recent months about Euronext.“We’ve agreed with regulators that the new shareholder base should include stable long-term shareholders that will consider the long-term interest of the new Euronext and its markets and this could also include ICE remaining as a continuing shareholder in a reduced capacity for a period of time,” he told investors in November.Besides the share trading business, Euronext encompasses options, equity indices, single-stock futures and physical commodities such as sugar trading. ICE said Euronext had trailing 12-month revenues of more than $500m with operating margins of 33 per cent to 35 per cent.News of the potential stake sale was first reported by Bloomberg.
232;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-11-30T00:18:19Z;ICE and DTCC set for clearing venture;;IntercontinentalExchange and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the post-trade services provider, are preparing to battle for market share in interest rates derivatives clearing by exploring ways for big dealers to reduce the cost of trading.The two said on Friday they would wind-down their joint venture New York Portfolio Clearing, a US clearing house for Treasury futures. The open positions in futures held at NYPC will instead be switched to ICE’s European clearing house.At the same time the duo announced they were discussing a new cross-margining service that “would offer capital efficiencies across a broader range of global interest-rate products”.NYPC was set up by DTCC and NYSE Euronext three years ago, but its future has been under review since the latter was purchased by ICE earlier this month for $11bn. The venture was once touted as a long-term challenge to CME Group’s dominance of US market in interest rate futures trading but failed to break the Chicago group’s grip.Instead ICE and DTCC are looking to repackage the business in London, as a platform to take advantage of new rules tightening the derivatives market comes into effect.Regulators want more off-exchange trades backed by collateral, and where possible, processed through clearing houses, to safeguard the financial system.The move is expected to raise global demands for high-quality margin that investors must post for their trades. However clearing houses are looking to ease the burden by netting their positions on different assets within the clearing house. NYPC estimates it has saved its members about $40bn in margin associated with fixed income and futures portfolios since it launched in March 2011.NYPC’s positions have been switched to ICE’s European clearing house as ICE also clears interest rate futures conducted on Liffe, the London derivatives exchange ICE bought as part of the NYSE Euronext deal. The UK exchange’s euribor futures benchmark is one of the world’s most popular listed contracts.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, wants to combine Liffe’s interest rate business with ICE’s dominant position clearing of credit default swaps and begin clearing interest rate swaps, potentially offering investors even more savings.ICE has agreed to move trading and clearing of futures for DTCC’s GCF Repo Index benchmark to London. The GCF repo contract is becoming popular with traders in overnight markets for hedging short-term interest rates.Lynn Martin, chief of NYSE Liffe US will serve as the chief executive of NYPC through the transition and wind down period, which expected to be completed in the third quarter of next year, subject to regulatory approval.More than 287,000 eurodollar contracts and 63,000 US Treasury GCF Repo Index futures contracts are currently open at NYPC.Separately, on Thursday ICE and its US rival CME Group also received approval from European regulators to operate a trade repository in preparation for tougher new rules governing derivatives trade reporting. DTCC was also granted a licence for a repository earlier this month.
233;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-11-21T16:16:40Z;Effect of reforms yet to be seen;Trend to more electronic trading and tough new global regulation;Driven by the long-term trend to more electronic trading and tough new global regulation, the world of fixed income trading is going through a quiet but profound overhaul.Trading floors, with people in colourful jackets frantically shouting and signalling to each other have become a relic of the last century as markets have gone global and investors use computers.But that trend has been accelerated by the financial crisis. In its aftermath, global regulators pinpointed the market structure of world’s derivatives markets as exacerbating the fallout.The G20 pressed for more of the vast but opaque over-the-counter market, historically traded bilaterally on the telephone between banks, be pushed on to transparent trading venues and processed through clearing houses. A clearing house stands between two parties in a deal, ensuring the deal is completed.Pushing it through central market infrastructure is intended to create a digital audit trail and force more trades to be backed by margin, or insurance for trading.These sweeping reform encompasses fixed income trading more than any other, from the underlying security to their derivatives such as interest rate and credit derivatives swaps.Interest rate swaps, for example, are used to hedging against and speculating on changes in global interest rates.The new swap trading era pits a host of players in open competition against each other, from the well-established interdealer brokers such as ICAP, to big platforms run by Bloomberg, Tradeweb and MarketAxess, to a number of new entrants such as State Street and Javelin.Other regulations are also having an effect. Banks and broker-dealers are also under regulatory pressure to hold more capital are keen to trade more of their major fixed income instruments – such as US, European and UK government bonds – electronically in an effort to cut costs.This has created a problem for banks as they have historically played a central market-maker role as they were able to hold large inventories. Broker-dealers continue to reduce the bonds they hold, thus shrinking the supply of corporate debt on offer in the market and constraining liquidity in the market. The new trading platforms, such as TradeWeb and MarketAxess, are also eyeing this market.But these momentous changes may yet have unintended consequences. They have been taking place while global interest rates have persistently been held at historic lows. That has dramatically damped investors appetite for risk and trading volumes. While there have been some signals that the US will taper its bond purchases, only when central banks make a firmer commitment will the industry see the full effect of its reforms, and volatility increases.That has led to fears of a shortfall of collateral to lubricate trading on financial markets, particularly in a world with less top-rated sovereign bonds to offer.Estimates have varied dramatically. The Basel Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) suggested the reforms, combined with new banking rules such as Basel III, could require the financial system to find an extra $4tn. That amounted to more that a third of the high quality collateral in active circulation.However the CGFS has argued that it is small relative to the global supply of assets capable of meeting the demand, with the stock of non-cash collateral eligible for derivatives standing at some $50tn.But the collateral comes with attendant risks. A rise in the value of collateral allows financial institutions to borrow and in turn push up the value of assets up further, known as “procyclicality”.“The reverse is also true. This inherent procyclicality exposes the system to sharp corrections in collateral values,” said Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England and chairman of the Financial Stability Board, in a recent speech. “In extremis, a sell-off in financial markets leads to higher haircuts, a run on repo and ultimately a market freeze.”Indeed, part of the regulatory push to focus on clearing houses is aimed at reducing this procyclicality, because these risk managers usually only accept the highest quality collateral available – mainly cash or US Treasuries as collateral for margin – as need to liquidate positions in extreme markets at short notice.But the fear of a collateral shortage means the industry is examining new ways to both meet regulatory requirements and free up collateral.Clearing house operators such as CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and LCH.Clearnet are offering investors the chance to offset the margin they put up for clearing listed derivatives against the margin they post to clear OTC products.“As trading volumes increase and with a potential collateral shortfall looming, participants are looking to markets such as NLX to provide access to clearing where portfolio margining with correlated interest rate derivatives creates margin efficiencies and reduces collateral requirements,” said Charlotte Crosswell, chief executive of Nasdaq NLX, a new European interest rate derivatives venue.If the Federal Reserve does signal rates will rise next year, these theories will be set for their first test.
234;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-11-12T21:08:07Z;ICE seals $10bn takeover with plan to float Euronext;Sprecher quashes idea of European exchange sale;IntercontinentalExchange has given the first indication of its plans for NYSE Euronext as it sealed its $10bn takeover by confirming it would float Euronext, owner of the Paris and Amsterdam stock exchanges.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, signalled the move as he prepared to formally take over NYSE Euronext on Wednesday.The deal will make the 14-year old ICE group the third-largest exchange operator in the world by market value and put it in control of the New York exchange, as well as the bourses of Paris, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Brussels.Dismissing speculation that Euronext could be sold, Mr Sprecher told the Financial Times: “We have been working on a separate European continental exchange . . . and we will take the company public. We’ve been solely working on that.”Mr Sprecher mooted floating the equities businesses of Euronext when he announced the deal last December. In the interim period the group has shied away from making many public comments on its plans while the deal was examined by regulators.The uncertainty encouraged persistent speculation that Euronext could be up for sale. A number of exchanges including Nasdaq OMX and SIX Group, the owner of the Swiss exchange, had expressed an interest.ICE’s plans received a broadly positive endorsement in Paris, where a report commissioned by the Socialist government on Tuesday concluded that the projected flotation “constitutes an opportunity for Euronext to develop services in the places where it operates and to play a key role in the desired organisation of the market and post-market infrastructures in Europe and the eurozone in particular”.The report by Thierry Francq, an adviser to the French Treasury, highlighted concern in France that the role of Paris as a financial centre should not be further diminished. It said maintaining a strong bourse in the capital was an essential condition for sustaining France’s influence over international financial regulation.But it stressed the need for a newly independent Euronext to have a strong, decentralised governing structure, rather than recommending, for example, that it be centred on Paris.It said ICE must put in place a core group of shareholders with at least a 25 per cent shareholding and representative of the interests of France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal, to ensure Euronext’s stability.Pierre Moscovici, French finance minister later issued a statement endorsing Mr Francq’s report and saying he approved ICE’s takeover of NYSE Euronext.Ownership of the New York exchange will mark new territory for Mr Sprecher and ICE, whose fortunes have been built on trading energy and commodity derivatives, such as oil and grain.ICE has been a critic of the US equity market structure, in which trading has been fragmented across tens of venues and technical glitches have become commonplace.Mr Sprecher said: “It’s definitely a learning curve for us . . . but we run regulated businesses so we understand that. Our goal is to make a positive contribution right away. The stock exchanges was a large part of the NYSE business. We have more flexibility to try new things and fail.”
235;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-11-12T12:09:05Z;NYSE Euronext takeover poses tough challenges for ICE boss;;Jeff Sprecher has built an enviable reputation by turning IntercontinentalExchange into the leading home for energy derivatives trading in just 14 years.But as the ICE chief executive takes control of NYSE Euronext on Wednesday, he steps into unfamiliar territory as the new owner of the world’s most high-profile stock exchange.His target in the $10bn acquisition was Liffe, NYSE’s London-based derivatives exchange, a leader in trading interest rate derivatives. But to justify that price tag to ICE shareholders accustomed to growth, the Atlanta-based group must unlock value from NYSE’s range of underperforming assets, including leading equity businesses in the US and Europe.That challenge is one much greater in terms of staff, scale and geography than anything Mr Sprecher has undertaken before. “This [NYSE] is a big conglomerate of stuff that has never been integrated and now Jeff gets to do one giant integration,” says one industry insider.Investors are betting that Mr Sprecher’s tenure will bring better times. More than 80 per cent of NYSE shareholders have opted to take ICE stock rather than the cash offered as part of the deal.With the addition of Liffe’s strong European interest rates business, Mr Sprecher will aim to turn ICE from a predominantly energy derivatives exchange to one better positioned to compete in new asset classes against CME Group and Deutsche Börse.As new regulations around derivatives take shape and with volatility expected to return when interest rates rise, the three exchanges have jockeyed for position around the world.The CME, which operates the world’s largest futures exchange, overwhelmingly dominates the US market in interest rate derivatives. Taking control of Liffe gives ICE a footing in Europe, where it will compete against Deutsche Börse and where CME’s plans to enter have been stalled.“Neither [CME nor ICE] has been able to steal each other’s contracts . . . it’s about new contracts and new territories,” says Karl Fruecht, managing partner at the Nomy Group, a consultancy. “As you’re looking for growth, you have to be buying new contracts – and that is what ICE has just done: they just bought Europe.”But while fighting that battle, Mr Sprecher must also divine NYSE’s future in US equities. While Twitter’s listing last week threw the spotlight on the famous exchange’s listing business, it has spent the past decade fighting a decline in market share.NYSE once had a near monopoly of equities trading, but now holds a slim lead in market share over US rivals largely by offering payments to encourage brokers to trade on its exchange. Mr Sprecher, however, has repeatedly expressed his disgust with the practice, which is a feature of most stock trading venues.Jeff Sprecher has long sought an interest rate derivatives business. His first shot at one came in 2007 with an unsuccessful attempt to halt the Chicago Board of Trade’s sale to CME. The ICE head then tried to purchase Liffe in 2011 by combining with Nasdaq OMX in a failed attempt to break up the merger of NYSE and Deutsche Börse, which was later blocked by regulators . . .Continue reading“I think the secondary market that takes advantage of people that have to trade or have poorer information is not particularly warranted or helpful or sustainable,” he said recently on an analyst call. “I think the market model is going to change, I think people in the business want it to change and hopefully by being transparent about it, we will be a positive force in causing it to change.”How Mr Sprecher will lead such a major change while re-establishing NYSE’s dominance in the market remains to be seen, especially considering many say the US equity market has little in common with the futures business. Rich Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill says: “It’s a very tough, highly competitive environment. It’s not going to be easy to change.”Mr Sprecher is also preparing to dispose of Euronext, the operator of stock exchanges in Paris, Lisbon, Amsterdam and Brussels. By spinning off Euronext through a sale or initial public offering, ICE will be freed of the transatlantic corporate governance issues that slowed decision making at NYSE.Lastly, ICE must decide what to do with the technology unit that NYSE has ploughed hundreds of millions of dollars into without much result. According to people familiar with its thinking, ICE is planning to move the market data business back into the exchange and look to dispose of the remaining assets, including data centres in Mahwah, New Jersey, and possibly Basildon, UK.The technology unit’s top executives are expected to depart when the NYSE-ICE deal closes. According to former insiders, the struggles of its technology business stemmed from NYSE’s halfhearted embrace of the changes taking place in the industry. NYSE declined to comment.“The biggest mistake an equity exchange [can make] is to try and not . . . be an equity exchange,” says one banker. Now how NYSE defines itself will be in the hands of Mr Sprecher.
236;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-11-12T12:04:04Z;ICE boss has eye on interest rate swaps;;Jeff Sprecher has long sought an interest rate derivatives business.His first shot at one came in 2007 with an unsuccessful attempt to halt the Chicago Board of Trade’s sale to CME. The ICE head then tried to purchase Liffe in 2011 by combining with Nasdaq OMX in a failed attempt to break up the merger of NYSE and Deutsche Börse, which was later blocked by regulators.In addition to interest rates trading, both ICE and CME are looking to exploit new rules around clearing of over-the-counter interest rate swaps. New regulations mean more of the OTC derivatives market will move on to electronic trading venues and trade through clearing houses.The CME has long been seen as a winner under the reforms as it is able to offer customers offsets on the margin investors post for both listed and OTC business.On a call with analysts last week, Mr Sprecher said that the combination of Liffe’s interest rate business, its new role as administrator of the Libor interbank rate, and ICE’s dominant position in the clearing of credit default swaps would “give us a platform to go after more unique businesses in the rate space” including the clearing of OTC interest rate swaps.While he would not go so far as to say the company could take market share from CME, he said “the pie for people in this business will be getting bigger”.NYSE switched clearing on NYSE Liffe to ICE Clear Europe ahead of the merger, which has so far generated a “relatively modest amount” of revenue, Scott Hill, chief financial officer, said on the call.But Mr Sprecher said “it was in ICE’s best interest to offer Liffe a very attractive clearing deal” to convince NYSE not to build its own clearing house, and this would benefit the combined company.Anything that strengthens ICE is likely to affect CME, says Matt Simon, analyst at the Tabb Group.“This tie up . . . will push the CME to be a little more aggressive in terms of trying to find out where they can capitalise,” said Mr Simon. “They’re going to be paying a lot of attention to what they’re doing at ICE-NYSE to stay on top of their game.”
237;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;NYSE Liffe tackles coffee and cocoa queues;Queues to take beans from warehouses mean extra costs for traders;Coffee roasters and chocolate makers could benefit from lower raw materials costs as the exchange that oversees the warehousing of official stocks attempts to tackle delivery queues for coffee and cocoa.The queues to remove coffee and cocoa beans from NYSE Liffe warehouses have led to extra costs for traders and end users, leading to calls for tighter regulation.The London-based exchange this week announced a consultation on warehouse delivery practices and charges, seeking detailed information from its users.The move comes as IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) prepares to take over NYSE Euronext. ICE has indicated that warehousing practices on soft commodities deliveries would be one of the priorities among the issues to be reviewed once the deal is completed.Long waiting times at official commodity exchange warehouses have been a problem over the past few years, and have been especially acute in the metals industry. Long queues at aluminium and copper warehouses have triggered complaints from metal users and the London Metal Exchange is considering proposals to cut waiting times, which can be as long as a year.Waiting times for robusta coffee deliveries at NYSE Liffe warehouses have been especially long in Antwerp, according to traders, causing concern among end users. As waiting times peaked in 2011-12, those seeking coffee bean deliveries had to wait as long as four months, adding to storage fees.Traders said large chocolate and coffee groups had held meetings with the exchange to air their worries.Part of the problem was that there had been no rules for minimum delivery rates, said market experts.Last year, the Belgian competition authorities ordered Antwerp-based warehouse keeper Port Real Estate, handling coffee beans certified by NYSE Liffe, to make a minimum rate of deliveries after Armajaro Trading, the soft commodities trader, lodged a complaint that the warehouse group was moving out the commodity at an unreasonably slow pace.NYSE Liffe later came out with its own minimum delivery rate rules at the end of last year, stipulating that warehouses holding less than 30,000 tonnes of coffee certified by the exchange should deliver a minimum of 250 tonnes per day, and requiring those holding more than that level to move out a minimum of 500 tonnes per day.Coffee traders said the waiting times had come down to about 6 to 8 weeks but said the exchange’s consultation was a welcome move. “[The queues] are not as egregious as a year ago but there still needs to be improvement,” said one coffee market specialist.In cocoa, the minimum delivery rate rules are scheduled to be implemented in December this year. As with coffee, warehouses holding less than 30,000 tonnes of certified cocoa must load out a minimum of 250 tonnes per day, while those holding more than 30,000 tonnes need to move out a minimum of 500 tonnes per day.
238;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-10-25T19:00:59Z;Top pair set to quit NYSE Euronext tech unit;;The top two executives at NYSE Euronext’s underperforming technology business are set to leave when the $10bn takeover by IntercontinentalExchange is completed in coming weeks, according to four people familiar with the situation.Jon Robson and Terry Roche, two Thomson Reuters executives brought in to turn round the struggling division just over a year ago, are set to leave when the deal is completed. ICE and NYSE have set a completion date of November 4, although it is subject to obtaining final regulatory approvals in Europe. Peter Moylan, head of global sales, is also expected to depart, according to sources.NYSE said all three men were still employed by NYSE but declined to comment further. ICE declined to comment.ICE plans to spin NYSE Technologies’ market data unit, the main generator of revenues for the subsidiary, back to the exchange, the people familiar with the situation said. It is also seeking to find buyers for the subsidiary’s remaining assets, which include a technology distribution business and a 25 per cent stake in Fixnetix, a UK trading technology company, for which it paid £17.5m in 2012.The departures at NYSE Technologies will further cloud the future of a business that NYSE had once touted as a key part of its growth strategy.The US exchange has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years developing the business, including building large data centres near New York and London to create digital trading hubs. It was intended to create a “virtuous circle” attracting other telecoms and technology groups to the site.However, it was hit by an industry slowdown in spending on trading technology, while users have sometimes complained of the high cost of renting server space and neither site is full.A year ago Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, admitted the technology business would not hit its long-term target of $1bn in annual turnover. In the past NYSE has looked to sell its data centres to Equinix, but the parties could not agree on price.One person close to the situation said Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, ascribed only a small valuation to NYSE Technologies when preparing his bid a year ago. Mr Sprecher is also preparing to spin off Euronext, the European exchanges business, next year, and has said that an initial public offering is the most likely option.The takeover requires formal approval from regulators in five European countries. Euronext’s governing college of regulators and European and US antitrust officials have already approved the deal.
239;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-10-17T10:25:54Z;Twitter move highlights high-stakes game between Nasdaq and NYSE;;For NYSE Euronext, Twitter’s decision this week to list its shares on its New York Stock Exchange could not have come at a better time.Apart from boasting rights, the $1bn Twitter initial public offering enhances NYSE’s technology franchise and comes as 83 companies have raised $32bn on the exchange this year, close to triple the amount raised by the 87 companies on Nasdaq.Landing Twitter came after a hard-fought battle between the exchanges, with analysts highlighting its ability to strengthen NYSE’s reputation.The exchange operator’s $10bn acquisition by IntercontinentalExchange is set to close early next month and scoring the social media company’s IPO bolsters its claim to running a differentiated listings business from its rival Nasdaq.While the future of NYSE’s European business is uncertain, the US equities business and its historic Manhattan location is very much part of ICE’s plans.But while the exchange benefits from membership, trading and listing fees, the contribution of a single company makes little difference to its annual revenues or its competition with its rival. Instead, landing a high-profile name to list on an exchange in the US is mainly a matter of prestige.Nevertheless, companies are offered a clear choice when presented with the two main US exchanges. Listing fees are typically lower on Nasdaq, reflecting its history as the choice for younger companies with less available funds. NYSE fees have historically been higher, in part as it has attracted more of the heavyweights of industrial and corporate America.From a branding perspective, NYSE offers executives a chance to ring the symbolic bell from the floor of an exchange, a factor that may sway some. However, Nasdaq can offer issuers advertising in the heart of Times Square, a prime spot to reach a large audience in New York.Nasdaq is stronger on services to issuers such as providing corporate communication tools and analysis on how a company’s stock and its peers are trading, according to Patrick Healy, chief executive of Issuer Advisory Group.A key difference is the way an IPO auction is run, a feature of the listings business that came under scrutiny when the start of trading in Facebook shares was mired by problems with Nasdaq’s systems.A NYSE IPO auction has a human element as floor traders work with bankers to determine the opening price for shares, while Nasdaq relies more on computers to launch a new listing. Nasdaq recently added an “auction officer” to liaise with underwriters.“I think it’s one of the most important things to a company,” says a senior equity capital markets banker, who declined to be named because he works with both exchanges. “If you actually talk to traders they would tell you they would rather open with the NYSE all day long. But plenty of companies are picking Nasdaq because they don’t need that level of control.”NYSE has been increasingly successful in attracting technology companies in recent years, a territory once considered undisputedly Nasdaq’s. In 2006, NYSE had less than 10 per cent of all technology IPOs but has grown its market share almost fivefold in recent years. So far this year, 16 technology or internet related companies have listed on each exchange, according to data from Dealogic.Companies such as LinkedIn, Yelp, and Pandora have chosen NYSE and the shift in emphasis was underlined over the summer when Oracle, the software company, switched from Nasdaq to NYSE.Nasdaq still remains highly-desirable, winning some of the largest Web 2.0 companies including Facebook and Zynga. It has also managed to attract large-cap companies from NYSE such as Viacom, the media company, and Marriott, the hotel group.Overall, 87 companies have raised $12.3bn in Nasdaq listing versus 83 companies raising $32bn on NYSE.As NYSE looks to build off its recent win, Mr Healy of Issuer Advisory wonders whether the $450m in synergies ICE has said it could achieve from the merger will affect its listings business. He asks: “How deep is [ICE’s planned] cost cut going to be and is it going to affect spending on the issuer community?”
240;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-09-16T21:00:40Z;Europe: Thwarted merger raises question of transatlantic power balance;Will a combination of new derivatives rules and EU competition policy usher in a US takeover of European market infrastructure?;To mention European competition policy to a senior Deutsche Börse executive is to touch on a sensitive subject. Last year Brussels squashed the plans by Europe’s exchanges operator to merge with rival NYSE Euronext.The merger would have created a transatlantic global powerhouse well positioned to exploit the opportunities being created by the sweeping legislation that will force more privately traded OTC derivatives on to electronic trading venues.Deutsche Börse argues that the consequences go far beyond its own interest. “It is the result of European regulators making sure that consolidation in our global derivatives industry, for the foreseeable future, will be very successfully led by exchanges with US origin,” Andreas Preuss, chief executive of its derivatives exchange Eurex, told a conference in London over the summer.Nearly 18 months on from the landmark ruling, the landscape in the old continent appears to be shifting dramatically. Overseas companies have been aggressively pursuing European and global expansion plans, using London as the hub.In that short time, CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, has expanded by opening a futures exchange and a clearing house in Europe. BNY Mellon, a US custodian bank, won approval for a European central securities depository.Overshadowing it all, the US’s IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) then swooped on NYSE Euronext last December in a deal worth around $10bn. Assuming the deal goes ahead, it will give Jeff Sprecher, ICE’s chief executive, the London Liffe derivatives market that he has long sought and ownership of the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. It has made ICE’s clearing house one of the largest in Europe. Deutsche Börse, which had eyed a mega-merger with NYSE Euronext for four years, found itself rebuffing polite inquiries from the CME about a deal.So will a combination of new derivatives rules and EU competition policy usher in a US takeover of European market infrastructure? “If you look at history, US dominance is far from proven,” argues Florence Fontan, head of asset managers at BNP Paribas Securities Services. “It doesn’t mean they can’t be successful.She adds that attempts to “take the US model and plug it into Europe” have “been failing” for “underestimating the level of complexity” on the continent. “Europe is used to adapting to differing frameworks,” she says.Significant variances between the US and Europe include regulations governing the way clearing houses must segregate their customers assets and the way they collect initial margin or insurance for trading.Newcomers face a serious problem in wresting business away from local incumbents, particularly in derivatives trading. Clearing of OTC interest rate swaps is dominated by LCH.Clearnet and, while the CME clearing operations are in their infancy, they have yet to make a significant inroad into the local market.Ms Fontan points to the example of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which tried to crack European equities clearing, as regulation demanded competition in equities trading.The US post-trade service provider is in the process of selling down part of its stake in its main vehicle, EuroCCP, which is merging with the European Multilateral Trading Facility to cut costs.European companies have been as ambitious as their US counterparts. LCH.Clearnet, its future secure after the London Stock Exchange Group bought a controlling interest, is taking its game to the US. It has cleared $50tn in client business since the first stage of the US clearing mandate began in March. Euroclear, the post-trade services provider, agreed a deal with DTCC on collateral.European pride may get a boost next year when Euronext’s future is resolved. ICE’s Mr Sprecher has signalled his intention to float the business, although rumours persist that it will be sold. Several exchanges, including Deutsche Börse, the London Stock Exchange and SIX Group have been linked with a bid.Complicating the outlook is the uncertain regulatory framework in which business decisions are being made. Details need to be finalised for key Europe regulations, known as the Mifid Review and Emir. Policymakers will spend the next few months debating opening access to derivatives exchanges’ “vertical silo” model, with which contracts that are traded at a venue are processed through the exchange’s clearing house.To do that, policy makers would have to insist that derivatives products owned by exchanges be made fungible, or interchangeable with rival products. That could potentially open CME, ICE and Deutsche Börse to competition in listed derivatives – and could allow others to follow the path opened this year by The Order Machine, the Dutch start-up that has taken a quarter of market share of options trading from NYSE Euronext in Amsterdam.CME, ICE and Deutsche Börse argue that their model is better suited to maintaining financial stability and is what customers want. “The question is how does Europe grow?” said Mark Hemsley, chief executive of US-owned BATS Chi-X Europe, the region’s largest share trading venue. “Should the approach be that of the US equity options market, which has created a vibrant market for customers by releasing exchange competition but providing fungible products? This is not where exchanges want to go but it may mean that in the longer run innovation will continue to be restricted in Europe.”
241;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-09-16T21:00:40Z;US: Rivals vie for custom in changing world of swaps;Reforms open up an industry dominated by big banks;The financial reforms triggered by the financial crisis are starting to make their presence felt in the $300tn privately negotiated US derivatives market.With the counterparty risk of swap transactions now being assumed by centralised clearing houses, the focus of the industry is on how the trading of swaps will develop.A number of firms are formalising new transaction venues known as swap execution facilities, and these “Sefs” will compete with established futures exchanges to enable trading between banks and institutional investors. The development is seen as opening up an industry long dominated by big global derivative banks to greater competition, resulting in lower trading costs for investors.The new swap trading era pits a host of players in open competition against each other, from the well-established interdealer brokers such as ICAP, to big platforms run by Bloomberg, Tradeweb and MarketAxess, to a number of new entrants such as State Street and Javelin.The leading derivative exchanges, namely CME Group and the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), and other vendors are seeking to entice users of over-the-counter (OTC) swaps towards futures contracts that are cheaper to clear centrally.As Wall Street has lobbied hard to water down financial reform, an undercurrent among players in the established swaps industry has been the fear that exchanges such as CME and ICE would emerge as the big winners from a wholesale evolution of OTC swaps from a telephone-based market to computers.“Either OTC swaps or swap futures could be the winner,” says Charley Cooper, head of exchange-traded derivatives at State Street Global Exchange, which has filed a Sef application, and also provides technology support for the Eris Exchange and its swap futures contract.“In our discussions with clients we heard a preference for OTC swaps and swap futures, so we are offering them both, so we can capitalise on the way it plays out,” says Mr Cooper.Goldman Sachs and other dealers are supporting the CME’s swap futures contract – which is also based on a Goldman patent – while the Eris swap contract has the support of Morgan Stanley.According to Richard Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill Partners, leading executives at the CME believe it is not yet clear how far the OTC market will shift towards futures, while the presence of dealers remains important.“The CME believes the dealers will continue to play a significant role in the trading and clearing of IRS [interest rate swaps], at least in the near term,” says Mr Repetto. “On a five-year forward view, CME believes it is still unclear how much of the OTC will stay cleared and remain OTC or convert to a futures-like product.”Chris Edmonds, president of ICE Clear Credit says their credit index futures contract, launched in May, was developed in response to demand from investors who may not generally participate in the OTC market. “This is a credit product that appeals to non-traditional players, looking to hedge macro credit risk.”Mr Edmonds says ICE is looking at launching a full suite of credit-related products that would complement existing OTC products in the future.As the world between dealers and investors converges, all prospective swap trading platforms will need to connect with a wide range of participants. For interdealer brokers, this means moving beyond talking to a limited number of banks. Existing platforms such as Bloomberg, TradeWeb and MarketAxess that already link banks with institutional investors are expected to hit the ground running once Sefs are fully operational.Many of the new trading venues will not only offer streaming prices that enable users to buy or sell a swap on a screen with the click of a computer mouse, they are also going to provide a request for quote (RFQ) service, whereby an investor can seek a price from a limited number of banks or other market makers.“The winners will be those platforms that listen to their customers and give them a choice of ways to transact,” says James Cawley, chief executive officer at Javelin Capital Markets, which has filed to become a Sef. “In a commoditised market place, it is the relationship that wins.”The use of RFQ is seen as helping banks to preserve their market share, but if more investors gravitate towards an anonymous electronic trading book, it is seen as shifting the market to an exchange model.Chris Ferreri, a managing director at ICAP North America says while it is too soon to tell whether the OTC market will move towards a futures-type model, the cost of trading is a key factor for users of derivatives. “If the cost to clear and margin a future is less than a swap, then it’s more of a challenge for clients to transact swaps and not futures,” he says.
242;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-09-11T14:58:28Z;CME outspends rivals on Washington lobbying;;CME Group has outspent its closest rivals on lobbying policy makers so far this year and has appeared more times before the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the past six years, federal lobbying records show.The commitment to Washington by CME and the ultimate influence it brings reflects the powerful position the Chicago-based exchange operator has carved out for itself in the hallways of power. Few rivals have matched its influence.The world’s largest futures exchange by volume has spent a total $1.6m in lobbying the first six months of this year, registering six times before the CFTC.The IntercontinentalExchange, its closest rival, has paid $637,688 over the same period and registered twice before its regulator, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington non-profit making organisation that tracks political donations and lobbying. Federal lobbying records require companies to disclose which agency they’re lobbying every quarter.Bloomberg, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, and the Managed Funds Association, a hedge fund lobbying group, also registered before the CFTC six times. However, over the past six years CME has registered visits to its regulator significantly more: 16 times in 2011 compared with four registrations apiece by ICE, NYSE Euronext, and Nasdaq OMX.But if anything the public data underrepresents the influence in Washington of CME, whose strident executive chairman Terry Duffy flies to the capital twice a month for meetings, many of which do not have to be recorded, including those with lawmakers.“I spend quite a bit of time out there. Washington plays a pivotal role not only in the US, but throughout the world, so I try to make sure I’m part of the process as much as possible,” he told the Financial Times.One congressional aide recalled the time Mr Duffy killed an attempt to increase the tax rate on derivatives put forward by Carl Levin, the Democratic senator.The clearing house boss called the proposal “stupid”, the aide said, and ensured that not a single member of Congress co-sponsored the bill. Mr Duffy, who is renowned for his mastery of expletives, said he remembered only a “spirited, not a heated conversation”.Ties with Washington extend beyond Mr Duffy. Jill Sommers, a CFTC commissioner until she stepped down in July, was a former lobbyist for CME.The Chicago-based group ultimately won the support of the CFTC on cross-border rules that threatened to make it more expensive for companies to trade on CME’s exchange.But CME has also faced heightened scrutiny from the CFTC under Gary Gensler, the agency’s chairman. The CFTC filed its first enforcement action against a CME unit for allegedly not supervising a broker who gave proprietary information about clients to a rival broker. CME is fighting the allegations.“They’re probably the smartest folks at this business for the longest period,” said one senior regulatory official. “But they’re cocky about it and they do mess up.”
243;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-08-19T11:13:33Z;CME and ICE mull joining new European repositories body;;CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange, the US derivatives groups, are among the market participants considering taking part in a new trade body being set up to resolve issues around repositories, the new derivatives data warehouses mandated by global regulation.The effort to create the Trade Repository Association is being led by the Trade Repository Group, a UK start-up that is preparing to register with European authorities as a derivatives data warehouse in coming weeks.The London-based group is also putting the final touches to its application with the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) to operate a trade repository, which are intended to give regulators an overview of the market, allowing them to spot potential risks to the financial system.Rory St John Webster, director of Trade Repository Group, said there had also been interest from fund managers and a large investment bank ahead of the first meeting of the association, which is due to take place on September 19. It will be “a European initiative but the intention is global,” said Mr Webster.Trade Repository Group was formed by CapitalTrack, an investment vehicle largely backed by Mr Webster and Fincore, a UK company that operates the European Central Bank database and the eurozone network of central banks running data to the ECB.It is touting its independence and online service as a critical factor for both its operations and administering the trade body. Unlike the six other groups that have agreed to build a trade repository in Europe, it does not have clearing operations.Its emergence comes as European regulators become concerned their view of trading on the derivatives markets may be hampered by the complexity of the rules.Policy makers have mandated that both sides of the trade – buyer and seller – be reported. However, the seller may report to one repository and the buyer to another. “One leg of the trade could be reported in Europe – the other leg reported to a repository that might be in Russia or Singapore. Somewhere the industry has to reconcile the two,” said Mr Webster.The first meeting of the association is due to take place only a few days before Esma is expected to name its first accredited trade repositories.US trio CME Group, ICE, Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the London Stock Exchange, the Central Securities Depository of Poland and Regist-TR, a venture between Deutsche Börse’s Clearstream and Spain’s Iberclear, have also made applications to operate the warehouses.Mr Webster said Trade Repository, which will be capitalised at around £1.8m, also planned to file applications with regulators in the US, Hong Kong and Singapore. “We shall be applying for authorisation with every regulator ‘governing this space’ around the world,” said Mr Webster.
244;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-08-06T12:46:12Z;ICE income rises ahead of expected NYSE merger;;IntercontinentalExchange, the US derivatives exchange, reported a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter net income on the back of increased trading volumes, just weeks before it is set to complete its takeover of NYSE Euronext.The Atlanta-based company on Tuesday revealed earnings of $153m, or $2.09 per diluted share, compared with $143m during the same period last year. Sales rose 6 per cent year-on-year in the quarter to $372m.Analysts had expected earnings of $2.15 a share, but excluding special items, such as costs related to the merger, ICE posted earnings of $2.19 a share.The results come as the company is set to complete its $10.2bn acquisition of NYSE Euronext. Unlike a previous attempted NYSE merger with Deutsche Börse, which failed to receive regulatory support due to antitrust concerns, the ICE deal is widely expected to pass.On a conference call with analysts, Jeff Sprecher, chief executive, said that since receiving antitrust approvals earlier this summer, ICE has “become more intimately involved in exchanging information with NYSE Euronext”.The two companies have been discussing how to organise a global equity index business, Mr Sprecher said. “We do think that together a meaningful group of equity indices on a common platform are likely to drive growth,” he said.The deal is expected to create one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges by contracts traded. Analysts expect it to better position ICE to take on its much larger rival, CME Group, as more of the vast $650tn over-the-counter derivatives market is processed through central clearing.ICE dominates the market for clearing credit default swaps, and said that it had cleared more than $1.3tn in credit derivatives since the first phase of mandatory clearing came into force in the US in March.On Monday, ICE said that Citi, Morgan Stanley, Société Générale and UBS would support CDS trading on its ICE Swap Trade platform, which will trade derivatives linked to European and North American countries and companies. ICE said the platform will be registered as a Swap Execution Facility and is expected to launch in the third quarter.Ahead of the merger, NYSE switched clearing on NYSE Liffe to ICE Clear Europe. It was also appointed the new administrator of the Libor interbank rate, the scandal-plagued reference point for more than $350tn in contracts worldwide, and charged with restoring confidence in the important financial benchmark.ICE’s revenues from transaction and clearing fees rose 4 per cent during the quarter to $319m compared with the same period last year, while ICE reported $8.3m in charges related to the NYSE deal and other transactions.Average daily contract volume in the three months to June rose 3 per cent to 3.54m compared with the same period last year.Mr Sprecher said on the conference call that trading activity won’t be affected by the collective shrinkage of Wall Street banks’ commodity businesses amid increased regulatory scrutiny.Shares in ICE, which have risen nearly 50 per cent from the start of the year, and were up just under 1 per cent to $187.25 in afternoon trading in New York.Shares in NYSE have risen 35.4 per cent since the start of the year, boosting the value of its cash-and-stock takeover, which was initially valued at $8.2bn.
245;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-07-30T12:46:46Z;Derivatives trading lifts NYSE Euronext;;NYSE Euronext said increased derivatives trading in Europe and aggressive cost-cutting helped lift second-quarter profits, in what was probably its last results before being acquired by IntercontinentalExchange.The exchange operator said net income rose 38 per cent to $173m on earnings of 71 cents a share, which climbed 12 cents compared with a year ago. Net revenues rose 1.5 per cent to $611m.The results came just weeks before the company is set to be acquired for $10.2bn by the upstart derivatives and commodities trading exchange, ICE. “We continue to execute solidly against our business plan as we build momentum toward closing the ICE deal,” said Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE.Sales from derivatives trading increased 7 per cent from a year ago to $195m in the quarter, but decreased slightly from the quarter before. In US equities trading, where it has the largest market share of any exchange, the company said daily trades slipped 11 per cent to 1.6bn, but ticked up marginally from the year’s first quarter.Operating expenses, excluding those costs tied to the merger, fell by 4 per cent to $382m. The company also said it was ahead of schedule on efforts to reduce expenses by $250m by the end of 2014.Howard Chen, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said: “The ICE merger appears on track and we see further signs of encouragement for standalone NYSE results. We see multiple channels of value creation and significant cash generation derived from ICE-NYSE combination for several years to come.”Unlike previous deal attempts, including a merger with Deutsche Börse that was scuppered after failing to receive regulatory support due to antitrust concerns, the ICE-NYSE tie-up is widely expected to be completed. The transaction is expected to close as soon as September after it cleared one of the last major hurdles to the deal and received EU regulatory approval this summer.Ahead of the merger, the exchange operator switched clearing on NYSE Liffe to ICE Clear Europe. It was also appointed the new administrator of the Libor interbank rate, the scandal-plagued reference point for more than $350tn in contracts worldwide, and charged with restoring confidence in the important financial benchmark.Shares in NYSE have risen 31.3 per cent since the start of the year, boosting the value of its cash-and-stock takeover, which was initially valued at $8.2bn.
246;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-07-18T11:53:56Z;Derivatives key to exchanges’ fortunes;Shares in LSE, CME and ICE up more than 40 per cent this year;Exchange groups are on a tear. Shares in London’s LSE, Chicago’s CME and the IntercontinentalExchange are all up more than 40 per cent this year.Equity trading volumes have recovered strongly in 2013 as global stocks have hit record levels. But that is only part of the story. The CME and ICE do not trade cash equities, and even at the LSE, stock trading accounts for barely 10 per cent of revenues.Far more important to today’s exchanges are derivatives. Principal among them are instruments linked to interest rates. Trading in interest rate derivatives is expected to rise sharply as traders position for an eventual hike in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Regulators have also mandated clearing of interest rate swaps. The CME, which is active in both these areas, has outperformed peers, while Nasdaq OMX, a more traditional equity exchange, has lagged behind.This explains why the LSE and ICE have bought into the rates business with the acquisitions of LCH.Clearnet and NYSE Euronext respectively. The underlying message is that markets no longer view exchanges simply as stock exchanges.
247;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-07-08T18:24:48Z;CME chief defends clearing houses’ growing role;;The head of the world’s largest exchanges operator, CME Group, has rejected calls from global banks that the growing reliance on clearing houses is posing a new challenge to the stability of the financial system.The risk management houses are becoming a critical part of the plumbing of the world’s financial markets after global regulators mandated that more of the vast but opaque over-the-counter derivatives market be processed through central counterparties.That is expected to lead to a higher-profile role for the US’s CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange, which own their own clearing houses, and LCH.Clearnet, the transatlantic group controlled by the London Stock Exchange Group. A clearing house sits between two parties in a trade, guaranteeing the deal in the event of a default.Terry Duffy, executive chairman of CME Group, said the shift in moving more OTC derivatives transactions was more profound than just transferring the risk and exposure to a counterparty default from banks to clearing houses. “The difference is with a clearing house we do market-to-market [risk management], either twice daily or have the ability to do it much more often,” he said on a visit to London.“What’s important is making certain the pays and collects are done on a risk basis and not a mark-to-myth or anything else. Because of that, we have a much easier time doing the pays and collects than the banks do if it was a bilateral transaction. In turn, I think some of the banks are just not used to the model of clearing.”Some banks have raised concerns about the relatively low capital reserves of clearing houses. Indeed, tougher European rules have forced the region’s two largest clearing houses – Deutsche Börse’s Eurex and LCH.Clearnet – to increase their capital reserves to about €250m and €744m.However, capital reserves form only one of a series of barriers employed by clearers if one of their members fails. Guarantee funds, which a clearing house would exhaust first, are typically far larger. CME has more than $4.5bn as a guarantee fund and LCH nearly €6bn. Industry executives also acknowledge that those reserves will be raised again when Iosco, the umbrella group of financial regulators, finalises global principles governing the operation of clearing houses next year.“I think what was critically important, under Dodd-Frank, we made certain we were not forced to accept all bilateral swaps into our clearing house, that if we felt we couldn’t risk manage them we wouldn’t accept them,” said Mr Duffy. “If we do take them, we make certain that we have adequate capital so we can do their risk management. So I think it’s a little bit of a misdirecter.”Some observers such as Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, have warned that clearing houses must also develop recovery and resolution plans should one default.
248;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-07-02T12:13:35Z;ICE Clear completes NYSE Liffe switch;;IntercontinentalExchange has begun clearing derivatives for NYSE Liffe, in a move that underlines ICE’s emergence as one of Europe’s largest clearing houses in just five years.Over the weekend the US derivatives exchanges operator switched the open positions of fixed income, equity, currency and commodities trades made on NYSE Liffe to its own clearing house from LCH.Clearnet. The move involved 43 member firms, 75m contract sides and $11.2bn of margin held at LCH.The switch has parallels with a similar transition of energy products from LCH to ICE in September 2008. The two moves have made ICE Clear Europe, which came into operation only five years ago, into one of the region’s largest clearing houses. The 3m trades per day it clears in energy and interest rate derivatives puts it alongside Deutsche Börse’s Eurex and LCH.Clearnet in terms of size. The combined guaranty fund for ICE Energy and NYSE Liffe Futures and Options is set at $1.2bn.It also brings to a close more than two years of uncertainty surrounding the future of clearing derivatives trades opened on Liffe. Its parent NYSE Euronext had sought to shift clearing of the positions to Eurex as part of its deal with Deutsche Börse, but then sought to build its own clearing house when European regulators blocked the deal.NYSE gave notice to LCH a year ago that it would shift the positions to its own clearing house. In spite of persistent industry speculation that NYSE would find the deadline a challenge, the group planned to spend more than $85m on the operation.The switch to ICE Clear was revealed on the day ICE announced its $10bn cash-and-shares bid for NYSE Euronext but was independent of the deal being completed.The successful transition is expected to help finalise some of the outstanding regulatory approvals for the deal in Europe.While it received EU approval last month, it still requires formal national assent from several European countries, including the UK and Holland. ICE has also applied to European regulators to operate a trade repository for the reporting of swaps and futures trade data. Europe is implementing new legislation intended to give regulators a better view of derivatives positions that have built up across global markets.LCH faces a similar sized loss of business next year when trades from the London Metal Exchange will move to the LME’s own purpose-built house next year. However it is making a push into new markets, such as Asia, and on Tuesday was granted permission by Australian regulators to offer its OTC interest rate swap clearing business to local banks. Overseas banks operating in Australia were already allowed to use the LCH service.“This is an important milestone for LCH.Clearnet’s long-term growth strategy in the region,” said Michael Davie, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear business.
249;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-06-21T20:33:29Z;US options volumes at record highs;;Options contract trading volumes hit record highs on Thursday as traders rushed to hedge equities after the Federal Reserve signalled the tapering of its asset purchasing programme, sending shares sharply lower.Trading in the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s S&P 500 Index options contracts reached an all-time high of nearly 2.3m contracts. The exchange’s popular Vix index, which measures implied volatility on the S&P 500 – often referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” – crossed 20 for the first time this year.The CME Group also experienced record high trading in Treasury options, 10-year US Treasury note options and e-mini S&P 500 options.Exchanges have pinned their hopes on a rebound in trading activity after 2012’s weak volumes crippled the industry.At the futures industry’s annual conference earlier this year, Jeff Sprecher, head of IntercontinentalExchange, highlighted the advantages exchanges might reap as markets, anticipating the end of the zero-interest rate environment, react to even minor positive comments from central banks.“You’ve got to believe that in a zero interest rate environment that money is flowing into places where it wouldn’t otherwise flow if there were normal interest rates,” he said. “I think as interest rates rise, we’re going to discover where all that money went …and people will have to hedge or get out of those transactions.“I suspect it will be pretty good for listed exchanges.”So far, it has been, with shares of bourses far outpacing the S&P 500’s nearly 12 per cent year-to-date gains.Shares of CME are up more than 50 per cent so far this year, with about 18 per cent of that increase coming since Fed chairman Ben Bernanke first suggested on May 22 that the central bank might begin to taper its asset purchases.That rise has also been driven by record futures volumes and new regulations under Dodd-Frank that will see more swaps traded on exchanges and cleared in clearing houses like the one that CME owns.Shares in rival IntercontinentalExchange are up around 38 per cent so far this year, while CBOE shares are up more than 44 per cent. All three have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last week.
250;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-06-17T15:58:00Z;EU set to clear ICE’s $10bn NYSE takeover;;European regulators have approved IntercontinentalExchange’s $10bn cash and shares deal to take over NYSE Euronext, a move that will allow the creation of one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges.Two people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times that a probe into the deal concluded that the two global exchanges were complementary to each other and did not breach competition rules.The regulator’s green light for the deal, which is likely to be completed in the second half of this year, clears the final significant obstacle for ICE to complete the takeover of its 208-year-old rival.The tie-up will create a powerhouse for trading commodities and interest rate futures as well as US equities. The combined exchanges will rival the scale of the CME Group, the Chicago-based derivatives bourse.“The Commission’s investigation has been looking into two asset classes, where there could have been a breach of antitrust rules and on both accounts it was clear that there was no overlap,” said a person informed of the antitrust watchdog’s probe.The two areas looked at closely by the regulator were the exchanges’ markets for soft commodities derivatives – including cocoa, coffee and sugar – and their US equities index derivatives.The probe concluded that in the soft commodities derivatives sector the exchanges offered different types of products, and in the equities derivatives business the two were not competing against each other as the NYSE focuses on the options market while ICE specialises on the futures markets.For NYSE, the approval comes more than a year after European regulators blocked a takeover attempt by German exchange group Deutsche Börse, which faltered amid antitrust concerns that both companies’ businesses overlapped and could potentially create a monopoly.However, the deal with Atlanta-based ICE was never seen to trigger the same fears among regulators as their businesses differed. ICE and NYSE declined to comment.“The Deutsche Börse-NYSE deal was very different from the ICE-NYSE,” said another person familiar with the matter. “If Deutsche Börse-NYSE went through they would have had a monopoly of the European derivatives market. That’s not the case with ICE-NYSE.”The news of the approval was first reported by Reuters.Antoine Colombani, Commission spokesman for competition policy, declined to comment on the investigation. He said the regulator’s decision would be announced on June 24.ICE’s cash-and-stock takeover valued NYSE shares at about $33.12 in December. They have since risen by a quarter, valuing the deal at $10bn without debt, according to analysts.
251;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;CME wins bigger Brent market share;;CME Group is using free trading and rebates to encroach on rival turf in the oil patch, winning 5 per cent of Brent crude futures volumes for the first time.The market share advance by the biggest US futures exchange comes at the expense of IntercontinentalExchange, where Brent generated $213.5m in revenue last year.Chicago-based CME has also softened its ambivalence towards Brent as its product attracts significant volume. The company’s New York Mercantile Exchange historically presented West Texas Intermediate futures as the world’s pre-eminent oil price yardstick since its launch in 1983.“There is more than one global benchmark,” Phupinder Gill, CME chief executive, said last week. “There is a suite of benchmarks that serve the world.”North Sea Brent has won favour as resurgent crude output in the US and Canada grew faster than the region’s pipeline capacity. This led crude stocks to swell at the WTI delivery point in Oklahoma.Prices of the two crude varieties diverged by as much as $28 a barrel, but WTI’s discount has closed as new pipeline and railway capacity brings inland crude to coastal refineries. On Tuesday ICE July Brent was $102.47 a barrel down $1.48, while Nymex July WTI was off 77 cents at $95 a barrel.In May, 685,058 Brent futures traded on CME, or 4.7 per cent of total volume. In June to date, CME market share jumped to 5.2 per cent. Last Friday CME Brent volume exceeded 50,000 contracts for the first time, a milestone the company announced in a press release.The price of CME Brent futures is based on the ICE Brent futures market price. Mr Gill’s predecessor in 2011 called such “lookalike” contracts “a parasitic, second-order derivative.”CME has offered free Brent trading for commercial customers such as oil companies and fee rebates for market-makers who stand ready to honour bids and offers. CME’s average rate per contract decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared with a year ago partly “due to an increase in incentives and discounts on our energy contracts”, the company disclosed in a securities filing.Mr Gill said at a New York conference last week that the programmes had drawn 19 commercial traders into the market, from one or two. “That is the traction that we wanted to see,” he said.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said at the same conference that he was “absolutely unconcerned” about the shifts in market share and that the competition was “healthy”. He added: “We are not a low-fee provider of services.”
252;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-06-10T13:39:26Z;CME primed for new derivatives rules;;CME Group, the world largest futures exchange operator, is leading a group of US exchanges hoping to take full advantage of the next phase of new US rules tightening up derivatives trading, which came into force on Monday.About 500 large institutional investors will be required to clear more of their over-the-counter derivatives trades under a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act passed three years ago. The rules are part of a global regulatory push to safeguard markets against systemic risk. Some institutions will be required to clear off-exchange trades, such as interest rate and credit default swaps, forcing them to put up more margin and collateral to back their trades.Exchanges such as CME, its main domestic rival IntercontinentalExchange and Chicago-based start-up Eris Exchange are seeking to capitalise on the new rules, as investors switch from tailored but expensive swaps to cheaper but standardised listed futures to offset their risk. They have also developed new products such as “swap futures” – hybrid products that promise the economic benefits of swaps but trade on an exchange at a lower cost than their OTC equivalents.Analysts said the CME was likely to be one of the biggest gainers as it owns one of the clearing houses in which US OTC swaps are likely to be cleared. Last week, analysts at UBS, Credit Suisse, Wells Fargo and Raymond James upgraded their views of the CME’s stock, which has lagged behind the overall market in the past few years. Each cited optimism around the potential for greater revenues from OTC clearing and trading in swap futures.Raymond James noted that it took more than two years for CME to clear its first $1tn of interest rate swaps, 82 days for the next trillion and 42 days for its third. Investors have taken note of the approaching mandate. The CME’s deliverable swap future has seen surging volumes recently, hitting consecutive single-day, all-time highs last week. The company’s OTC clearing activity has also jumped as banks and customers start centrally clearing some swaps.Shares are up nearly $21 so far this year, to $72, with more than half of the gains coming in the past seven weeks. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in a May note to investors, said that even if swap futures do not pick up as anticipated the company’s core eurodollar and treasury futures “could benefit from some customers looking for alternatives to swaps”.Market insight: Instant market news and commentaryHowever, some have raised doubts about whether the infrastructure will be ready on time on Monday. Last month Tabb Group, a financial markets consultancy, warned that 75 per cent of the market was not ready for the mandate, and that this could lead to a liquidity drain of about $55tn in notional value from the market.Ray Kahn, head of OTC derivatives clearing at Barclays, told a conference last week in New York that investors were leaving it late to set up their systems for the second phase of swap clearing.“It’s like a term paper – everyone is waiting,” he said. The second phase of clearing, he added, was a much bigger operational event than the first round in March, with between five and 10 times more clients now required to clear their swap trades.CME faces competition in its dominance of the market. Domestic competition in swap futures products comes primarily from Eris, the start-up derivatives operator backed by some of the futures industry’s biggest traders. Eris has seen a similar surge in volumes leading up to Monday’s deadline. The exchange reported a record 12,700 contracts traded on May 10, and 40 per cent of 2013’s total trading volume came in May. However, its trades will clear at CME’s clearing house. In energy trading and clearing, CME faces competition from ICE.It will also face a challenge from a nascent LCH.Clearnet, the transatlantic clearing house which launched a US-domiciled version of its interest-rate swap clearing service last week. The London Stock Exchange Group-controlled company is the world’s largest clearer of interest rate swaps. But it has little US-domiciled business, and some observers warn that the differing methods by which CME and LCH calculate their margin requirements may favour the US company.Given the CME’s dominance in trading interest rate products – specifically its eurodollar and treasury futures contracts – it is likely to prevail, said John Brady, managing director of global institutional sales at RJ O’Brien.“The CME has walked a delicate line in terms of relationships between New York banks and customers,” Mr Brady said. “But since Dodd-Frank, when Congress and the American people mandated clearing, they’ve been setting up for it and they’re in a great position to capitalise.”www.ft.com/tradingroom
253;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;London Metal Exchange chief resigns;;Martin Abbott has resigned as chief executive of the London Metal Exchange just six months after spearheading the £1.4bn sale of the 135-year-old bourse to a Chinese rival.Mr Abbott, a former journalist and broker who personally made about $10m from the deal, will leave the exchange at the end of the year.The sale of the LME, the centre for global metals trading, to Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing was completed in December after a hotly contested bidding war among most of the world’s largest exchanges companies including CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and NYSE.The 53-year-old Mr Abbott said he felt he had secured the future of the LME, a bastion of tradition that is home to the last open outcry trading floor in Europe, for a new era of heightened regulatory scrutiny and high-frequency trading.“The business is in a better place. It’s time for me to go and find another business where I can do some kind of turnround job,” he said.HKEx has begun to stamp its mark on the LME, which it hopes will make it a gateway for Chinese companies wishing to trade commodities.Charles Li, chief executive, last week detailed his plans to allow more Asian companies to become members of the LME, to clear contracts in renminbi and to expand the exchange’s network of warehouses in Asia. He said he was also looking to form “strategic partnerships” with exchanges in mainland China.Mr Abbott denied that he had clashed with Mr Li, saying they had experienced “no disagreements other than typical business discussions”.“But I’m used to being pretty much in charge of everything, and quite reasonably that’s not the case any more,” he added.Mr Li praised Mr Abbott’s record at the LME, where trading volumes have risen to successive records in recent months. In the first five months of the year, volumes are up 13 per cent from 2012.“It’s not unusual for leaders of Martin’s calibre who are involved in major transactions and big transitions to pause for reflection when it’s all over and to decide it’s time to take a break,” Mr Li said.The LME this week announced that it would clear its own contracts from September next year– one of Mr Abbott’s signature projects.HKEx said Mr Abbott’s successor would be announced in due course.
254;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Swap futures market ramps up ahead of clearing mandate;Start-up operator seeks to capitalise on regulation of over the counter derivatives;Eris Exchange, a start-up US derivatives operator backed by some of the futures industry’s biggest traders, is to offer trading via one of the world’s largest trading software companies ahead of new clearing mandate for investors that kicks in next week.The exchange will connect its hybrid interest rate swap futures products to Trading Technologies’ popular X_Trader software platform, the companies announced on Tuesday.Eris specialises in “swap futures” – an emerging product in the derivatives industry. They promise the economic benefits of a swap but trade on an exchange at a lower cost than their equivalents that are traded over the counter (OTC).The two-year old company is looking to capitalise on efforts by global regulators to regulate the over the counter derivatives industry, with US reforms contained in the Dodd Frank Act of 2010. The centralised clearing of swaps is a key reform that seeks to limit the fallout from the failure of a major dealer or large investor in the future.From next Monday, more hedge funds and institutional investors will have to clear their swaps trades through clearing houses, the next phase of a set of rules being brought in to safeguard global markets against systemic risk.With the bulk of OTC swaps set to be cleared, exchanges like CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and Eris are hoping investors will may gravitate towards swap futures as they will require less margin for trading.Chicago-based Eris is looking to broaden the appeal of its products to investors as the new rules come into force. On Monday Eris cut the size of its contracts to a $100,000 notional figure, compared with $1m previously, a move widely interpreted as an effort to appeal to smaller investors and attract more users. Eris was founded by several electronic market makers including DRW Holdings and Getco, while Morgan Stanley, the broker-dealer, also took a stake in December.Trading Technologies, also based in Chicago, counts 19 of the top 20 futures commission merchants in the US as its customers, including Goldman Sachs, UBS and Newedge.Robert Stowsky, senior analyst at Aite Group said the choice between using OTC swaps and a swap future will be a “cost decision” for some investors. “We will see some firms that would have used swaps, go into swap futures.”For market-moving news and views 24 hours a day visit our new rolling news feed of bite-size stories and commentaryThe established swaps industry, led by global banks and interdealer brokers, has become increasingly worried that the lower cost of clearing and transacting a swap future will lead to a big shift in the over the counter derivatives market once banks and customers start centrally clearing swaps.Similar changes have already taken place in the energy derivatives market as CME and ICE converted swaps contracts to futures in response to the new rules.The difference in trading costs between swap futures and OTC swaps transacted on so-called Swap Execution Facilities has been a hot topic of debate within the swaps business. Bloomberg is suing the CFTC in an effort to equalise margin rules between Sefs and exchanges that plan to trade swap futures.Prospective backers of Sefs are worried that the market is moving to a futures model. GFI, the interdealer broker, indicated in March that it had filed an application with the CFTC to launch a futures exchange.Separately, Wells Fargo upgraded the CME Group’s stock to an “outperform” rating on Tuesday.“Outside of clearing, CME stands to benefit from the futurisation of swaps volumes which could ultimately be a much bigger opportunity than clearing alone,” said the bank.
255;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-05-21T13:37:01Z;ICE and NYSE file deal with European regulators;;IntercontinentalExchange and NYSE Euronext have formally filed their planned $10bn deal to create one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges with antitrust authorities in Europe.The filing to the European Commission was made last Friday and published on the regulator’s website on Tuesday. It has 25 working days to make an initial investigation although the period can be extended by an extra 10 workdays.Regulators also have the ability to open a further in-depth investigation of the merger, which would last at least another 90 working days.Approval of the deal would create a competitor to CME Group of the US and Deutsche Börse for trading and clearing futures, used by corporations and banks both to hedge risks in price movements and to speculate.The deal will also propel ICE, which has grown through offering trading in energy, emissions and commodities, into the trading of listed interest-rate derivatives, the world’s largest asset class.ICE has also said it would keep the NYSE building on Wall Street but wants to hive off Euronext’s cash equities businesses, which include the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. The company said it was exploring a listing of Euronext if market conditions allowed and European policy makers supported the offering.The deal has received approval from US authorities. Shareholders of both companies will vote on the deal on June 3.
256;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-05-01T16:33:04Z;IntercontinentalExchange profit falls ahead of NYSE Euronext deal;;IntercontinentalExchange, the US derivatives exchange, on Wednesday indicated it would look to push further into trading credit after clearing more than $300bn in derivatives in the past two months.The Atlanta-based company reported first-quarter results ahead of analysts’ expectations with net income of $135.4m, or $1.85 per diluted share, compared with $147.9m, or $2.02 per share, during the same period last year. Revenues for the quarter fell 4 per cent, from $365.2m to $351.9m.The group attributed the decline in part to lower revenue from transaction and clearing fees and higher expenses related to its $8.2bn takeover of NYSE Euronext. The two exchanges are expected to formally file for approval of their deal before European antitrust regulators in coming months.The deal is expected to create one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges by contracts traded and exploit wide-ranging reforms of the over-the-counter derivatives market. G20 regulations have mandated that more of the vast $650tn OTC derivatives market be processed through central clearing.ICE dominates the market for clearing credit default swaps, which provide insurance against a default on bond payments and are used by investors to insure against risk and speculate on creditworthiness. It is also planning to launch futures trading in June.The group said it had cleared more than $300bn in credit derivatives and earned more than $1m in revenue since the first phase of mandatory clearing came into force in the US in early March. A second phase, for institutional investors, will start in June.“We’ll start with the investment grade in high-yield indexes, but I think there’s a lot of opportunity down the road beyond just those products, Scott Hill, chief financial officer, told analysts. “Longer-term credit will be a tradable market and we think there are additional products that we can create with our customers that will enable that trade.”Revenues from transaction and clearing fees fell 7 per cent to $299.7m, while ICE reported $17m in charges related to the NYSE deal and other transactions.Average daily contract volume in the three months to March fell nearly 4 per cent to 3.64m compared with the same period a year ago. In 2012, volumes grew nearly 10 per cent year on year to 2.72m led by double-digit growth in its Brent and energy products.The group also said it was “on track” with the transfer of clearing positions at NYSE Liffe, and held at LCH.Clearnet, to ICE’s own clearing house.On Monday, ICE said it would reduce its electronic US grain trading hours from 22 hours to 18.5 hours because of customer feedback. The move follows CME’s March decision to cut its trading day to 17.5 hours, after earlier expanding it in response to ICE’s expansion.Shares in ICE, which have risen more than 33 per cent from the start of the year, gained 2.2 per cent to $166.56.
257;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-05-01T15:16:08Z;MTS plans push into US bond trading;Pressure grows to move to electronic platforms;One of Europe’s largest electronic fixed income platforms is preparing a push into the US as it looks to tap rising demand from institutional investors for government and corporate bonds.MTS, owned by the London Stock Exchange, is set to announce an expansion in coming weeks into bond trading in the US, the world’s most advanced market for trading fixed income.It comes as many exchanges and brokers are taking a closer look at ways to ease tight trading of corporate credit, which is emerging as a sought-after asset class in a world of ultra-low interest rates and falling sovereign debt ratings. Demand remains high, as illustrated by Apple issuing the largest corporate bond sale in history on Tuesday.Banks have historically played a central market-maker role in credit markets as they were able to hold large inventories. However, after the financial crisis their desire to maintain such inventory has weakened in the face of the regulatory changes, notably the higher levels of capital they will have to hold.“We are looking very closely at the US,” Jack Jeffery, chief executive of MTS, told the Financial Times. “We have plans there. It’s a huge marketplace compared to Europe.”Several other exchanges, notably IntercontinentalExchange and Nasdaq OMX are aiming to exploit the changing environment in credit markets by trading the cash products and developing derivatives contracts around them.“It’s very hard to trade those [cash] products because there really isn’t that well-established derivative market that’s around them like you would see in most other asset classes,” Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, told analysts yesterday. “It’s the development of that derivative market that has so intrigued and it’s the reason that we decided to move into that space.”The LSE’s push also comes as the bond markets that have hitherto often been traded bilaterally and over the phone face long-term pressure to move on to electronic venues.Investors and banks have been pushing to use the same types of high-speed trading, algorithmic and automated trading tools in fixed income markets that have transformed equity markets in recent years.MTS started out 25 years ago as Europe’s first market mandated for electronic government bond trading, in Italy. MTS is 60 per cent owned by the LSE, with the remainder held by a consortium of global banks and several regional Italian banks.
258;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;NYSE Euronext sees pick-up in European derivatives trading;;NYSE Euronext said a pick-up in European derivatives transactions helped the exchanges operator being bought by IntercontinentalExchange to report a 44 per cent increase in net profits.The company, which runs the largest US stock exchange by volume, said the gains came amid a slowdown in its primary business of equity trading in both the US and Europe.Net revenues from derivatives trading in Europe – increasingly one of its key drivers of profits – rose $27m to $201m on the back of higher trading volumes. The growth in the quarter came as investors have begun positioning for a change in interest rates. With the eurozone economy continuing to weaken, the European Central Bank is widely expected to cut interest rates on Thursday.Net income for the first quarter rose from $87m to $126m year-on-year. The company reported $8m in merger expenses and exit costs for the period, compared with $31m a year ago. Revenues rose 1 per cent in the same period, to $963m. NYSE also took a $10m stock-based compensation charge in the quarter.NYSE’s European derivatives business, known as NYSE Liffe, is the main asset sought by ICE as the two parties prepare to put their planned $8.2bn deal before antitrust authorities in Europe in coming weeks.The cash-and-shares deal, in which the 14-year-old ICE will purchase the 221-year-old owner of the New York Stock Exchange, will create a rival to CME Group and Deutsche Börse as one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges by contracts traded.It will give ICE access to trading interest rate derivatives, the asset class most used by investors, banks and corporations to hedge risk and speculate. Both groups have scheduled a shareholder meeting in June to approve the deal.“When you look at the combined business, you see a company with a completely different complexion than the one we have today,” said Duncan Niederauer, NYSE chief executive. “Almost 50 per cent of our net revenue will be generated from our derivatives business.”He added: “This is a critical aspect of the transaction because of the relatively high margin and its impact on our overall valuation.”The focus on derivatives markets comes as profits from equities transaction continue to slid, amid an industry wide downturn in volumes. NYSE said transactions from its European and US equities business fell 13 per cent respectively.Alongside the ICE deal in December, NYSE agreed to move clearing of contracts traded on its Liffe derivatives exchange to ICE’s London-based clearing house, rather than build its own operations.The move will allow NYSE to compete for business as new rules around derivatives markets come into force over the next 18 months. Bourses are looking to exploit a push by global regulators to move more of the over-the-counter derivatives market on to exchanges and through clearing houses.Shares in NYSE Euronext, which have outperformed a broad measure of US stocks since the start of the year, rose 0.4 per cent to $38.81 on Tuesday in New York.
259;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-04-26T09:12:44Z;Comment: Like airlines, exchanges hit turbulence in consolidation;Independence is increasingly the exception, not the norm;"Recently I travelled to Madrid, having booked a flight on British Airways. I found myself flying Iberia. Of course, these two “national carriers” are now part of the same company, listed primarily on the London Stock Exchange and Bolsas y Mercados Españoles, its counterpart in Madrid.But the parallels between the two extend far beyond my journey. The Madrid and London stock exchanges are both over 150 years old and fiercely independent. They used to be among scores of independent stock exchanges around the world, all existing to serve their local markets with listings of companies from their country or local area. But increasingly their independence is the exception, not the norm.Like airlines, when countries from Austria to Zimbabwe took pride in having “national carriers”, having your own stock market was a calling card for a nation, even a region. Just as the economics of airlines have prompted alliances no one could have conceived of – Air France-KLM, for example – the economics of stock markets are increasingly leading to a shake-out of the industry.And just as with airlines, the traditional players are being challenged by low-cost entrants who are altering the perceived business model by stripping it back to the basics of what traders want from a market. For every easyJet or Southwest Airlines, there are multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) such as BATS-Chi-X Europe or hungry new entrants, such as IntercontinentalExchange (ICE).Hardly a week goes by without another deal or alliance being struck among exchanges. Partnerships change all the time, creating the most unlikely bedfellows. But in reality all they are doing is following the money.We are often told that we live in a global world; what happens in São Paulo can move markets in Shanghai. This means that traders can be in any location they choose – and these choices are dictated by the availability of skilled labour, the nature of the tax regime, regulations – and probably where hedge fund managers want to send their children to school. From that location they want to trade in any security anywhere in the world. Their choice of market is not predicated on any national loyalty – they will go where there is the best opportunity, the most liquidity, the lowest costs and the least hassle.As a result you have seen an increasing flow of companies listing on stock markets outside their home territory – from Israeli technology companies on Nasdaq to Kazakh miners on the LSE and Manchester United listing in New York, where “soccer” is at best a minority sport. Even when a company has its primary listing in its home country, you will often find that the investor community is based, and the majority of trading happens, elsewhere.Like airlines, national exchanges have had to adapt from being near monopolies in their home markets to being relatively small players in an increasingly global market. They have had to invest in systems and infrastructure to compete and yet still see a large amount of their business being taken by rivals. Against this background it is not surprising that they want to huddle together or face being picked off by global consolidators, or even worse: remaining forgotten and obsolete.Over the past few years we have seen multiple alliances in other parts of the world. Euronext in western Europe should regain some autonomy following the very likely takeover of its parent company by ICE, while Nasdaq OMX in the Nordics, ASEAN in South East Asia, CEESEG in Central & eastern Europe, and Mila in Latin America have all emerged as important trading blocks, each operating with a subtly different market model.A fresh crop of new entrants are emerging who reflect the financial strength of markets previously not considered to be worthy of consideration. Moscow shows how, with government backing and strong momentum, a fragmented market can be consolidated to create a credible emerging financial centre, fighting for Russian stocks listings that previously would have gone to London or New York. Both the Warsaw and Istanbul exchanges are emerging with similar ambitions.Where will it end? I see a few major groupings of markets emerging over time. It is hard to see more than two or three exchange groups in Europe. The lessons from the airline industry are there to see.Philippe Carré is the global head of connectivity at SunGard Financial Systems"
260;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Nasdaq set for Europe energy trades push;;Nasdaq OMX is preparing a push into Europe’s commodities and energy markets, which will put it head to head with Deutsche Börse and Intercontinental­Exchange in the region’s emerging market for trading power.In the coming months the transatlantic exchanges operator will extend trading of electricity derivatives into Germany, and plans to introduce gas and coal forward contracts in the UK, Germany and the Nordic region.Nasdaq’s rapid expansion into European commodities trading is part of a three-pronged move in which the exchange aims to break out of trading equities in the US and Nordic region, where profits have shrunk dramatically amid fierce competition.In recent months it has paid $390m for two corporate services businesses from Thomson Reuters, and $750m for eSpeed, the electronic government bond trading platform of interdealer broker BGC Partners. It is also putting the final touches to the launch of an interest rate derivatives venue in Europe called NLX, which is likely to launch next month.Hans-Ole Jochumsen, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX’s European business, told the Financial Times that the group would begin by offering electricity futures contracts in Germany from May. “We will be active in Nordic region, the UK and Germany,” he said. “The next step will be to move into gas and coal. They’re very correlated in the UK.”He added that the contracts would be cleared through Nasdaq OMX’s own clearing house.This market is also being eyed by Deutsche Börse, via its European Energy Exchange subsidiary, while IntercontinentalExchange, the US derivatives group, earlier this month won regulatory approval for ICE Endex, an exchange to trade European natural gas.They are looking to exploit sweeping change in global derivatives markets. Incoming rules under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, is pushing to have more of the vast over-the-counter derivatives market processed through clearing houses.A clearing house stands between two parties in a deal, guaranteeing the trade in the event of a default.Brokers and their ­customers, such as big power companies, use derivatives such as swaps to offset risks from trading, but swaths of such activity will be caught under the new rules.Tighter capital requirements imposed on banks by Basel III may also make it harder for them to provide the industry with the credit and swaps trades they have done in the past.As it stands, around three-quarters of Europe’s gas and power derivatives trading is uncleared.Nasdaq, like ICE and Deutsche Börse, will let customers clear through its own clearing house, aiming to exploit the savings customers can make from netting the margin they have to put up to trade derivatives.
261;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-04-01T21:30:21Z;Nasdaq OMX in $1.2bn deal to buy eSpeed;;Nasdaq OMX made an aggressive foray into the market for benchmark US Treasury bonds on Monday, offering as much as $1.2bn in cash and deferred stock for a leading electronic trading platform from BGC Partners, an interdealer broker.The transatlantic exchange operator is buying a unit of the eSpeed platform that deals only in the most liquid Treasury securities – so-called “on-the-run” issues – hoping to attract high-speed traders who are spreading into other markets as their equity returns decline.Nasdaq is betting on both an increase in electronic trading in fixed-income markets and on a pick-up in Treasury transactions once the Federal Reserve ends its quantitative easing policy of purchasing bonds and suppressing interest rates“It’s important to recognise that the US Treasury market is the most similar to the US equity market in its construction and operation,” said Bob Greifeld, chief executive officer at Nasdaq OMX. “The under-pining of technology is something we are familiar with and we believe is in our power zone.”BGC, which was spun off from Cantor Fitzgerald, will continue to operate a unit of eSpeed that deals in less liquid Treasury notes and bonds. In three years’ time, BGC can also return to the on-the-run market under the proposed offer.The purchase consideration includes $750m in cash and as much as $484m in stock, to be dispersed over 15 years, subject to various conditions. At current prices, BGC would receive 15m shares. Nasdaq said it will receive a tax benefit, which will offset the value of the stock portion of the deal.The deal is Nasdaq’s second large acquisition since IntercontinentalExchange made an $8.2bn offer for its main competitor, NYSE Euronext. In December, Nasdaq agreed to a $390m purchase of the investor and public relations services unit of Thomson Reuters as part of its efforts to expand beyond equities.In bond trading, Nasdaq will face competition from Icap’s BrokerTec system, which holds roughly a 60 per cent market share in the electronic Treasury trading market.Examine the state of the bond market and whether the bull run is sustainable“We have great respect for what Icap has accomplished and I certainly think it will be a good competitive dynamic between the two market places,” said Mr Greifeld.Shares in Nasdaq, which are up 28 per cent on the year, fell slightly in after-hours trading in New York. Moody’s also placed Nasdaq’s credit rating on review for a downgrade as the company said it would suspend guidance on its $30m share repurchase programme. In contrast BGC jumped 41 per cent to $5.43 in extended hours trading.Howard Lutnick, BGC chairman and chief executive, said the deal “clearly demonstrates that this process ultimately leads to enormous value for our stockholders.” He added that the $1.23bn deal was approximately equal to BGC’s current market capitalisation.Deutsche Bank advised Nasdaq on the transaction and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom provided legal assistance. Cantor Fitzgerald acted as financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted a legal adviser to BGC Partners.
262;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-03-19T23:40:25Z;Derivatives sector urges wider Iosco role;;"The heads of some of the world’s largest derivative trade associations have urged the body for global securities regulators to help resolve the controversial issue of cross-border application of derivatives rules.They called on the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco) to take the lead in the reform of derivatives markets at its annual meeting this month. The umbrella body for the world’s securities regulators had no supervisory responsibilities, nor a regulatory position to defend, they argued.The stance, contained in a letter to the Financial Times, was signed by the chief executives of the Futures and Options Association and the Futures Industry Association, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and the Swiss Bankers Association.They were joined by several high-profile heads of privately owned market infrastructure operators, including the London Metal Exchange and ICE Clear Europe, a London-based clearing house owned by US-based IntercontinentalExchange.Implementation of policies agreed by global leaders to safeguard derivatives markets in the wake of the financial crisis have been delayed by differences between regulators over their jurisdiction. Authorities have warned the planned US reforms in particular could sweep up overseas financial institutions, forcing them to comply with two sets of overlapping and conflicting regulations.The letter said the objective to “reject protectionism and not turn inward” was “being progressively undermined” by regulatory extraterritoriality and the differences in national implementation of global standards.The executives warned that the result was not only greater confusion and complexity for customers but it clashed with the public policy objective of fast-tracking post-crisis economic and business recovery.It said assuming greater responsibility was “a natural evolution of [Iosco’s] existing role”.A central part of the global push requires that OTC derivatives be traded on electronic trading platforms as well as greater use of clearing of such derivatives through clearing houses.A clearing house guarantees that a trade is completed even if one party defaults, helping to reduce risk in the financial system.The US stance has caused most problems with overseas regulators, although is willing to use “substituted compliance” which would allow exempt foreign activity from falling under US rules so long as the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission deems the foreign rules to be sufficient.Iosco is due to hold its annual board meeting this month. David Wright, its secretary-general, has spoken at industry events of the need to take a greater role in regulation.Among the signatures include Anthony Belchambers and Walt Lukken of the FOA and FIA respectively, Robert Pickel from ISDA; Ian Russell, chief executive of the Investment Industry Association of Canada; Martin Abbott of the LME; Paul Swann of ICE and Muthukrishnan Ramaswami, president of the Singapore Exchange."
263;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;ICE adjusts terms of $8.2bn NYSE deal;;IntercontinentalExchange has tweaked the terms of its planned $8.2bn deal to purchase NYSE Euronext to satisfy regulatory rules surrounding ownership of exchanges.In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, ICE said it would form a new holding company for both itself and NYSE Euronext, which operates exchanges in the US and Europe. Each share of ICE common stock will be converted into the right to receive one share of the new holding company, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange as ICE Group.The change was made to meet requirements laid down by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which permits parties a maximum shareholding level in stock exchanges of just 20 per cent.“The terms of the agreement, including consideration to be paid to NYSE Euronext shareholders, are substantially the same,” the filing said.ICE is set to shake up global derivatives trading with its cash and shares deal to buy the New York Stock Exchange. However, ICE, which has emerged only in the past decade via energy and commodity trading, has designs on NYSE Liffe, the European derivatives exchange.Ownership of it will allow ICE to trade interest rate derivatives, the most widely used derivatives for hedging risk, and create a rival to CME Group and Deutsche Börse as one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges by contracts traded.The deal comes amid a lull in industry volumes as global low interest rates, little economic growth and greater stability in the eurozone curb investor appetite for trading.However, under its plan many of NYSE’s continental European assets, including the stock exchanges of Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon, are set to be floated in Europe. Dominique Cerutti, deputy chief executive of NYSE Euronext, has emerged as a frontrunner for the new European entity, according to people familiar with the situation.ICE is finalising its discussions with European regulators ahead of filing its deal proposals to antitrust authorities. It hopes to complete the deal by the end of the year.Last week Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of the ICE, called for more consolidation among European exchanges as regulation and the euro crisis combined to further the creation of a single market among the 27 euro states.Exchanges should form a federation “where they accommodate the local markets for listing and capital raising but allow trading to happen cross-border”, he said.Shares in ICE, up nearly 30 per cent this year, fell 0.3 per cent to $159.13. NYSE Euronext shares were down 0.3 per cent to $37.91.
264;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-03-13T01:15:21Z;ICE head calls for exchange consolidation;;Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of IntercontinentalExchange, has called for more consolidation in Europe as he prepares to buy NYSE Euronext and float most of its continental assets.“I think that continental Europe needs more consolidation in the exchange space,” he said at the futures industry’s annual conference in Florida on Tuesday. “I’m hoping that if we take Euronext public …it can be the first mover in what I think should be continued consolidation or joint ventures or some sort of federation or loose amalgamation of exchanges on the continent.”He added that there was little sense in having separate exchanges in each European country as wide-ranging reforms like banking union, and the growing role of the European Central Bank, push the region toward a single market.Mr Sprecher reiterated his plan to spin off the European equities, options and indices businesses via either a listing, should regulators allow, as envisaged when ICE agreed a deal to buy NYSE Euronext in December.Mr Sprecher said the exchanges should form a federation “where they accommodate the local markets for listing and capital raising but allow trading to happen cross border”.“The failure of the individual exchanges in Europe to do that means that entrepreneurs will come in,” he said, referring to alternative trading platforms like BATS Chi-X Europe, the region’s largest share trading platform with a 25 per cent market share. “[They] will sit wherever they want to in Europe and provide trading cross border and the incumbent exchanges’ long term viability will be threatened.”Mr Sprecher has grown increasingly outspoken since announcing ICE’s planned purchase of NYSE Euronext. He said on Tuesday he intended to be “provocative” – and previously had called some US equity markets practices “patently absurd”.He said during an earnings call last month that he hoped to see the NYSE deal increase the influence the combined company has to comment on how market structure can be improved.The deal will create a rival to CME Group and Deutsche Börse as one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges by contracts traded.NYSE has also agreed to move clearing of contracts traded on its Liffe derivatives exchange to ICE’s London-based clearing house, rather than build its own operations.
265;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-03-12T23:10:39Z;Bloomberg threatens suit over swaps trading;Financial data and services group complains to regulator over new rules;Bloomberg LP has threatened a leading US regulator with legal action in an effort to prevent a competitive advantage for exchanges in the battle over how derivatives will trade under new rules.In a letter sent this week to Gary Gensler, Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, the company said the higher cost of clearing over-the-counter swaps, compared with futures, is unfair to the swaps industry.Bloomberg, the financial information service which provides tools such as analytics and trading platforms, said it is prepared to file a lawsuit to block new regulations mandating minimum margin collateral that can cover five days of possible losses for cleared financial swaps. By contrast, margin for futures contracts traded on exchanges presently covers the risks of one day of losses.The company has hired Eugene Scalia, partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and son of US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. The younger Scalia has successfully challenged US financial regulations in court, stymying regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission.Last year, Mr Scalia persuaded a court to overturn caps on commodity speculation that the CFTC was implementing as part of Dodd-Frank.The CFTC is working to implement rules governing the trading of over-the-counter derivatives as mandated by the US overhaul of financial regulation known as Dodd-Frank.The CFTC has yet to pass final rules for trading swaps on so-called Swap Execution Facilities. But trading venues for transacting “swap futures” contracts at exchange operators CME Group and Eris Exchange in Chicago are already active.With OTC swaps now subject to clearing, the higher cost associated with trading these products is seen favouring swap futures. This week, IntercontinentalExchange announced plans to list a credit derivatives futures contract by May.“With ICE, CME, and others able to offer futures products that have substantially lower margin requirements than swaps that otherwise are functionally interchangeable, the implications for SEFs (which cannot offer futures) are clear and profoundly disturbing,” Mr Scalia wrote on behalf of Bloomberg.Bloomberg is developing a SEF and is expected to play a major role as a trading venue for OTC swaps.George Harrington, Bloomberg head of global fixed income trading, said the agency should set margin requirements based on the risk posed by the financial instruments, echoing arguments made by several large investors and dealers at a public CFTC roundtable in January.He claimed there was more liquidity in swaps than in swap futures, which should drive the CFTC to lower its margin requirements.The difference in trading costs between swap futures and OTC swaps transacted on SEFs is a hot topic for the swaps business, with many key players attending this week’s annual Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton.“Treating swaps and futures products differently is inconsistent with [the] Dodd-Frank Act’s commitment to transparency, investor protection, and competition, and it poses imminent, significant adverse consequences to Bloomberg (and potentially others),” said Mr Scalia in his letter to the CFTC.The company said all financial products should be subject to one-day margin requirements. This would result in similar margin treatment for over-the-counter swaps and futures on swaps, limiting an arbitrage opportunity for exchanges that list futures.Bloomberg said it was prepared to launch a lawsuit “in order to ensure that a flawed regulation, which would cause significant public harm, does not get implemented”.The company requested that the commission respond to the letter by March 19 so that Bloomberg “can proceed to court if necessary to obtain appropriate relief”.Additional reporting by Shahien Nasiripour in Washington
266;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-03-03T16:53:31Z;Nasdaq executing trades at a loss;;Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange operator, is executing some US stock trades at an operating loss in what analysts are calling an aggressive act to regain market share.The US’s second-largest exchange said it had been employing the classic loss-leader strategy since February and is expanding the scheme this month, betting that the knock-on effect will bolster its overall transaction levels.The effort comes as Nasdaq and its rival, the New York Stock Exchange, both already facing an industry-wide downturn in trading levels, have steadily been losing market share of what’s left to competing exchanges and alternative trading platforms run by banks, brokers and others.The move appears to have worked last month for Nasdaq, as February market share data show the exchange gained about 1.5 percentage points of overall volumes back. Analysts at brokerage Rosenblatt Securities said the gains came primarily at the expense of other exchanges, such as NYSE.Nasdaq said in a statement to the FT that it was committed to offering its members diverse investment strategies aimed at increasing transaction volumes.In recent weeks, Nasdaq has been looking to poach business away from NYSE as its rival focuses on its impending $8.2bn merger with the IntercontinentalExchange. Industry insiders also speculated whether Nasdaq might also be trying to boost market share with a view towards looking for merger opportunities. Nasdaq held failed early-stage talks with buyout firm Carlyle Group earlier this year over a deal that would have seen the exchange operator taken private.With the programmes, the exchange is specifically targeting price-sensitive brokers that transact on behalf of retail investors, including UBS, Citigroup, Knight Capital and Citadel, and offering them rebates larger than the amount they take in for executing the trade. People familiar with the scheme confirmed the trades were lossmaking.NYSE has executed similar schemes in what people familiar with its policies said were run at break-even or slightly lossmaking rates since August. The people said the NYSE’s programme, which is offered on its Arca exchange, was significantly smaller than Nasdaq’s, but that it was considering a move to increase the size of those rebates in response.“I don’t think it’s healthy for the business or the market for us to create a price war in a negative margin area,” said one of these people. “It’s not a sign of health. It’s a desperate situation.”Exchanges often tinker with the rebates they pay brokers each month in what is a common practice on the fragmented US equity market, which is made up of 13 stock exchanges and about 50 alternate trading venues vying for transactions.According to analysts, however, while exchanges sometimes offer rebates at a loss, Nasdaq’s move is the most extreme to date.
267;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-02-27T19:59:12Z;LCH.Clearnet names Weisbrod for US unit;;LCH.Clearnet, the transatlantic clearing house, has appointed David Weisbrod from JPMorgan to run its US business as it prepares for incoming rules around derivatives trading.Mr Weisbrod, who has been at JPMorgan for more than 40 years, will lead strategy in the US, one of the world’s largest locations for off-exchange derivatives trading.Global regulators want more of the vast over-the-counter derivatives market to be processed through clearing houses. A clearing house stands between two parties, guaranteeing a trade in the event of a default.LCH is the world’s largest clearing house, dwarfing rival services from CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange. It clears nearly half of the world’s $400tn global interest rate swap market and is the second-largest clearer of bonds and repos in the world.Ian Axe, chief executive, has led a two-year transformation to turn the Anglo-French group into a more global business and give it a more commercial focus.Mr Axe has agreed to sell a majority stake in the group to the London Stock Exchange, and last year bought the International Derivatives Clearing Group from Nasdaq OMX to expand its business.LCH is also in talks to sell a stake in the business to SGX, the Singapore exchange.Mr Weisbrod’s last role at JPMorgan was vice-chairman for risk management. He also chaired its exchange & clearing house steering committee. He has also been a member of committees on the New York Federal Reserve and served on the board of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, a bank-owned clearing house. He is also on the board of CLS, the foreign exchange settlement service.“I am delighted David is joining our team. He has vast risk management expertise, clearing knowledge and experience working with US regulators, and he joins the group at a critical stage of our US growth,” said Mr Axe.
268;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-02-27T18:00:20Z;Block trades face higher minimums;;A US regulator is pondering making it tougher to execute block futures trades, a way to transact discreetly while dodging new rules covering derivatives.Block trades have become a point of friction among brokers, traders, exchanges and regulators as financial reforms take hold. They worry about keeping markets transparent while also letting customised risk management survive.Futures from natural gas to interest rates are mainly traded on a computer screen or exchange floor where traders see live prices. Block trades enable market participants to strike a deal in private and afterward post it to an exchange.These trades were traditionally reserved for large transactions. But late last year exchange operators CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange began allowing much smaller trades in energy markets to qualify as blocks. In US crude oil options the minimum block size is now 100 contracts, down from 1,000 in early 2012. In markets such as coal and electricity the threshold is as little as five.Traders embraced blocks as an alternative to over-the-counter derivatives as the latter became regulated under the Dodd-Frank financial law. But some regulators are concerned the vogue for blocks will encourage trading outside transparent exchanges.Staff of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are now studying methodologies that would raise minimum block sizes in some futures markets. If approved by commissioners, their work may result in a proposed rule or a “concept release”, people familiar with the effort said.One question under consideration is whether to allow exchanges to continue to set futures block thresholds or dictate formulas from Washington. The staff are also examining ways to make trading in futures consistent with OTC swaps, where new block rules are pending.Bryan Durkin, CME chief operating officer, said at a public meeting last month: “We believe the thresholds we have established need to stay in place absolutely until the full extent of the swap rules are clearly defined and evident to the marketplace. We also need to give appropriate time for the marketplace to adapt and adjust to whatever that criteria is going to be.”The prospect of higher block minimums has sparked anxiety in energy markets. Mercuria, the Swiss-based trading house, warned it could abandon US futures markets if the CFTC tried to manage the size of block trades.“We strongly believe that the commission should refrain from trying to fix something that is not broken. In other words, block trading is working,” Jerry Jeske, Mercuria chief compliance officer, said at the meeting.LCM Commodities, a New York broker, said in a note to clients: “If minimum block sizes were raised to the old 1,000 threshold, liquidity in energy options would be so drastically diminished that it could jeopardise the adequate functioning of the market itself.”
269;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Those betting on D Börse deal face a wait;;Will Deutsche Börse be the latest European exchange to fall to a larger US rival?The group quickly moved to shoot down the news, first reported by Bloomberg, that it was pursuing a merger with the CME by flatly stating it was “not in merger talks”.Its shares closed up 4.8 per cent at €48.80 in Frankfurt on hopes that its depressed market valuation would receive a shot in the arm. But those betting on a takeover may be waiting for some time.In the short term, the stories put pressure firmly on Deutsche Börse management to increase shareholder value in the wake of its failed merger with NYSE Euronext.Its push into collateral management, while a vital issue for the stability of the financial system, has yet to catch the imagination of investors looking for growth.The group’s shares continue to underperform those of rivals such as CME and IntercontinentalExchange.More importantly, the daily business continues to languish. Peter Lenardos, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, pointed out last week that Deutsche Börse had yet to see the bounce in derivatives trading volumes seen elsewhere.With overall trading volumes dropping sharply for several years, muted investor appetite to offset their trades with derivatives and low interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic, unsurprisingly the two big US exchanges CME and ICE have seen their higher market valuations as a once-in-a-lifetime chance for a European shopping trip.CME’s initial push to meet Deutsche Börse pre-dated the announcement of ICE’s planned purchase of NYSE Euronext in December, although both US groups clearly had the similar M&A thoughts at around the same time.A return to a more “normal” economic environment, with rising interest rates, would result in rising volumes in fixed income derivatives trading. Deutsche Börse’s Eurex and NYSE’s Liffe would be clear beneficiaries of that trend, whenever that will be.But beyond that, investors hoping this deal will be the next “mega-merger” for the industry may be disappointed. Putting the two together would create a powerhouse in derivatives trading that may make approval from European antitrust authorities a very difficult proposition.On the face of it, there should be few issues. The CME, since it took control of Chicago Board of Trade in 2008, has an overwhelmingly dominant position in the US market. Eurex is one of two main futures exchanges in Europe and has little in the way of business in the US.CME’s flagship product is eurodollar futures while Eurex’s main products are the Bund, Bobl and Schatz German bond futures. But a combination comes with other issues. CME would be buying a cash equities business, and it really has no interest in that asset class. Furthermore, Deutsche Börse’s US business, International Securities Exchange, is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees the CME, and many argue the CME has (largely) had its way on key issues. Would the SEC be so friendly?Furthermore, CME recently gained approval in Europe to clear interest rate swaps, providing the market with three-way competition with Eurex and LCH.Clearnet in the newly emerging market as global rules push more OTC interest rate swaps on to exchanges.European legislation, enshrined in the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), has mandated greater competition in OTC derivatives clearing. A reduction of choice in the market could be a tough sell, even if both parties lag far behind market leader LCH.Clearnet.The German contingent could find it especially tough given it had been part of the lobby that successfully managed to argue that the scope of Emir should not be extended beyond OTC derivatives to listed products. The two products were very different, it argued. Would the exchange now argue they were similar and in fierce competition?Political considerations in Germany, in the shape of job losses, will also play a part.One senses Deutsche Börse understood all this. It would help explain its reticence for going back to Brussels for another fight. For observers outside Europe, it is sometimes worth stressing once again the depth of disappointment the exchange felt when the deal was blocked.Shareholders who have watched the NYSE deal fall apart and the German group write off significant value of its $2.8bn acquisition of ISE might be forgiven for that sinking feeling if presented with “another transatlantic deal”.The more interesting question is why, when faced with all these obstacles, CME wants to pursue it. They would not be the first exchange executives to have consistently misread the strength of regulator resistance to deals in recent years. A more likely explanation is twofold. Firstly, they feel Jeff Sprecher and IntercontinentalExchange coming up behind them if, as widely expected, the NYSE Euronext deal receives the necessary regulatory clearance.The second is that their options for growth in the US are hamstrung for the moment. The US justice department took a dim view of CME being granted approval by US regulators to buy CBOT, writing to the US Treasury that the deal may have inhibited competition. Unlikely to be granted further leeway, Europe seems a more enticing prospect for large-scale M&A.It may not be that easy.
270;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-02-25T18:51:18Z;Deutsche Börse: aisle be seeing you;CME’s interest in DB lifts sector’s mating game to a new level;Spring is just around the corner and the marriage season is picking up. Not that exchanges have been altar-shy recently: the London Stock Exchange/LCH.Clearnet tie-up is in its final stages, while the $8bn bid for NYSE Euronext from the IntercontinentalExchange is grinding through the approval process.Interest by the CME in Germany’s Deutsche Börse, though, lifts the sector’s perennial mating game to a new level. By contracts traded, these are the largest derivatives exchanges in the US and Europe respectively. Combined, they would outstrip ICE-NYSE by a factor of 2:1 on that front. Sadly for investors, though, regulatory scrutiny would be inevitable – not least because of chunky interest rate business at both. The extent of synergies is also debatable. Given that DB’s own play for NYSE was thwarted by antitrust concerns, its caution about even entering talks – a denial was issued on Monday – makes some sense.Still, a 10 per cent fillip in DB’s share price on mere speculation does highlight the need for some sort of tonic in Frankfurt. With economic uncertainty dampening trading activity and interest rates low, DB’s revenues fell almost 7 per cent, to €2.2bn, in 2012. It is hard to see that changing much in 2013. Fixed interest derivatives volumes looked better in January, but consensus estimates are still for a further, smaller dip this year. True, DB pledges cost-savings which could reach €70m by 2016. But these will ramp up over four years: a more modest sum, perhaps around €20m, seems likely this year.That leaves DB’s shares trading on 13 times 2013 consensus earnings. That is not demanding. But legislative uncertainties – from the potential financial transaction tax impact to a clampdown on high-frequency trading – still loom. So if suitors or partners are discounted, it could be a long, lonely slog ahead.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
271;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-02-15T13:14:38Z;US set to lose cotton pricing primacy under review;;The US stands to lose its crown as king of world cotton pricing as negotiations over a world futures contract for the commodity take on new urgency.A world contract if agreed would overturn a decades-old system of allowing only cotton grown in the US to settle benchmark futures used by farmers, merchants and money managers around the globe.Traders blame a lack of deliverable supplies for price swings that recently stung companies such as Glencore.Industry groups have revived talks in the past month aimed at an alternative: boosting supplies by adding reliable exporters such as Australia and Brazil to the list of eligible cotton origins and potentially making bales deliverable at ports in south-east Asia.Futures are contracts that require delivery of a commodity by a certain date.Most futures are liquidated beforehand but a small amount of deliveries establish a firm link between financial contracts and the physical markets they track.Expiring futures have surged in the past two years as merchants scrambled to find domestic bales that met the standards of IntercontinentalExchange’s New York futures market.US farmers grew 14 per cent of the global crop in 2012.That share may shrink further as US farmers plan to plant 27 per cent fewer acres with cotton this spring in a shift to high-priced soyabeans and corn, the National Cotton Council estimates.“These things create discussion about a world contract,” said Bill May, chief executive of the American Cotton Shippers Association. “Who knows what cotton acreage is going to be in the US when you continue to have grain prices where they are today?”In January, shippers reconvened a committee dedicated to a world futures contract for the first time since talks stalled last summer, Mr May said.Its board, which includes top international merchants such as Cargill, Noble and Louis Dreyfus Commodities’ Allenberg Cotton, also addressed it at a meeting late last month.Meanwhile, a new taskforce of the Liverpool-based International Cotton Association “unanimously agreed that the trade needed a world cotton contract” at its first meeting on January 28, ICA said.However, the question of whether to set futures prices at the point of origin, such as Australia, or destinations such as Asia, generated “strong opinions,” minutes of the meeting showed. An origin contract prevailed in an 8-7 vote.The ICE exchange said: “We have been, and continue to be, in discussions with market participants on an international contract, but no decisions have been made.”Separately, a rule filing disclosed that cotton and other commodities traders on the ICE trading floor will move to NYSE Euronext’s nearby New York Stock Exchange floor this year.ICE is completing a $8.2bn takeover of NYSE but said its lease for the space was not contingent on the deal.
272;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-02-11T19:02:06Z;Nasdaq held buyout talks with Carlyle;;Nasdaq OMX held early-stage talks with buyout firm Carlyle Group last month about leaving the public markets but they fell apart over a failure to agree a valuation for the stock exchange operator.The discussions, which came weeks after its main rival NYSE Euronext was acquired for $8.2bn, are no longer taking place, according to one person familiar with the talks.Adena Friedman, who was chief financial officer of Nasdaq before taking up the same role at Carlyle in 2011, introduced her former employers to the technology investment team at Carlyle. “They got to step three in a 100-step process,” added the person.Shares in Nasdaq jumped as much as 9 per cent in midday trading on Monday, reaching a 52-week high, as investors reacted to the reports, which were first reported by Fox Business Network. They later eased for a gain of 3.1 per cent on the day.Carlyle Group, which is listed on Nasdaq following its initial public offering last May, declined to comment while Nasdaq said it did not comment on market rumours.“You look at it because it is there and probably cheap,” said the head of private equity at one big buyout group. “There’s been a big cyclical decline in trading volumes and initial public offerings. The bet would be on a cyclical rebound, but increasingly exchanges are being disintermediated by dark pools and ETF platforms, and fees are under pressure.”News of the talks comes two months after IntercontinentalExchange announced plans to acquire the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange.Nasdaq shares have risen a fifth since the ICE-NYSE deal was announced. However, Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, said after the NYSE Euronext takeover that the deal had not fundamentally changed the outlook for his business.That deal came as a surprise to Nasdaq, which only a year earlier had a hostile bid with ICE to acquire and break up NYSE Euronext, but abandoned the deal after US competition regulators threatened to sue to block the deal.In the time since, the exchange operator has sought to expand beyond a reliance on transactions, moving closer to an information and technology services company. Most recently, Nasdaq acquired the investor and public relations services unit of Thomson Reuters for $390m.Ms Friedman, who also was head of strategy at Nasdaq, played a leading role in the company’s $3.7bn acquisition in 2008 for OMX, the Scandinavian exchanges operator, according to a person familiar. The combined company’s capitalisation is just over $5bn.“We think private equity would potentially be very interested in a Nasdaq buyout given its strong cash flow characteristics and diversification away from trading,” said Chris Harris, exchange analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.“For its part, we think Nasdaq is likely frustrated with its valuation with the stock trading well below other exchange peers and financial technology companies.”
273;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-02-07T22:48:12Z;Brazil approves ICE electronic platform;;Brazilian regulators have approved IntercontinentalExchange’s plans to create an electronic bond-trading platform in Brazil as the US-based group looks to tap growing demand for corporate debt in the Latin American country.ICE said on Thursday it expected to launch the platform it developed with the Brazilian clearing house, Cetip, on February 25 this year. The Cetip Trader platform would give traders access to voice confirmation, electronic trading and historical data in a single platform, ICE said.Moves by Brazil’s central bank to bring the benchmark interest rate down to a record low, combined with efforts to stimulate long-term borrowing, are expected to boost demand for corporate securities in the coming years.However, ICE said the platform could also be used to trade other products in the future. “While the platform was initially developed for corporate and government bonds, its flexible architecture is adaptable for new products as driven by market demand,” it said in a statement.ICE said it had tested Cetip Trader on about 80 institutions, carrying out more than 100,000 mock trades, before Brazil’s securities regulator, the CVM, gave it final approval on Thursday.ICE made its first big move into Brazil in April 2011 when it teamed up with billionaire Eike Batista to create an electronic marketplace for power contracts.The world’s biggest bourses, which are fighting for pole position in a turbulent industry, have increasingly looked to emerging markets to get ahead of their competitors.Several global exchange operators have tried to open equity platforms in Brazil, with less success. Direct Edge, BATS Global Markets and NYSE Euronext have announced plans that have so far failed to reach fruition.BM&FBovespa, Brazil’s exchange operator with a near-monopoly over the market, has been reluctant to open its clearing house to rival equity platforms.
274;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;ICE attacks ‘absurd’ US market practices;;IntercontinentalExchange hopes to use its planned $8.2bn purchase of NYSE Euronext to reform some of the “patently absurd” practices on US equity markets, chief executive Jeff Sprecher said on Wednesday.Mr Sprecher said the “pendulum has swung too far” in the wake of some of the reforms that have reshaped US equity markets in recent years.Critics say legislation has contributed to a growing catalogue of missteps in US equities trading, from the flash crash of 2010, errant algorithms at Knight Capital, and glitches involving the listing of Facebook, one of the world’s highest-profile companies.“I’m hoping that attention [surrounding the transaction] will increase the pulpit that both we and the New York Stock Exchange have to make comments about how the market structure can be improved,” he said on an analyst call as the company reported results above Wall Street’s expectations.“The market itself needs to come up with solutions that it can take back to market participants and to regulators in a collaborative way,” said Mr Sprecher. Some practices, such as rebates offered to market participants by some trading venues, were “patently absurd” and “destructive” to shareholders.He made the comments as ICE reported a rise in fourth-quarter net income as it escaped the worst of the effects of weak global trading activity.The securities industry – including exchange operators, which make commissions on trades – was hit by a fall in trading activity last year. Amid the downturn, ICE has managed the slowdown better than rivals.While ICE reported a slight drop in average daily volume in the quarter that ended in December, its full-year trading levels grew nearly 10 per cent to 2.72m led by double-digit growth in its Brent and energy products. That compares with a 15 per cent drop in average daily volumes at rival CME Group.Overall, ICE reported fourth-quarter diluted earnings of $129.5m, or $1.76 a share, compared with $126.8m, or $1.73 a share, during the same period last year. Excluding transaction costs such as those for the NYSE deal, the company reported earnings of $135.1m, or $1.84 a share.Revenues fell 1 per cent year on year to $323m. Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of $1.75 cents a share on revenues of $322.1m.On Tuesday, as it announced fourth-quarter results, NYSE said it would cut more costs ahead of the planned sale, which should close in the second half of the year. The deal will create a rival to CME Group and Deutsche Börse as one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges by contracts traded.NYSE has also agreed to move clearing of contracts traded on its Liffe derivatives exchange to ICE’s London-based clearing house, rather than build its own operations.“Jeff Sprecher is a credible voice in the exchange market place and will bring a fresh look to equity market structure,” said Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.For equity exchanges, the lower volumes come as the percentage of trading activity at private off-exchange venues rises.ICE shares rose 1.2 per cent to $145.22 in New York on Wednesday.
275;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Weak trading activity hits CME earnings;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, said it was hopeful for a boost in trading activity in 2013 after low volumes hit earnings last year.“We remain cautiously optimistic about the trading environment,” said Phupinder Gill, chief executive, as the company announced fourth-quarter earnings.Lower trading activity took its toll on exchange operators and the wider securities industry last year, leaving companies searching for new sources of revenue.New clearing mandates that are part of Dodd-Frank legislation that was passed in response to the financial crisis may benefit CME, which is one of the biggest global clearing houses, Mr Gill said on an analyst call.The mandates, while will be phased in from March, will move more of the vast over-the-counter derivatives market on to exchanges and through clearing houses similar to CME’s.In the fourth quarter, CME reported earnings of $166.8m, or 50 cents a share, compared with a split-adjusted $746.7m, or $2.25 per share, during the same period last year. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were inflated by a $377m tax benefit. Last May, the company announced a 5-for-1 stock split.Wall Street analysts had expected fourth-quarter earnings of 63 cents per share. Revenues in the quarter fell 11 per cent year on year to $660.9m, against analysts’ expectations of $660.1m.“Despite facing a difficult environment with low volatility in 2012, we made significant progress in advancing our global strategy while preparing for the changing regulatory landscape,” said Terry Duffy, executive chairman, in a statement accompanying the results.Average daily contract volume in the three months to December fell roughly 13 per cent to 10.2m compared with the same period a year ago. For the full year, volumes fell 15 per cent to 11.4m.Last month Mr Duffy told the Financial Times that any increase in volumes this year would depend on whether “we stop trading government fundamentals and start trading corporate fundamentals”.“I don’t think we’ve been able to do that for a number of years because of the euro crisis, the US debt crisis, the debt ceiling and the fiscal cliff,” Mr Duffy said.He said CME’s recent acquisitions, including the Kansas City Board of Trade, meant the company remained competitive in the face of IntercontinentalExchange’s $8.2bn acquisition of NYSE Euronext, which is awaiting regulatory approval. He said he was unsure if that deal would spur further consolidation in 2013.People familiar with the situation said the CME had expressed interest in parts of NYSE’s derivatives business, before NYSE agreed to ICE’s bid.On Monday, the CME said it would move wheat futures pits to Chicago from Kansas City, ending 157 years of floor trading there.At the end of the fourth quarter, CME paid an annual variable dividend of $1.30. The timing was advanced in order to avoid any possible tax increases on dividends.CME reported full-year diluted earnings of $2.71 per share on revenues of $2.91bn, against $5.43 per share on $3.28bn in revenues during 2011.Its shares fell nearly 2 per cent to $58 in after-market trading.
276;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Exchange groups ramp up cost cutting;;Two of the world’s largest exchange groups have stepped up cost cutting in a sign of the pressure on bourses from low trading volumes.NYSE Euronext, the transatlantic exchanges operator, said on Tuesday it would cut more costs ahead of its planned $8.2bn sale to US rival IntercontinentalExchange, slated for this year. It said an extensive cost reduction programme was far ahead of targets, with $115m last year compared with a forecast of $63m.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE, said: “The lacklustre trading environment continues to impact our results.” He said it was too soon to tell if a pick-up in trading for US equities in January, which has been accompanied by inflows into mutual funds, would continue.“While one month doesn’t make a trend, we’re hopeful that this is an indicator of the re-emergence of the retail investor and the resurgence of interest in the US equity markets,” he said.Deutsche Börse, whose planned merger with NYSE was blocked by the EU last year, said preliminary annual net revenues fell 9 per cent to €1.9bn and outlined plans to reduce costs by €70m annually through voluntary redundancies and other cuts.The steps would help it grow in Asia and other emerging markets, Deutsche Börse said.The results come as the US exchange prepares to take a planned deal with US rival ICE, predominantly a commodity and derivatives exchange, to antitrust authorities in the US and Europe.The cash-and-shares deal, in which the 12-year-old ICE will purchase the 220-year-old owner of the New York Stock Exchange, will create a rival to CME Group and Deutsche Börse as one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges by contracts traded.NYSE said revenues for the three months to December 2012 fell 11 per cent to $562m while net income for the period fell from $110m to $28m year on year as it took charges for writing off investments in its European clearing house, unwinding its stake in BlueNext, the carbon-trading exchange, and other merger expenses.“Our fourth-quarter results reflect both the beneficial actions we took to refinance our debt and rationalise our clearing plans for Liffe in connection with the announced move to ICE Clear,” said Mr Niederauer.Alongside the ICE deal in December, NYSE agreed to move clearing of contracts traded on its Liffe derivatives exchange to ICE’s London-based clearing house, rather than build its own operations.The move will allow NYSE to compete for business as new rules around derivatives markets come into force over the next 18 months. Bourses are looking to exploit a push by global regulators to move more of the vast over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market on to exchanges and through clearing houses.Exchanges will be able to earn profits from managing the risk on open-ended derivatives contracts. NYSE was planning to spend $20m on its European clearing operations last year.Deutsche Börse said operating costs would rise overall because of greater investment. It said most of the costs of the efficiency measures would be between €90m and €120m, with the majority of the total to be incurred this year.Trading volumes in the German group’s cash equities business fell 18 per cent last year while derivatives volumes were down 23 per cent. Deutsche Börse said adjusted net income would be €660m, compared with €833m last year.Shares in NYSE rose 0.4 per cent to $35.01 in New York. Deutsche Börse gained 0.6 per cent to €48.26 in Frankfurt.
277;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;The OTC data conundrum;;One of the tenets of the G20 agreement in Pittsburgh in 2009, which is overhauling financial markets, is the development of trade repositories. This in turn raises the intriguing question of what becomes of all the data that will be generated by their introduction.These repositories will create a map of information for off-exchange derivatives trades around the world, allowing regulators to monitor trends in interest rates swaps, credit default swaps and currency swaps. Lack of information about the use of credit-based products in over-the-counter markets was blamed as one of the factors that led to the financial crisis.Companies such as CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation have regulatory approval in the US. Similar repositories are either planned or in the process of being established elsewhere, including Europe and Asia. The companies say that setting them up is a natural extension of the post-trade services, such as clearing, that they already perform for clients.Most of the concern to date has, rightly, centred on the potential fragmentation of the repositories around the world, which could make it harder for regulators and the industry to find an aggregated picture.But another interesting issue is the commercial potential of this data gold mine. After all, two of the exchanges that are building out trade repositories, CME and ICE, are for-profit companies with obligations to shareholders.We are only in the early stages of finding out how this trade-off between “public good” provision of sensitive data and its collection by a commercially minded business will play out.One example of how it might work is the UK’s Regulatory News Service. It distributes material corporate information – as mandated by law – on UK listed companies, such as earnings results, profits warnings and executive appointments, and is owned by the London Stock Exchange.Known to all as RNS, it is available free of charge on a variety of websites such as Investegate and the LSE site in real-time. As my colleague Bryce Elder on Alphaville documented this week, any threat to this free access is usually greeted with concern.Market insight: Instant market news and commentaryThe LSE is conducting a consultation into RNS. The areas it is studying include the number of professional consumers of RNS information, service levels, fee structures, regulation and product development. The results were due last summer but discussions with market participants are ongoing.There are fears about where the consultation is going. Bloomberg reported last May of user concerns that the LSE will start charging them to receive statements. Others ask why the LSE is trying to form a better profile of its users. After all, this is the world of web 2.0, they say. If you’re not paying for the content, you’re the product.We await the outcome of the consultation but the example of RNS throws up two points.First of all, it is not widely realised but competition to RNS was mandated to the provision of corporate news a decade ago. That also, in theory, broke up the market for critical market-moving information as the LSE began to compete with rivals such as Business Wire and PR Newswire.A decade on and it’s clear that fragmentation fears have been overblown. The market has a preference for one provider – RNS accounts for 70 per cent of regulatory announcements – but can live with a few others.The second point is that one of the spin-offs of this fragmentation was that it allowed the LSE and others to charge for distributing the news, even though the data are free to end users. So far that balance between users and corporate providers of the data seems equitable.The outcome of the LSE consultation, should there be any changes, may provide others with food for thought. To date, operators of trade repositories have said little about future developments, preoccupied with just getting them operational and approved by regulators. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation thinks data should not be a commercial entity. Both CME and ICE say any fees or charges will be equitable, uniform and non-discriminatory.The past few years have seen Facebook, LinkedIn and other web 2.0 companies redefining what can be done with data. Even supermarkets, with their brand loyalty cards, understand how to exploit consumer data and sell it back to us, in the form of targeted offers.But a word of warning to those optimistic that financial markets data may also provide a serious commercial opportunity. As even Facebook has repeatedly discovered, providers of your content tend to push back forcefully if you try to exploit them too much.
278;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2013-01-22T18:51:49Z;CME surveys grain traders on hours;;The biggest US futures exchange opened the door to shorter grain trading sessions amid discontent from some of the most important names in agribusiness.CME Group, which lists benchmark corn, soyabean and wheat contracts on its Chicago Board of Trade platform, on Tuesday began formally surveying producers and other traders to gauge views on near round-the-clock grain trading hours begun last year.In May the exchange operator lengthened its grain trading day to 21 hours from 17 after rival IntercontinentalExchange launched lookalike grain futures that tracked price moves in Chicago. The all-electronic ICE upset the established rhythms of agricultural markets by enabling trading 22 hours per day.The changes meant market-moving statistics from the US Department of Agriculture were now published in the middle of the trading session. The department this month started releasing the reports at noon instead of 8.30am Eastern time to hit markets when they were most active.The longer trading hours also drew fire from companies whose hedging forms the backbone of the futures market. An official at Louis Dreyfus Commodities told USDA that the release of crop statistics amid trading hours resulted in “extreme market volatility”.Alberto Weisser, chief executive of Bunge, told Reuters last year that 21-hour trading was “too much”.“We’ve received significant customer feedback about the extended hours we implemented for CBOT grains last summer,” said Tim Andriesen, CME managing director of agricultural commodities and alternative investments. “As we start a new year, we think the timing is right to review those changes and industry feedback more formally to ensure we’re continually meeting our customers’ needs.”The threat from ICE appears to have receded. The exchange had 799 open corn futures contracts last week. More than 1m such contracts are open on CME.“We’ve been consistent in the past that the decision to expand hours was for competitive reasons, and that we would retain those hours as long as we needed to from a competitive standpoint. We do take customer feedback seriously,” CME said.CME said it would speak to traders through conversations, focus groups and an online survey open through January 31.The National Grain and Feed Association, a group of US grain handlers that previously sought a one-hour pause in trading around USDA report release times, said it looked forward to giving feedback.The CME announcement comes a week ahead of the annual meeting of the Commodity Markets Council, whose members include many of the largest physical commodities trading houses as well as CME and ICE.
279;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-12-24T11:36:58Z;LSE in cut-price clearing house deal;;The London Stock Exchange has agreed to buy LCH.Clearnet, the European clearing house, in a deal worth about €340m, shaving more than €100m off the original offer price.The LSE cut the price for an expected 60 per cent stake in the clearing house because of tough new European rules forcing clearing houses to hold more capital. The LSE had originally agreed to pay €463m.The revised offer means LSE will pay €15 a share, down about €5 on the deal agreed in April. The offer comprises €14 a share in cash payable on completion and €1 payable on September 30 2017, replacing a previously announced special dividend, the company said.The original terms offered €19 a share plus a €1 special dividend, for an implied value of €463m. The new offer implies a value of €341m, according to people familiar with the situation, and is based on an assumption of a €300m capital increase.The deal is due to be finalised in the first quarter of next year. It had originally been due to complete by the end of this year.The two groups said they had agreed to extend the date of the transaction until January 31 2013 to finalise detailed terms, although the deal may not be completed until later.The deal will give the LSE its own clearing house as global regulators push for greater use of such institutions to help safeguard the financial system.The bourse will be able to earn profits from fees charged for offsetting the risk in open-ended derivatives contracts, which often have multiyear durations.It will also allow the LSE to compete with rivals such as NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, which own their own clearing houses.LCH.Clearnet clears nearly half of the world’s $400tn global interest rate swap market and is the world’s second-largest clearer of bonds and repo transactions.The UK’s Office of Fair Trading cleared the deal earlier this month, removing one of the final regulatory obstacles to the takeover.Separately, LCH.Clearnet’s French business agreed a new long-term deal with NYSE Euronext for clearing European cash equities. Fees for clearing blue-chip stocks on the bourse, which includes the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon stock markets, will fall 20 per cent to €0.04 when the six-year deal begins on January 1.Most derivatives clearing in NYSE’s European business is set to move over to IntercontinentalExchange’s European clearing house as part of ICE’s $8.2bn takeover of NYSE Euronext, announced last week.
280;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-12-21T16:13:00Z;ICE sets $750m break fee on NYSE deal;;IntercontinentalExchange has agreed to pay NYSE Euronext a $750m break fee in the event the US derivatives market operator fails to gain antitrust approval for its $8.2bn takeover of the owner of the New York Stock Exchange.The two groups have also set out fees of $450m payable to the other party if one board were to change their recommendation in favour of the deal, a regulatory filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday showed.Both will pay a $300m break fee if they were to abandon the deal in favour of another proposal while, either ICE or NYSE will pay $100m if the other’s shareholders fail to approve the deal.The high break fees further underscore the difficulties rival exchanges would face in breaking up the deal as they digest the plan unveiled this week by ICE, founded 12 years ago, to acquire NYSE, its totemic 208-year-old rival. Neither ICE nor NYSE expect to meet significant opposition from competition watchdogs, arguing they compete in different asset classes in the market.In the most recent comparable exchange deal, NYSE agreed a break fee of $340m (€250m) with Deutsche Börse in their merger terms.Analysts expect few parties would have the financial capacity to challenge the deal. The purchase price, amounting to $33.12 per NYSE share in a mixture of cash and shares, was a 38 per cent premium to its closing share price on Thursday.Peter Lenardos, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that in tough markets the valuation of NYSE at 14.5 times next year’s consensus earnings forecast was “quite a high price for ICE to pay to gain meaningful access to European derivatives”.“However, we acknowledge that with regard to historical transaction multiples, the deal appears reasonably priced,” he said.The takeover also underlines how derivatives trading has become a global business since the financial crisis as investors turn to assets that can hedge risk.ICE would become the third-largest derivatives market operator in the world by the volume of contracts traded, allowing it to compete on a more even footing against Deutsche Börse and CME Group, the US-based market leader.Derivatives are highly lucrative for exchanges. That is in part because bourses are able to carve out dominant niches in a diverse market but they can also charge costs for offsetting the risk against open-ended contracts through clearing.Profits in equities trading, by contrast, are low-margin as fierce competition, underpinned by high-speed technology, has eroded exchanges’ market share.However Jeff Sprecher, founder and chief executive of ICE, has committed to keeping the US equities business of NYSE. The European equities businesses, which include Amsterdam, Paris, Lisbon and Brussels, may be spun off.The filing also revealed the corporate code words for the project. ICE was the “Braves” and NYSE the “Yankees” – references to the baseball teams of the bourses’ home cities, Atlanta and New York respectively.
281;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
282;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-12-20T23:19:45Z;ICE agrees NYSE Euronext takeover;;IntercontinentalExchange has agreed to buy NYSE Euronext, its 208-year-old rival, in an $8.2bn deal that will make the energy and commodities bourse one of the world’s largest derivatives markets operators.The transaction, announced on Thursday, marks the biggest gamble to date by Jeff Sprecher, ICE’s chief executive, who has long coveted NYSE Liffe, the European derivatives exchange owned by NYSE Euronext.Last year ICE and Nasdaq OMX jointly launched an $11.3bn hostile bid to acquire and break up NYSE Euronext, but abandoned the deal after US competition regulators threatened to sue to block the potential deal.ICE will keep the NYSE building on Wall Street but wants to hive-off Euronext’s cash equities businesses, which include the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. The company said it was exploring a listing of Euronext if market conditions allowed and European policy makers supported the offering.The deal will propel ICE, the 12-year-old exchange that has grown through offering trading in energy, emissions and commodities, into the trading of listed interest rate derivatives, the world’s largest asset class. It will also transform ICE into the third largest operator of futures exchanges, posing a threat to Deutsche Börse and CME Group, ICE’s long-time rival.“Markets have inherently changed in the face of the global financial crisis,” said Mr Sprecher. “While derivatives markets have become more global . . . many cash and equity markets have become more regional as major European financial institutions turned their focus to capital efficiency and regulatory reform.”ICE’s ambitious takeover comes ahead of a big shake-up of derivatives trading. In the wake of the financial crisis, global regulators want to push more of the off-exchange derivatives market on to transparent trading venues and have more deals processed through clearing houses. The changes are due to come into effect next year in the US and in about 18 months’ time in Europe.Under the terms of the deal, ICE has agreed to pay $33.12 per NYSE share in a mixture of cash and shares. The duo said they would have headquarters in Atlanta, where ICE is based, and New York.NYSE shareholders will have the option of either accepting $33.12 in cash per share, taking 0.2581 ICE common shares or a mix of $11.27 in cash plus 0.1703 ICE common shares, subject to a maximum cash consideration of approximately $2.7bn.Mr Sprecher will remain chief executive of the enlarged company while Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, will be chief executive of NYSE Group and president of the enlarged company.Mr Niederauer stands to receive more than $10m if the deal is successful, according to a company filing.Like all other incumbent exchanges, NYSE has seen its dominant market share and profits from stock trading eroded in recent years by rivals offering faster trading and cheaper prices. NYSE’s combined share trading platform accounts for only about a quarter of all US equity trading, forcing it to focus on European derivatives and IT outsourcing services.ICE was advised by Morgan Stanley, BMO Capital Markets, Broadhaven Capital Partners, JPMorgan, Lazard, Societe Generale and Wells Fargo, and received legal counsel from Sullivan & Cromwell and Shearman & Sterling.NYSE was advised by Perella Weinberg, BNP Paribas, Blackstone, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Moelis, and received legal counsel from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Stibbe N.V.
283;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-12-20T19:40:00Z;NYSE / ICE – if he can make it there;Sprecher will find New York exchange emblematic of the deal’s complexities;"What is Jeff Sprecher to do with the New York Stock Exchange? The boss of IntercontinentalExchange has just agreed to buy that venerable institution’s parent, NYSE Euronext, for $8.2bn. But cash equity trading is low margin, even if the NYSE brand makes a profitable listings business possible. The real attraction is NYSE’s Liffe European derivatives exchange. So ICE aims to spin off the Euronext equity exchange. Mr Sprecher might like to spin off the NYSE, too, but its status as a symbol of American capitalism will prevent him. So he is stuck with a business that, in six years, has gone from a near-monopoly in trading of NYSE-listed stocks to a 25 per cent share. Well, if floor trading should die out, Mr Sprecher can always sell the financial news channels footage of men in blue coats yelling and throwing paper.This is a small complication. But it is emblematic of the deal’s complexities. If the tie-up works as advertised, both sides will be happy. ICE has paid NYSE Euronext shareholders a 38 per cent premium – a total of $2.2bn – for a stock that has gone nowhere for four years. For ICE the $450m in annual synergies it expects, if realised, are easily worth $3bn or more.But if there is sufficiently small overlap between the businesses for antitrust regulators to allow it, where will the savings come from? ICE thinks NYSE Euronext could be run more tightly. There is some overlap: both companies have clearing businesses, which are costly to run. Mr Sprecher is betting that, because the two clearing units mostly clear different things (energy, commodities and emissions at ICE; interest rates and fixed income at NYSE), regulators will be sanguine. He may be right. And ICE has a strong track record of cost-cutting. But it is buying a dreadful chimera of a company, built out of at least five previously distinct parts.There is a long list of big cross-border stock exchange deals that have failed to create value. If Mr Sprecher keeps NYSE-ICE off that list, it will be a major achievement.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
284;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-12-20T12:46:40Z;ICE in talks to buy rival NYSE Euronext;;IntercontinentalExchange is closing in on a deal to buy its 208-year-old rival NYSE Euronext in a move that highlights the sweeping changes hitting exchanges and global markets.A deal could come as soon as Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter.NYSE shares gained more than 21 per cent in after-hours trading on Wednesday, giving it a market capitalisation of $5.9bn, following reports that it and ICE were engaged in negotiations.Shares in ICE, which is valued at $9.3bn, rose 3 per cent. Both NYSE and ICE declined to comment and shares in both groups were suspended ahead of an expected announcement later on Thursday.The move would push Atlanta-based ICE, best known as an energy trader, into trading listed interest rate derivatives – a market which exchanges hope to exploit when an overhaul of the derivatives market comes into force in the US next year.Global regulators want to push more of the over-the-counter derivatives market on to transparent trading venues like exchanges, with deals processed through clearing houses. Similar moves are expected to become mandatory in Europe in the next 18 months.Exchange operators such as ICE, NYSE and CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, are hoping to exploit the changes by offering listed products that mimic off-exchange assets, such as interest rate swaps. Many of the world’s largest exchanges also run clearing houses, which will move to the forefront of regulators’ efforts to safeguard the world’s financial system against systemic risk.The move would give ICE a vastly expanded presence in Europe and greater firepower to take on CME Group.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, has previously coveted NYSE Liffe, the European derivatives exchange, but was forced to abandon a bid for it in April last year. ICE had made a joint $11.3bn hostile bid with Nasdaq OMX to break up NYSE Euronext but US competition regulators threatened to sue to block the potential deal. The Department of Justice said that combining NYSE’s stock market operations with Nasdaq’s would have “substantially eliminated competition” in listings, trade reporting and other areas.ICE, which owns the Brent futures contract, has also set its sights on European expansion and already trades and clears energy and emissions contracts from London. Mr Sprecher this year failed with a bid for the London Metal Exchange, losing out to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.The latest proposed deal would also give him the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. NYSE Euronext is building up its clearing operations in London in anticipation of new rules for trading derivatives.In its own response to the root-and-branch changes in the derivatives markets, NYSE Euronext had aimed to merge with Deutsche Börse but the deal was blocked by European antitrust officials.The Wall Street Journal first reported news of talks between NYSE and ICE.
285;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-12-20T11:01:00Z;Quick View: ICE’s zest for Liffe;NYSE Euronext the target for latest exchange deal;If at first you don’t succeed…..Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of IntercontinentalExchange, is back on the acquisition trail, just months after his bid for the London Metal Exchange failed.Now the relentless dealmaker wants to buy NYSE Euronext, owner of the famous New York Stock Exchange. It could mean the end of more than 200 years of independence for the Big Board and no doubt that aspect will grab the lion’s share of attention.But stock trading is a low-margin, high volume business. Like all other incumbent exchanges, NYSE has seen its dominant market share and profits from stock trading vastly eroded in recent years by rivals offering faster trading and cheaper prices.Mr Sprecher has turned his start-up into a $9bn exchange through energy, emissions and commodities trading. In truth, equities trading holds little interest for him. The real prize in this bid is NYSE Liffe, the European derivatives exchange.The move by the G20 group of economies to push more of the off-exchange derivatives on to electronic trading venues is an important factor. Exchanges like ICE, NYSE and CME all see it as an opportunity to grab business from banks and interdealer brokers.But his itch for Liffe, despite his protestations to the contrary, really reflects a longer term desire to get into trading interest rate derivatives. Mr Sprecher tried in 2007 with a bid for the Chicago Board of Trade, famously delivering his offer during the industry’s biggest annual conference. Eventually outbid by the CME, he turned his attention to Europe, which has two principal derivatives exchanges – NYSE Liffe, based in London, and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex.Eurex is unattainable – it would mean buying the parent company and a feat probably beyond even Mr Sprecher’s boundless optimism. But NYSE Euronext is a different beast. Less unified that its German counterpart, it still has big operations in New York, London and Paris. Sometimes it has felt ill-integrated, a legacy of the mergers of Euronext and Liffe, and then of NYSE and Euronext.His first attempt to get Liffe was by teaming up with Nasdaq OMX to break up the planned NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse merger but that attempt foundered on resistance from US antitrust authorities. But that problem wasn’t with ICE. Regulators took a dim view of the prospect of NYSE and Nasdaq, the two largest US equities exchanges teaming up.Now he’s back on his own, as NYSE Euronext adapts to a world in which it is barred from merging with Deutsche Börse and struggles with 20-30 per cent drops in its key derivatives trading markets. ICE, too, has seen a slowdown in trading but ownership of the key assets like the Brent futures contract, has insulated it.Besides the prospect of ICE finally getting Liffe, it should also be remembered that NYSE Euronext has a growing and often under-appreciated commodities business of its own.But it also raises the intriguing prospect that some, or all, of the equities trading businesses in New York, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon could be hived off once the deal is completed. After all, it has never been part of Mr Sprecher’s empire.The exchange landscape has been dominated by mega-deals for the past decade as rivals look to new geographies or bulk up to ward off unwanted takeovers. But rarely are the questions asked: how many of these deals have been truly successful? How many of them have added value for shareholders and been truly integrated?With his persistence to get at Liffe, Mr Sprecher is effectively asking whether some of these assets are in the right hands. What we may be looking at here is not further consolidation, which the industry has seen for the past ten years, but rather a coming redistribution of the ownership of key assets.
286;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:41:20+0000;ICE Futures to restart daily carbon trading;;IntercontinentalExchange, the operator of Europe’s largest carbon trading platform, is to lift a near two-year shutdown of trading in daily emissions futures after regulators improved oversight.The US futures bourse operator will resume trading on December 10 in the two main daily futures contracts – the EU emissions allowance (EUA) and the United Nations-supervised carbon emission reduction (CER) futures contract.At the same time, ICE will also introduce a new daily futures contract as the European Union prepares to enter Phase III of its emissions trading scheme.The group said it had been reassured by a series of measures the European Commission has put in place this year to rebuild confidence in the €80bn market, the largest carbon trading scheme in the world.Investors’ trust in the fledgling market has been badly affected after a series of scandals, culminating in the alleged theft of emissions allowances worth up to €30m in early 2011.That shut down much of the daily futures markets, also known as the spot market, overnight. In the aftermath, the commission gave permission for five national registries to reopen after they satisfied tighter security requirements, but some exchange operators, including ICE, wanted to delay reopening while it was unclear exactly how many allowances had been stolen.While many other venues soon reopened, there has been no trading on ICE Futures Europe, which accounts for 90 per cent of the region’s emissions trading.“ICE Futures Europe wanted to ensure that all aspects of the single union registry were fully implemented prior to reopening the emissions daily futures market,” said David Peniket, president & chief operating officer at ICE Futures Europe.Last month the commission also introduced a single registry for the EU, which addressed one of the industry’s key concerns – the legal ownership of stolen permits that had crossed national borders. At the time the commission had no centralised procedure for the recovery of illegally transferred allowances.In spite of the shutdown, year to date volumes for longer dated ICE emissions futures and options products have risen 22 per cent to 8.15m contracts.As part of its plans to cut greenhouse gases, Brussels will reorganise its rules on carbon trading from January and sell most of its allowances instead of giving them away, as it has done since inception in 2005. ICE Futures won approval from UK regulators to be the UK’s recognised auction platform in April.The contract will last for an initial three years and is extendable for another two. It will cover part of the third phase of the ETS, from 2013-2020, and will allow the UK to sell emissions permits to the airline industry, power groups and manufacturers.www.ft.com/tradingroom
287;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-11-05T22:06:19Z;ICE gets UK approval for European CDS;;IntercontinentalExchange, the US futures exchange, has won UK regulatory approval to clear European sovereign credit default swaps as the industry prepares for wide-ranging reforms of the off-exchange derivatives market.ICE, is looking to clear the sovereign debt of Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Portugal through its London-based ICE Futures Europe unit from next year, according to a recent US regulatory filing.The group was the first exchange to offer clearing for corporate CDS – the over-the-counter derivatives widely blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis. It has long-eyed the sovereign market in Europe. On Monday, the group said the service would begin once it had received US regulatory clearance following the British green light.“In CDS, we’ve had European sovereigns approved by the FSA. We’re waiting the SEC approval right now,” Scott Hill, chief financial officer of ICE, told investors and analysts on an earnings conference call.“We have mandatory clearing starting in the first quarter of next year, with the buy side in the portfolio margining that’s critical to that offering. We expect to be approved by the SEC in the not too distant future,” he said.The push for more of the vast $650tn over-the-counter derivatives market to be processed through clearing houses and backed by collateral, or insurance, is part of a G20 mandate intended to safeguard the financial system. Rules are expected to come into force on both sides of the Atlantic in coming months.A clearing house stands between two parties, ensuring a trade is completed if one side defaults. Hitherto most OTC trades have been conducted privately and bilaterally.While broker-dealers have increasingly moved more swaps deals through clearing houses, the CDS market has remained an anomaly.According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a derivatives trade body, only about 10 per cent of a market with an adjusted annual average outstanding notional value of $30tn was centrally cleared last year.That’s in part as brokers have not pushed contracts on their own parent or the country in which its parent is based. CDS provide insurance against a default on bond payments and are used by investors to insure against risk and speculate on creditworthiness. Should the country default, the bank would then face making large payouts, increasing its own risk of default. ICE plans to denominate its dealings in US dollars and not eurosMr Hill’s comments came as ICE reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, mainly owing to a more favourable tax rate.For the period to September 30, net income fell to $131m from $132.6m a year ago. Turnover fell 5.2 per cent to $323m from $341m a year ago. Revenues from processing OTC derivatives such as CDS fell 16 per cent to $123m year-on-year.Weak trading in US and Canadian futures was offset by a 5 per cent rise in trading on ICE Futures Europe.The group’s US unit already processes sovereign debt trades of several Latin American countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela.
288;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-10-25T18:17:02Z;US swaps reform triggers futures rush;;Looming US rules for “over-the-counter” derivatives deals are starting to transform credit and energy markets as traders adjust to new strictures and costs.Tradeweb, the electronic fixed income trading platform, has seen a fourfold jump in US credit derivative index volume over the past week since barriers to trading between market participants were lowered.CME Group, the futures exchange and clearing company, has meanwhile seen volumes in energy derivatives traded over the counter shift sharply in favour of futures since making changes in mid-October. The contracts are essential to oil companies such as BP and Shell, banks and hedge funds that are the biggest participants in energy markets.The changes have taken place ahead of federal rules that require the registration of swap dealers, processing of standard derivatives at clearing houses and trading platforms called “swap execution facilities”. A more open and transparent OTC derivatives market is a key aim of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, but the swaps industry fears that futures are gaining ground.The Tradeweb trading platform, partly owned by big Wall Street dealers, has boosted volumes by allowing banks that provide live prices in credit default swap indices to not only transact with clients, such as hedge funds and institutional investors, but also with each other.Historically, the swap market has been strictly divided between the so-called interdealer and bank to client sectors. The move is seen as posing a challenge to interdealer brokers, who only negotiate swap trades between dealers.CME plans to trade a swaps futures contract next month with the support of four major banks, while IntercontinentalExchange is launching a CDX future next year.Tradeweb is allowing clients and dealers to access the same streaming bid and offer prices for US investment grade and high yield CDS indices on its platform.Lee Olesky, chief executive officer, said the company had “evolved the rules of engagement for Tradeweb’s marketplace to provide the best experience for all participants”.Large energy traders were worried new swap rules would qualify them as “swap dealers”, which under the new regulations face a raft of new oversight and costs.ICE responded by converting all its existing cleared energy swaps into futures on October 15. CME Group has given traders the option of making the same oil and gas trade as either a swaps contract, which in 2013 will carry the new regulatory burden, or as a futures contract.Exchange data show a large share of energy traders have shifted to futures since CME began listing the products on October 15. More than half the energy volumes on CME’s ClearPort over-the-counter platform are now executed as a block futures trade, up from about 13 per cent before the change.
289;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-10-17T17:26:56Z;CME buys Kansas City wheat exchange;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, acted to cement its dominance in grain futures markets on Wednesday with the purchase of the top US exchange for bread wheat.The US derivatives exchange, said it agreed to acquire the member-owned Kansas City Board of Trade for $126m in cash. The 156-year-old Kansas City exchange lists futures and options on hard red winter wheat, a variety grown in the US great plains and prized by bread bakers.CME, whose Chicago Board of Trade hosts flagship futures on soft red winter wheat, corn and soyabeans, faces new competition in the grain market from rival IntercontinentalExchange.For the Kansas City exchange’s 192 equity members, the purchase price represents a 37 per cent premium to the last recorded seat price of $480,000 but below peak prices of late 2007, according to exchange data. It will make a special distribution of excess cash to members after the deal closes.The Kansas City exchange in early spring formed a special committee to sound out potential buyers and received bids from “a number” of interested parties, said chairman Steven Campbell.Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, said of the purchase: “It’s not a defensive move. It’s a growth move for CME.”The deal leaves the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, the home of the hard red spring wheat futures contract and a fledgling contract in apple juice concentrate, as the lone independent US grain bourse. Mr Duffy declined to comment on prospects for a deal with Minneapolis.Futures traders are already accustomed to executing Kansas City wheat transactions on CME’s Globex electronic trading platform, which gets the bulk of futures volume. The New York Mercantile Exchange, an energy futures hub, also used Globex before it was bought by the CME in 2008.The majority of options on hard red winter wheat futures still trade on the Kansas City floor, which CME committed to keep open for at least six months.The deal comes as food commodities prices have surged in the wake of the worst US drought in half a century. In the quarter ended September 30, CME agricultural commodities volume rose 14 per cent on the same period in 2011, bucking declines in other product lines.Overall volumes have declined by 25 per cent in Kansas City so far this year.
290;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-10-15T11:12:14Z;ICE Link expands forex links with Traiana;;Two of the world’s largest trade processing platforms in the off-exchange derivatives market have agreed to exchange trading information as the derivatives industry races to fulfil regulations that will reshape its market.ICE Link, which confirms trades in credit default swaps, has agreed to interoperate its systems with those of Traiana, whose transaction processing business dominates the foreign exchange market.Their agreement to process over-the-counter (OTC) foreign exchange contracts via ICE Link brings together technology built up separately to cater for each asset class and highlights how the derivatives industry is forging new infrastructure to comply with reform of the market.G20 regulations have mandated that more of the vast $650tn OTC market be processed through central clearing. A clearing house stands between two parties, ensuring a trade is completed if one side defaults.Mandatory clearing is a significant departure for the CDS and forex derivatives sectors, which typically trade bilaterally and by telephone. That has meant the rapid construction of trading infrastructure and hubs that have hitherto not existed.It has spurred the growth in recent years of platforms such as Traiana, owned by interdealer broker ICAP, IntercontinentalExchange’s ICE Link and MarkitSERV, a joint venture between Markit and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.These platforms sit between institutional investors, derivatives exchanges such as ICE and CME Group, interdealer brokers and swap execution venues such as Bloomberg and TradeWeb, channelling trades to clearing houses and providing the IT connectivity.“We’re very keen that our buyside clients that want to clear OTC foreign exchange derivatives at ICE are able to do so in a very efficient way,” Clive de Ruig, global head of ICE Link, told FT Trading Room.“To do that you need to build a network like ICE Link has in credit, and those networks are not easy to build and take many years. Traiana are the pre-eminent network in forex so for both Traiana and us it made sense.”Foreign exchange and credit default swaps were the second and third-largest products traded on OTC markets in 2011, behind interest rate swaps, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements.However, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a derivatives trade body, estimated only about 10 per cent of a market with an adjusted annual average outstanding notional value of $30tn had been centrally cleared.Investors and banks have been keen to back the emergence of third-party hubs rather than add to their IT costs by creating links for trading and clearing for each off-exchange asset class.Jeff Gooch, chief executive of MarkitSERV, recently told FT Trading Room the group would begin a similar hub to make credit lines available to market participants by the end of the year.The ICE Link/Traiana move is the latest in a rapid spurt of development in foreign exchange derivatives.ICE and LCH.Clearnet announced plans to launch forex clearing services in March while Traiana has added EBS and Thomson Reuters, two of the world’s largest venues for trading foreign exchange, to its platform in recent weeks.MarkitSERV has signed a deal with Swift, the Belgian financial messaging group, to deliver forex derivatives to clearing houses.
291;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-10-09T16:05:24Z;Birley leaves NYSE Euronext after 3 months;;The new head of commercial operations at NYSE Euronext’s London-based clearing house has left his role after just three months as part of the shake-up at the transatlantic exchanges operator.Patrick Birley, the former London Stock Exchange and London Metal Exchange executive, was appointed in July as part of an effort to expand European clearing operations.The group is re-examining its long-term strategy after its bid to merge with Deutsche Börse was blocked by European Union regulators this year. Duncan Niederauer, chief executive, has put the emphasis on technology and plans to spend $85m on building up its derivatives clearing house in London. A string of executives have subsequently departed, including Garry Jones, global head of derivatives.Mr Birley left on Monday. His role will be subsumed into NYSE’s global sales operations, headed by Lee Hodgkinson, according to a sources close to the situation. NYSE Euronext declined to comment.NYSE’s focus on clearing comes as exchanges look to grab market share for derivatives clearing. The G20 countries have mandated that more over-the-counter derivatives be traded on electronic venues and processed through clearing houses, potentially opening up a market that had until now been dominated by banks.NYSE is building on its NYSE Liffe Clear operations while the London Stock Exchange is in the process of buying a controlling stake in LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French clearing house. NYSE Liffe is due to withdraw clearing of some of its derivatives products through LCH.Clearnet next June.Mr Birley was previously chief executive of the UK arm of LCH.Clearnet and chief executive of the European Climate Exchange, which was bought by IntercontinentalExchange in 2010. In 2010 he briefly advised the LSE on its post-trade strategy.Mr Birley also worked at the London Metal Exchange and helped develop the South African Futures Exchange, later sold to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
292;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-09-19T17:44:37Z;Investors refine bets on crude price gap;;Forget the sharp slide in oil prices. What’s really concentrating minds in oil markets is the huge sums at stake in a bet on the direction of Brent and WTI – the world’s most heavily traded crude benchmarks.Here the debate is about more than the prospect of rising Saudi oil output or a jump in US stock. It is not so much about the actual price of oil, but the huge differences in the cost of the two crude streams.For nearly two years oil extracted from the middle of the US and Canada has traded at steep discounts to oil delivered in ocean tankers as North American drillers pump more than pipelines can take to refineries.Now investors including Pimco and Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street bank with the biggest commodities business by revenues, say these discounts will narrow. Others including PBF Energy, a company chaired by refinery investor Tom O’Malley, and oil transport company Magellan Midstream Partners see the discounts lasting for years.This debate matters. At stake are hundreds of millions of dollars worth of trades and investments as well as fees for commodities exchange operators CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange.The discount is most visible in futures markets, where $92-a-barrel West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark crude, sells for $16 less than Brent, the North Sea benchmark. Changes in pipeline flows and the use of rail routes to carry crude produced inland to the coast have led to bets that the discount will diminish.Goldman argues that a recent change in direction of oil flow along the Seaway pipeline is draining 150,000 barrels a day from the glutted WTI delivery and pricing point of Cushing. The pipeline’s capacity is due to rise 400,000 b/d in 2013.New rail infrastructure will carry more barrels from inland fields, reconnecting Cushing with the waterborne market. This should in turn shrink the WTI discount to $4, or the Seaway tariff, says David Greely, Goldman’s head of energy research. The bank is recommending clients buy WTI and sell Brent for delivery next June.“In the second quarter of next year we think that spread has to come in pretty sharply,” says Mr Greely.Mihir Worah, who oversees a $30bn commodities portfolio at Pimco, says the fund has bought WTI and sold Brent futures for delivery in December 2013.“Late 2013 is when the physical oil offtake is going to grow dramatically. But clearly, if this becomes a certainty, which we expect, the market will start to narrow well before that,” Mr Worah says.The difference between the December 2013 contracts was $10.50 on Wednesday. “We think it should be trading $5 to $6,” Mr Worah says. There is a feeling, too, among traders that the glut at Cushing could soon ease.“Volume in WTI-Brent has been massive over the last few weeks. Many people anticipate the pipeline logjam is about to clear up,” says a dealer in swaps that track both oil benchmarks.The market has flashed false signals before. After hitting a record $28 last October, the spread contracted to $8 after Seaway’s owners announced the pipeline reversal, only to expand again. HollyFrontier, a central US refiner that has enjoyed fat profit margins largely thanks to stranded inland crude markets, believes the wide spread is here to stay as production keeps outpacing pipeline projects.“Our best guess is we are going to see it higher longer,” says Neale Hickerson, vice-president.Magellan is spending $375m to reverse a pipeline to carry 225,000 b/d from west Texas to coastal Houston and is contemplating another 278,000 b/d line in the same direction. Both projects would steer rising production away from Cushing.Mike Mears, chief executive, nevertheless says it will take years for pipeline capacity to shrink WTI’s discount to tariff levels. “The four-year, five-year timeframe is probably the right timeframe for that to happen,” he says.At its refinery in the east coast state of Delaware, PBF is investing $60m to build a rail terminal to offload more than 100,000 b/d from trains loaded in North Dakota and Canada. “We believe crude differentials are sustainable for the foreseeable future . . . it’s going to continue to be a volatile, disconnected, regionalised market,” says Neil Wizel, director at private equity firm First Reserve, which co-owns PBF.This week Brent has fallen faster than WTI, narrowing the spread by more than $1. But Mr Greely warns: “It’s a buy-and-hold trade. It could be a bumpy ride.”
293;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-09-16T15:52:22Z;ICE push into Europe with Dutch purchase;;IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) is preparing an aggressive push into European gas and power trading with the acquisition of a majority stake in a business demerged from APX-Endex, a Dutch energy exchange.The deal, to be announced on Monday, and for an undisclosed sum, will vastly expand the US energy exchange’s gas and power derivatives trading business in the region. It will also allow ICE begin spot trading of natural gas in the UK, Belgium and Holland for the first time. The group is looking to create a European benchmark that more accurately reflects the fundamentals of the market.The move comes as politicians explore a role for natural gas to meet national energy requirements instead of costly nuclear and low carbon electricity projects. It also marks ICE’s first move after it lost out to Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing in acquiring the London Metal Exchange, the commodities trading venue. ICE’s focus on energy trading has helped it increase profits this year while weak investor appetite has crimped earnings at rivals that mainly offer equity and fixed-income products.Trading volumes for natural gas in continental Europe have risen in recent years although the market remains less developed than the US. Benchmarks for natural gas in the region, such as the one based on the Dutch virtual hub TTF, have yet to develop the deep liquidity seen on the Henry Hub benchmark in the US. The deal for APX, an exchange, that trades only electronically, “represents a significant step in expanding ICE’s global commodity markets,” said David Peniket, chief operating office of ICE Futures Europe.As part of a restructuring to be announced on Monday, APX-Endex is expected to split off its derivatives and spot natural gas business. ICE will take a 79.1 per cent stake in a new company with the balance held by Gasunie, a European gas infrastructure company. The other APX assets will be moved into a power spot and clearing business.It will also give ICE an exchange licence in the Netherlands as well as the physical infrastructure for delivery. Last year APX recorded net income rose more than 30 per cent to €4.1m while revenues rose from €30m to €34m. The deal will be funded by ICE cash reserves. It is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013.ICE will be aiming for similar success with natural gas that it has in trading crude oil derivatives. Trading in the latter market has quadrupled in the last decade to more than 1m daily contracts, driven by high demand, a switch to electronic trading and an increasing use of derivatives. In 2001 ICE bought London’s International Petroleum Exchange and used it as a springboard for the Brent futures contract to become the world’s benchmark for crude oil trading, taking market share from rival CME Group, which own the US-based WTI contract. However, natural gas is priced differently for local markets.
294;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-09-06T10:28:28Z;CBOE looks to set up London base;;Trading of the world’s most popular volatility gauge is set move around the clock as part of wide-ranging expansion plans laid out by the Vix’s owner, the Chicago Board Options Exchange.The derivatives exchange is set to follow its larger Chicago rival CME Group and develop a London-based trading hub next year for its futures exchange.The move will triple the trading hours available for its popular Volatility index (Vix) futures contract, commonly known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”.Its decision illustrates how exchanges with extensive derivatives operations are looking to broaden their appeal to investors around the world keen to trade popular assets and products.Low appetite for trading is likely to crimp bourse profits this year.It also strengthens London’s role as a developing financial centre for derivatives trading as the industry prepares to comply with incoming global reform of the industry.G20 regulators want to move more over-the-counter derivatives trading on to electronic exchanges but market participants are concerned about being caught in regulatory jurisdictions they consider unfavourable.Consequently, exchanges are looking to offer customers a choice of location to trade and clear derivatives.“Around-the-clock hours for Vix index futures and a CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE) London hub offer the ultimate in flexibility,” Bill Brodsky, chief executive of CBOE, told the company’s risk management conference in Ireland.He added that Vix index futures would be the first contract traded on a CBOE Holdings exchange on a near 24-hour basis, five days a week, pending regulatory approval.“There’s definitely a need for access to US markets from people in London and Europe,” said Jack Boyle, senior director, financial futures and options execution, at Newedge in Chicago.“CBOE’s presence in the UK could broaden its exchange to a new set of users in Europe that prefer to trade on localised venues,” said Christopher Harris, an analyst at Wells Fargo. He added that the move could attract new users who prefer not to hold overnight positions.The CBOE’s focus on London adds to the growing list of US bourses using the UK capital as their principal base for overseas operations.CME Group last month applied for a derivatives exchange licence.NYSE Euronext, via its Liffe derivatives unit, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), and Nasdaq OMX have all also made the UK capital the headquarters for their European derivatives businesses.www.ft.com/tradingroom
295;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-09-05T21:01:57Z;CME leads exchanges lower as trades slow;;"Shares in US stock exchanges fell after CME Group reported official August trading volumes that pointed to a significant slowdown in activity both on a year-on-year and month-on-month basis.The largest US exchange by market capitalisation fell as much as 2.2 per cent while many of CME’s peers also came under pressure after reporting soft data.CME pared its losses in late afternoon activity to close even at $55.31.NYSE Euronext lost 0.2 per cent to $25.39 and IntercontinentalExchange was down 0.8 per cent to $135.54.Alex Kramm, exchanges analyst at UBS, said the sector was protected from further downward pressure because low trading volumes had been signposted in recent weeks.Mr Kramm also remained upbeat on CME despite lowering his forecast for the company’s third-quarter earnings.“We continue to look for multiple expansions as opportunities from OTC derivatives reform become more visible,” he told clients.Elsewhere, markets were flat as investors weighed Tuesday’s soft economic data from the US against newswire reports fleshing out details of a bond-buying programme that the European Central Bank is expected to unveil on Thursday.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower to 1,403.44 and the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 13,047.48.US analysts continued to stress the importance of ECB intervention for the US equity market. David Brown, the chief market strategist at Sabrient Systems, said continuing deterioration in the eurozone would not just weigh on global demand for the goods and services of US companies, but could also lead to the dollar strengthening against the euro, hurting exporters.Earnings growth for the S&P 500 index in the second quarter has been almost flat compared with the same period last year.With a significant majority of second-quarter results now in, analysts are forecasting year-on-year earnings growth of just 0.85 per cent, which would be the lowest growth rate since the third quarter of 2009.In a further sign of the vulnerability of US companies to weak global growth, shares in FedEx fell 2 per cent lower to $85.80 after the package delivery company sharply lowered quarterly earnings estimates on Tuesday, citing “weakness in the global economy”.Credit Suisse analysts lowered their price target and suggested clients should not buy the stock, even though FedEx has said it is planning a restructuring programme to boost profitability.“Restructuring efforts generally signal that the underlying business is deteriorating; thus, we prefer to wait on the sidelines for now,” Christopher Ceraso told Credit Suisse clients.FedEx is considered a bellwether for the global economy because of its role in shipping goods for companies, and other freight and delivery companies also lost ground.United Parcel Service, one of FedEx’s main rivals, lost 2.4 per cent to $71.94.Safeway shares climbed 4.3 per cent to $16.50 after the supermarket group said it would sell a minority stake in its Blackhawk Network Holding business via an initial public offering of shares.The pre-payment card business generates at least $100m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to Safeway.Jonathan Feeney, an analyst at Janney, said the Blackhawk business could be worth almost $1bn and would likely trade at a premium to industry peers because of its “niche” position in the industry.Shares in the education company DeVry climbed 5.2 per cent to $20.20 after it announced it would buy back up to $100m of shares.Advanced Micro Devices, a semiconductor manufacturer, fell 3.6 per cent to $3.51 after UBS analysts lowered their price target on the stock, arguing that the growth of tablets and ultrabook computers will hit sales of personal computers, which AMD supplies with processor chips.Goldman Sachs rose 3.3 per cent to $109.94, outperforming as financials in the S&P 500 index were generally flat.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.2 per cent to 3,069.27. Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the Nasdaq, declined 0.7 per cent as investors awaited the iPhone makers latest iterations of its popular mobile device.Shares in Facebook bounced 4.8 per cent to $18.58, having hit a fresh low of $17.55 on Tuesday. Investment bank Jefferies initiated coverage on the social network with a bullish outlook."
296;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;CME plans Europe derivatives exchange;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, has unveiled plans for a European derivatives market in a move that will pitch it into battle with Liffe and Eurex, the continent’s biggest derivatives trading bourses.The group, which dominates US futures trading via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, will file an application with UK regulators in coming days for a London-based bourse that would operate with its own management team.CME’s decision to launch an exchange in London will strengthen the city’s role as a financial centre. Rivals NYSE Euronext, via its Liffe derivatives unit, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), and Nasdaq OMX have all made the UK capital the headquarters for their European derivatives businesses. Frankfurt-based Eurex is owned by Deutsche Börse.CME’s decision also illustrates how expansion in Europe has become a priority for CME as exchanges look to grab emerging business in global derivatives trading and clearing.Group of 20 regulations such as the US Dodd-Frank act have mandated that more of the vast over-the-counter derivatives market be moved on to exchanges, and processed through clearing houses. Clearing houses stand between two parties in a trade, ensuring a deal is completed in the event of a default.The CME dominates US derivatives trading and takes 80 per cent of its revenues from North America. It has become increasingly constrained by regulators, however, and over the past 18 months has expanded significantly its London-based staff. Employee numbers have doubled in three years to more than 150 as it opened a clearing house.A successful application would be only the sixth Recognised Investment Exchange licence granted by the Financial Services Authority.The CME intends to begin trading by mid-2013 with foreign exchange futures but will expand into other products. The business, to be called CME Europe, will be headed by Robert Ray, currently managing director, products and services, at CME. It will also use CME’s electronic trading platform Globex, and CME Clearing Europe for clearing.Phupinder Gill, chief executive of CME, said: “Our application to establish an exchange in Europe fits within our strategy to grow organically and is an important next step to meet the growing regional demand from our customers.”The decision to open its own derivatives exchange follows CME’s failed bid to buy the London Metal Exchange this year. It faces a battle in its new target market, however. Liffe and Eurex, account for virtually all of trading in derivatives in Europe. Their parent companies unsuccessfully tried to argue to European antitrust authorities that CME was their main competitor when they tried to merge earlier this year. Officials blocked the merger in February.Liffe also competes with the CME for customers wanting to trade dollar-denominated futures products at the short end of the yield curve.Nasdaq OMX announced plans in June for a European derivatives trading business while NYSE Euronext said in March it would expand its Liffe business following the failure of its merger with Deutsche Börse. ICE Futures Europe is strong in the trading of commodity and emissions futures, such as the Brent oil contract.
297;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-08-14T17:49:56Z;MGEX develops thirst for apple juice;;The Duke brothers, the villains trying to squeeze the orange juice market in the Hollywood comedy Trading Places, have a new potential target: apple juice.Nearly half a century after the launch of the original frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) futures contract, the Minneapolis Grain Exchange has this week started trading the first derivatives on apple juice, in a move that could bring modern-day risk management techniques to the conservative apple juice industry.“It is great to see market participants finally having the opportunity to utilise this new risk management tool,” Mark G. Bagan, MGEX president and chief executive, said in a statement on Monday.“MGEX is pleased the operational foundation for the AJC contract was proven successful,” he added.The 131-old MGEX, home of the benchmark contract for high quality spring wheat, launched futures and options on apple juice concentrates, or AJC, after years of discussions with industry participants and US regulators.The launch of apple juice derivatives comes on the back of the success of the FCOJ contract, born in 1966 at the New York Cotton Exchange. The exchange later became the New York Board of Trade until it was acquired in 2006 by the Atlanta-based InterContinental Exchange, which continues FCOJ trading.Apple juice is a $3.2bn global industry led by Chinese producers, according to estimates published by the Minneapolis exchange. The US and European Union are among the largest consumers of apple juice products.China’s prominent role in the apple juice trade is remarkable, considering that its juice industry barely existed until the early 1990s, according to a study by the US Department of Agriculture. “The industry emerged after market reforms in the 1980s encouraged Chinese farmers to diversify their incomes by planting apples and other horticultural crops,” the study said.The expansion of the Chinese industry is starting to find its limits, however. “The supply of apples as raw materials for juice, which once seemed limitless, has tightened. Now that the industry consumes as much as a fourth of China’s apple crop, juice processors sometimes bid against each other to procure apples. The result has been upward pressure on prices,” the study added.The apple juice contract saw little trading on its launch on Monday or on Tuesday, with initial prices for futures for delivery in November at $9.25 per gallon, according to Bloomberg data.The AJC futures contract is for delivery of concentrate from any country of origin to facilities along the US mainland coast. Among other specifications released by the MGEX, the deliveries’ flavour should be “characteristic of ripe, mature apples with no off-flavours or aromas”.
298;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-08-12T18:18:37Z;Two-year battle for TMX Group ends;;The two-year battle for the future of TMX Group, Canada’s largest exchange operator, has ended with an overwhelming majority of its shareholders favouring a scheme that will create a big bourse in North America.TMX Group said late on Friday that 95 per cent of its shares had been tendered for an offer by Maple Acquisition Corp, a consortium of a dozen Canadian banks and pension funds, to acquire up to 80 per cent of TMX at C$50 a share, in a deal that valued TMX at $3.8bn.The deal will create a potential rival to some of the largest exchanges in the US, such as NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX. Tom Kloet, chief executive of TMX, has already spoken of aggressive expansion plans once the deal is completed, including potentially creating a US platform aimed at small and medium-sized businesses, based on the success of the Canadian Venture Index.TMX has also declined to comment on reports it is in talks to buy Direct Edge, the fourth-largest stock exchange in the US, once the Maple deal is completed.Maple’s successful bid also marks a rare success for an industry that has seen potential large-scale mergers scuppered by regulators or insufficient shareholder backing. Deutsche Börse, NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX, IntercontinentalExchange and the London Stock Exchange are among those to have plans thwarted.As part of the deal TMX will also take control of Alpha Group, Canada’s largest independent electronic trading platform, and the country’s main securities clearing house.The addition of a clearing house will give TMX a so-called “vertical silo”, by which an exchange owns both the trading platform and the clearing house that processes the trades. That model gives exchange operators the power to lock out competitors and keep lucrative contracts and revenue in-house.TMX also has an eye on grabbing a share of the emerging global market for trading and clearing of derivatives, as G20 countries fulfil a mandate to move more of the vast but opaque over-the-counter derivatives market on to electronic trading platforms, and process trades through clearing houses.Banks have been concerned the mandate will require more collateral to trade. In common with rivals, TMX has been developing “single pot margining”, which would allow market participants to offset the margins needed for trading assets such as futures, cash equities, repo and swaps in a “single pot”. However, the move is in part dependent on global regulators recognising the jurisdiction of their Canadian counterparts.TMX’s future has been uncertain for nearly two years. Maple’s interest helped scupper an agreed merger between TMX and the LSE last summer, and TMX subsequently admitted it had been in talks with a third, unnamed, party for nearly a year before the LSE deal.National and provincial regulators approved the deal a month ago, leaving Maple requiring approval for a minimum of 70 per cent of shareholders. The TMX shares that were not acquired by Maple will be exchanged for shares of Maple on a one-for-one basis.www.ft.com/tradingroom
299;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-07-31T16:08:04Z;ICE shifts OTC energy swaps to futures;;Intercontinental Exchange, the transatlantic exchange and clearing house operator, will convert all its cleared over-the-counter energy contracts into futures as the company responds to greater post-financial crisis regulation.The development is one of the biggest signs that some OTC markets could shift over to the listed futures markets – where there are fewer concerns about counterparty risk and where trading costs are cheaper.It could be followed by similar moves from other exchange operators that clear swaps, such as CME Group.The move will benefit ICE, since it will force traders to use its proprietary listed products, rather than giving them the freedom to clear their swap contracts at any clearing house, as new rules stipulate.It could be detrimental to the banking sector, which has historically benefited from selling customised swaps to a range of customers seeking to hedge their risks in the market.Although some customers may continue to use bespoke swaps, many could follow a similar strategy using standardised futures.ICE currently clears energy swaps such as crude and refined oil, natural gas, electric power and natural gas liquids.The company said that, from January, all North American natural gas, electric power, environmental products and natural gas liquids swaps will be listed on its US futures exchange while oil products, freight and iron-ore swaps will be listed on its London exchange.The move comes ahead of regulatory reforms that are likely to take effect by next year in the US.The new rules, which are aimed at making the $650tn swaps market more transparent, demand that most swaps be cleared.However, the new regulations will also make it more expensive to trade swaps because margin requirements will be higher than for listed futures contracts. Similar rules are being drafted in Europe and Asia.If traders continue to use swaps in the same way, they will have to put up some $2,000bn in collateral under the new rules, according to a report by the Tabb Group, a research organsation.Three-fifths of respondents to the survey said they would consider using futures instead of swaps if the rules made the latter much more costly.ICE said it was responding to the higher costs swaps traders will incur under the new regime.“Based upon our extensive analysis of new swap rules and consultations with a wide variety of customers, we believe that these policies will increase the cost and complexity for swaps market participants, both in absolute terms and relative to that of futures market participants,” said Chuck Vice, ICE president and chief operating officer.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst at Raymond James Equity Research, said ICE’s initiative reflected the similarity between traditional futures markets and increasingly standardised OTC markets, where contracts are moving to a centrally traded and cleared model.“The move is being billed as a response to increased regulations of the OTC derivatives market … but we believe the transition makes sense regardless as there is little difference between cleared OTC products and futures contracts trading on ICE Futures Europe,” Mr O’Shaughnessy said.
300;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-07-26T20:14:11Z;ICE to close New York trading floor;;The ICE Futures US exchange plans to bring the curtain down on an era in New York commodities markets by ending open-outcry trading on its floor this year.The bourse, formerly the New York Board of Trade, is the main venue for US futures and options on cocoa, coffee, cotton, orange juice and sugar. A predecessor was the scene of the frenzied climax to the 1983 film Trading Places.IntercontinentalExchange, which bought the exchange in 2007, said yesterday that from October 22 all options listed on ICE Futures US will trade exclusively through its electronic trading system.The decision is the latest chapter in the decline of open-outcry futures markets, where traders gesture and shout across pits to trade.ICE shifted all futures trading to computers more than four years ago but allowed the floor to remain as a venue for options on futures.Options, which give the holder the right to buy or sell futures contracts at a set price before a fixed date, have been seen as too complex to trade on computers alone. Traders have flocked to screens in the past year, however. The share of electronically executed options volumes rose from 10 per cent in April 2011 to more than 75 per cent on ICE.Ben Jackson, ICE Futures US president , said: “The rapid adoption of electronic trading by options market participants is strong validation of the capabilities ICE has built into its electronic trading platform.”In January, ICE imposed a $6,000 annual access and usage fee on floor traders who failed to meet volume targets. About 100 floor traders remain today, down from 150 a year ago and 330 when ICE ended floor-based futures trading in March 2008.“I don’t see how the floor closing better serves the customer or the merchant that uses options products,” said Thomas Butler, a cotton broker who chairs the ICE executive floor committee. “I feel it was a little bit premature, but inevitable.”The New York Board of Trade moved into the space in 2003, after the September 11 attacks destroyed its former home in the World Trade Center.ICE Futures US rents the space on the seventh floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange building from arch-rival CME Group under a lease that expires in June 2013.IntercontinentalExchange plans to move in 2013 to office space in Manhattan that was formerly occupied by collapsed futures broker MF Global, according to people briefed on its plans. An electronic “dealing room” will be available for brokers who need one, the exchange said.Just over a year ago extreme volatility in soft commodities lured some oil options traders to the ICE floor, whose history dates back to the New York Cotton Exchange, founded in 1870, and what later become the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. The two merged to form the New York Board of Trade in 1998.
301;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-07-25T21:33:21Z;LME members approve sale to HKEx;;Shareholders in the London Metal Exchange on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to sell the historic exchange to Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing for £1.4bn ($2.1bn).The sale is the latest move in a wave of consolidation that has swept the global exchanges industry.It marks the end of the LME’s 135-year history as a member-owned exchange – one of the last such in the world – which began in the 19th century when traders gathered in coffee houses in the City of London to deal in metals.It will catapult HKEx, whose focus has until now been almost exclusively on equity markets, into the global league of exchanges, challenging established players such as CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) for dominance in commodity futures.Charles Li, HKEx chief executive, said: “Our shared vision for global leadership in the commodities market will allow us to respectfully build on the proud heritage of this unique institution.”The £1.4bn bid was approved by 99.2 per cent of shareholders – largely the banks and brokers who use the exchange – voting at an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday, with an almost full turnout of 99.6 per cent.The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, conditional on approval from the UK’s Financial Services Authority, although Sir Brian Bender, LME chairman, said that so far “no red flags” had been raised.HKEx triumphed last month in a global bidding war for the LME as the industry’s heavyweights, including ICE, CME Group and NYSE Euronext, vied to buy the metals exchange.Mr Li has pledged not to move the LME from London and to keep its open-outcry trading floor, where dealers shout orders to one another – known as the “ring” – the last such in Europe.People familiar with the matter said the few dissenters at Wednesday’s vote were likely to be small industrial users of the LME. Gabriela Grillo, who represents such users on the LME’s board, voted against the idea of selling the exchange at a meeting last month, the people said.The sale will deliver a windfall to the banks and brokers who own the LME. At £1.4bn, JPMorgan would receive £151m for its shares, Goldman Sachs would get £132m and the Bagri family, owners of Metdist, would receive £130m.At £1.4bn, HKEx is paying a multiple of 180 times last year’s LME earnings.
302;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;NYSE appoints Birley to clearing role;;"Two of Europe’s biggest exchanges have conducted executive reshuffles as they prepare to make post-trade services such as clearing a bigger part of their businesses.NYSE Euronext on Wednesday said Patrick Birley, the experienced exchanges executive, would head the commercial team of its expanded London-based clearing house when it goes into operation from June 2013.At the same time John Tanner, post-trade business architect at the London Stock Exchange, departed at the end of last week, according to three people familiar with the situation.The moves come as exchanges prepare to grab a slice of the emerging market for clearing of derivatives. The G20 countries have mandated that more over-the-counter derivatives are traded on electronic venues and processed through clearing houses, potentially opening up a market that had hitherto been dominated by banks.This year NYSE has confirmed it will expand its NYSE Liffe Clear operations to become NYSE Clearing while the LSE is in the process of buying a controlling stake in LCH.Clearnet. Last week NYSE Liffe formally gave 12 months’ notice to LCH.Clearnet that the latter would no longer clear some of Liffe’s derivatives products.Mr Birley has previously been chief executive of the UK arm of LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French clearing house, and chief executive of European Climate Exchange, which was bought by IntercontinentalExchange in 2010. In 2010 he briefly advised the LSE on its post-trade strategy.Mr Birley has also worked at the London Metal Exchange and helped develop the South African Futures Exchange, later sold to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.Mr Birley will report to Mark Ibbotson, executive vice-president of Global Clearing, and work alongside Declan Ward, executive director and head of NYSE Liffe Clearing.Mr Tanner, who has been at the LSE for more than 25 years, is the latest in a series of departures at the LSE, which is reorganising internally after a rapid three years of change as it diversifies beyond cash equities.The deal to buy up to 60 per cent of LCH.Clearnet, which gave the clearer an implied value of more than €800m, is due to close at the end of the year. The LSE declined to comment.Last month the LSE announced three high-profile departures – Doug Webb, chief financial officer; Kevin Milne, its head of post-trade operations and Tracey Pierce, head of primary markets. In their place it appointed David Warren, formerly the chief financial officer of Nasdaq OMX while Alexander Justham, once head of markets at the Financial Services Authority as chief executive of the UK business and head of regulation."
303;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;US approves first swap trade repository;;US regulators have approved the first data warehouses for storing details of derivatives trades as they look to comply with looming deadlines in legislation that will reshape off-exchange dealing.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday granted provisional approval for a trade repository owned by IntercontinentalExchange, the futures trading platform.The warehouse, called ICE Trade Vault, will collect information on swaps data as the industry builds the infrastructure needed to comply with new trading rules.The Group of 20 has mandated that many opaque, off-exchange derivatives trades move on to electronic venues, with deals processed through clearing houses and their details reported to trade repositories.The CFTC’s approval for ICE Trade Vault comes ahead of a deadline for US regulators to begin receiving data from clearing houses under G20 agreements and the terms of the Dodd-Frank Act.CME Group, a rival futures exchange operator to ICE, has also made an application to the CFTC.DTCC, the principal US clearing and settlement house, is also making a strong push into the market.Bruce Tupper, head of ICE Trade Vault, said: “Global market participants will benefit from our functionality and compliance tools, which will help them manage new reporting requirements through a well designed, cost efficient solution.”But others in the sector have worried that a proliferation of venues around the world, each containing trade details, may serve to complicate rather than simplify the tracking process.Issues surrounding the number of global trade repositories, their location and joint technical standards have been the subject of prolonged debate since the efforts began.Some say that even with all the data recorded, the new practices will rely on consistent scanning and understanding of large quantities of information. All of which, they say, throws into question whether the efforts can prevent another financial meltdown.After testing its trial system in the spring, ICE said it expects to launch the trade repository later this year. The company said the service would reach more than 250 of its customers, which include brokers.
304;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
305;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-06-28T15:15:23Z;Chinese exchanges invest in joint venture;;The stock exchanges of Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen will invest a total of HK$300m in creating a joint venture aiming to give investors access to companies listed in all three cities for the first time.The venture, to be a separate company, should be up and running within three months and Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Limited, said it would create its first cross-border indices by the end of the year. Further products, such as derivatives and exchange traded funds based on the indices and stocks will be introduced next year.The move is another step in the co-operation between the three exchanges, who have frequently been rivals as they vie to be the pre-eminent exchange in China. The three have previously signed agreements to co-operate on various issues, but it is the first commercial venture between them.Hong Kong stole a march on its rivals ten days ago by winning the race with IntercontinentalExchange of the US to buy the London Metal Exchange. Mr Li has ambitious plans to make HKEx the gateway for the world’s capital markets to China.Each exchange will contribute HK$100m to the new venture while HKEx will nominate the chief executive from its designated directors. It will be based in Hong Kong and will offer products in Hong Kong dollars, renminbi and both currencies together, Mr Li said.Asked if the joint venture was a prelude to a merger between the three exchanges, Mr Li said: “We have not talked about a merger of the exchanges, it has not been discussed at all and is not part of our plans.”More news on exchanges, clearing and settlement, trading technology and markets regulationMr Li said the venture was designed to achieve three main objectives. “These are to increase co-operation between Hong Kong and the mainland exchanges, to promote the internationalisation of the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong exchanges and to enhance the overall competitiveness of Chinese capital markets,” he said through an interpreter.Song Liping, chief executive of the Shenzhen exchange, said the move would help investors from the mainland and from Hong Kong gain access to their opposite markets. “In Hong Kong, there are lots of investors who want to invest in mainland China. This need has been building up and this is what pushed us into developing this joint venture,” she said through an interpreter.Rival index compilers MSCI, Hang Seng and the China Securities Index company already offer indices containing mainland stocks, but Ms Song said the new venture would be the only one licensed to create indices with stocks from all three exchanges.Additional reporting by Philip Stafford
306;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-06-11T17:54:17Z;Liquidnet investors help secure start-up;;Victor Securities, a start-up broker-dealer focused on millisecond-speed risk management for hedge funds, has secured a round of private financing from veteran trading platform investors.Michel Daher and Jim Brown, the investors, were also early backers of Liquidnet, the US’s largest block trading platform, and FXCM, the publicly traded retail currencies broker.Victor was started last year by Rob Newhouse, former chief executive of Ballista Securities, an options trading platform, alongside the Gargoyle Group, an options market-making firm.Mr Newhouse is betting that Victor’s strategy of focusing on risk management software, which calculates the impact of stock or options price changes on a hedge fund or proprietary trading firm’s portfolio, will attract a number of smaller start-up hedge funds in the competitive institutional brokerage business.“The arms race for speed is over, and Citadel and Getco have won. Now the industry needs to focus on risk management. The JPMorgan and MF Global fiascos only prove the absence of effective risk systems in our industry,” he said.Victor last year acquired Gargoyle’s previously proprietary risk-management systems, which use dozens of Nvidia graphics processing units, to generate options prices within 3 milliseconds of stock price changes, according to Mr Newhouse.It can also predict what impact 5 per cent falls or rises in stock prices can have across a portfolio. The system’s speed is improved by performing the checks in the broker’s data centre, rather than by selling the software to clients.“Everyone in the industry is focused on faster trading. That game is done, but every dollar in risk-management that you can retain goes toward alpha,” Mr Newhouse said.Victor is targeting clients with assets under management between $10m and $100m, and already has a number of funds on its platform.The technology behind Mr Newhouse’s previous venture, Ballista Securities, was bought by IntercontinentalExchange after the options trading platform failed to attract significant volume. It aimed to trade blocks of options.Mr Daher founded Daher Foods, one of the largest consumer packaged goods companies in the Middle East, and has invested in several trading technology firms. He is currently chairman of Master Capital Group.Mr Brown was a founder of Long Ridge Equity Partners, a private equity firm focused on financial services, and formerly with TH Lee Putnam. Mr Brown’s investment in Victor is with personal funds, not through Long Ridge. He currently sits on Liquidnet’s board.
307;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-06-11T15:32:09Z;New grain trading hours spark anxiety;The change has caused concern across the agricultural world;When dealing with chunky crop reports from Washington, Tim Gubbels, a Nebraska grain elevator owner, sticks to a routine. He skims the data online, scrutinises broker commentary and types futures orders before the market opens two hours later, often furiously.With Tuesday’s latest set of market-moving crop statistics, he will have almost no time at all to react.The Chicago Board of Trade and smaller futures exchanges have just extended their hours to overlap with the US Department of Agriculture’s sensitive reports.The move meets the demands of ultra-fast traders using sophisticated computer technology to deal more quickly but raises questions over who commodity futures markets are meant to serve.“The fastest computer’s going to win as far as getting the information,” says Mr Gubbels, who buys corn, oats and soyabeans from local farmers. “At North Side Grain here in little Laurel, Nebraska, I can’t afford the fastest computer,” he says.The move to near 24-hour trading brings grain markets closer to other, bigger markets, such as oil and foreign exchange, that do not take breaks for data releases. “This will become the non-farm payrolls of the grain market,” says an executive at one proprietary trading firm.But the new trading hours have sparked anxiety across the agricultural world, from farmers and country grain merchants to officials at the USDA in Washington.The change comes amid increased scrutiny of computerised trading in commodities, particularly the impact of so-called “high frequency” strategies in which speculators dart in and out of the market in fractions of a second.The concerns run beyond the grain community. One US hedge fund manager with large positions in agriculture called the new hours a “mistake”, saying crop futures are not liquid enough to trade almost round the clock. “The grain markets are not the FX markets and they are not the global bond markets,” he says.The reform was set in motion last month, when the Intercontinental-Exchange listed five grain contracts that duplicate Chicago grain futures. They were offered 22 hours per day, five more than Chicago, “making electronic trading available during important events like crop reports”, the ICE web site says.Chicago-based CBOT, home to world benchmark grain futures, responded with its own 22-hour day for electronic trading, since trimmed to 21 after grain merchants complained. Exchange owner CME Group then extended floor trading on crop report days such as Tuesday to let open-outcry options traders in on the action.The schedule means crop reports that serve as monthly applications of market dynamite will now appear in the thick of trading. USDA economists estimate soyabean and wheat traders average a return on collateral of more than 20 per cent on crop report days late in harvest season.Dave Smoldt, vice-president at broker FC Stone, says that when the reports hit “people may react to one number, then the other numbers follow and they realise overall the report isn’t quite as bullish or bearish as people thought”.And analysts accustomed to having two hours to digest the USDA’s 40-page monthly supply and demand estimates will now have to pass judgment after the market has already delivered its verdict. “This change is going to force analysts to be less confident in what they write,” says Richard Feltes, vice-president at broker RJ O’Brien.USDA, aware of its market impact, is seeking comment on whether to adjust report release times. It has a history of doing so: in 1994, the agency shifted the publication time for its crop supply report to the early US morning in response to complaints that traders in Tokyo, not Chicago, were getting the first chance to act on its numbers.Yet, for all the complaints, other markets still function amid a stream of complicated, and sometimes contradictory, government data. In agricultural markets, as well, New York-based cotton futures and Paris-based wheat futures have long been open while the USDA publishes its monthly reports.Scott Irwin, a University of Illinois professor of agricultural economics, says: “I don’t see it as being any more complicated than the unemployment report or the CPI release or the Fed minutes being released.”
308;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-06-11T08:50:20Z;LME race heads to nail biting finale;The winner is ‘too close to call’ ahead of board decision;It has been a long nine months since the bidding war for the London Metal Exchange kicked off. But anyone who has stuck with the drama of the contest has been rewarded with a nail biter.On Thursday the two finalists, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing and IntercontinentalExchange, resubmitted their bids. Following a preliminary look by the LME’s bid committee that evening, the metals exchange’s board is this week expected to make a choice – at long last.The conversations I have had over the past few days suggest that the decision will be a difficult one. “Too close to call” is the verdict of several people I have spoken to who are well acquainted with the board’s deliberations.The future of the LME matters. The 135-year-old exchange is the place where the price is set for metals from copper (found in almost every electric wire) to aluminium (used to make aircraft, trains and fizzy drinks cans). It is also an important City of London institution, directly and indirectly sustaining thousands of jobs by ensuring that London is the centre of the global metals markets.The most obvious means of differentiation is price. But I am told the two bidders have submitted valuations for the LME that are too close for the money to be the deciding factor.The magic number shareholders have been talking about is £100 a share – which translates to a value for the whole exchange of £1.29bn. And they will probably get it. A couple of weeks ago, when CME Group dropped out of the race, both bidders were within range of that valuation.Even after last week’s “final” bids, there is still time for the bidders to put more on the table (there is always time for that). Nonetheless, shareholders should not hope for wildly higher valuations: £100 a share is 168 times last year’s net profit, already a heady number. Any bidder paying much more than that may be forced to make significant changes to the LME’s model to get a suitable return on its investment.If not the money, then what? Simply put, the LME must decide which prospective owner it would prefer.There is not much in it. Both bidders are proposing to keep the LME’s open outcry trading floor, its warehousing network, its daily contracts, and members’ involvement in day-to-day decision making. Both have credible plans to boost the LME’s trading volumes: HKEx through its links to China, ICE through its admirable expertise in clearing and technology.After two weeks of meetings between shareholders and bidders, it is my sense that HKEx is slightly preferred by the members. But there is no overwhelming consensus, and indeed many shareholders have not expressed a strong preference, instead leaving the board to decide.If it were a football game, this would be the penalty shoot-out.The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
309;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Barclays clears $1tn of OTC derivatives;;Barclays has cleared more than $1tn worth of over-the-counter derivatives arranged with clients globally, the latest in a series of moves as some asset managers rush to embrace some forms of clearing as a way to relieve burdens on stressed capital.The clearing of interest rate, credit and foreign exchange swaps via CME Group, LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear unit, and IntercontinentalExchange’s ICE Credit Clear comes well ahead of the final version of the Dodd-Frank Act rules that will require a bulk of the swaps market to be centrally cleared.“While this volume of clearing is significant, we believe it is only a very small portion of what will be cleared as regulatory deadlines approach and more clients move to a centrally-cleared model,” said Ray Kahn, head of OTC derivatives clearing at Barclays.He added that more investment by the industry in the ability to clear was needed before the final Dodd-Frank rules came into place, set to be later this year. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is first considering the definitions of swaps before it sets final clearing requirements.Regulators in the US, Europe and Asia have been pushing banks and their clients to stop privately negotiating the payment flows on swaps contracts and instead move them into central clearing houses, so that they can reduce counterparty risk. The clearing house stands between the parties and collects collateral and margin.Some banks have feared this shift will eat into the substantial revenues generated by assuming clients’ clearing risks, and that clearing will force standardisation on the market because clearing houses will not want to assume the risks of bespoke contracts. Banks earn higher fees on bespoke trades.The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a trade body controlled by banks, has warned that a proliferation of clearing houses could increase costs for market participants and concentrate risk.But a number of banks have been increasing the flow of their client business that goes through third parties, both due to client demands as asset managers such as BlackRock and Pimco build up their clearing capacity, but also in order to reduce their own capital needs.Barclays said that it had cleared 11,000 contracts, with a notional value of $1tn, on behalf of regional banks, fund managers, pensions, insurers, government agencies and hedge funds. Barclays also said the clearing was processed via its BARX electronic trading platform. The clearing unit sits within Barclays’ prime services unit.The bulk of cleared client swaps have been interest rate swaps, and Barclays has made up a substantial share of it. SwapClear and CME Group have cleared some $2tn between them, though that is just a fraction of the larger dealer-to-dealer clearing market
310;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-05-31T09:39:15Z;LME suitors woo the board;The metals exchange ponders its two bidders;The London Metal Exchange has been playing the field for the best part of a year. Now the time is drawing near for the 135-year-old exchange to choose one of its suitors and settle down.The choice, narrowed down to just two from an early field of more than 10, is stark.Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing is playing the role of the dashing and mysterious foreigner. It is wooing the LME’s shareholders – mainly banks and brokers – with the promise of greater access to China.On the other hand, IntercontinentalExchange of the US is a known quantity. It is already one of the world’s top commodity exchanges, hosting benchmark contracts for crude oil, sugar and coffee. Its chief executive, Jeff Sprecher, has coveted the LME for years – indeed, he initiated the bidding war last summer by making an unsolicited approach after the LME announced it was considering building a clearing house.The suitors have been in London this week, meeting some of the LME’s shareholders. On Thursday, the LME’s board will hear presentations from the two bidders.On the surface, HKEx might look disadvantaged. It has no experience running a commodity futures exchange, no clearing house in Europe, and half of its board is appointed by the Hong Kong government.In contrast, ICE is pitching itself as an experienced operator and level-headed steward of the LME, which hosts the global benchmarks for all the world’s most widely traded non-ferrous metals.ICE’s experience running futures exchanges – it has made a dozen acquisitions since 2001 – suggests it would be able to integrate the LME fairly smoothly into its current operations. It already has a clearing house in London. And it is based in the US, as many of the LME’s members are, which is among the most active promoters of transparency and regulation of commodity markets.Ironically, however, those points may count against the ICE bid.Because it has a large futures business already, some shareholders fear that it would force the LME to conform to its existing model – for example, eventually, by switching the LME’s daily delivery system to monthly futures, or doing away with the open outcry trading ring.This despite the fact that ICE, like HKEx, has stated its intention to keep the key features of the LME, including the date structure and the ring, as they are.While HKEx’s lack of a clearing house in Europe means there would be a greater delay in bringing LME’s clearing in-house, it also means that the clearing house would be custom built for the LME – indeed, HKEx would probably stick with the LME’s current project to build “LMEClear”.And while some shareholders are reassured by ICE’s ties to the US, others are disconcerted, fearing that it could provide a means for overzealous US regulators to meddle in their exchange.Ultimately the LME’s board and shareholders must choose between the devil they know and the devil they don’t. Some of the larger banks may favour the less risky option of selling to ICE, but most of the shareholders I have spoken to thus far have been smitten by the allure of HKEx.One thing is clear though – at current prices the exchange is likely to be sold. When they were last putting numbers on the table, the two bidders valued the exchange at £1.2bn-£1.3bn. With a final round of one-upmanship still to come, significantly higher valuations could be in the offing.In the end, who gets to walk the LME down the aisle may be a simple question of how deep his pockets are.The Commodities Note is a daily online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
311;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Electronic trading comes to OTC oil swaps;;A group of brokers has signed on with exchange operator CME Group to offer electronic trading of over-the-counter oil swaps, a specialised market where most deals are still negotiated by telephone.CME said interdealer brokers including Marex Spectron, Tradition and Tullett Prebon had licensed technology allowing trading of the exchange operator’s benchmark energy futures on the same computer screen as oil swaps, which are traded less frequently and tailored to niche markets such as jet fuel or heating oil.The move comes as regulators are crafting rules for swap execution facilities, or Sefs, platforms open to a variety of traders that are required by the Dodd-Frank financial reforms. Voice brokers have fought to preserve their business model in face of a push towards futures-style electronic trading.While other over-the-counter energy markets such as natural gas have shifted to screen trading, oil remains dependent on phone transactions. Traders say the oil market’s multiplicity of products and delivery locations favours voice broking.“It’s a largely bespoke market, and it’s the combination of being bespoke and volatile that lends itself to the nuanced dealmaking that a voice broker can bring to the table,” said Mark Vonderheide, managing partner of Geneva Energy Markets, a New York oil swap dealer.CME’s new services follow other attempts to bring privately traded oil swaps markets into the electronic realm. The New York Mercantile Exchange, which was acquired by CME Group in 2008, discontinued oil trading on its ClearPort over-the-counter platform in the absence of volume. ClearPort survives as a tool for transferring the risk of OTC derivatives to the CME clearing house.ICAP, the interdealer broker, introduced a combined voice-electronic broking service for OTC oil swaps in 2010, using technology from IntercontinentalExchange. That exchange’s WebICE platform also offers futures and oil swaps trading on the same screen, though most swap trades are still handled by brokers.“We feel that it’s necessary and inevitable that screens become more prominent, but they haven’t because there hasn’t been the correct solution,” said Michael Anderson, global head of oil at Tradition. “A hybrid model between voice and screen is most likely to succeed long term in oil OTC.”CME’s technology, called CME Direct, comes from Elysian Systems, a London-based company that the exchange operator acquired in 2010. Brokers or their customers will be able to post prices on the OTC side of the platform, said Michel Everaert, CME managing director of OTC solutions.Mr Everaert said that while brokers using the technology would probably have to register as Sefs, it was not yet clear whether CME Direct would also meet the Sef definition.“At a minimum it’s a Sef aggregator,” he said.CME’s principal source of revenue from the over-the-counter part of the system will be fees for clearing trades, Mr Everaert said. He declined to discuss terms of broker licensing agreements.
312;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-05-22T16:43:54Z;CME knocked out of race for LME;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange by value, has been knocked out of the running to acquire the London Metal Exchange after bidding £1.05bn ($1.65bn).The move to eliminate CME, which followed a meeting of the LME’s board on Friday, has narrowed the field to just two bidders: IntercontinentalExchange and Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing. The two have submitted bids of about £1.1bn-£1.2bn ($1.75bn-$1.9bn), according to people familiar with the matter, although there is still room for adjustment as they jostle for the lead.CME was the only one of the three remaining bidders already offering metals contracts. Its US copper contract, listed on its Comex division, is one of the LME’s few direct competitors. It has also expanded in recent years into the steel market, seen as one of the most important growth areas for commodities trading. CME declined to comment.NYSE Euronext, another US exchange group, was knocked out earlier after bidding about £800m.The 135-year-old LME is seen as one of the last prizes in a wave of consolidation in the exchanges industry. It hosts global benchmark contracts for metals from aluminium to zinc.The two remaining bidders are likely to have an opportunity to engage directly with shareholders in the coming weeks before the board selects one of them, according to two people familiar with the process. To succeed, any bid must win the support of three-quarters of the shares.In a statement, the LME said it had “decided to continue discussions with two parties regarding their proposals for the potential acquisition of the LME”.“This will involve obtaining a detailed understanding of their plans for the future governance and operation of the market and the deliverability of their respective proposals, as well as the value offered.”The LME’s shareholders – the largest of which are JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Metdist, a family-owned metals trader – will enjoy a windfall if the sale goes ahead.A valuation of £1.2bn represents about 19 times the last traded price before the sale process was announced in September, following an unsolicited approach by ICE.The focus will now turn to the bidders’ plans to expand the LME’s business.HKEx offers close ties to China, the world’s top consumer of metals, and could potentially help the LME register warehouses in China and to launch clearing in renminbi.ICE offers a large network of customers in Asia, the most important region for the industry, already trading commodities on the exchange through its benchmark Brent crude oil and gas contracts.
313;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-05-17T21:47:38Z;LME’s suitors’ bids pass £1bn mark;;The three remaining contenders to acquire the London Metal Exchange have all valued it at more than £1bn and promised to preserve its open outcry trading pit, setting the scene for a close-run contest as they attempt to snatch control of the historic bourse.The finalists in the bidding process, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEx) and CME Group, have offered similar valuations in a range of about £1bn-£1.2bn, people familiar with the situation said, although there is still time for bids to be adjusted. NYSE Euronext was eliminated last week after bidding about £800m.Still owned by the brokers and banks that use it, the 135-year-old LME is seen as one of the last prizes in a wave of consolidation in the exchanges industry. It hosts global benchmark contracts for metals from aluminium to zinc.Each bidder has also proposed to keep the LME’s idiosyncrasies– such as its “open outcry” trading, daily contracts and global network of warehouses – that are prized by members.Many feared a sale would lead to the closure of the exchange’s trading pit – known as “the ring” – the last in Europe where traders still shout orders to one another.The valuations, at the higher end of early expectations, together with the proposals for continuity, should assuage concerns among some shareholders that buyers would seek drastic changes.The LME’s shareholders, the largest being JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Metdist, a family-owned metals trader, will enjoy a windfall if the sale goes ahead. A valuation of £1bn represents about 15 times the last traded price before the sale process was announced in September, following an unsolicited approach by the ICE.The focus will now turn to the bidders’ plans to expand the LME’s business.HKEx offers close ties to China, the world’s top consumer of metals, and could potentially help the LME register warehouses in China and to launch clearing in renminbi.CME has a wide range of contracts linked to the steel market, seen as one of the main areas of growth in commodities trading and a natural fit because many steelmakers trade metals such as nickel and zinc on the LME. It also has experience running a network of warehouses through its ownership of New York’s Comex.ICE offers a large network of customers in Asia, the most important region for the industry, already trading commodities on the exchange through its benchmark Brent crude oil and gasoil contracts.The LME and the three bidders declined to comment.Additional reporting by David Gelles and Philip Stafford
314;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-05-16T12:05:02Z;Costs and investments cut LME profits;;The London Metal Exchange suffered a 19 per cent drop in profits last year as higher costs and investments outweighed a sharp rise in trading volumes.The results highlight the challenges facing the 135-year-old exchange should it remain independent in an increasingly competitive and more stringently regulated industry. They also underline the dilemma for the LME’s shareholders, the banks and brokers that use it, as they decide whether or not to sell the exchange.The LME is the subject of a bidding war that is in its final stages, with Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, CME Group and the IntercontinentalExchange in the running to acquire the metals exchange, seen as one of the last great prizes in a wave of industry consolidation. The highest bids are expected to value it at about £1bn.The exchange disclosed it would pay Moelis & Co, its financial adviser, a £3.5m fee plus 0.5-0.7 per cent of the valuation of the exchange if it is sold. It will pay a further £500,000 to “other advisers”, likely to include RLM Finsbury, the public relations firm. The LME has also retained Freshfields has a legal adviser.According to figures disclosed in the LME’s annual report and seen by the Financial Times, revenues at the LME rose by a fifth last year. That was on the back of a 22 per cent increase in trading volumes in its contracts, which serve as global benchmarks for metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc, but net profit fell from £9.5m to £7.7m on the back of higher costs.“The investment requirements of being a global exchange have changed the economics of the business,” Martin Abbott, chief executive, wrote in the report.The fall in profits is unlikely to worry bidders, since LME’s profits are expected to rise significantly in the coming years as it brings clearing in-house and increases trading fees.The moves have divided opinion in the traditionally clubby LME, leading to a rare public disagreement over the fee increase this year. Many shareholders remain wary of changes that a sale could bring and prefer the current model under which LME is run, not to maximise profits but for the benefit of its users.“The LME is not for sale,” Mr Abbott wrote in the report. “But we cannot stop people from trying to buy it and it will be interesting to see whether bidders can show a good reason for shareholders to sell.”He added: “The new fee will allow the exchange to maintain an appropriate investment programme, to maintain its regulatory capital requirements and to continue to grow in an increasingly competitive market.”The results highlighted the weight of investment that the LME is planning in the coming years. It had signed contracts for £44m of expenditure at the end of last year, more than doubled from £21m a year earlier, on the back of investments in technology.Mr Abbott pointed out that before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and the cost of the clearing project and the bid process, the LME registered record profits last year.The board proposed paying no dividend, due to the uncertainty about the exchange’s future ownership.
315;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-05-15T21:48:18Z;LCH.Clearnet expands European CDS;;LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French clearing house, has joined the battle to clear European credit default swaps (CDS), as clearing houses prepare for incoming regulation which will reshape trading of off-exchange products.The group, which is being bought by the London Stock Exchange, said on Tuesday it was extending its two-year old French domestic CDS service to international markets.The service has been backed by 10 of the world’s largest derivatives dealers, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citi and Credit Suisse, it added. CDS contracts insure the buyer against a default against a borrower’s debt payment and their use has grown rapidly in the last decade.The development puts LCH.Clearnet in competition with Deutsche Börse’s Eurex and CME Group of the US in taking on IntercontinentalExchange, the world’s largest CDS clearing house as the industry prepares for more over-the-counter derivatives products moving on to electronic venues, with the trades processed through clearing houses.The G20 has mandated the reforms to guard against systemic risk following the financial crisis. A clearing house sits between two parties, guaranteeing a trade in the event of a default.CDSClear clears Markit iTraxx Europe, one of the most traded indices for CDS. Users will be able to clear CDS on single European borrowers and offset margin against CDS index trades. It was also working on a service for the US, it added.“This launch brings real choice to the international cleared CDS market,” said Charlie Longden, chief executive of CDSClear. “We are working hard on building our client offering and are keen to engage with clients globally and gain their input into its development,” he added.The 10 brokers are: BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS. They join BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Natixis and Société Générale, who used the French domestic service.
316;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-05-15T18:44:04Z;Backlash to longer grain futures sessions;;Exchanges face a growing furore over a longer trading day in grain futures as traders fear it will lead to knee-jerk reactions to sensitive crop reports.The backlash puts CME Group, the biggest US futures exchange operator, in a delicate position as it fends off new competition in agriculture and balances the needs of farmers and grain handlers with electronic traders.The Chicago Board of Trade, a CME exchange, next week plans to allow electronic trading of crop futures including corn, soyabeans and wheat for 22 hours a day, extending sessions by five hours. The move comes after the rival IntercontinentalExchange this week launched lookalike contracts, challenging Chicago’s dominance in the grain pits.The new hours overlap with the release of crop reports that regularly move markets. Until now, the US Department of Agriculture’s lengthy reports were released while trading was halted.RJ O’Brien, a large Chicago-based futures broker, on Tuesday implored exchanges and regulators to freeze trading on the 15 days each year when the USDA publishes its crop production, acreage and grain stocks reports.“Many RJO clients worry that contract volume and liquidity in the initial minutes after release of the major crop reports will be impeded by the inherent delay necessary to digest all of the updates,” said Gerald Corcoran, chief executive. “This low initial participation could trigger extreme price reactions and wider bid/ask spreads, thus increasing hedging costs, which ultimately will be passed on to consumers.”Last week grain handling groups including the National Grain and Feed Association said longer hours “could lead to competitive inequalities and impose significant additional costs” in personnel and technology.Grain is one of the few markets where trading halts around important data releases. Oil futures stay open when weekly US petroleum supply numbers appear.Smaller agricultural markets, such as Liffe milling wheat in Paris and ICE canola in Canada, already trade during USDA releases and to a degree are proxies for other commodities during the Chicago hiatus.John Stotts, director of commodities at Infinium Capital Management, a Chicago proprietary trading firm, said the longer trading day was “destined to happen”.“Exchanges have a global client base. These customers will want to be able to trade data in real-time, and not wait around for one timezone to open up,” he said.Hubert Hamer, chairman of the USDA’s Agricultural Statistics Board, said the agency is discussing the longer sessions. “Any change to the report release schedule is complex, has far-reaching impact, and would be taken very deliberatively,” he said.
317;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-05-15T17:18:30Z;NYSE Euronext knocked out of LME race;;NYSE Euronext has been knocked out of the race to acquire the London Metal Exchange after submitting too low a bid.NYSE was one of four bidders to submit binding bids for the exchange last week, and it is the first to be eliminated. Those remaining are Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, CME Group, and the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE).NYSE’s bid valued the metals exchange at roughly £800m, according to people familiar with the matter, suggesting that shareholders’ aspirations of a bid in excess of £1bn may be met.Martin Abbott, LME chief executive, said this month that “as a matter of personal pride, as the CEO, I’d like to think that we’d get there [to a valuation of £1bn] at least.”NYSE said: “We put a proposal in that we believe was a fair valuation for the business and we wish them well.”The elimination of NYSE thwarts another attempt by the transatlantic exchanges operator to diversify its business after regulators blocked a merger with Deutsche Börse in February.NYSE had not been seen as a likely bidder for the LME until the collapse of its deal with Deutsche Börse. However, the group could have integrated the LME with its existing soft and agricultural commodity derivatives business, part of NYSE Liffe. It would also have been able to send trades done on the LME for clearing at NYSE Liffe Clear.However, it was not prepared to enter into a bidding war with the other exchanges, people familiar with the matter said.The LME, still owned by its members, is seen as one of the last great prizes in a wave of consolidation in the exchanges industry. It accounts for 80 per cent of global turnover in metals futures and hosts industry benchmark contracts for commodities such as copper, aluminium and zinc.The board of the exchange met last Thursday to begin narrowing down the field before putting a possible bid to a vote.The decision-making process is complicated by many shareholders being as concerned about keeping the LME’s structure constant as they are about valuation. The board is therefore weighing the relative merits of the business models proposed by the bidders, together with the price they are willing to pay.Any bid must receive the support of at least 75 per cent of the LME’s shareholders, meaning the three largest shareholders – JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Metdist – could together block a bid.
318;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-05-02T21:58:16Z;Energy contracts boost ICE income;;IntercontinentalExchange, said commissions from a growing number of over the counter energy contracts helped the US electronic futures exchange outperform its competitors and report record net income in the first quarter.The company’s net income grew 15 per cent to $148m in the period compared with the same time a year ago, with earnings at $2.02 a share coming in line with market consensus.Revenues moved 9 per cent higher to $365m in the three-month period to March 31, driven by a 15 per cent rise in OTC energy volume to $163m.Average daily commissions on those contracts grew 20 per cent to $1.95m, which helped the company’s top line despite a slower rate of growth in its other products, including credit default swap clearances.Ed Ditmire, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, said: “[Their] first quarter is relatively healthy compared to an exchange industry which is struggling to hold year-ago levels, but was only in line with expectations.”Revenues from one OTC energy contract, WTI futures and options, however, declined 42 per cent in the period – reflecting the growing role of Brent as the dominant benchmark for crude.“In April, Brent was the most heavily traded crude futures contract in the world …pricing approximately 70 per cent of international oil,” Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE’s chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call.To meet the demand in the market, the ICE said it was rolling out new Brent products.ICE performed better than other exchanges, including the CME and NYSE Euronext, which saw profits decline by more than 40 per cent each in their respective first quarters. Both rivals blamed regulatory uncertainty for a slowdown in trading activity.“Our results continue to reflect the role that ICE’s markets and clearing houses play in enabling companies to manage risks in a dynamic economic and regulatory environment,” Mr Sprecher added.But shares in ICE closed down 2.49 per cent to $127.85 on Wednesday, as the company said in a separate release that commissions on energy contracts had fallen by about 23 per cent in April to an average of $1.5m daily.Analysts said that despite the fact the company reported that futures volumes – which attributed for just under half of total revenues in the first quarter – grew 21 per cent in April, the slowdown in commissions would hurt shares.Niamh Alexander, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said: “We see risk to second-quarter consensus on OTC energy [commissions], which is tracking at $1.5m in April and 15 per cent below our estimate of $1.758m, and lower than expected futures volume, though April can be the slowest month in the quarter.”
319;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-05-01T19:14:26Z;ISDA warns against competing clearing houses;;Competing clearing houses for privately negotiated derivatives could make markets less secure, warned the chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, undermining the aims of new regulation.Global regulators have made central clearing a key way to reduce the systemic risk generated by over-the-counter derivatives during the financial crisis, but the derivatives industry is fighting to keep some of the market cleared by individual dealers.“We don’t want to see a race to the bottom on margin terms, nor a fragmented market caused by a proliferation of central counterparties,” said Stephen O’Connor, chairman of ISDA and head of over-the-counter clearing at Morgan Stanley, speaking at the industry lobby’s annual meeting in Chicago.“Any trend towards a weak, fragmented clearing system will result in a market less secure than exists today,” he added.ISDA is an industry lobby of banks, service providers and users of over-the-counter derivatives. These are distinct from listed derivatives markets in that they are privately agreed, and not listed on exchanges.The group has worked to move many of those trades into central clearing houses, help counterparties match exposures to reduce collateral needs and establish data repositories.However, the industry is now fighting moves by some regulators, such as the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to push for more reform, such as requiring broad access to real-time clearing to encourage more trading in standardised central markets, such as Swap Execution Facitilies, or on exchanges.This could threaten the role of banks as dealers who make markets and trade in large sizes by allowing new firms, such as electronic market makers, to become liquidity providers.Already, exchanges CME Group and the IntercontinentalExchange have launched clearing houses for credit default swaps where clients can clear. CME Group is also competing with LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear to clear interest rate swaps.SwapClear said on Tuesday, just as the ISDA conference began, that dealer-to-client clearing volumes of interest-rate swaps had jumped 175 per cent in April from a year ago, to $712bn notional. That is still just a sliver of LCH’s $300tn notional dealer-to-dealer clearing.Mr O’Connor noted that some countries, such as Japan, India and South Korea, were considering adopting rules that trades must go through domestic clearing house. This would create complexity, and rules should allow any qualified clearing house to act as a central counterparty, he said.The clearing houses have been expanding the range of acceptable collateral to additional currencies and securities such as high-grade corporate bonds. They have also been promoting measures to cut margin requirements by allowing traders to offset their swaps trading exposure to interest rates with any futures positions they hold.They argue these measures do not imperil risk management, but reduce costs while quality collateral is at a premium and will see increasing demand by central clearing mandates.Luigi Zinagles, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, told the ISDA conference that “OTC markets tend to be opaque and unstable. They rely heavily on some market maker that [is] central to the transaction”.“Sometimes competition evolves naturally, but when you have an oligopolistic [market], the creation of those rules will not be great,” he said.
320;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-05-01T10:20:40Z;Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing/LME;Race for mutually owned metals exchange heats up;"There, they’ve said it. Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing is the first bidder to confirm publicly its interest in the London Metal Exchange. The bidding deadline for the centre of the metals world is Monday and HKEx will probably be up against an exchange world who’s who, including NYSE Euronext, CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange.Of course they all want the LME, one of the few remaining mutually owned exchanges. Still, that status makes a valuation tricky. Private share trades last autumn valued it at £540m – 57 times 2010 profits – but simply adding a profit-seeking motive would boost income. A bidding war could push the price north of £1bn.Debt-free HKEx had more than that in cash at the end of last year and borrowing for a deal would be easy enough. But its rivals are hardly stretched; the most “extreme” is NYSE Euronext with net debt worth just 1.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The real question is what LME members would demand over and above cash. Some protection of key features, such as the daily contract structure seem a given. Fine. Retention of the trading floor is open to debate but immediate closure seems unlikely. Any arrangement to retain the LME’s ring, however finite, would cut into early-year income.HKEx’s big attraction to LME members could be its China links; last week the exchange approved its first Chinese member. But HKEx does not have the same experience in absorbing and modernising another exchange as the others do; just ask CME and NYSE about coping with resistant and outspoken traders. Overpaying for such a unique asset could be justified merely to stop a rival getting it, but boosting the revenues to make good the price tag in the longer term would take a lot of skill.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
321;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Chicago aims for share of OTC derivatives;;Chicago’s trading community is stepping up its attempt to wrest control of over-the-counter derivatives markets from New York-based dealer banks.New York’s vice-like grip on over-the-counter derivatives may loosen with the implementation of rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act, which overhauled US markets in the wake of the financial crisis. Stricter capital requirements are also making it harder for big banks to take on customers’ risk.That could give an edge to the already highly regulated market for exchange-traded futures, which is primarily based in Chicago, to take share from privately negotiated swaps, which the dealers in New York control.On Monday, Eris Exchange said it had struck a deal with CME Group, both based in Chicago, to allow traders to reduce their costs by combining the clearing of futures and swaps trades. Eris was founded in 2010 by a consortium of Chicago trading firms to trade listed futures meant to replicate over-the-counter interest rate swaps.The announcement comes a day ahead of the annual general meeting of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the bank-run industry body for over-the-counter derivatives. ISDA is meeting in Chicago this year, just blocks away from the home of the CME, the world’s largest listed futures market.The new offering, which goes live on May 7, will be used to offset collateral and margin requirements for trading in interest-rate swaps on Eris, and eurodollar and Treasury futures positions at CME.If successful, the Eris-CME effort could bolster Eris’s efforts to challenge the banks’ over-the-counter trading. It could also drive swaps clearing into CME Group’s central clearing house that is already the world’s largest for futures trading.A new study by Greenwich Associates this week found that a key cost for traders will be how much collateral they will need to post against their trades. “The need to post collateral would cause them to …cut back their activity in interest rate derivatives,” the survey said.Eris claims that the offsets could reduce the margin need for interest-rate swaps, which are highly correlated with eurodollar and Treasury futures, by up to 95 per cent.Supurna VedBrat, managing director at BlackRock, welcomed the move, saying it “provides the market with a new source of liquidity for cleared interest rate swap exposure delivered with cross-product portfolio margin efficiency with CME Group futures directly at the individual client level”.Neal Brady, Eris chief executive, told the Financial Times the offering was aimed at financial traders such as hedge funds and asset managers. “Interest-rate swap clients are increasingly looking for ways to minimise operational and financial costs as they begin to migrate bilateral OTC swap activity to central counterparty clearing,” he said.Eris represents one of several attempts by the Chicago financial trading community, which pioneered exchange-traded financial derivatives in the 1970s, to seize the initiative on the changing OTC markets from Wall Street dealers.The Chicago Board Options Exchange and DRW Trading, a Chicago-based trading firm that is the chief backer of Eris, announced a deal last week to launch listed futures contracts that mimic equity-based swaps.CME is also using margin offsets as a key offering in its battle for a share of interest rate swaps clearing with LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear. SwapClear is the global leader in bank-to-bank clearing, but the two groups are fighting for the new market for bank-to-customer trading.CME rolled out margin offsets earlier this year in interest-rate swaps. LCH has partnered with NYSE Euronext’s Liffe US market to develop its own competing product.
322;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;HKEx confirms interest in LME;;Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing said on Monday it was interested in buying the London Metal Exchange, pitting the Chinese bourse against rivals from New York and Chicago.The news confirms months of rumours that the Hong Kong group hoped to acquire the world’s leading metals exchange as part of its plans to push into new businesses, such as commodities.The bidding deadline for the LME is Monday May 7, with shareholders hoping for a valuation in excess of £1bn.HKEx, which has a monopoly on equity trading in Hong Kong, is the world’s biggest exchange operator by market capitalisation and would easily be able to finance an acquisition of the LME.The group has already started talks with banks about a loan to finance a bid for the 135-year-old metals exchange, according to people familiar with the matter.The Hong Kong group is expected to be bidding against established commodities bourses including CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange, and NYSE Euronext, according to people familiar with the matter.The LME, which hosts futures contracts used as global industry benchmarks for base metals from copper to nickel, is one of the last member-owned exchanges in the world. It is home to Europe’s last trading pit – known at the LME as the ring – where traders shout orders to each other.Many of the LME’s shareholders look favourably on a potential offer from Hong Kong, believing that stronger ties with China would benefit the exchange.Last week the LME approved Bank of China as its first Chinese member, and is also considering adding renminbi to its range of currencies available for trading and settlement.Nonetheless, shareholders – primarily the banks and brokers that trade on the exchange – are unlikely to approve a bid that does not promise to preserve the LME’s business model.Explore deals on the table and those that have fallen by the waysideCharles Li, HKEx chief executive, said in January that commodities was the next asset class on its list as it seeks to expand beyond equities. Mr Li said at the time: “Although commodities may prove to be the most difficult, the opportunity is also the greatest.”As China’s influence in commodities had expanded, Mr Li said the country needed access to financial and commodity derivatives markets in renminbi and in the Asian timezone.
323;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-04-12T18:09:59Z;ICE takes on rival CME on grains;;IntercontinentalExchange is bringing its rivalry with CME Group to US grain markets, listing five new futures contracts that settle against the Chicago exchange operator’s benchmarks including corn and wheat.The new products are the latest cash-settled “lookalike” futures, in which one exchange ties the price of a contract to futures settled by physical commodity deliveries at another.The ICE cash-settled US West Texas Intermediate crude oil contract was launched in 2006 and now has a quarter of the open interest of the physical crude it mirrors on CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange.CME also lists lookalikes including futures that track cocoa, coffee, cotton and sugar futures on the ICE Futures US exchange in New York.Trading in the four contracts is sparse. Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, last year told the Financial Times that cash-settled futures were “a parasitic, second-order derivative”.ICE’s move comes as grain markets have gyrated over the past year owing to disappointing crops and strong demand from livestock farmers, ethanol refiners and other consumers.Average open interest has roughly doubled in the past five years for corn, soyabean and wheat futures and options on CME’s Chicago Board of Trade, partly fuelled by commodities’ advent as an asset class.The new ICE futures and options would start trading next month and settle against Chicago-listed corn, soyabeans, soyabean meal, soyabean oil and wheat.Ben Jackson, chief operating officer of ICE Futures US, said the exchange listed the contracts in response to demand for an alternative place to trade as regulations tighten for off-exchange derivatives markets.“A fundamental belief of our customers is that competition will improve these markets,” he said. “They believe competition will make these markets tighter and more liquid for them to facilitate the type of transaction they need to do to protect themselves from volatile price movements.”Atlanta-based ICE is also trying to appeal to ultra-fast electronic traders, an important part of its customer base.A web page announcing that the new futures and options says ICE has the “fastest matching engine in [the] futures industry with sub-millisecond transaction time”.Corn, wheat and oat futures, introduced in 1877, are the oldest Chicago grain futures contracts still trading. Soyabean futures were first offered in 1936.CME said: “CME Group agricultural products, including CBOT grain futures and options, are global benchmarks that continue to offer the deepest and most liquid markets to customers around the globe.“We believe competition is good for business and we will continue to work with our customers to meet their needs for agriculture risk management.”Sterling Smith of broker Country Hedging in Minneapolis doubted the tradition-bound agricultural futures market would migrate away from Chicago’s legacy marketplace.“I am not entirely sure there is a lot to be gained by having these contracts,” he said. “The ICE is definitely going to face an uphill challenge in trying to get liquidity to move out of the CME.”
324;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-04-10T19:26:46Z;HFT slows down in US ahead of exchange action;;Fewer messages are being blasted at US stock exchanges by high-speed traders ahead of pending rule changes that penalise some automated trading activities.The practice of electronically sending thousands of quotes each second to the stock market has come under scrutiny over the past two years, following the May 2010 “flash crash” and regulators’ concerns about whether trading in milliseconds is detrimental to some investors.Such trading is seen as necessary by many traders and academics, who say that it dampens wild market swings and allows market-makers to offer better prices to investors.But it is viewed as costly by other participants and some regulators, who say investors are forced to spend more on technology to accommodate the bandwidth necessary to record the millions of quotes generated per day.Three US exchanges are in the process of adopting policies that would penalise traders for exceeding set ratios of quotes per trade, such as more than 100 quotes per trade, in the hopes of cutting down on wasteful activity.Nasdaq and Direct Edge are considering them for equities, while the IntercontinentalExchange has begun rolling them out in its futures markets. Ahead of such changes, fresh figures suggest the volume of tradeless quotes may be declining as traders adjust their strategies, although declining price volatility and trading activity may also be having an impact.Steve Hammer, founder of HFT Alert, a service that collates market data, analyses and resells it to traders, found that the average daily level of quotes with no trades dropped to 3m per day over the past two weeks of March from average levels of 11.7m quotes over the past year.“Since the Securities and Exchange Commission and many exchanges have announced their intention to more closely scrutinise such practices in early March, this has had a dramatic and very noticeable change in quote traffic,” said Mr Hammer.Direct Edge said it was not yet seeing any changes in quoting patterns on its market.Nasdaq said it could not comment on any trends, as it is awaiting approval of its penalties for excessive messaging by the SEC, which has asked for public comment on the rules.There are also other factors at work, such as a broad decline in market volatility, which necessitates fewer price changes by market-makers. The Vix implied volatility index has dropped by 50 per cent since August.Analysts at Credit Suisse have seen a steady decline in the number of changes in the best quotes to buy and sell individual stocks since that time. The daily number of changes has fallen from a peak above 400m in August to hover at about 150m since January.
325;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-04-09T21:02:42Z;CME considers London futures platform;;CME Group is considering opening a futures exchange in London as a way for the US operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to expand in Europe.The development is a sign that if the Chicago company does not win the bidding for the London Metal Exchange, it could build a European futures exchange to complement its existing clearing business.CME is one of a handful of global exchanges, including NYSE Euronext, that have submitted initial bids for the LME, with IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) also believed to have bid.It underscores how London is emerging as the key battleground for derivatives trading and clearing as new regulations, such as the US Dodd-Frank Act and similar European legislation, force over-the-counter derivatives to be processed through clearing houses.The London Stock Exchange last week said shareholders had approved its acquisition of a controlling stake in LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest clearer by volume of OTC interest rate swaps.NYSE Euronext, operator of London’s Liffe futures exchange, said last month it would complete a fledgling derivatives clearing house in the capital that would handle OTC derivatives as well as Liffe’s existing euribor interest rate futures contracts.CME has operated a clearing house in London since last year, building on a sales office that was its beachhead in Europe when it opened in 2004.William Knottenbelt, head of CME’s operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, said that CME had OTC derivatives clearing in London, but because of the group’s wide product range, “We would have to consider what we would do on the [exchange-traded] futures side, so we would need to have an exchange [in London].”“It’s something which we are considering, but the decision to actually do it has not been made,” Mr Knottenbelt told the Financial Times. He declined to comment on a potential bid for the LME.CME’s main US rival, ICE, has operated a London energy futures exchange since its purchase of the International Petroleum Exchange in 2001.It also operates a clearing house in London for OTC credit default swaps, OTC energy contracts and all its energy futures business.LSE is expected to use its LCH.Clearnet acquisition as the launch pad for a push deeper into exchange-traded futures and to increase OTC interest rate swaps clearing, already handled by LCH’s SwapClear service – which also competes with CME in swaps clearing in the US.Deutsche Börse is also set to enter the fray with the launch of OTC interest rate swaps clearing at its Eurex Clearing subsidiary, based in Frankfurt, by the summer.Mr Knottenbelt, global head of futures and global clearing at RBS until he was hired by CME last November, said CME would later this year launch clearing in London of OTC interest rate swaps.He said even with SwapClear and the imminent entry of Eurex Clearing, there was room for a third competitor given that about 65 per cent of the global market for OTC interest rate swaps originated in London.“We’ve talked to existing clients in Europe and have had a relatively good response. From a client perspective you want choice,” he said.
326;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-04-02T19:09:41Z;NYPC names chief executive;;"New York Portfolio Clearing has named former swaps trader Alexander ""Sandy” Broderick as its permanent chief executive, the latest in a series of moves as it prepares to take on over-the-counter products ahead of impending financial reform.Mr Broderick joins NYPC, the joint venture between NYSE Euronext and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, from Société Générale, where he was head of British pound derivatives and bond trading. He was previously a swaps trader at Bank of America.While at SocGen, Mr Broderick aided in the development of SwapClear, the global OTC interest-rate swaps clearing system backed by LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house. He was also chairman of OTCDerivNet, which represents global banks in efforts to develop clearing tools.LCH.Clearnet and NYPC recently announced a ”Project Trinity” alliance, along with NYSE Liffe US, a listed futures exchange, to explore ways to offer margin efficiencies to traders of swaps and futures, and compete with integrated exchanges CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, told investors on Monday: “Hopefully we can be the swaps solution on this side of the pond [in the US], the way OTCDerivNet and SwapClear are on the other side.”Such efficiencies have emerged as a critical battleground in the burgeoning trading and clearing landscape, which is being reworked by the Dodd-Frank Act in the US, and Emir in Europe, to push more over-the-counter trades into central clearinghouses in order to reduce risk.But with a shortage of available collateral, many banks and trading groups are worried about the huge costs of posting margin to clearing houses.In response, clearers such as CME and the ICE have rolled out tools that will enable members to net their margins across products; the “trinity” aims to join them.“The impending change in market regulation makes NYPC perfectly placed to serve and help market participants adapt to the new environment,” said Mr Broderick in a statement.Mr Broderick replaces interim chief Murray Pozmanter of DTCC, who was filling in following the departure of Walt Lukken.Mr Lukken was a former commissioner of the US futures regulator, who is now head of the industry lobby, the Futures Industry Association."
327;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;NYSE Euronext moves on after failed merger;;NYSE Euronext begins the next phase of its life on Monday, as it holds its first investor meeting since its failed Deutsche Börse merger amid questions about how it now plans to grow its clearing and technology revenues.Since a series of proposed global exchange mergers last year were blocked by shareholders and regulators, NYSE Euronext and its peers have been fighting the perception that they have become more utilities, which are now expected to pay dividends rather than expand their companies.Many incumbent exchanges continue to lose market share to start-up electronic markets and bank-owned pools. NYSE Euronext saw its share of US stock trading fall to less than 24 per cent in the first quarter, according to analysts at Sandler O’Neill.“Given the soft volume environment, we are very interested in what they have to say about cost-cutting, the capital return programme and what they’re doing to grow new businesses,” said Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.NYSE Euronext has said it expects to use the $550m remaining on a share buyback programme from last year, and could authorise more. But its 16 per cent share price decline in 2012 has outpaced rivals such as Nasdaq OMX, CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange.On Monday, Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, is expected to delve deeper into its post-merger strategy. He has already identified clearing as a “key focus”, which had also been a central rationale for the Deutsche Börse deal.Clearing houses stand between buyers and sellers in a trade, and are expected to see sharply rising revenues as G20 countries urge more complex derivatives to be centrally cleared.The group recently announced an $85m revival of a two-year-old plan to expand its London-based derivatives clearing house and sever some of its existing ties with LCH.Clearnet. It has also hinted at further investment in its US futures trading and clearing effort, and submitted a bid for the London Metal Exchange, the commodities bourse.But analysts say the larger opportunity lies in clearing over-the-counter swaps trades for customers, and LCH.Clearnet is the global leader in clearing interest-rate swap trades between banks.Attention will also be focused on NYSE Technologies, the group’s fastest growing business. Turnover last year rose 10 per cent to $490m, but that fell short of targets, and is still halfway to its target of $1bn by 2015.
328;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-03-28T16:25:23Z;Chinese bank arm seeks LME membership;;The London Metal Exchange has received two new membership applications, including one from the first potential Chinese member, in a vote of confidence as the exchange prepares for a sale.BOCI, the international arm of the Bank of China, one of the country’s leading banks, and London based GH Financials have applied to become broking and clearing members of the 135-year-old exchange, which hosts futures contracts used as global industry benchmarks for metals from copper to nickel.The Chinese bank’s move comes as the Asian nation has become the largest buyer of many raw materials and industrial metals traded at the LME.Arthur Fan, chief executive of BOCI Global Commodities in the UK, said: “Over 50 per cent of the volume of the LME is for Chinese customers but there is no Chinese investment bank to provide hedge services directly to them.” He said the investment bank was also in the process of entering iron ore swaps trading in Singapore.The Chinese bank’s LME application also comes as European banks – the traditional players in commodities derivatives trading – are cutting back or shutting their commodities operations as they face increasing balance sheet constraints.While the LME is set to decide on the applications at a board meeting next month, the addition of the Chinese bank to its membership will increase the exchange’s attractiveness as a takeover target.The LME, one of the only a few member-owned exchanges in the world, is waiting for the second round of offers by a May 7 deadline. The exchange’s suitors include the CME Group, ICE and NYSE Euronext. The exchange is home to Europe’s last trading pit where traders shout orders to each other, and is seen as one of the few prizes left in an increasingly consolidated industry.
329;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
330;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-03-26T20:57:33Z;US regulator convenes panel on HFT;;The US futures regulator has named the participants for a key panel set to discuss a definition of and the regulation of high-frequency trading later this week.The panel was assembled by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after commissioner Scott O’Malia formulated his own definition of high-frequency trading and asked the industry for input.Mr O’Malia and Gary Gensler, another commissioner, have said that a definition is necessary before regulating any potential dangers of high-frequency dealing, though some European regulators have opted not to define the practice, arguing it would inhibit prudential regulation.The CFTC has said it has started a broad review of the role of computerised trading in markets, focusing on whether automated “algorithms” pose risks of runaway trading.The industry has also been divided on whether to define HFT, with some believing it would produce a more focused debate on market technology, but critics and others fearing that it could provide a way for some groups that use HFT, such as banks, to escape regulation by the letter of the law.The CFTC committee, which will meet on March 29 for the first time, includes representatives from some of the biggest high-speed trading firms in the world, such as Sean Castette of Getco and Chris Concannon of Virtu Financial.It also includes representatives of exchanges where high-speed traders are major customers, such as Chris Isaacon, chief operating officer of BATS Global Markets, Colin Clark of NYSE Euronext, Mark Wassersug of the IntercontinentalExchange and Dean Payton of CME Group.Several highly quantitative hedge funds, which rely on computer models but do not necessarily trade at the same speeds as proprietary market-makers, are also represented. That includes Peter Reiss of DE Shaw and Michael Mendelson of AQR Capital Management.There are also critics of high-frequency dealing, such as Joseph Saluzzi of Themis Trading and Jordan Lea, president of the American Cotton Shippers Association.Two influential academics were also included, both of whom have argued in favour of speed trading. Terrence Hendershott of the University of California Berkeley co-authored a paper last year that found that HFT played a “positive role in price efficiency”. Joel Hasbrouck of the New York University Stern School of Business co-authored a paper finding that high-speed trading “improves traditional market quality measures”.The panel will be chaired by Andrei Kirilenko, CFTC chief economist. It will also have two working groups, with one working on a definition of HFT and the other working on whether to have multiple categories of HFT.
331;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-03-25T20:17:19Z;Alliances offer solution for exchanges;;Exchanges will be forced to pursue alliances rather than costly cross-border mergers after the failure of four large-scale tie-ups in the past two years amid tough antitrust and political scrutiny, industry experts say.“It’s pretty clear that after all the recent cross-border mergers were rejected for one reason or another that the current era of exchange consolidation is dead,” said Seth Merrin, chief executive of Liquidnet, the largest operator of “dark pool” block trading platforms.Last week NYSE Euronext said it would not follow Deutsche Börse in taking legal action against the European Commission for last month blocking a planned tie-up between the two. The deal would have created the world’s largest bourse but it foundered amid objections from Brussels antitrust watchdogs that it would create a dominant exchange in European derivatives.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of IntercontinentalExchange, said that some deals would still be possible but exchanges needed to recognise that antitrust regulators and exchange customers should be more closely involved. “If users support these mergers, they will let the competition authorities know, and deals will get done,” he told a Futures Industry Association conference in Florida.The failure of the US-German deal was the last in a string of collapsed deals that were sparked by an attempt in 2010 by SGX, the Singapore exchange, to take over the ASX exchange in Australia. That was blocked by Canberra on national interest grounds.Some domestic-only deals have succeeded, such as the merger of Micex and RTS, the two main Russian exchanges.However Jeffrey Wallis, managing partner at SunGard, a trading technology company, said exchanges should learn from airlines, where cross-border alliances had been effective.“These alliances created marketing agreements to share data, routes and customers as well as distribution channels establishing a global network to satisfy customer demand,” he said.CME Group, operator of the largest US futures exchange, distanced itself from mergers and instead forged alliances with exchanges in Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and Japan involving cross-distribution of each others’ products.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, said exchanges had been reluctant to pursue alliances because “their expectations are too grand for a near-term type of outcome. But we’ve done it by looking at it as a 15-20 year project. It’s like a marriage,” he said.CME rival Eurex, the futures arm of Deutsche Börse, and SGX this month agreed to link their data centres to allow traders of each other’s derivatives products easier and cheaper access.This week such alliances are set to spread to within emerging markets when Bricsmart, a five-way tie-up between exchanges in Hong Kong, Brazil, India, Russia and South Africa, starts trading its first product.Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, which initiated the project, said the alliance was one way of ensuring that the member exchanges could be “at the forefront of the shift in growth to developing economies”.
332;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-03-19T11:24:54Z;Brokers and exchanges set for FX clearing;;The world’s largest broker-dealers, exchanges and clearing houses have finalised preparations to clear foreign exchange (FX) derivatives in readiness for new financial rules that will reshape trading of the world’s largest asset class.On Monday six of the world’s largest dealer-brokers confirmed they would use an ICAP-owned platform that simplifies clearing for foreign exchange, while LCH.Clearnet, the European clearing house, began an FX-clearing service supported by 14 market participants. It comes only days after IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the US group, announced a similar service.The developments illustrate how many market participants, particularly sell-side banks, are readying themselves for a year-end deadline to comply with tough new US regulations for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading. The Dodd-Frank act, passed in 2009, mandated that more derivatives be traded on electronic venues and cleared through central counterparties (CCP), often known as clearing houses.A clearing house stands stands between two parties, ensuring a trade is completed if one side defaults. Upcoming regulations in Europe and Asia are making similiar provisions. Mandatory use of CCPs is a significant departure for the FX industry which has traditional conducted deals on a bilateral basis.However the new regulations have ratcheted up IT costs. Each trading venue historically has had its own software language, requiring broker-dealers to undertake complex software coding to connect to each trading venue and clearing house.The six broker-dealers - BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS - will use a platform owned by Traiana, a post-trade services group, to connect to clearing houses that clear OTC FX derivatives.The Traiana platform, known as Harmony CCP, sits between the broker and the trading venue and provides all the IT connectivity. CME Group, operator of the world’s largest futures exchange, has already connected to the Traiana network.Nick Solinger, chief marketing officer at Traiana in New York, told FT Trading Room that the group was working on interoperability - the ability of a system to work with rivals systems’ with other post-trade services providers.Also on Monday, LCH.Clearnet said that other market participants would be joining its FX clearing service in coming weeks. Among the currencies it will clear are non-deliverable futures include the Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Chinese yuan, and Indian rupee against the US dollar.It comes only days after ICE, one of its main rivals for clearing in Europe, unveiled a similar venture. It will clear derivative FX contracts for BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS.The exchange also confirmed it was working with other market participants, including investors and trading venues to develop the service further. ICE is one of the world’s largest clearers of credit derivatives and has cleared more than $28tn in gross notional value in US and European index and single name CDS. CME also began FX clearing in May last year.Institutional investors are unprepared for tough new regulations around trading off-exchange derivatives and are relying on banks and brokers to help them adapt, a survey last week found. Brokers are spending up to $1bn on technology and compliance systems upgrades to meet the Dodd-Frank rules but buy-side spending was only about $1m-$2m per participant this year, it found.
333;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;CME launches portfolio margining for swaps trades;;CME Group has raised the stakes in the battle to control over-the-counter derivatives clearing, rolling out a way for big dealers to reduce the cost of trading swaps if they have offsetting positions in listed derivatives.The launch is one of the most significant developments in the over-the-counter derivatives markets since G20 reforms, such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US, mandated the clearing of OTC derivatives as part of the clean-up of the financial system after the 2008 crisis.So-called “portfolio margining”, which allows customers to calculate their net exposure to interest rate risk after combining their exposures in swaps and futures, promises to reduce the expected scramble for quality collateral that is already in short supply.Such margining tools have been in development for some time and may reduce the cost of posting daily collateral adjustments by as much as 85 per cent, CME said.The move is also a challenge to CME’s competitors in interest-rate swap clearing. CME, in addition to its role as a swaps clearing house, also runs the US’s largest futures exchange. LCH.Clearnet‘s SwapClear US also clears customer-to-dealer swap trades, and has a futures clearinghouse. But it does not have an adjacent US futures exchange.“Capital efficiency is very important for dealers and end user clients,” said Laurent Paulhac, CME Group managing director of OTC products & services. “There is a good opportunity for market participants to offset their eurodollar futures with swaps.” He also noted it was a “key differentiator between ourselves and competitors”.CME and SwapClear have also been announcing additional ways to post collateral, such as allowing the use of very high-grade corporate bonds and assets denominated in other currencies as collateral.At present, CME’s offering is not yet available to customers of the banks because regulators have not yet approved it for non-”house” accounts, that is for customers who are not clearing members. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has yet to approve portfolio margining for customers.The IntercontinentalExchange also offers portfolio margining for clearing of single-name and index-based credit default swap trades in ICE Credit Clear for house accounts, but not yet with their customers. The Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve portfolio margining for CDS contracts on individual companies. Those are regulated as securities.Separately, Newedge, the largest futures broker, or “futures commission merchant”, by trading volume handled, unveiled plans to develop its clearing facilities for interest rate swaps. FCMs are mandates by Dodd-Frank to act as brokers between OTC users and clearing houses.Newedge said it would be the first independent FCM – that is, as distinct from an FCM owned by a bank – to offer services such as clearing of OTC interest rate swaps including reduced counterparty risk, default protection and “capital efficiencies from cross-margining opportunities”.Volumes in customer clearing of interest-rate swap trades are steadily rising, but still represent just a roughly $900bn sliver, split evenly between CME and SwapClear US, of the $440tn notional rate swaps market.
334;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-03-07T18:00:51Z;Direct Edge addresses tradeless quotes;;Direct Edge, the US electronic stock exchange, is adopting new measures to combat high rates of quotes that do not result in trades, following measures by several other US and European groups to address the costs of such trading.Like many exchanges, Direct Edge has seen an explosion of message traffic resulting from the increasing speed and use of high-frequency trading algorithms, many of which will quote and then cancel trades once they detect how the market is moving.Though the practice is viewed by many as necessary to providing liquidity at low risk, enabling tight trading spreads, there is a growing belief that a portion of such traffic is inefficient, and possibly abusive as well.It also drives up costs to many traders who do not trade in millisecond increments but must pay for such data feeds. Nanex, the market data firm, has said that many high-volume US trading days can produce nearly 1 terabyte, or a million megabytes, of data.“These changes have had a profound impact on how our market operates, how resources are used, and the nature of responsible market participation,” said Bryan Harkins, chief operating officer, in a letter to clients.To combat this, Direct Edge told clients on Wednesday it will start paying lower rebates on excessive volumes of messages, termed the Message Efficiency Incentive Program.It will pay full rebates to eligible traders only if their average monthly ratio of messages-to-trades is at or less than 100 to 1. If they exceed that level, traders will receive $0.0001, or 1 mil, less per share in rebates.“The objective of the [programme] is to continue to provide members with order-management flexibility, while acknowledging the benefits to the market that come with more efficient participation,” Mr Harkins wrote.The flat approach is in keeping with moves at Deutsche Börse and Borsa Italiana, who have announced similar measures in recent weeks.They were responding in part to regulatory concern. In Europe, several countries are considering transaction taxes that would affect all trading, but most dramatically high-speed strategies that produce tiny margins across thousands of trades.The US is not looking at such blunt measures, but the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have both said they were still reviewing automated trading strategies. The CFTC cited “potential market disruptions”.Some exchanges are focused on narrower excesses. Last week, the IntercontinentalExchange announced a year-long pilot programme that penalised high cancellation rates, but only when quotes were far away from the current market price.It said that violations of its limits fell by 97 per cent, as firms adjusted their automated algorithms.Other exchanges have also been tweaking their approaches to such traffic. The London Stock Exchange has operated a similar tariff, which it calls an “order management surcharge” since 2005 and revised it in 2010. Euronext, which comprises the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon markets, has operated one since 2007.Nasdaq OMX last year instituted rules requiring the minimum life for a quote on its PSX market. BATS recently adopted a market-making programme for shares that go public on its nascent listings market, whereby traders will be rewarded for effective quote rates.
335;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-03-04T17:22:55Z;US corporation tax rates hit 10-year low;;The effective tax rate paid by large US public companies fell to its lowest in a decade in the fourth quarter last year as an increasing amount of revenue was generated outside of the country.Though a handful of corporates, including General Electric, paid more tax than a year ago, many other companies are continuing the trend of paying less as a share of pre-tax income.Corporate tax reform has been a major presidential campaign issue. Barack Obama and his Republican rivals are promising to slash the US’s 35 per cent rate, one of the highest statutory rates in the developed world, to encourage a return towards domestic investment.According to figures compiled by Morgan Stanley, the unweighted average tax rate paid by the largest 1,500 US public companies by market value in the fourth quarter was 31.9 per cent of pre-tax income. About 100 companies are yet to report for the quarter.That puts the period on track for the lowest average in any quarter since 2001 and off sharply from the 35.4 per cent paid a year ago.A greater mix of non-US revenues was the primary driver, said Adam Parker, US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. “There was a richer mix of foreign earnings, often in regions that have lower rates, continuing a long-term trend toward lower taxes paid,” he said.For example, IntercontinentalExchange, the Atlanta-based derivatives exchange operator, said it beat analysts’ forecasts amid faster growth in London-based trading and clearing. The UK corporate tax rate is 26 per cent.“Our focus is on generating the highest after-tax returns for our investors,” said Scott Hill, ICE’s chief financial officer. “All else equal, given current tax rates and future expectations, that biases us towards investments in London.”Joseph Rosenberg, research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said corporations considered more than just tax rates in strategic location decisions.Lower tax bills boosted many companies’ earnings in a quarter that otherwise saw the slowest yearly profit growth since 2009, according to S&P Capital IQ.Morgan Stanley said in a review of 68 companies reporting lower-than-expected pre-tax income that 27 of them met or beat forecasts for net income by reporting lower-than-expected tax expense. “You need to have that context when judging earnings season,” said Mr Parker.Though the average tax bill can vary, with some quarters distorted by some groups’ tax deferrals or lump-sum payments, the median is also falling. The median rate in the fourth quarter was 31.8 per cent among the 1,500 companies, with only the third quarter – at 31.5 per cent – seeing a lower value since 2001, according to Morgan Stanley.Companies have benefited from tax breaks in recent years, including credits for research and development and bonus depreciation, though many of those expired at the end of last year.
336;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-02-29T19:41:33Z;CFTC seeks to tighten regulation on ‘algos’;;Regulators and exchanges are looking at fresh ways to regulate automated trading as continuing market disruptions deepen some concerns raised by the “flash crash” nearly two years ago.Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, on Wednesday said that his agency was beginning a broad official review of such trading. It comes on the heels of moves by several exchanges in the US and Europe to add speed bumps to their systems.High-frequency trading uses sophisticated computer models to place and often cancel hundreds of bids and offers per second. Other algorithms do not trade at great speeds but buy or sell without a human trader reviewing each decision.While regulators acknowledge “algos” as a necessary tool to create liquidity or make large trades across disparate venues, they are increasingly worried about “stupid algos” and other abuses that may distort prices and disrupt trading.“These concepts will be designed to address potential market disruptions that high-frequency traders and others who have automated market access can cause,” Mr Gensler told lawmakers in testimony.The CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted various measures in response to the US equity market’s “flash crash” in May 2010, such as requiring risk checks by brokers of all trades before they are sent to the market.But disruptions still occur. As recently as last week, the NYSE Amex options market said that a market maker made 30,000 erroneous options trades in 27 seconds.“This latest incident only reinforces that belief that the potential for loss and market abuse is too great,” said John Bates, chief technology officer of Progress Software, a designer of trading systems.The CFTC’s proposed “concept release” is only a prelude to potential rules, which may take years. It will outline concerns and will pose questions to the industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission last week said it was still examining concepts related to automated trading introduced in 2009, such as the practice of some firms plugging directly into exchanges to gain speed advantages.Regulators are also still debating a definition for “high frequency” trading. Scott O’Malia, a CFTC commissioner, is assembling an industry taskforce to consider one he has proposed.In the meantime, exchanges are focused on the costs to customers of handling data volumes generated by algos. Borsa Italiana and Deutsche Börse this month said they plan to limit algos that place but quickly cancel hundreds of quotes per second, making few actual trades.The IntercontinentalExchange on Wednesday announced the results of a pilot fee programme adopted a year ago to curb excessive traffic while preserving necessary quotes and cancellations. The derivatives market operator said that violations of its limits declined by 93 per cent.“HFTs made desired improvements to their algorithms and the quality of streamed orders improved,” ICE said.
337;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-02-29T14:15:32Z;Quick View: ICE’s ‘stupid algo’ solution;;It’s one of the shocking features of today’s equity markets that millions of orders you see flashing on trading screens do not represent actual deals.Thanks to the way algorithmic trading works, exchanges and other trading platforms are flooded on a daily basis with buy and sell orders – carried in electronic “messages” – that do not actually end up in a deal being done.They are often sent out just in response to shifting market sentiment, to “machine-readable news” signals, to fresh market data or whatever. But now exchanges are getting worried.This week the FT reported that Deutsche Börse is introducing a punitive new tariff that charges traders for high “order-to-trade” ratios – that is, if the number of orders sent in exceeds the number of deals that result by a certain level.The London Stock Exchange has had a similar system in place since 2010, and Euronext since as far back as 2007.The aim is – in the words of Börse senior executive Andreas Heuer – to cut down the number of orders generated by “stupid algos”.The exchanges are worried because the volume of orders is slowing down their systems – affecting “latency”, in the jargon – and making their platforms less efficient places to trade for the bona fide users of algorithms, the big market-makers and big “high-frequency” trading customers.Market-making firms like Getco and Optiver change their prices a lot, generating messages, but they say they are always tradeable quotes. Exchanges want that liquidity, but not the stuff generated by “stupid algos”.Regulators have been concerned for some time about related phenomena such as “quote stuffing”, when large orders are allegedly rapidly entered and then withdrawn, flooding the market with quotes so rivals struggle to cope. Proving that quote stuffing exists as a practice has been hard.But is the straight application of fees on high order-to-trade ratios the answer?Today, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) waded into the debate, revealing what it called “the first full year impact of its high frequency trader (HFT) messaging policy”.ICE seems to be arguing that a simple fee structure is a blunt instrument that could penalise bona fide high-frequency and algorithmic traders.About a year ago ICE implemented a “high frequency messaging policy” for its most heavily traded futures and over-the-counter contracts. It aimed to “discourage inefficient and excessive messaging without compromising market liquidity”.Before then, ICE’s policy – like many other exchanges – was a simple order-to-trade ratio with order levels above which high frequency traders were assessed a fee, explains Mark Wassersug, vice-president of operations.He says this “simplistic approach” failed to differentiate between orders that added to liquidity and those that were “far out of the market”.For the past year ICE has operated a more sophisticated system. It assesses how far away from the best bid and offer the incoming orders are. If the bid or offer is at the current market level, it is not assessed as part of the overall order-to-trade ratio calculation. By definition, orders that are way off the mark get caught.The assumption has to be that you are hitting the “stupid algos” that way.It’s effectively a way of judging quality of liquidity. Exchanges like HFT because it provides liquidity, but if they don’t know what kind of liquidity – or have no ability to filter out “good” from “bad” – then floods of orders are risky liquidity.What’s good about the ICE system – and order-to-trade ratio charges at exchanges generally – is that this is the industry stepping up to provide a solution, not waiting for some fix to emerge through regulatory fiat.With luck, that should result in better quality markets. That is important on a day when the UK government-sponsored “Kay Review” into equity markets reveals a widespread belief in the UK investment community that the liquidity which frequency trading claims to provide is “real”.
338;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-02-23T21:38:09Z;LME delays fee rise after members revolt;;The London Metal Exchange has rolled back an increase in trading fees following a rare public revolt from its members.At a meeting on Thursday, the LME’s board decided that the fee rise, which would more than double the cost of some trades, would be delayed by several months and that short-dated contracts would be exempt.The change of course comes as the 135-year-old exchange, which hosts futures contracts used as global industry benchmarks for base metals from copper to nickel, is considering a sale.One of only a few member-owned exchanges in the world, it is home to Europe’s last trading pit where traders shout orders to each other, and is seen as one of the few prizes left in an increasingly consolidated industry.The watering down of the fee increase is likely to be closely watched by the LME’s suitors, which include CME Group, ICE and NYSE Euronext.An increase in fees at the member-owned LME, which are lower than those at its main competitors, would play an important role in any bidder’s valuation, according to people with knowledge of the process.However, the LME said that the move to exempt contracts for delivery in 15 days or less from the fee increase would have only a small impact on its income. “The effect of the changes are 5 per cent of total forecast revenues,” it said.Such short-dated contracts are popular among the physical metals trading and warehousing community. Some of the LME’s largest shareholders include JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which between them hold more than 20 per cent of the shares and also own warehousing companies.The climbdown on fees comes after a rare public outcry at the LME, where disagreements and scandals are usually kept under wraps.Martin Abbott, LME chief executive, said in January that there was “no provision for a revision” of the decision to raise fees.However, the banks and brokers who use and own the LME have been vocal in their opposition. Three of the exchange’s 12 board directors wrote a letter to fellow members attacking the move, while others privately voiced their concern that it could hurt their business just as the brokerage industry is attempting to recover from the collapse of MF Global.The LME has argued that the fee increase is necessary to allow it to make investments – including the cost of building its own clearing house – and to maximise profitability ahead of the possible sale.“Shareholders will be asked to consider the value of the business at some point in 2012, and it is important that they are able to compare incoming bids with the true value of the business,” Mr Abbott said in a letter to members late last year.
339;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-02-22T19:46:03Z;Prospect of LME’s sale puts focus on clearing;;When the London Metal Exchange said last autumn that it would consider a sale, the move kindled talk of booming investor interest in commodities and the metals price “super-cycle”.But much of the interest in the 135-year-old member-owned exchange is thanks to an altogether more prosaic boom – in the clearing industry.Long seen as the unglamorous plumbing of the financial markets, clearing has moved centre-stage in the wake of the 2008 crisis as regulators insist that clearing houses be used more widely to process over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives in order to provide more security to both parties to a trade.It is also at the heart of discussions over the sale of the LME, whose board meets on Thursday to review first-round bids.The LME, which hosts contracts that serve as the benchmarks for the global metals market, was first approached by a potential buyer after announcing that it was considering building its own clearing house last year, according to people familiar with the process.The addition of a clearing business, which could more than double the LME’s profits, is likely to be a central part of any buyer’s valuation of the exchange, they add.“Clearing is the big project,” Martin Abbott, LME chief executive, said. “It would be our most significant product.”A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, stepping in to ensure that a deal goes ahead even if one party defaults. Clearing houses, or central counterparties (CCPs), earn money by collecting a fee each time a trade is cleared, and by placing collateral deposited with them by market participants in the money markets.The attractions of that potential revenue stream have not been lost on the LME’s suitors. Exchanges such as CME Group, ICE and NYSE Euronext, which are among the roughly seven bidders for the LME, own clearing houses already. “Someone who has an up-and-running clearing house can pay more than someone who has to build one,” says a person familiar with the LME sale.Since the 1980s, the LME’s trades have been cleared by LCH. Clearnet.The focus on clearing at the LME reflects a broader shift in the industry, as exchanges increasingly view having a clearing infrastructure as essential to being able to grow their business.Beyond the additional revenues, having control of a CCP allows exchanges to bring new products to the market far more quickly than if they had to rely on external providers to help them do so.“As important as clearing is financially it’s even more important strategically because it provides futures exchanges with a significant barrier to entry by competitors,” says Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James.The attraction of clearing helps explain the wide gulf between the LME’s 2010 net profits of £9.5m and the apparently heady valuation of up to £1bn being discussed by some industry executives.But by building its own clearing house – a project that was approved by the LME’s board in December – the metals exchange could significantly boost its revenues. The LME generated total revenues of about £50m in 2010, when it last published results, and Mr Abbott says that clearing would add £12m-£13m in revenue from fees alone.“In the right interest rate environment collateral management could give multiples of that,” he adds, estimating that even in with today’s low interest rates the LME could generate an additional £9m-£13m in so-called “treasury income”.Potential buyers that already operate clearing houses could easily expand to clear the LME’s metals contracts, analysts say, significantly boosting profitability.Trevor Spanner, an industry veteran who joined the LME last year to lead its clearing project, says: “You could cut the LME business on to an existing clearing house […] and the rest drops to the bottom line.”For example, when ICE severed its ties with LCH.Clearnet in 2008 it managed to boost the amount of revenue from its benchmark Brent futures from $1.30 per contract to $1.53, according to Mr O’Shaughnessy’s estimates. “That can be directly attributed to them bringing clearing in-house,” he says.Moreover, analysts see clearing as a growth industry in its own right. In the OTC markets in particular, the shift to clearing because of G20 reforms such as the US Dodd-Frank act is likely to bring new business for exchanges that also have clearing.Even if it is not acquired, the LME intends to push ahead with its clearing house. Mr Spanner estimates that the new clearing house would pay for itself within two to three years of its launch, planned for early 2014. “The whole bid process has convinced me of the wider value of clearing,” he says.
340;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-02-22T10:31:08Z;Valuing the London Metal Exchange;LME could be worth as much as £1.4bn;"What price the London Metal Exchange?With the 135-year-old exchange’s board meeting on Thursday to judge the first round bids, that will be the question on everyone’s mind – particularly the shareholders of CME Group, ICE, NYSE Euronext and the other four or so companies that are bidding.Indeed, the £1bn number suggested by some shareholders – and even the £540m implied by JPMorgan’s acquisition of shares in November – appears at first blush to be remarkably high when compared to the LME’s net profit of just £9.5m in 2010.But the LME is tricky to value for two reasons.The first – according to the sales pitch – is that it is unique: the undisputed global leader in metals futures, host of global benchmark contracts for the six most widely traded non-ferrous metals.The second reason is a little more mundane. The LME is not run to maximise profit. It is therefore no simple task to calculate what its revenues would be if it were run more commercially.Numerous conversations with shareholders, bankers and industry executives suggest there are three main areas where a potential buyer could unlock value: by increasing income from trading fees; by bringing clearing in-house; and by cutting costs.Trading feesThe LME’s revenues come from a number of sources, including annual membership fees, charges for providing data, and a 1.1 per cent levy on the warehousing fees charged on LME metal.But the bulk of the income comes from trading fees. And, while there remains some dispute about the details and implementation, it is highly likely that trading fees will soon rise significantly.According to examples provided by the exchange, the overall LME income for a segregated client trade, excluding clearing fees, would rise to 70p from 36p currently, while LME income for a non-segregated client trade would rise to 70p from 27p.Under the new fee structure, which could yet be altered at this week’s board meeting, fees for broker-to-broker trades would be unchanged.The increase in the LME’s overall fee revenue depends on the relative proportions of segregated, non-segregated, and broker-to-broker trades – which the LME does not disclose. Nonetheless, the examples above suggest an increase of somewhere between 50 and 100 per cent. If a popular trade used by traders to square positions – called “tom-next” – is excluded from the fee increase as has been mooted, the overall rise could be as little as 40 per cent.That suggests that, as long as trading volumes do not suffer, increasing fees could single-handedly boost the LME’s bottom line by £15m-£40m.ClearingThe next big piece of the puzzle is clearing – which the LME currently outsources to LCH.Clearnet. The LME is in the early stages of building its own clearing house, due to be finished in early 2014. If it were bought by an exchange which already owns a clearing house, it could take its business out of LCH.Clearnet much sooner.Clearing could make a large difference to the LME’s profits, and the additional operating cost of plugging LME trades into an existing clearing house would be minimal, industry executives say.From clearing fees alone, the LME would pick up an additional £12m-£13m (the amount that LCH.Clearnet earned last year from clearing LME trades). Moreover, it could earn “multiples of that” by investing collateral, according to Martin Abbott, the LME’s chief executive. In a low interest rate environment like today’s, “treasury income” would still amount to 75-100 per cent of the fee income, he says.That means, conservatively, clearing could add £15m-£20m to the LME’s bottom line if it is bought by a company that already owns a clearing house. If interest rates rise, net income from the clearing business could rise to £30m or more – although that is likely to be offset somewhat by a fall in trading volumes when the era of easy money ends.CostsIf the LME is bought by another exchange, it is likely to be able to cut some costs – or at least halt the 20-30 per cent annual increase in the LME’s cost base of the past few years. By way of comparison, when ICE bought the New York Board of Trade in 2006, it succeeded in cutting costs by 30 per cent within two years, according to Niamh Alexander of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.If the LME’s buyer wielded its knife with the same success, it could reduce costs by about £12m.Put all that together and the LME’s net income could rise to £40m at the more conservative end, or as much as £90m on the most bullish assumptions.Throw in the value of the LME’s stake in LCH.Clearnet (unnecessary if the LME clears its own trades), which is worth £55m at the price the London Stock Exchange is offering for the clearer. Put the LME on a multiple of 15 times forward earnings (roughly where CME and ICE are trading). And, for the right buyer, the metals exchange would be worth £650m-£1.4bn (£50-£110 a share) – before a possible bidding war.All of which makes JPMorgan’s purchase of shares in November at £41.92 a share look like a smart trade. And it makes Goldman Sachs’ purchase of shares last summer for less than £5 look like a steal."
341;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-02-21T09:03:32Z;ICE makes UK carbon platform bid;;Three of the world’s largest exchanges are among those bidding to win the contract to auction Britain’s emissions trading allowances, after IntercontinentalExchange on Monday confirmed it had submitted a tender.ICE Futures Europe, the London-based operations of the US futures exchange, also said that UK regulators had given it recognised auction platform status, a stepping-stone to allow the platform to conduct carbon permit auctions.Brussels is reorganising rules governing carbon emissions trading from January as part of its ambitions plans to cut greenhouse gases under the Kyoto protocol. Under the so-called Phase III of the Emissions Trading Scheme, the European Union wants to sell most of its allowances. Since its inception in 2005, it has given them away for free.To cope with the shift, the EU is building its own centralised auctioning platform but three of Europe’s three biggest polluters – the UK, Germany and Poland – have opted to conduct their own national auctions. They have tendered for bidders to operate them. Analysts have estimated more than half of the 2.3bn metric tons of allowances may be sold on exchanges next year.The UK deadline passed on Friday. ICE Futures, the region’s largest carbon trading platform, is in competition to host the UK platform with European Energy Exchange (EEX), controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Börse. A decision from the UK government is expected in April. BlueNext, a venture founded by Caisse des Depots and NYSE Euronext, has also submitted a tender. GreenX, the exchange partly owned by CME Group, has decided not to bid for of the auctions as it doubts operating the auction platform will make commercial sense.ICE Futures confirmed it had submitted a tender to the Department of Energy & Climate Change and added it planned to put forward a tender for the European platform.“ICE Futures Europe is well positioned to provide European auction facilities, fulfilling requirements which are an important aspect of Phase III,” said David Peniket, president of ICE Futures Europe.The auction for the UK trading platform comes as the European carbon trading market faces the most difficult period of its short life. Contracts have hit record lows of €6 this year after the market was hit by a succession of scandals and investor concerns about slowing eurozone economies. Furthermore the inclusion of the aviation industry in the emissions trading programme has exacerbated oversupply of permits.ICE Futures is Europe’s most liquid market, accounting for 90 per cent of all European emissions trades.
342;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-02-16T23:26:02Z;NYSE Euronext and CME kick off race for LME;;NYSE Euronext and CME Group, the two US exchange groups, have submitted bids for the London Metal Exchange, valuing it at up to £1bn and kicking off a contest for the commodities business, according to people familiar with the matter.The 135-year-old exchange, which hosts futures contracts used as global industry benchmarks for base metals from copper to nickel, is one of the last member-owned exchanges in the world. It is home to Europe’s last trading pit – known at the LME as the ring – where traders shout orders to each other.The LME, which is owned by the banks and brokers that use it, announced in September that it had received preliminary expressions of interest from 10 potential suitors.One person familiar with the sale process said that roughly half of the 15 or so companies that looked at the LME’s books had made an offer for the exchange in the first round of bidding that closed on Wednesday. IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), CME’s main rival and long seen as a frontrunner for the LME, had also submitted a bid and has hired JPMorgan as adviser, according to one person. ICE declined to comment.The preliminary bids, which are likely to be honed in the coming months, offer valuations for the exchange roughly in line with the £1bn that had been mooted by shareholders last year, though one person described that number as ­“aspirational”.The LME’s board will meet to consider the bids on Thursday February 23. The idea of a sale has divided the LME’s members with some members reluctant to give up control of the exchange while others are keen to profit from their shareholdings. Shareholders would enjoy a windfall if the sale went ahead, with a valuation of £1bn representing more than 15 times the last traded price before the sale process was announced.Several potential suitors, including Deutsche Börse, decided not to bid, the people said, with the London Stock Exchange also unlikely to bid. CME Group, long seen as a frontrunner, and NYSE had submitted a “first round” bid, they said. Some bidders may have been put off by a public dispute among the LME’s board members about a decision to raise trading fees, in part designed to maximise the LME’s profitability ahead of a potential takeover.NYSE Euronext was not previously seen as a likely bidder, in part because it was heavily involved in an attempted tie-up with Deutsche Börse, a deal that collapsed this month.However, it is interested in the LME because of a possible fit with its existing soft and agricultural commodity derivatives business, part of NYSE Liffe – the former London International Financial Futures Exchange. That includes coffee, sugar, cocoa and wheat futures. The LME and NYSE Liffe already use many of the same warehouses for delivery of commodities.The US exchange would also be able to send trades done on the LME for clearing at NYSE Liffe Clear, a fledgling clearing house that NYSE Euronext is building in London. Being able to combine the trading and clearing of securities under one roof is increasingly important to exchanges as they seek new sources of profits.Ownership of the LME is restricted to its 93 members. The largest shareholders are JPMorgan Chase with a 10.9 per cent stake, Goldman Sachs with 9.5 per cent, and Metdist, a family-owned metals trader, with 9.4 per cent. Those three companies could between them block the sale, since any offer needs 75 per cent shareholder support.JPMorgan last November bought the shares that had been owned by bankrupt brokerage MF Global in a deal valuing the exchange at about £530m.The LME’s shareholders are likely to be more concerned about preserving the status quo of the exchange’s business model as they are about the value of the bids, numerous shareholders have told the FT. Maintaining parts of the LME’s infrastructure such as its network of registered warehouses and the complex structure of its futures contracts are likely to be critical.The LME is being advised by Moelis & Co. The companies declined to comment.
343;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:41:20+0000;Carbon market: there’s still time;With another phase of the trading scheme on the way, there is hope yet;A few little things separate a gold medal sprinter from an also-ran. The same applies to the European Union’s carbon emissions trading scheme. When it pioneered the idea of a fully fledged carbon trading market in 2005, the EU envisaged that a price of about €40 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted would encourage big polluters, such as power generators, to invest in clean energy. With the current price at under €8, that looks like seriously wishful thinking. Yet the market is not irretrievably broken. With another phase of the trading scheme due to begin next year, there are a few things regulators could usefully do to turn carbon trading into a proper market.The collapse in the carbon price to one quarter of its 2008 level is due to poor decision-making by the scheme’s operators, and to a handful of scandals. It also faces strong corporate opposition. Chinese and US airlines, for example, are protesting at being forced to buy carbon trading permits.Useful solutions to some of these problems have been proposed by regulators for the third phase of the scheme. These include centralising permit allocation and the greater use of auctions rather than allocations. A few further changes could help even more. One is to boost transparency. Currently, the results of emission permit auctions are provided to a select group of banks rather than the broader market. For example, the European Investment Bank announced only last Thursday that it had sold (over the counter) 1.5m permits on each of three days in January.Furthermore, about 90 per cent of on-exchange emission trading is conducted on IntercontinentalExchange, which charges €3.50 per trade for the most common emissions contract. That is eight times the cost of trading the contract on UK natural gas. If regulators did more to encourage competition and lower prices, traders – notably hedge funds – would be more interested in giving the carbon trading market the boost it needs to survive.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
344;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-02-10T19:47:32Z;NYSE sets ‘full service’ clearing house for London;;NYSE Euronext has pledged to make building up a “full service” clearing house in London a priority as the US-exchange operator sought to draw a line under its failed tie-up with Deutsche Börse.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE chief executive, said the group’s portfolio of clearing businesses would be “a key focus” this year, as G20 regulations designed to expand use of clearing in the vast over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets move towards completion.“Our immediate focus in 2012 will be Europe …and the build out of Liffe Clear [in London] and of new OTC clearing solutions,” Mr Niederauer told analysts on a fourth-quarter earnings conference call. Developing the post-trade business would be “critical for us in 2012”.His comments come as rivals have been expanding into clearing, a crucial post-trade process that helps guarantee that securities and derivatives trades are completed even if one party defaults.Clearing, especially in London, has become a priority for many of the world’s exchanges as they see a business opportunity in offering clearing services as more activity is forced to be cleared through post-2008 crisis regulations.London is already home to clearing houses recently set up by NYSE rivals IntercontinentalExchange and CME Group, both of which are using the UK capital as a beachhead to push into Europe. The London Stock Exchange is in exclusive talks with LCH.Clearnet, an Anglo-French clearer based in London, about taking a controlling stake .NYSE Euronext has a fledgling clearing house in London known as NYSE Liffe Clear but it shares some of the clearing of the Liffe futures exchange’s derivatives with LCH. Clearnet.The aim is to convert NYSE Liffe Clear into a “full-service” clearer that would not only handle Liffe’s futures contracts but also offer clearing of OTC derivatives. Part of Liffe Clear’s expansion would require altering the relationship with LCH. Clearnet.At present, Liffe derivatives are processed through Liffe Clear, but the treasury and risk management services – the heart of what a clearing house does – are outsourced to LCH. Clearnet.“We want to get all the revenues, and then have a platform to launch new products like over-the-counter interest rate and credit [default] swaps,” said Michael Geltzeiler, chief financial officer of NYSE Euronext, in an interview. He said the group would lay out specific details at an analyst meeting in early April.NYSE said its Liffe US futures market, launched last year to compete against CME Group, was expected to become profitable in 2013 after the roll-out of new products this year. NYSE also was looking at “the possible addition of new partners” at a US clearing house that clears Liffe US products and is run jointly with Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, the dominant securities post-trade group in the country.Mr Niederauer said that NYSE was still “in a position to grow through strategic M&A”, pointing out that it had cut its net debt to earnings before interest, debt, tax and amortisation ratio to 1.6 times – the lowest level since before the NYSE group bought Euronext, the European network of stock exchanges, in 2007.The group’s net income in the fourth quarter fell from $135m to $110m after charges of $46m for merger expenses and exit costs, mostly related to the Deutsche Börse deal. “I don’t regret what we tried to do for a second. It’s onward and upward from here,” Mr Niederauer said.Pressure on NYSE also came from weak trading volumes, especially in Europe. Net revenues from derivatives fell 1 per cent from a year ago to $186m. However, turnover in its technology business, which sells trading software and direct connections to the exchange, grew 16 per cent over last year to $127m.
345;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Brazil eyes expansion in OTC trades;;Brazil’s main exchange operator, BM&FBovespa, has signalled ambitions to expand into the over-the-counter derivatives business with plans to develop a platform for storing electronic records of OTC trades.The move comes as G20 economies outside the US and Europe are muscling in on opportunities thrown up by reforms enacted after the 2008 crisis designed to clean up the financial system, especially the OTC derivatives markets.Legislation such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US mandates that “standardised” OTC derivatives be traded on exchanges or new platforms known as “swap execution facilities” (SEFs), while similar rules working their way through Europe would do the same.That is designed to shift them from the control of big banks that long controlled pricing of such instruments and on to more formally organised trading systems, where prices could be seen more easily by a wider set of market participants and by regulators.Regulators also want electronic records of all OTC derivatives to be reported to and stored at “trade repositories”, to create an audit trail of trading activity.BM&FBovespa is building a trade repository for OTC products as part of a $600m, four-year project that started in 2010. That involves creating a new trading system for equities and derivatives, integrating the group’s four clearing houses into one, and building a data centre for high-frequency traders, said Eduardo Guardia, the group’s chief financial officer.“OTC products are less than 1 per cent of our revenues at the moment, but we do see an interesting opportunity in the OTC business in Brazil,” he said in an interview at City Week, a conference in London.BM&FBovespa in November hired Calypso, a US technology company, to develop the OTC repository.OTC derivatives markets are tiny in Brazil, partly because the country’s regulations have ensured that most financial instruments be traded on an exchange after the collapse of the Rio de Janeiro exchange in the 1980s. That left Brazil with one of the most robust, transparent market structures in emerging economies.But the G20 push to move OTC derivatives on to more formal platforms has been seized on by exchanges and clearing houses elsewhere as an opportunity, with Eurex Clearing, the clearer owned by Deutsche Börse, set in March to launch clearing of OTC interest rate swaps.CME Group, which owns 5 per cent of BM&FBovespa, IntercontinentalExchange and LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear unit are already active in OTC derivatives clearing.Mr Guardia said that once the consolidation of the four clearing houses at BM&FBovespa was complete, this would save market participants in foreign exchange, equities and derivatives up to 40 per cent in reduced collateral expense.The new clearing system would use a new risk management system that would allow BM&FBovespa to see all traders’ positions. Mr Guardia said that such a feature was all the more important after the collapse of MF Global, the US futures broker, which highlighted shortcomings in the US futures industry.
346;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-02-08T14:28:20Z;ICE says China backing US futures trades;;Chinese banks are filling in for European lenders in US agricultural finance, helping preserve trading activity in sugar and other commodities in the wake of MF Global’s collapse, according to a US exchange chief.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), told analysts that volumes in its US futures business, formerly the New York Board of Trade, had been affected by MF’s bankruptcy last year, as it was one of the largest sugar brokers in the market.However, he said that volumes for ICE Futures US had rebounded, in part because while European banks had been pulling back from lending to US agricultural businesses, Chinese banks were emerging to provide that finance. Businesses needed to pay for hedging expenses and for warehouse space“A bigger impact [than MF Global] has been restructuring of European banks,” said Mr Sprecher. “But what we have seen in recent times is that gap is being filled by new banks coming into this market. We have started to see a recovery of open interest …in sugar.”Data from the exchange show that open interest in sugar has rebounded to some 695,000 contracts after bottoming out at fewer than 500,000 contracts leading up to MF’s bankruptcy in late October. ICE Futures US still saw a 7 per cent decline in average daily volume in the fourth quarter on last year.However, strong commodities trading across US and UK markets run by ICE, drove an rise in profits and revenues. Net income rose 28 per cent on the year to $127m, on the back of a 15 per cent jump in revenues to $327m.ICE’s shares rose 5.8 per cent to $129.79, their highest level since last October.While rival CME Group, which also had large markets in financial futures, saw its volumes fall 2 per cent in the fourth quarter on the previous year, ICE’s overall average daily volumes rose 12 per cent in futures and 10 per cent in over-the-counter derivative markets.The exchange has benefited from a shift in oil trading from US West Texas Intermediate as the universal benchmark, which is primarily traded by CME, to many traders looking at Brent crude, which is traded by ICE Futures Europe in London.Mr Sprecher said that natural gas trading volumes were holding up despite record low prices for gas in the US following a boom of drilling in shale formations, because worries about storage capacity were driving longer-term hedging activity.“OTC energy commissions for January …running above $2m a day mark a big surprise given expected headwinds from low natural gas prices,” said Alex Kramm, analyst at UBS.This article is subject to a correction and has been amended.

We see upside from less exposure to Europe and a potential transaction tax”.Mr Rutschow added that other incumbents could benefit from the collapse of the deal.“If the merger had gone through, there would have been concern that Nasdaq in particular was becoming an also ran in the exchange space globally, but now competitors are under less pressure to do their own deals.”CME Group climbed 2.5 per cent to $245.41, Nasdaq OMX gained a cent to close at $24.77, although shares were hit by fall in fourth quarter net income, and IntercontinentalExchange was up 0.2 per cent to $114.69.Elsewhere, Wall Street was back in tune with global markets, as US stocks climbed higher after a rash of positive global manufacturing survey data.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent to 1,324.08, back once again into bull market territory, although the index tended to face resistance from sellers taking profit whenever it moved above 1,325 in January.Banks led the rally with Morgan Stanley up 4 per cent to $19.39, as reports gathered momentum that the investment bank has won the race to be the lead underwriter of Facebook’s IPO.Goldman Sachs lagged behind, up just 1.8 per cent to $113.45, on suggestions it may also have been beaten by JPMorgan to the role of second underwriter in the Facebook deal.Large commercial banks also climbed, with Citigroup up 2.9 per cent to $31.60 and Bank of America climbing 3.2 per cent to $7.36 on reports states’ attorneys-general may be looking at a comprehensive deal on mortgage-related litigation that has been hanging over bank stocks since the financial crisis.Amazon shares fell 7.7 per cent to $179.46 after the company’s fourth-quarter results disappointed on Tuesday evening. Wall Street had been primed for a fall in margins, as the online retailer has pursued growth through heavy spending on its Fire tablet and promotions, but analysts were taken aback by a fall in revenue and sales growth.Brian Nowak at Nomura was equally concerned about the company’s cautious outlook.“This is the seventh straight quarter in which Amazon’s forward . . . guidance has come in below the Street, and the second consecutive quarter where the midpoint of revenue missed guidance. We are lowering our forward estimates,” he told clients.Broadcom climbed 8.1 per cent to $37.13, with management upbeat on the company’s current quarter prospects, without quite calling a bottom to the semiconductor market. That was vindication for analysts who had called for investors to buy the stock in the wake of Apple’s blockbuster results.JPMorgan analysts once again picked out Broadcom’s supplier relationship to Apple smartphones and tablets as they predicted the company will “outgrow the overall semiconductor market [in 2012]”.Whirlpool shares soared 13.5 per cent to $61.64, approaching levels last seen in July, before last summer’s market sell-off. Quarterly profit at the dishwasher manufacturer surged by a fifth on cost savings.Marathon Petroleum shares climbed 9.6 per cent to $41.88, as the company announced a $2bn share buy-back programme. Shares in refiners have slumped in recent weeks after a succession of oil companies announced collapsing margins on refining operations, as the discount of WTI to Brent crude fell in the fourth quarter, increasing input costs for refiners.Shares in hard disc drive manufacturer Western Digital climbed 4.6 per cent to $38.03, as profits at its rival Seagate Technology surged. Seagate shares climbed 20.8 per cent to $25.53.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 12,716.46, and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.2 per cent to 2,848.27.Gas exploration and production companies sold off again, as natural gas prices reversed their recent rally. Chesapeake Energy fell 0.8 per cent to $20.97, Southwestern Energy was off 2.3 per cent to $30.41 and EQT Corp was off 1.1 per cent to $49.98.Chesapeake, among other companies, has announced cuts in production this year in a bid to put a floor under gas prices.
348;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-02-01T17:05:29Z;Nasdaq upbeat over bourse tie-ups;;Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, sees continued opportunity for global exchange consolidation under the right circumstances, in spite of the collapse of the Deutsche Börse-NYSE merger.“We do not believe this ruling will preclude other large exchange deals from happening,” he told analysts on Wednesday.Nasdaq, like NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, has been an aggressive but thwarted operator in global exchange consolidation, as the operators of marketplaces have sought to fend off competition and falling volumes by joining forces.It has seen two significant deals blocked, including a counterbid alongside IntercontinentalExchange to buy NYSE Euronext, which was turned down by US anti-trust authorities, and an attempt to take over the London Stock Exchange in 2007, rejected by shareholders.However, Mr Greifeld said that the lesson was that only certain types of deals were doomed to fail, notably those that would create near-monopolies in a single market, such as futures for DB-NYSE, or US listings for Nasdaq-NYSE.“Our rejection and DB-NYSE’s rejection sends a clear message that a transaction that results in 90 per cent market share is suspect. But there is compelling industrial logic in combining …non-overlapping exchanges,” he added.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Greifeld declined to say that Nasdaq was considering a fresh approach for the LSE, but noted that it would not be precluded.“You have in the UK, like you have in the US, a proper environment where they will consider or approve exchange mergers. The London market place is a fair and open market,” he said.He added: “It’s important to realise that [the DB-NYSE deal] was approved on the US side. It’s a clear example that the entire world can buy the NYSE, even if we cannot.”At present, Mr Greifeld said, Nasdaq was focused on what he termed “bolt-in” acquisitions that aim to profit from market regulation and falling technology spending by large banks.Nasdaq’s core quarterly earnings topped forecasts despite volume declines in US and European equities and only small gains in derivatives trading.Earnings were $113m for the quarter, defying analysts’ forecasts of zero growth over last year’s earnings of $110m in the same period. Nasdaq shares rose 1.3 per cent to $25.08.
349;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;ICE to combine margins for CDS clearing;Waiting on regulatory approval to extend to banks’ customers;"The IntercontinentalExchange will begin allowing banks to combine the margin used to clear trades in single-name and indices of credit default swaps, but is still waiting on regulatory approval to allow banks’ customers to do so.The move follows the Dodd-Frank Act’s requirement that many over-the-counter swap trades be cleared through a central counterparty and its allowance for so-called ""portfolio margining” that would allow clearing participants to use the margin posted for one trade to also be used for similar bets.Clearing houses are also seeking approval to allow customers of the banks, such as hedge funds and asset managers, to use the new service. ICE expects to do so once it has received the necessary approvals, a spokesperson said.The Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates single-name CDS securities, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates CDS index products, have yet to approve the expansion to customers.ICE filed a letter with the CFTC that responded to regulators’ concerns related to the collapse of MF Global, which has heightened scrutiny of clearing houses’ management of customer assets, following accusations that MF allegedly allowed protected customer monies to disappear.

“Customers would prefer to maintain all of their OTC-cleared derivatives in a single account to avoid different and uncoordinated treatment of their positions in an insolvency proceeding,” ICE said. “If anything, the MF Global insolvency reinforces the desirability of [the proposal].”

ICE Credit Clear has quickly become the dominant central counterparty for CDS trading, having launched in 2009. Credit default indices and single-name swaps are ideal for such margining, ICE has said, because the indices hold much of the same risk as their underlying components.



The expanded proposal is backed by asset management groups, which are aiming to become more direct participants in swaps markets as a result of centralised clearing, in some ways displacing the banks as the key intermediaries.Steven Chittenden, director of investment operations at Loomis, Sayles & Company, said in a CFTC comment letter on behalf of the Association of Institutional Investors, “Inequality will result from permitting proprietary accounts to pay the reduced margin amounts that result from portfolio margining while requiring customer accounts to remain fully margined, creating a significant economic barrier to customer open access to clearing.”The banks, despite the challenge from their clients, have not opposed their proposals. A comment letter filed by global banks including Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas and Nomura, called customer margining “good for the marketplace”.Other clearing houses are also moving to allow cross-margining in other over-the-counter markets.
The CME Group expects to begin offering swap margining against Treasury and eurodollar futures in the first half of the year for banks and in the second half for customers.New York Portfolio Clearing, partly owned by NYSE Euronext’s Liffe US futures exchange, is also hoping to clear swaps and could extend its existing cross-margining futures clearing to swaps as well."
350;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-01-24T20:44:50Z;Quick View: Last-minute lifeline or false hope?;Barnier or Almunia? Brussels right or wrong?;"As my Brussels-based colleague Alex Barker reports, Michel Barnier, Europe’s heavyweight head of the region’s internal markets, has reserved the right to oppose his antitrust colleagues in Brussels, who are saying the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext deal should be blocked. Meaning: he may come out and say it should be allowed after all.It is potentially a big development and the only bit of good news the two exchanges have had since it became clear that Joaquín Almunia, competition commissioner, was dead set against the deal.The feeling in Brussels – where I have just spent two days – is that the two groups badly misjudged Mr Almunia’s determination – from quite early on in the process – to turn the deal down.His department made clear that the combination of Eurex and Liffe, the groups’ two derivatives exchanges, would not only control a whopping 95 per cent of the listed (ie exchange-traded) derivatives markets in Europe, but would stifle new entrants.On strictly antitrust terms, Mr Almunia’s staff are absolutely correct.It is also impossible to argue against someone saying: “More competition is good, right?”But here’s a funny thing: a lot of people I spoke with in Brussels, while they accepted that point, said that Brussels was also wrong.They pointed out that the listed derivatives market simply cannot be treated as solely “European” and that it is global. This is, of course, the line that D Börse/NYSE are hammering home in their frenetic lobbying campaign, which kicks into high gear on the snowy slopes of Davos, where the World Economic Form is convening.Yes, there is a universe of hedgers who have euro exposure and need to hedge that exposure. The only place they can do that is on Eurex/Liffe. And the only place you can trade German Bund futures is Eurex. Ditto euribor futures in Liffe (assuming you dismiss the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s recently launched rival euribor contract as not that serious or practical an alternative).But, equally, Liffe’s biggest product, euribor, operates at the short end of the interest rate yield curve, the opposite end to Eurex’s biggest product, German Bund, Bobl and Schatz futures. And don’t tell me that the shifting of the Bund contract in the 1990s from Liffe in London to Eurex in Frankfurt was a result of “competition” between them; that happened because the contract was repatriated with a lot of help from the German banks, as many people involved at the time will tell you (how else do you shift “open interest” from one platform to another in futures markets?).I am not privy to Mr Barnier’s thinking but, as the guy with a 30,000ft view of markets, market infrastructures and a need to deal with his US and Asian counterparts regularly as part of his day job, he may see that D Börse and NYSE have a point.I also suspect that as a sceptic when it comes to the value of off-exchange or over-the-counter markets (and that probably puts it mildly), he sees the creation of a mega European exchange, carrying with it the reassuring labels of “transparency” and “fully regulated”, as the perfect antidote to the “opaque” and “unregulated” OTC markets.We know Mr Barnier’s views on the OTC markets from his statements on Mifid II (the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), whose thrust is to shift as much OTC trading on to exchanges and other formal platforms as possible.What Mr Barnier’s possible intervention shows is that, rightly or wrongly, there is more to the D Börse/NYSE deal than a narrow definition of the derivatives market and that definition being “Europe”.In fact, there are some I spoke with in Brussels who fear that the way the antitrust people have defined the market has sent the wrong signal globally, that Europe is too blinkered to see beyond its own borders when, patently, the derivatives markets are global. There are suggestions of narrow protectionism.And exchanges that are looking beyond the D Börse/NYSE deal – and its possible collapse – are very keen to understand what is going on because Brussels’ market definition could imply significant limitations on what they might do, M&A-wise, in Europe in future. Think of IntercontinentalExchange , which has a clearing house in London and runs what used to be the International Petroleum Exchange. And of CME Group, which also has a clearing house in London. Both have ambitions in Europe.On balance, I still think the deal is probably doomed. But this latest twist shows there are ramifications that go far beyond the deal itself. Which makes it all the more fascinating and difficult to call."
351;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-01-20T16:51:40Z;HKEx targets commodities trading;;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) has signalled its ambition to break into the commodities markets in a move that would pit it against heavyweight incumbents CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE).The move comes as there is increasing interest globally in the HKEx’s plans to expand beyond its core business of initial public offerings, equities and expansion into renminbi-related services.The exchange is the world’s largest by the market capitalisation of the exchange as a listed entity, ahead of CME Group and BM&FBovespa, the Brazilian bourse operator. It also has a strong balance sheet, potentially making it a player in global exchange consolidation.HKEx has consistently played down expectations that it may be preparing to go on the acquisition trail, or to make bold moves into new business lines.However Charles Li, HKEx chief executive, said in Hong Kong on Thursday that HKEx “had the opportunity to lead Hong Kong in to new asset classes”. Commodities was next on HKEx’s list.Mr Li said that China’s influence and relevance in commodities was larger than it had been and the country needed access to financial and commodity derivatives markets in renminbi and in the Asian time zone.He said moving into commodities was “an extension of [the] Hong Kong value proposition ‘China meets international’ to new asset classes”, but acknowledged that this was a “globally competitive sector”.On Friday CME and Mysteel, a Chinese company providing market data in ferrous metals, said they had agreed to develop risk management products for the ferrous industry based on Mysteel’s data services. The products would be listed by Nymex, owned by CME Group, and cleared through CME’s clearing house.Mr Li said: “Although commodities may prove to be the most difficult, the opportunity is also the greatest.”
352;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-01-16T21:11:52Z;Bovespa clearing stranglehold faces challenge;;Direct Edge, the fourth-largest US exchange operator, has insisted that access to clearing at Brazil’s biggest exchange operator should be opened up in the interest of competition.BM&FBovespa, which runs a near monopoly on equities and derivatives trading, is refusing to open its clearing arm to outsiders in a stance rivals say will stifle competition.The issue has become a focus of traders interested in the Brazilian market since competition against established exchanges has swept most other markets, with few barriers to usage of clearing systems.Australia’s exchange last year faced competition from Chi-X Global, an alternative trading system, but is allowing the system to use its clearing services – for a fee.Direct Edge said in November that it would launch an electronic equities exchange platform in Rio de Janeiro by the end of this year. Rival BATS Global Markets, which operates the third-largest US stock exchange, has said it is considering launching an equities trading platform.Both would compete against Bovespa, but would first need to have a solution for the clearing of trades done on their platforms. Clearing is part of the essential post-trade process that helps guarantee that deals go ahead even if one party in a trade defaults.Direct Edge’s hopes of using Bovespa’s clearer appeared to have been dashed late last year after Bovespa chief executive Edemir Pinto told the Financial Times that the company was not interested in providing services to third parties.He said Bovespa was concentrating on investing in technology and services for its own customers.A few days later the Brazilian market regulator, CVM, announced its backing for a study by London-based consultancy Oxera Consulting on efficiency and competition in Brazilian capital markets.Anthony Barchetto, Direct Edge head of strategy, said he hoped the study would recommend that newcomers be given access to the existing clearing corporation. “It is only logical that if you want the benefits of competition, the benefits of transparency, that you would open the existing clearing facility to various competition,” he told the FT.Mr Barchetto said the company had already approached Bovespa about gaining access to its clearing house, CBLC. He said that while Direct Edge was pursuing other options, its preferred route was to use CBLC, which he said would better fit the requirements of CVM for greater market transparency.Brazilian regulators are proud of their market’s system of ensuring that the ultimate beneficiaries of all trades are known to the authorities.“Ultimately, it is really regulators that lay out rules of the game and how they want competition in the capital markets to work, so we believe that with this study coming out and looking at the efficiency of the Brazilian market, especially on clearing, there would need to be some level of government involvement if we were to have access to CBLC,” Mr Barchetto said.Foreign interest in Brazil’s market infrastructures was further underlined last July when IntercontinentalExchange, the US futures and commodities exchange and operator of clearing houses, bought a 12.5 per cent stake in Cetip, the Brazilian post-trade services group, for $512m.
353;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-01-15T15:17:50Z;D Börse and NYSE investors face failure;;Like fans watching a football team struggle to salvage a point in the dying minutes of a losing match, investors in NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse appear increasingly resigned to the failure of the two exchange’s year-long attempt to combine.The US and German exchange operators are lobbying EU politicians to override a recommendation by EU antitrust staff that their plan to create the world’s largest bourse would stifle competition in European derivatives markets, and should not proceed.Attention is already shifting to whether a wave of exchange consolidation that had all but fizzled out on antitrust and political hurdles could spring back to life.The focus is on London, a hot spot given that it is home to two market infrastructures that are both available and have global heft: LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French clearing house and the London Metal Exchange.That may seem surprising, given that the exchange landscape is littered with failed deals. The London Stock Exchange’s attempted tie-up with TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses, and a deal between the Singapore and Australian exchanges evaporated last year.But deals are still possible says Roger Barton, managing director of Financial Reform Consultancy. “Far from dampening down consolidation, a failure of DB/NYSE could re-invigorate it. The drivers – economies of scale and globalisation – are still there, even though people are acutely aware of the competition issues.”Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, argues that failure for the DB/NYSE plan “should not affect mergers that are smaller in scale or geographic focus, such as nationally focused or bolt-on transactions”.He cites potential deals involving LCH.Clearnet and the LME – which has acknowledged approaches from bidders – as well as the ongoing merger between the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Osaka Securities Exchange.The LSE has been in exclusive talks since September with LCH.Clearnet about taking a controlling stake in the clearer which processes UK share and derivatives deals done on the UK bourse.The Singapore Exchange is seen as a likely player in London and is believed to be considering using its formidable balance sheet to join forces with the LSE in its LCH.Clearnet venture or target the LME – or a combination of both.Yet LCH.Clearnet could still make an attractive target for NYSE Euronext.Aside from NYSE Liffe Clear, a small London clearing operation, NYSE has few clearing assets to speak of and needs them as the trend towards exchange ownership of post-trade assets continues.This month NYSE rival Nasdaq OMX took control of the central securities depository in Lithuania, adding to its existing ownership of such post-trade businesses in Latvia and Estonia.By getting its hands on LCH.Clearnet, NYSE would gain control over a clearing house for its Euronext network of stock markets in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal. It would also own the clearer for its Liffe derivatives exchange, whose flagship euribor interest rate futures is one of the most widely traded derivatives products.As a next step, NYSE could offer customers the ability to clear euribor together with over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps, which are already cleared at LCH.Clearnet through its SwapClear clearing service, operated together with key banks in the swaps markets.Moreover NYSE is no stranger to LCH.Clearnet’s business. It was briefly a junior partner with Markit, a UK-based financial information company, in a bid to secure the exclusivity that the LSE eventually won with LCH.Clearnet.It also has roughly half of a 17 per cent stake in the clearer, the rest of which is held by the LME. Market participants hold the remaining 83 per cent.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, estimates that NYSE has about $300m cash and could add up to $500m in debt and still have a debt to ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) ratio of less than two times.LCH.Clearnet is hard to value given its not-for-profit structure but the LSE‘s offer may value it at up to €1bn.As for other scenarios, some observers see Deutsche Börse making another attempt to take over the LSE, while Nasdaq chief executive Bob Greifeld’s long-held interest in the LSE remains a possibility – as does reviving interest in LCH.Clearnet, after he abandoned pursuit of a minority stake at the time of the Markit/NYSE and LSE approaches.Deals may also emerge in the US. Mr O’Shaughnessy suggests NYSE may go for the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or MarketAxess, a US-listed government and corporate bond electronic trading platform.Indeed, such is the attraction of Liffe in London that NYSE itself may prove a target. IntercontinentalExchange, US operator of futures and OTC platforms and clearing houses, has long eyed Liffe as a way of securing a European futures trading business.Mr Repetto says: “We view a NYSE combination with ICE as a possibility given ICE management’s clear attraction to the financial futures business, ICE’s clearing capability and expertise and complementary product set of the two.”
354;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-01-13T17:51:32Z;Quick View: Let the games begin, again;Two weeks from a decision by European antitrust officials;What happens next in the industry if the planned Deutsche Börse/NYSE Euronext merger fails?Two weeks from a decision by European antitrust officials, it’s not too early to speculate.First, the rationale for the London Stock Exchange-LCH.Clearnet tie-up is weakened.One of the reasons for the UK bourse’s interest was that, if DB/NYSE were to happen, there would be all the more reason for the LSE to build up its own post-trade infrastructure too. DB/NYSE is also a eurozone play, and neutral if not negative for London.That is not to say the LSE wants to create a “vertical silo” in the way that Deutsche Börse is. The LSE says it would certainly control LCH.Clearnet from an ownership perspective, but it would be open to competitors in a way that the German silo is not.But the LSE probably hopes DB/NYSE goes ahead.That would also allow the LSE to snap up the continental European equity options businesses that DB/NYSE have offered to offload as a remedy. Either the LSE gets this business, or BATS Chi-X Europe does.The other risk of the deal failing, for the LSE, is you could then see NYSE Euronext making a bid for LCH. Clearnet. Aside from NYSE Liffe Clear, NYSE has no clearing assets to speak of and needs them.NYSE has also declared its ambition to build a Paris-based cash equities clearer, as part of plans this year to cease using LCH.Clearnet as clearer for that. It has already partly withdrawn its futures business from LCH.Clearnet, doing its own clearing at London-based NYSE Liffe Clear.Worth remembering that NYSE Euronext was a junior partner in Markit’s failed bid – against the LSE – for exclusive talks with LCH. Clearnet. And NYSE used to be a 15 per cent shareholder in LCH.Clearnet, so is no stranger to the business.And here’s another interesting wrinkle: LCH.Clearnet – the holding company – may be incorporated in the UK but has a French watchdog, the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel, as its primary regulator, not the UK’s Financial Services Authority. LCH.Clearnet has never really managed to make the 2003 merger of Paris-based Clearnet and London’s LCH work properly. And as an astute observer has pointed out to me, the French regulator may prefer to deal with an exchange owner that has a stronger interest in the French market.Nasdaq OMX was also in the running, late last year, for LCH. Clearnet. Bob Greifeld saw a bid as a way of preserving the “horizontal” clearing model in Europe amid the prospect of a DB/NYSE tie-up, which would significantly strengthen the silo. Might Nasdaq come back in, or even have another go at the LSE? Possible.Then there is SGX, the Singapore exchange. It has a strong balance sheet and probably cannot pass up the chance to secure a London-based asset – by teaming up with the LSE on its LCH.Clearnet venture and/or in a bid for the London Metal Exchange.Deals may suddenly spring back to life in the US. Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James in the US, suggests that NYSE may go for the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or even MarketAxess, the US-listed government and corporate bond electronic trading platform.Equally, NYSE may itself become attractive, as Sandler O’Neill analyst Rich Repetto points out. It’s conceivable that IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) may make a move on NYSE as a way of getting its hands on Liffe. It may seem odd for ICE to do a deal that involves it getting into cash equities – not a business that ICE chief executive Jeff Sprecher has been interested in, given its relatively low margins and lack of compatibility with his energy and OTC business.But it was striking how much he said he had learnt about the cash equities business from Mr Greifeld, when the two men paired up in their ultimately doomed effort to bust up the DB/NYSE deal.And it’s also worth remembering that John Thain, chief executive of New York Stock Exchange group, didn’t balk at the prospect of acquiring the Euronext cash equities business as one of the costs of getting hold of the ultimate prize: Liffe.Finally, over in Canada, if Maple is blocked from taking over TMX Group, might the LSE and TMX revive their deal?Let the games begin.
355;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

357;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-01-13T00:00:25Z;Nasdaq looks at changing its structure;;Nasdaq OMX’s board of directors is discussing the possibility of changing Nasdaq’s leadership structure, which could include Robert Greifeld being named chairman in addition to chief executive, people briefed on the discussions said.The discussion comes as NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse’s deal appears at risk of being called off due to strong opposition from antitrust regulators in Europe.It is likely to stoke anticipation that Mr Greifeld may be trying to clear a way for a potential merger to capitalise on his rivals’ failure by seeking the ability to offer up the chief executive role to a merger partner as an inducement to complete a deal.However, people familiar with Nasdaq’s thinking said that no such deal talks were being held.A Nasdaq OMX spokesperson declined to comment.Mr Greifeld, 54, has been chief executive since 2003, overseeing an aggressive evolution of Nasdaq from a US cash equity marketplace to a global group, merging with Sweden’s OMX stock and derivatives exchange and the Philadelphia Exchange, one of the US’s largest options markets.He is said to have strong support from the board to continue as chief executive and has no plans to retire. Last year saw record earnings for Nasdaq OMX as it slashed costs and expanded market share in options, though its share price has languished along with other capital markets groups’.Nasdaq has recently launched a series of acquisitions of market services and technology groups with the aim of diversifying Nasdaq’s revenues away from trading.But moves to dramatically transform Nasdaq’s footprint have struggled. Last year, the US Department of Justice blocked its bid, jointly with the IntercontinentalExchange, to buy NYSE Euronext and break up the planned tie-up with Deutsche Börse.Nasdaq has also twice attempted to merge with LSE, the first time calling off a friendly merger, then later having an unsolicited bid rejected by shareholders of the LSE, then under the leadership of Dame Clara Furse.Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said the board move may be a way to ease potential discussions with other exchanges.“Mr Greifeld’s potential elevation to the role of chairman could facilitate a merger with another exchange peer as it would remove a cultural conflict over who would run the combined company as CEO,” said Mr Repetto.The board discussions were first reported by Fox Business News.Deregulation is increasing competition among exchanges, leading many to seek mergers and acquisitions as a way of increasing scaleA move by Mr Greifeld into the chairman’s role, even if temporary, might raise corporate governance concerns. Many shareholders and experts argue that the chairman and chief executive roles should be separate.“It goes without saying that a stock exchange ought to exemplify good governance,” said John Wilcox at Sodali, a corporate governance consultancy.Mr Wilcox noted that some companies combine the role for strategic reasons but emphasised that “a board chairman and a CEO have different roles to play”.During Nasdaq’s takeover bid for NYSE, Nasdaq argued that good corporate governance practices were not observed when NYSE’s board did not offer up Nasdaq-ICE’s counter-proposal to a shareholder vote.
358;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2012-01-11T14:53:26Z;LME faces revolt over fee increase;;The chief executive of the London Metal Exchange faces a revolt from some of the most senior figures in the metals industry after he pushed through a sharp increase in trading fees last month.The rare public dispute at the 135-year-old LME, a clubby institution where disagreements and scandals are usually kept under wraps, highlights growing caution among the exchange’s member-shareholders about a possible sale, which could be facilitated by the fee increase.In a strongly worded letter to fellow members seen by the Financial Times, three of the LME’s 12 directors attacked the decision to raise fees and urged others to write to Sir Brian Bender, the chairman of the exchange, the centre for global metals trading.The fee increase was designed to maximise the LME’s profitability ahead of a potential takeover bid and also to allow it to invest in new technology, but has angered many banks and brokers who believe that trading volumes will fall.Under the decision announced in December, fees for many trades would more than double, according to the LME.The exchange is owned by its users, and therefore has traditionally sought to minimise costs to them rather than maximise profits. In September, however, it said it had received expressions of interest from more than 10 potential suitors, with first round bids due by the end of February.The three executives, who represent Category 1 members – the core members of the exchange authorised to trade on its open outcry ring – on the LME’s board, said that they disputed the decision to raise fees.“As elected Category 1 directors we are writing to advise you that we do not support the proposed decision to raise the fees,” wrote Michael Overlander, chief executive of Sucden Financial, James Land, managing director of Amalgamated Metal Trading, and Gavin Prentice, managing director of Marex Spectron.The LME’s board may be forced to reconsider the fee increase if the three dissenting directors are able to muster support from the membership.“There has been a fair amount of feedback,” one director said.Announcing the increase in trading fees last month, Martin Abbott, LME chief executive, said: “Shareholders will be asked to consider the value of the business at some point in 2012, and it is important that they are able to compare incoming bids with the true value of the business.”In their letter, the three directors argued that any move to increase fees should be postponed until after any decision on a sale. Some shareholders believe a fee increase is inevitable if the LME is to remain independent, but not if it is sold to a company that already owns a clearing house, such as the Singapore Exchange, CME Group or ICE.The head of a top-10 shareholder added there had been increased doubts over Mr Abbott as chief executive in the wake of the fee increase.“The membership is becoming less confident in Martin as the CEO,” he said.The LME said that fee increases were “a matter for the board and are discussed every year”.

Many analysts had predicted a loss and shares held steady at $9.43 in after-hours trading.The S&P 500 index closed up 0.2 per cent at 1,277.83, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 12,392.69.Although Google’s woes weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, the tech-heavy index eked out a 0.1 per cent gain to close at 2,676.56. Its other heavily weighted stock, Apple, hit a high of $427.75 in the morning session, before closing at $421.73, off 0.2 per cent.The S&P 500 has recorded gains on all but one trading day in 2012 but much of the legwork has been done by a concentration of industrial, material and financial stocks, making some analysts wary.“While the S&P 500 closed up 1.6 per cent last week, the percentage of industry groups in up trends actually contracted [from 56 per cent to 52 per cent],” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird. “Absent of a significant broadening in rally participation, the ability of the major indexes to move significantly higher is likely to be limited.”Netflix climbed 13.8 per cent to $98.18 as it launched its UK and Ireland video web streaming service.The stock, which bombed last year as its US service lost subscribers, is enjoying a mini-renaissance, now up almost $30 since the start of 2012, when the company said customers had streamed more than 2bn hours of content in the quarter to the end of December.Shares in Inhibitex climbed 141.1 per cent to $23.70 after Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to buy the pharmaceutical group for its hepatitis C medicines. That drove up shares in other treatment developers as Idenix Pharmaceuticals surged 37 per cent to $9.66.Bristol-Myers Squibb was off 0.9 per cent to $33.91.CareFusion fell 8.6 per cent to $23.28 after the medical device manufacturer lowered the bottom end of its full-year earnings forecast to $1.75 from $1.80.Rival St Jude Medical rose 3.2 per cent to $35.70 after it said it still expected to meet fourth-quarter and full-year guidance.Regions Financial rose 2.7 per cent to $4.53 on reports that the regional bank, which is yet to repay all Tarp funds borrowed from the Treasury, may offload its Morgan Keegan brokerage unit, which could fetch up to $1bn.Financials were generally stronger with Bank of America climbing 1.5 per cent to $6.27, despite reports it would sack a fifth of its Asia managing directors.Health insurer AFLAC fell 2.3 per cent to $43.23 as UBS analysts warned “its outsized exposure to debt issued by European financials” makes it particularly vulnerable to a European slowdown.Exchanges continued to show weakness after JPMorgan analysts warned on Friday that earnings estimates may be over optimistic. The CME Group fell 2.5 per cent to $228.24 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 2.1 per cent to $112.58.Ralph Lauren climbed 4 per cent to $146.36 as Goldman Sachs analysts tipped the luxury brand to be one of the “secular winners with strong tailwinds of sales and margin expansion” in 2012.Video game retailer Gamestop fell 3.5 per cent to $23.99 as same store sales in the holiday period came in 0.3 per cent lower than in 2010.Tech stock Zynga fell 9.2 per cent to $8.00, $2 below its December IPO price.

Seagate Technology said it had dispatched 47m hard disk drives in the three months to January in a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected. Seagate climbed 11.6 per cent to $18.30, while rival manufacturer Western Digital rose 8.2 per cent to $33.49.Semiconductor manufacturers LSI Corp, up 12.9 per cent to $6.72, and Micron Technology, up 14.5 per cent to $7.21, rallied in anticipation of stronger demand for computer memory chips.Bank of America climbed 11.2 per cent to $6.18, topping $6 for the first time since November, on the back of its strongest one day gain since October on Thursday. Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed earnings estimates for BofA, citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits. Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.5 per cent to $7.10.It might also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform – SunTrust was up 11.6 per cent to $19.75 and Hudson City Bank, a New Jersey-based mortgage lender, rose 9.3 per cent to $6.83. But investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, lagged behind the pack.Goldman Sachs was up just 3.3 per cent to $93.42 while Jefferies climbed only 0.7 per cent to $13.85. Douglas Sipkin, of Ticonderoga Securities, slashed his quarterly earnings forecast for Goldman to 97 cents a share from $4.12 and tipped Morgan Stanley for a 59 cents a share loss, citing the weak trading environment.But Mr Sipkin said US investment banks could benefit from “widening bid- ask spreads, driven by the major retrenchment of European competitors”.CME Group, the largest US exchange by market capitalisation, fell 4 per cent to $234.00 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 4.6 per cent to $115.01 as JPMorgan analysts downgraded both exchanges to neutral, arguing that the companies’ estimates appeared optimistic and might have to be revised down.MasterCard fell 8 per cent to $342.92 as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its “buy” recommendation on the stock as well as Visa.Chesapeake Energy climbed 7.6 per cent to $23.98 after concluding a $2.3bn joint venture with French oil giant Total and EnerVest for shale gas and oil exploration in Ohio.Investor reaction was initially muted but the stock rallied late in the week, when the company said it had used JV revenues to reduce debt by $1.4bn to $10.3bn in the fourth quarter.Devon Energy was up 4.4 per cent to $64.75 after concluding its own $2.5bn shale joint venture with China’s Sinopec. But refiners sold off sharply after Tesoro said it could post a fourth-quarter loss of up to 80 cents a share because of collapsing margins. Tesoro fell 1.8 per cent to $22.95 followed by rivals Marathon Petroleum, off 4.9 per cent to $31.66, and Valero Energy, down 3.2 per cent to $20.37.Tesoro cited the narrowing of the Brent-WTI spread from $26 a barrel to $8 a barrel over the quarter, which cut margins at its mid-continent refineries, which account for 17 per cent of capacity and have benefited from access to cheaper WTI.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions were mixed. Gap fell 3 per cent to $18 after December sales came in 4 per cent lower than the previous year. Ross Stores, the discount clothing chain, rose 6.8 per cent to $50.74 on a 9 per cent increase in same-store sales that easily beat the consensus analyst forecast of 4.2 per cent.Barnes & Noble slumped 19.9 per cent to $11.61 after the company said it was considering a sale of its Nook e-reader business.Netflix climbed 22.3 per cent to $84.70 after the company said subscribers streamed 2bn hours of video on its website in the fourth quarter, although it did not provide data from previous quarters for comparison.Alcoa climbed 6 per cent to $9.17 over the week, before it kicks off fourth quarter reporting season on Monday.But the stock slipped 2 per cent on Friday after the aluminium producer said it was cutting global capacity by 12 per cent and idling smelters in response to falling aluminium prices. Several analysts are predicting a quarterly loss for the company on Monday.
361;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-12-15T20:28:06Z;Tradition rules when it comes to sale of LME;;"The London Metal Exchange is a place of tradition. Turn up for trading with your top button undone, and you could be fined up to £500.Traders often complain about such peculiarities but when it comes to the question of selling the 134-year-old exchange, they are preparing to fight for them.Following a board meeting on Thursday, the LME is expected to send out a memorandum of information to potential bidders within the next week, officially kick-starting the sales process.The LME is owned by its 93 members – largely banks, brokerages, and physical metals traders.Crucially, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, the two largest shareholders on the LME with 20.4 per cent between them, both have large and profitable metals units. Any bid must receive support from holders of more than 75 per cent of the shares, putting the two US banks in a powerful position.After an early flurry of excitement following the announcement in September that more than 10 suitors had expressed interest in acquiring the exchange, shareholders have become more sanguine.In interviews with companies representing roughly half of the voting rights of the LME, a clear outline emerges of a common position on the potential sale: any bidder with plans to change the century-old trading style of the LME should think again – no matter how deep their pockets.“Our business model is driven by our clients’ needs and not by the underlying value of exchange shares,” says Mike Frawley, head of metals at Newedge, which holds a 2.8 per cent stake in the LME and is one of the 12 companies that trades on the exchange’s open outcry ring. “Consequently, LME members will be seeking assurances that market convention will not change.”Unlike most other commodities exchanges, which offer futures contracts for delivery once a month, the LME offers delivery every day. The resulting profusion of contracts makes trading LME metals fiendishly complicated: there are 191 live futures contracts for copper, more than twice the number for WTI crude oil.But many shareholders also believe this structure, together with the ability to take delivery of physical metal from the exchange’s global network of warehouses, underlies the popularity of the LME’s contracts, which are used as the pricing benchmark for 80 per cent of the global trade in non-ferrous metals.One critical issue will be warehousing. Both Goldman and JPMorgan have acquired warehousing companies in the past two years, meaning any buyer of the LME will need to offer assurances that the current warehousing system, which is overseen by the exchange, will not change dramatically.While shareholders have lost some of their enthusiasm for a sale, most still believe that their exchange will eventually be sold – just not to the highest bidder.In September, when interest first emerged, a price tag of £1bn was mooted; now, shareholders say, they would be happy to settle for a valuation closer to £750m.In the first public valuation since the prospect of a takeover was announced, JPMorgan bought MF Global’s stake last month in a deal valuing the exchange at about £530m.And although shareholders are resistant to change on some fronts, they are actively seeking it elsewhere. Many recognise, for example, that the LME is in need of hefty investment in clearing and trading infrastructure – something that, if it were to remain private, would probably be funded by raising fees.Shareholders are therefore likely to look favourably on bidders, such as SGX, ICE or CME Group, which have their own clearing houses. The LME currently outsources clearing activities to LCH.Clearnet, losing what many see as a lucrative income stream.Even the LME’s open outcry ring – the last in Europe – could find itself on the chopping block. Most shareholders argue it is the unique structure of the market, rather than the ring itself, that underpins its success.“It’s a bit of an anachronism to believe an exchange can survive without changing the model,” says one top-five shareholder. “The clock can’t go back to where it was: something has to change now.”Additional reporting by Anousha Sakoui"
362;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-12-06T01:08:20Z;Competition for US OTC clearing heats up;;Competition for clearing over-the-counter trades by customers in the US is heating up, with CME Group posting new clearing volume records, while LCH.Clearnet moves to make its competing offering more attractive.Though the buyside clearing market is still just a sliver of the $150tn notional swaps market, which is primarily traded between big banks, it is growing quickly as Dodd-Frank rules in the US and other G20 reforms aim to push clearing of nearly all swaps through clearing houses. Groups including CME, LCH and the IntercontinentalExchange are vying for the nascent market.Concerns about bank counterparty risk stemming from the European crisis have also accelerated efforts by big asset management and pension firms to sidestep them and take trades directly to clearing houses themselves.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, using funds deposited by its members to help guarantee that a transaction is completed in case of a default.On Monday, CME announced it has now cleared $150bn in notional volumes of interest rate swap and credit default swap trades, including a record $61.9bn in November, between customers such as BlackRock and banks such as Goldman Sachs and RBS.Meanwhile, LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French group that dominates clearing of bank swap trades but is currently still in the testing phase of its US buyside offering, announced on Monday it would accept a wider range of collateral in its SwapClear US platform and announced new products.“We’re upbeat and optimistic about closing the short-term gap,” said Daniel Maguire, head of SwapClear US.It expanded eligible collateral to include currencies other than US dollars, including Japanese yen, euros and British pounds, as well as non-sovereign bonds and other government-guaranteed bonds, such as US agency mortgages.CME’s platform does not accept yen collateral at present. CME said recently it was ”working with several major banks on a specialised collateral programme that permits clearing firms to pledge collateral that CME does not accept directly”.SwapClear acknowledged that a shortage of quality collateral was a concern that its customers, which include asset managers, pension funds, hedge funds and regional banks that are not eligible to be clearinghouse members, had expressed.“By giving [customers] a broader spectrum of margin, it makes it easier to cover margin calls. But we are absolutely not competing on margin as such,” said Mr Maguire.“The key for us always in these debates is, if we can take this in, can we get out of it in a highly volatile environment?” he added.SwapClear will also now allow trade confirmations through Bloomberg, Tradeweb and MarkitSERV, a joint venture between Markit and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. It also said it would begin clearing variable notional swaps, which are commonly used by regional banks to hedge mortgage exposures.The cost of clearing and posting margin is a concern to investment firms, which are facing a potential sharp rise in the frequency of margin calls to trade in OTC markets.A study by Celent, the market research firm, said that “some buyside firms may reduce the number of OTC contracts they trade as they will be effectively priced out of the market”. They might switch to using more listed futures and exchange traded funds, the study said.

364;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;JPMorgan to buy MF Global’s LME stake;;JPMorgan Chase is to buy MF Global’s stake in the London Metal Exchange, making the US bank the largest shareholder in the historic institution as it prepares for a potential bidding war.The deal implies that the LME, the centre for global metals trading, is worth just over £530m ($828m) – the first public valuation of the exchange since it revealed in September that it would initiate a sales process after being approached by more than 10 suitors.JPMorgan will buy the 4.7 per cent LME stake for about £25m – or just over £40 a share – from KPMG, the administrator of MF Global’s UK arm, according to two people familiar with the situation. The last time LME shares changed hands, when Goldman Sachs bought the shareholding of Lehman Brothers’ European arm in July, they traded at a price of just 492½p.LME shareholders are hoping that bids will value the exchange in excess of £1bn, which if achieved would put JPMorgan in line for a healthy profit. One of the people familiar with the deal said there could be some “upside” for JPMorgan if the exchange was sold.However, some shareholders believe the weakening of the global economy since the LME’s first announcement may make an eventual sale less likely.“I think the mood has changed,” one top 10 shareholder said. “It has just taken a lot of fizz off it.”Ownership of the LME is restricted to its 90-odd members. JPMorgan will become the largest shareholder with a 10.9 per cent stake, giving the bank, one of the largest metals dealers after its purchase of Sempra from RBS last year, a greater influence over the outcome of the sales process.Other leading LME shareholders include Goldman Sachs, with 9.5 per cent, Metdist, a privately owned metals trader, with 9.4 per cent, and UBS, with 4.3 per cent.JPMorgan will also purchase 25,000 “B shares” in the LME, which confer trading rights but not ownership, for about £2m, the people said.The deal to buy the ordinary shares and B shares is likely to be announced within days, according to people familiar with the situation.The LME shares attracted “an awful lot of interest”, a person familiar with the sales process said, making them one the most coveted assets in the US brokerage’s bankruptcy.The LME is likely to open its books to inspection by potential buyers in the next few weeks. Likely bidders include CME Group, the US exchange, SGX, the Singapore exchange, and IntercontinentalExchange, a CME rival.The idea of a sale has divided the LME’s members, with some reluctant to give up control of the exchange while others are keen to profit from their shareholdings.JPMorgan, KPMG and the LME all declined to comment.
365;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-11-21T11:31:46Z;Direct Edge plans Brazilian launch;;Direct Edge, the fourth-largest US stock exchange operator, is to launch an electronic equities trading platform in Brazil in competition with BM&F Bovespa, the domestic monopoly.The US group intends to launch the venue in Rio de Janeiro in the fourth quarter of 2012, pending approval from Brazilian regulators.The company’s decision to pick Rio as its base is likely to win them support from the government, which has been investing heavily in the city’s revival as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in 2016.Over the past decade, Rio has gradually lost businesses to São Paulo, which is generally favoured by executives for its better transport links and is seen as a safer place to live.The move is a sign that the competitive forces that sparked fragmentation of equities trading in the US and Europe have arrived in Brazil, where share trading is dominated by Bovespa. The same trend is playing out in Asia, where Chi-X last month became the first alternative trading platform to challenge ASX, the incumbent in Australia.It is also a sign that Brazil has become one of the most attractive prospects for investment in market structures such as exchanges and downstream post-trade services.BATS Global Markets, the third-largest US equities exchange, also has designs to enter the Brazilian market while IntercontinentalExchange, the US futures and commodities exchange, bought a 12.5 per cent stake in Cetip, the post-trade services group, for $512m in July.The Direct Edge move represents another challenge to BM&F Bovespa, the world’s third largest exchanges operator by market value as a listed company. While it has a domestic monopoly, the Brazilian exchange has aimed to pre-empt potential competition by attracting high-frequency traders to its platforms to raise volumes and increase liquidity in shares.“The Brazilian economy is among the fastest growing in the world and we believe that a second stock exchange in the country will spur even greater investor participation through competition that drives innovation and price improvement,” said William O’Brien, chief executive of Direct Edge.He said Direct Edge had been researching entry into Brazil for a year and a half. Asked how much cheaper any Direct Edge platform would offer trading in Brazilian blue chips, he told FT Trading Room: “There is a significant difference in exchange fees compared to other developed markets. We do think there is value to be provided there. The gap is pretty wide.”However new market entrants into Brazil would still have to find a way to clear trades. Last week BM&F Bovespa, Brazil’s national exchange operator, made clear that it would not share its vital clearing service with newcomers. BATS is exploring setting up its own clearing and depository services in a venture with Claritas, a Brazilian asset manager.Setting up rival clearing services could also prove problematic, analysts said, given the complex nature of the Brazilian system whereby all trades are cleared at the final beneficiary level.Mr O’Brien said Direct Edge had spoken to Bovespa about using its clearing house but declined to elaborate.“Wherever we possibly can we are interested in reducing risks that exchange competition could introduce for the system if not introduced properly and clearing is a big part of that,” Mr O’Brien said.Direct Edge Brazil will operate as an independent local company, majority owned by Direct Edge with its headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. A locally-based chief executive will be expected to maintain close working relationships with the Brazilian financial community, many of whom are based in São Paulo.“The arrival of Direct Edge is further proof of the importance of Rio to the global financial markets,” said Eduardo Paes, the city’s mayor. “Having one of the largest stock exchanges in the United States operating here will provide added incentive for other global financial market participants and will likely attract broker services and financial technology firms.”Direct Edge is owned by a consortium that includes the International Securities Exchange, investment banks JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs as well as brokers Knight Capital Group and Citadel Derivatives Group.
366;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-11-18T16:14:49Z;Vultures circle MF Global’s stake in LME;;MF Global’s shares in the London Metal Exchange have emerged as one of the most coveted assets as the bankrupt brokerage is wound down.The broker’s UK arm, which was one of 12 dealers on the LME’s open outcry ring, held a 4.7 per cent stake in the historic exchange, making it the fourth-largest shareholder.It comes as the administrator winding down the London-based division of MF Global said it may give clients some funds before it settled all of the failed futures broker’s final positions.Shares in the LME, the centre for global metals trading, have attracted a wave of interest after the exchange revealed in September that it would initiate a sales process after being approached by more than 10 suitors.“A whole raft of people are interested” in MF Global’s LME stake, a person familiar with the situation said. JPMorgan, the third-largest LME shareholder and one of the leading banks in commodities, is among the parties to have expressed interest, the person added, “along with several other members of the LME”.If the US bank is successful, it would become the largest shareholder with 10.9 per cent. Other large LME shareholders include Goldman Sachs with 9.5 per cent, Metdist, a privately owned metals trader, with 9.4 per cent, and UBS, with 4.3 per cent.Ownership of the 130-year-old exchange is restricted to its 90-odd members. Any bidder of MF Global’s stake must therefore either be a member of the exchange or in the process of obtaining membership, according to the LME.Shares rarely come on the market. The most recent trade in LME shares was the sale of the shareholding of Lehman Brothers’ European arm, which was bought by Goldman Sachs in July at a price of 492½p.At that price, MF Global’s shares would be worth about £3m ($4.7m). However, LME shareholders are expecting bids for the exchange worth more than £1bn, giving MF Global’s stake a potential value of as much as £47m ($75m).“That MF Global is under administration is irrelevant, the LME stake is a very sellable, standalone asset,” said Richard Fleming, UK head of restructuring at KPMG, the administrator. “Whether we sell it next week or in several months’ time is irrelevant. We’ll only sell it at the right time and price.” Buyers are also lining up for MF Global’s metals trading team, Mr Fleming said: “The metals trading team has attracted interest as well.”Another large shareholder told the Financial Times he had received “a lot of calls” regarding his company’s LME shares. The LME is likely to open its books to inspection by potential buyers in the next few weeks. Likely bidders include CME Group, the US exchange, SGX, the Singapore exchange, and IntercontinentalExchange, a CME rival.The idea of a sale has divided the LME’s members, with some reluctant to give up control of the exchange while others are keen to profit from their shareholdings.The most aggressive acquirer of LME shares in the past two years has been Goldman Sachs, which has more than quadrupled its stake to become the largest shareholder. JPMorgan’s interest in acquiring MF Global’s LME shares was first reported by Sky News. JPMorgan declined to comment.Separately KPMG, administrator of the UK fund, said the return of client money would be dependent on establishing the size of claims against funds held in designated client money accounts and the non-segregated monies.“Final distributions to clients will not be made until all client risk positions have been liquidated or transferred and all claims against have been validated,” KPMG said. “However, we are likely to make interim distributions along the way.”KPMG expects to take several months to help liquidate or transfer open positions held by the broker for more than 10,000 customers
367;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-11-11T23:52:54Z;MF Global trustee hunts missing funds;;The hunt for customer funds continued at MF Global, the failed futures broker.US authorities and the trustee overseeing the broker’s liquidation have been combing through what they described as a thicket of records and a convoluted cash trail to find about $600m in margin money missing since MF Global filed for bankruptcy on October 31.The shortfall meant 17,000 US futures accounts transferred from MF Global to other brokers arrived with insufficient margin money to back trading positions. Then CME Group, the exchange operator overseeing the transfer, froze what funds were transferred as it verified the accounts.MF Global customers who had liquidated their accounts as the brokerage teetered had no access to their cash as a bankruptcy court ordered only the transfer of funds backing open positions.IntercontinentalExchange, another futures exchange, asked a judge to free as much money as possible, warning that the court had “created an inadvertent preference in favour of those customers who did nothing in response to MF Global’s financial condition, and operated against those customers who acted quickly and responsibly to reduce their exposure to MF Global”.Accounts are also being transferred in other markets where MF Global had a presence, from the UK to Hong Kong.The failure of the futures broker claimed more victims on Friday as the trustee announced that MF Global’s 1,066 brokerage employees had been fired.The collapse of MF Global, one of the world’s largest commodity brokers, rocked the futures industry. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced it would review more than 120 other US futures brokers to ensure customer funds are safe.
368;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-11-10T21:44:55Z;CFTC reviews brokers after MF Global collapse;;A key regulator investigating missing customer funds at failed broker-dealer MF Global has begun reviewing other brokers as the shortfall shakes confidence in US futures markets.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, said it will review the approximately 120 futures brokers that clear trades for customers, as MF Global did, to ensure they obey rules to segregate customer deposits from house funds.The announcement brings heightened scrutiny of futures brokers. Existing rules require futures exchanges to oversee clearing brokers, including reviewing monthly financial reports. Exchange operator CME Group, MF Global’s supervisor, has said it completed an on-site review of MF Global in the week before its collapse.After MF Global filed for bankruptcy, lawyers disclosed a shortfall of about $600m in customer accounts, or 11 per cent of the $5.45bn it was supposed to hold. Authorities, including the CFTC, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Bureau of Investigation, are searching for the missing money.The shortfall meant that 17,000 futures accounts were only partially funded after they were transferred to 12 other futures brokers last week. CME, which is overseeing the transfers, froze these funds as it verified the accounts.IntercontinentalExchange, the US’s second-biggest futures-exchange operator, warned the bankruptcy trustee’s handling of former MF Global customers risks creating “moral hazard”, saying that traders with open positions were having their accounts transferred to new brokers ahead of those who had liquidated trades before the broker-dealer collapsed.“If this inequitable approach is left unaddressed by the court, it could establish an inappropriate standard for future bankruptcy events,” the exchange wrote in a letter to the bankruptcy court on Thursday. “This could potentially have grave systemic implications.”The CFTC also took the rare step of publicly confirming that its enforcement lawyers had opened an investigation into MF Global.Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, has recused himself from the probe to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest because he worked with former MF Global chief Jon Corzine when Mr Corzine headed Goldman Sachs in the 1990s.Jill Sommers has been named senior commissioner on matters related to the MF Global bankruptcy and shortfall. Ms Sommers, appointed in 2007, previously served as a lobbyist for the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and CME, which is now under scrutiny for its oversight of MF Global customer accounts.“Segregation of customer funds is at the core of customer protection in the commodity futures and options markets and must be maintained at all times,” Ms Sommers said in a statement.Separately, Fitch Ratings projected on Thursday that holders of MF Global’s $2.2bn in senior unsecured debt, including bonds sold just this August, will get only 10 to 30 cents on the dollar back. Of the some $130.6m of preferred stock, either zero or just 10 cents on the dollar will be repaid, Fitch said.The rating agency based its analysis on MF Global’s most recent financial statements, which showed consolidated assets of about $41bn and liabilities of $39.7bn at September 30.
369;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;ICE says MF trustee created ‘moral hazard’;;The trustee handling MF Global’s bankruptcy has created a new kind of “moral hazard” in financial markets, IntercontinentalExchange, the US’s second-biggest futures exchange operator has warned, inadvertently encouraging clients of failing broker-dealers to hold on to their trading positions and “wait and hope” rather than liquidating them to minimise risk.The exchange group urged the trustee on Thursday to immediately address the inequalities in how accounts held with the collapsed broker-dealer had been transferred to new brokers. ICE noted that traders with open positions were having their accounts transferred to new brokers ahead of those who had liquidated trades before the broker-dealer collapsed, and said the bankruptcy court should immediately release as much money as possible from the frozen accounts.ICE’s criticism raises the pressure on MF Global’s bankruptcy trustees to free up money, coming a day after the Futures Industry Association, the industry’s main body, called on the trustee to return customer funds promptly. “Futures customers cannot afford to have the funds they had deposited to support their positions held up while the claims process runs its course,” the FIA said.CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange operator, on Wednesday announced a further delay in validating the amount of customer funds transferred out of accounts formerly held with MF Global. Privately, CME is also thought to be putting pressure on the trustee to speed up the process of freeing customer money.The delays have caused frustration in the futures trading community, with some 15,000 traders unable to tap the money in their accounts. Moreover, a shortfall in customer funds at MF Global meant accounts were transferred with only 60 per cent of the margin required to back positions, meaning traders were immediately asked for extra margin deposits to maintain their trading positions.“Because the customers who already liquidated or transferred prior to the bulk transfers had no open positions to move, the effect of the bulk transfer order was to preclude these traders from accessing any of the cash lying idle in their accounts with MF Global,” ICE wrote in a letter to the court.“Thus, the bulk transfer order created an inadvertent preference in favour of those customers who did nothing in response to MF Global’s financial condition, and operated against those customers who acted quickly and responsibly to reduce their exposure to MF Global.”“If this inequitable approach is left unaddressed by the court, it could establish an inappropriate standard for future bankruptcy events,” ICE warned. “Such an inappropriate standard would create a moral hazard by encouraging customers not to immediately transfer their position or liquidate to minimise risk … but rather to ‘wait and hope’. This could potentially have grave systemic implications.”
370;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-11-07T23:57:51Z;Aftershocks of MF Global bankruptcy continue;;Aftershocks from the MF Global bankruptcy spread on Monday, reaching a level that prompted a leading broker to ask the US government to delay crop reports because of the upheaval.Many problems involved shifting accounts of former MF Global traders to other clearing firms. As these accounts appeared on the books of new brokers, owners were hit with demands for extra margin deposits to maintain positions. RJ O’Brien, the Chicago futures broker that took over some accounts, told new arrivals to wire more money or liquidate.“There are people blown out of positions there’s no reason to blow out of,” said Tres Knippa, a broker and commodity trading adviser on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor.Adding to the short-term cash crunch, exchange operator CME Group directed brokers to delay distribution of customers’ funds until late Tuesday as it verifies that each one receives the right amount.Any impact on futures prices has been minimal since MF Global filed for bankruptcy on October 31. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a commodities benchmark, on Monday rose a quarter of 1 per cent.However, RJ O’Brien warned of volatility ahead as it petitioned the US Department of Agriculture to postpone the release of two closely followed crop reports from Wednesday to next Monday. The broker said a delay would “mitigate the aftershocks of MFG’s bankruptcy to thousands of innocent market participants”.The USDA rebuffed its entreaty.Managers of the 12 clearing firms that took over 17,000 US accounts from the failed broker-dealer, which also include Rosenthal Collins, Dorman Trading and ADM Investor Services, a division of agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland, were scrambling to assess accounts transferred in bulk last week. MF Global was known for its retail customer base.A shortfall in customer funds at MF Global meant accounts were transferred with only 60 per cent of the margin required to back positions. CME and IntercontinentalExchange, the exchange and clearing house operators, eased the cost of margin calls by temporarily relaxing rules on deposits.Among the worst-hit traders were firms that invest client money in futures markets. These “managed futures” firms often apply one trading strategy to dozens of individual accounts. As account holders who had MF Global as a broker were forced out of the market, their losses influenced managed futures firms’ performance records.“The fallout has been pretty bad for money managers,” said Chad Butler, president of Clarke Capital Management, which oversees $150m in more than 200 managed futures accounts, 120 of them formerly with MF Global.US authorities and MF’s bankruptcy trustee are investigating the disappearance of some $600m in futures customer funds that disappeared in the days leading up to MF’s bankruptcy last week.“MF has gone a long way to destroy faith and trust in the good firms out there. The question on everyone’s mind is, how safe are they really?” Mr Butler said.
371;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-11-06T18:52:37Z;Rules eased to avert MF Global fallout;Move raises risk of widespread margin calls;US futures exchanges have moved to head off instability in financial markets following the collapse of broker-dealer MF Globalby relaxing rules on how much collateral speculators must hold.CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange have temporarily cut the amount of deposits they will require from speculators, including those whose positions were transferred in bulk from MF Global to new brokers late last week.The exchange and clearing house operators decided the changes as futures markets were set to reopen late on Sunday with thousands of new, underfunded accounts on the books of other brokers.While customer positions were successfully moved, 40 per cent of their margin, or the deposit needed to make a transaction, was held back at clearing houses as ordered by a US bankruptcy judge.This raised the risk of widespread margin calls, or demands for additional deposits, from brokers, which could lead to a sell-off in markets from stock index futures to oil.“This is a short term accommodation to maintain market integrity and provide temporary relief to customers whose accounts have been disrupted by this event,” CME said in a notice to clearing members over the weekend.ICE’s US soft commodity, foreign exchange and stock index exchange said it lowered the margin rate to “mute the impact of the transfer” and “support the integrity of exchange markets”.As of Sunday, 17,000 open accounts had been transferred to other brokers, the office of MF’s bankruptcy trustee said. These included 15,000 MF Global accounts CME said it moved last week.CME said it had also shifted $1.45bn in MF customer collateral held at its clearing house to other clearing firms. The money was about 60 per cent of the $2.5bn in customer funds on deposit at CME.The impromptu nature of the transfers was evident as CME informed MF Global’s Canadian customers that their accounts were mistakenly moved to new brokers without approval from Canada’s regulators or bankruptcy trustee. CME, which blamed the mix-up on records supplied by MF Global, sought to transfer these accounts back to MF Global Canada by early Monday.In all MF Global was required to hold $5.45bn in customer funds separate from its own funds, of which about $600m remains unaccounted for. Authorities are investigating the shortfall.Gary Gensler, Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, stepped back from the agency’s probe to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, according to Bart Chilton, a CFTC commissioner. Mr Gensler worked at Goldman Sachs when it was headed by Jon Corzine, MF’s chief executive until his resignation last week.For speculative traders, both CME and ICE reduced the amount of initial margin – the amount needed to open a position – to bring it in line with the maintenance margin needed to keep a position open. In US crude oil, for example, speculators’ initial margin was $8,100 per 1,000-barrel contract, but will now be the same as the prevailing $6,000 maintenance margin.“They recognise the problem and they are doing what they can to decrease the possibility of a forced liquidation in the market,” said Raymond Carbone, president of Paramount Options, an oil broker on the floor of CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange.Only a portion of the margin accounts was transferred because of the shortfall at MF Global. The trustee’s office said it had to hold back assets to “best satisfy customer claims and to maximise the estate for all stakeholders.”MF Global customer accounts that only held cash were not transferred and are frozen. The disposition of the money could be fought out in court, a process that could take years.“If you have all cash, you can’t move it out,” said Tim Butler, a lawyer for his brother, New York cotton trader Thomas Butler.
372;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-11-04T18:36:54Z;S&P commodities index to increase Brent weighting;;The S&P GSCI, the most widely tracked commodity index, will increase the weighting of Brent crude next year at the expense of rival West Texas Intermediate, a move that will force billions of dollars moving from one contract to the other.The change in weighting comes after the traditional price relationship between Brent and WTI, the world’s most important oil benchmarks, moved upside down.Brent has for years traded at a $1 to $2 a barrel discount to WTI.But since mid-2010, Brent has traded consistently at a premium to WTI due to a logistical bottleneck around Cushing, the Oklahoma town that serves as the delivery point for the WTI contract.The Brent-WTI premium reached an all-time high of $28.10 a barrel last month. On Friday, the price differential traded at $17.43 a barrel.The past week was paradigmatic of the different price trajectory. In late afternoon trading, ICE December Brent was up 1.1 per cent on the week to $111.18 a barrel while Nymex December WTI was up just 0.5 per cent on the week to $93.75.Oil prices rose in the last part of the week after the European Central Bank cut interest rates.The announcement by Standard & Poor’s comes only weeks after the Dow Jones-UBS commodity index, the second-most popular commodities basket, announced it would include Brent in its index for the first time in 2012.The shifts will have big implications for commodity markets.Brent, linked to crude from the North Sea, is the flagship futures contract on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, a unit of Atlanta-based InterContinental Exchange. WTI is the main oil contract at the New York Mercantile Exchange, owned by the CME Group.Michael McGlone, head of the S&P GSCI in New York, said he estimated that about $110bn tracked the commodity index at the end of October.S&P GSCI – formerly Goldman Sachs Commodities Index – said the weight of Brent crude will rise from January to 17.35 per cent from 15.9 per cent while the share of WTI will be cropped to 30.25 per cent, down from 32.59 per cent.It is the third year in a row that Brent weightings in the S&P GSCI index have increased.It could also increase the number of oustanding Brent contracts, giving a boost to ICE Futures in its fight for market shares with Nymex.Brent has benefited from the rupture in the traditional price relationship, with companies and speculators shifting their exposure in favour of the North Sea crude.In the most striking example, Delta Air Lines, one of the world’s largest carriers, shifted in March almost all its fuel hedges away from WTI and into Brent.
373;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-11-03T17:43:50Z;OTC derivatives: Euro crisis gives clearing a boost;There is a sense in the industry that the change is a trend, not a blip, says Hal Weitzman;The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 was undoubtedly devastating for the global financial industry and had profound effects on the economy.For CME Group, the biggest futures exchange in the US, it also gave rise to an important opportunity.The fear of counterparty risk provoked by the bank’s collapse held out the promise that the over-the-counter derivatives market – the value of which dwarfs listed markets – might be pushed to clear through central counterparty clearing houses – such as CME’s – providing the group with significant new business.A G20 agreement in 2009 and the Dodd-Frank Act– US legislation passed last year that aims to overhaul financial regulation – both envisaged a legal mandate for as many OTC swaps as possible to be cleared.CME offers clearing facilities for credit default swaps (CDS), a type of financial product that became much more well known in the wake of the crisis.Yet the group has been beaten to the punch by the London-based clearing business of IntercontinentalExchange, which established dominance in CDS through its consortium arrangement with the biggest dealers.Instead, CME has focused most of its efforts on interest rate swaps (IRS), a huge market that is a natural fit with the Chicago exchange’s dominant position in US interest rate futures.The IRS pie is much bigger than CDS. Whereas the CDS market ended last year with a notional value of $30,000bn, according to the Bank for International Settlements, the IRS market is valued at $465,000bn, or more than three-quarters of the entire OTC market.However, uncertainty about the implications of Dodd-Frank have contributed to slower progress than might have been expected at CME.Also, after the Lehman collapse, with the passing of time, the urgency of risk reduction diminished – and the promise of large cleared volumes failed to materialise.But in recent months, volumes have shot up. CME cleared $5m in IRS contracts in May, $190m in June, $400m in July, $1.24bn in August and $35.47bn in September.Although the notional value of cleared volumes levelled out in October, it is still on course to be in the tens of billions of dollars.Cleared CDS volumes also went up from $10m in July to $6.46bn in September.To a large extent, these increases are in response to the eurozone crisis.Just as the Lehman collapse prompted a rush to reduce counterparty risk, the debt crisis in Europe has given OTC clearing a second wind.Kim Taylor, CME’s head of clearing, says: “In the past couple of months, we’ve seen a significant uptake in OTC clearing as traders respond to the eurozone debt crisis and review their counterparty risk profiles.”That is echoed by Daniel Maguire, head of Swapclear US – the OTC service of LCH.Clearnet, London’s main clearing house – which competes with CME. “The need for counterparty risk reduction is driving demand,” he says.At the same time, those in the industry say traders are also moving to clearing to be ready for when mandates will apply.Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told a futures conference in Chicago in October that a government mandate forcing the most standardised swaps to be cleared could come into effect by April, with the entire industry having to comply by the end of next year. Many are not waiting for those deadlines before acting.Ms Taylor says CME has more than 500 clients clearing OTC trades, with “many more” in the pipeline and a sharp increase in client testing. She also says CME has been forced to bring forward its product launch dates because of the strength of customer demand.Floyd Converse of LCH.Clearnet says his organisation is increasingly seeing asset managers – who will not be mandated to clear in the US until the end of 2012 – “jumping the queue” and beginning to clear swap trades.Chris Perkins, head of derivatives clearing at Citigroup Global Markets, says his bank is setting up 2,000 accounts for clearing.He adds that dealers are already offering their clients cross-product margining (the cash or securities posted as collateral) between swaps and futures, even though exchanges cannot yet do this, and regulators could ultimately decide not to allow the practice.The sense in the industry is that the move to clearing is a trend, not a blip.Volatility and uncertainty will eventually recede, but as Mr Converse notes, by then clearing will be mandated.Revenues from clearing swaps may be becoming an important part of CME’s business, but the exchange still hopes that the overhaul of financial regulation will also cause business to migrate from OTC to its traditional listed markets.A key factor may be the relative costs of clearing swaps and futures: margining costs for the former may be up to five times higher. William Cleary, a managing director at Bank of America Merrill Lynch says: “There’s a whole load of customers looking at the cost of trading OTC. We’ll see a big increase in the use of futures products.”Kevin Foley, a partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman, a law firm, agrees. “Not only will we see a shift from uncleared to cleared, but also from swaps to futures,” he predicts.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, sees this as a shift that will shape both OTC and listed markets.“As people look at the costs of doing swaps, they’re looking at alternatives [such as listed futures],” he says.“That is good for exchanges in both senses. The ‘Big Game’ may be the convergence that happens for market users.”
374;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-11-03T17:43:37Z;Energy: An example for regulators to study;The 2001 bankruptcy of Enron shocked market participants into finding safer ways to trade, says Gregory Meyer;US regulators pushing to send more derivatives deals to clearing houses would do well to study energy markets.Years before the Lehman Brothers collapse and the AIG bail-out, traders in over-the-counter natural gas and oil derivatives started clearing their swaps.The impetus was the 2001 bankruptcy of Enron, then dominant in US gas markets, and credit downgrades of other energy trading companies. The crisis shocked energy market participants and forced them to look for safer ways to hedge supplies.The New York Mercantile Exchange, now part of CME Group, and the fledgling IntercontinentalExchange began allowing bilateral trades to be transferred to clearing houses, which acted as the buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer, shifting credit risk away from individual counterparties. Traders had to post collateral to keep positions.At first, “the market looked at it and said, ‘I have all these triple A counterparties. Why would I want to incur the extra cost of clearing?’ ” says Chuck Vice, the ICE president.“The whole Enron situation changed that quite a bit. Everybody looked around and said: ‘If my highest-rated, largest counterparty can go bankrupt, pretty much anyone can go bankrupt’. The pendulum started to swing fairly quickly,” Mr Vice says.Technology made clearing easier, as some trading shifted from telephones to instant messages to screen-based platforms.At ICE, the share of over-the-counter energy trades that were cleared grew from 2 per cent in 2002 to more than 95 per cent today. Daily volumes handled by ClearPort, the clearing service that Nymex launched in May 2002, grew from 24,000 on average in 2003 to almost 450,000 so far this year. Volumes peaked at nearly 500,000 in 2009, after Lehman’s failure.ClearPort was “born out of necessity”, says Mike Prokop, managing director for energy and cross asset-class products at CME. ClearPort now also handles foreign exchange, interest-rate and other derivatives.The trend towards clearing has enabled new energy swap dealers to break into markets once dominated by Wall Street banks and large oil companies.Previously, a trader had to sign mountains of documents with each counterparty to certify it was able to strike deals under swaps rules. The process could take months and still left traders at risk of another’s default.“It’s been great for everyone except those whose business models required opacity, episodic liquidity and the ability to serve as a gatekeeper for investors,” says Michael Cosgrove, a managing director at GFI Group, an interdealer broker.One smaller dealer is Geneva Energy Markets, an 11-person operation based in New York and Dublin. Inside GEM’s modest office near Wall Street, computers make laser-gun noises each time a trade goes through. At times it sounds like a shoot-out in a science-fiction movie. The company is one of the most active traders of cleared oil swaps.“We only do cleared trades. We wouldn’t take Exxon’s credit if they asked us to,” says Mark Vonderheide, GEM managing partner.“It’s not a matter of suggesting someone’s not credit-worthy. Why bother to add that to your list of things to think about?”He says other market participants initially resisted clearing, but volumes took off after 2007.“Trading counterparties realised it cost them real money if they weren’t willing to clear their oil swap trades, because the cleared-only bids or offers were regularly the best in the market.”Mr Vonderheide, a former senior trader at banks and Vitol, the oil trading house, says that now most of the oil swaps market is cleared. “It’s certainly a model for how a very active, volatile and large market can organise itself to do a massive percentage cleared,” he says.Not every trader wants to clear its positions. Posting margin collateral can be a drain on companies’ cash. The US Dodd-Frank Act on financial regulation will not require commercial “end-users”, such as gas drillers or oil refiners, to clear their derivatives trades.Under the reforms, standardised swaps deals between big financial traders must be cleared. Regulators are still writing rules to implement the legislation.Some say that while energy is an appealing example for other markets, it will not translate neatly to other derivatives, such as credit default swaps.“In the energy business, the market perceived a need for [clearing]. It grew organically, without anybody telling them to do it,” says Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the University of Houston.
375;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-11-02T22:30:55Z;ICE says MF Global did not break its rules;Customer accounts were fully funded;MF Global’s collateral accounts at IntercontinentalExchange, the US’s second biggest futures exchange by revenues, were in full compliance with rules relating to the management of customer segregated funds at the time of its bankruptcy filing, the exchange group said on Wednesday.The assurance came a day after CME Group – the US’s main futures exchange operator that acted as self-regulatory body to the collapsed broker-dealer as well as hosting its trades – said MF Global had broken rules relating to customer segregated funds.US rules require customer funds to be kept separate from a futures broker’s own funds. MF Global’s action in the days leading up to its bankruptcy filing on Monday – the eighth biggest corporate collapse in US history and the largest of any financial firm since Lehman Brothers in 2008 – are now under investigation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the FBI, according to people familiar with the situation.But Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said ICE had not encountered the same issues as CME. “ICE has always been in receipt of the full amount of margin money required for the positions in our clearing houses,” he said. In terms of segregated accounts “they did not violate any of our rules”.Mr Sprecher contrasted the position of ICE with CME, where MF Global was the top broker by volume on the energy and metals markets. He said MF had represented a “low, single-digit number” in terms of the percentage of activity at ICE’s clearing houses.He also sought to distinguish ICE’s experience in the fallout of the collapse with that of CME. “ICE is in a very strong position,” he said.“We believe we have ample collateral to assist in the orderly movement of customers to new member firms or the termination and liquidation of their positions.”After the bankruptcy filing, ICE sold off MF Global’s non-cash collateral and seconded traders to hedge the broker’s portfolio and to liquidate accounts, he said. Mr Sprecher made his remarks as ICE announced quarterly profits ahead of expectations.Net income in the three months to the end of September was $133m or $1.80 per share, up from $96m or $1.29 per share in the same period last year.Excluding extraordinary items, earnings per share were $1.87, above analysts’ average forecasts. ICE shares were trading 0.7 per cent higher by mid-morning in New York at $124.09.

Shares rose 7 per cent to $357.66.“The MasterCard results show no signs of a macro slowdown, even in Europe,” said Glenn Greene at Oppenheimer Securities.The spending surge did not appear to be driven by higher consumer borrowing: spending on US credit cards was up 7 per cent year on year, whereas debit cards were up 23 per cent.Wall Street saw a wider bounce, with the S&P 500 up 1.6 per cent to 1,237.90. The benchmark index had pared early gains as Fed president Ben Bernanke said inflation would stay below its 2 per cent target through 2014, but the index moved higher again in the afternoon.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was up 2.8 per cent, as much as any other sector, in a clear sign of a Europe-driven rally. Bank of America rose 5 per cent to $6.72 and Morgan Stanley 3.3 per cent to $16.76.But insurer Genworth Financial saw the biggest bounce, up 5.7 per cent to $6.17. Genworth has been one of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500 in recent months, with investors wary of its vulnerability to the eurozone.Bank stocks had plunged on Tuesday after the Greek prime minister’s call for a referendum on his country’s eurozone bail-out, but on Wednesday some investors found reasons to be cheerful about the latest twist in Europe’s saga.“Because politicians can change their minds once in power, a referendum could bring more clarity on the issue and force more decisive resolutions than we have seen through the negotiation process,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.5 per cent to 11,836.04 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.3 per cent to 2,639.98.Wireless network providers surged after the House of Representatives voted on Monday to bar new state and local taxes on wireless services. The bill was passed on Tuesday. MetroPCS, a national wireless provider, was up 11.9 per cent to $8.57, while Clearwire was up 10.3 per cent to $2.04.Infrastructure contractor Quanta Services was up 11.6 per cent to $22.14 after it said one of its units would be part of a venture that would build Transcanada’s Keystone XL Pipeline.EOG Resources jumped 11.8 per cent to $96.04 as it raised its output of lucrative liquid gas and oil. Liquids production was up 49 per cent compared with the same quarter last year. EOG was spun off from Enron a decade ago as a domestic natural gas driller, but the company has turned to crude oil as natural-gas prices have slumped.Pioneer Natural Resources, which has also struggled to navigate falling natural gas prices, leapt 12.6 per cent to $91.16. The company has suffered significant hedging losses in recent quarters, but this quarter it booked profits of about $200m by marking derivative contracts to market prices.Time Warner was off 0.8 per cent to $33.57, as investors appeared to put a more than 50 per cent year-on-year jump in third-quarter profits down to the box office success of its last Harry Potter film.Fibre optic manufacturer JDS Uniphase rose 8.5 per cent to $12.46 as earnings, excluding some items, of 18 cents per share, easily beat expectations because of high sales of laser products.BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion fell 2 per cent to $18.91 to close below its book value for the first time in nine years. That means RIM’s market capitalisation is now lower than the market value of its property, patents and other assets.Intercontinental­Exchange fell 0.5 per cent to $122.62. Shares had increased as much as 5 per cent after quarterly results showed a 38 per cent surge in income, driven by strong trading volume in its oil futures contracts.CME Group, the largest US exchange group by market capitalisation, bounced back 7.5 per cent to $259.39. The stock had sold heavily on Tuesday, after Craig Donohue, chief executive, said the derivatives broker-dealer MF Global had broken CME’s rules on segregating customer and broker accounts.Medical technology company Becton Dickinson fell 4.6 per cent to $72.60, as income for the quarter ended September 30 fell to $300m and the company’s full-year earnings forecast disappointed analysts.
377;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-11-02T01:53:39Z;Australia grain and wool futures resume trading;;Australia’s agricultural commodities market resumed trading on Wednesday morning, a day after ASX, the exchange operator, shut it down in the wake of the collapse of MF Global.The exchange had said it took the decision on Tuesday to close the grain and wool markets “until further notice” given the large amount of outstanding contracts held by the US broker, highlighting the impact the bankruptcy of MF Global has had on futures markets.MF Global has an outsize market share in Australian commodities markets. The company said on its website that its customers accounted for “over” 80 per cent of the turnover in the country’s wool contracts.The indefinite shutdown in Australia went far beyond the measures taken on Monday by other leading commodities exchanges, including the CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and the London Metal Exchange, which only suspended the broker.Nonetheless, trading volumes across commodity markets have been thin and trading nervous as investors attempt to extricate themselves from positions held with MF Global.The company was one of the largest global commodity brokers, with the leading position by volumes on Nymex and Comex, where energy and metals futures are traded, according its website. It was also one of 12 companies authorised to trade on the London Metal Exchange ring.Its bankruptcy is likely to be a boon for other commodity brokers, such as INTL FCStone, RJ O’Brien and Marex Spectron, as well as in-house brokerages at banks such as JPMorgan, UBS, Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas. “The trickle of accounts wanting to open up late last week has turned into a torrent,” an executive at a rival brokerage said.Australia is the world’s largest wool exporter and the country’s wool futures are one of the most important global benchmarks for the fibre industry.The ASX said in a notice to its members on Tuesday that it had decided to suspend the agricultural markets for grain and wool “given the significant percentage of open interest held by [MF Global], in order to maintain a fair, orderly and transparent market.”“They [MF Global] were quite happy to make markets. You remove them from the market then the market now has to look for another liquidity provider. I think that will happen but we’ll really need to give it a bit of time,” said Jonathan Barratt, head of Australia’s Commodity Broking Services.ASX did not answer calls seeking comment.Additional reporting by Sarah Mishkin in Hong Kong
378;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-10-27T20:51:08Z;Citigroup hires Hubble from ICE Clear Europe;Banks keen to build their clearing businesses;Citigroup has poached Suzanne Hubble, a senior executive from ICE Clear Europe, as it attempts to become a big beneficiary of the deep reforms reshaping US and European markets.Ms Hubble was previously director of credit default swap development at ICE Clear, the London-based clearing business of IntercontinentalExchange and set up in 2009 to emulate the success of ICE Trust, the US CDS clearing house.While rivals have been shedding staff, Citigroup has been aggressively creating a new team in the past 18 months to focus on exchange-traded and over-the-counter clearing business. It is led by Jerome Kemp, global head of listed derivatives sales and clearing, who joined Citigroup a year ago after a 17-year career at JPMorgan.Banks are keen to build up their clearing businesses partly because the Dodd-Frank Act in the US mandates that futures brokers act as intermediaries between users of OTC derivatives and clearing houses. It has resulted in fierce competition for industry talent and experience. Ms Hubble has worked in the industry for more than 13 years and held positions in the foreign exchange and credit trading markets.“There are two reasons to clear over-the-counter swaps. The first is if regulation or statute compels it, and the second is because our clients and their investors commercially desire the mitigation of counterparty risk that central clearing provides,” Chris Perkins, global head of OTC derivatives clearing at Citigroup, told FT Trading Room.Ms Hubble, who started at Citigroup earlier this week, will report to Andrew Sterry, head of OTC clearing Europe, Middle East and Africa at Citigroup. “The derivatives clearing business continues to be a top priority across the firm and the hire of a renowned industry expert like Suzanne is a further testament to Citi’s strategic focus in this space,” said Mr Sterry.
379;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

But the eurozone crisis has put a spanner in the works.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said back in August that the process had been held up by the crisis. “It’s been complicated by the fact that there’s been a lot of dislocation in sovereign debt and so I think the regulators and even our own board of directors have not wanted to necessarily rush into that market,” he said.Instead, ICE have plumped to go for the more less tumultuous Latin American sovereigns. The company will launch clearing on Oct 31 on Brazilian and Mexican CDS before extending to Argentina and Venezuela in November.Clearly, the ICE board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the relevant Washington regulator, think Argentine and Venezuelan debt is more easily managed than that of Europe.

381;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-10-20T18:40:24Z;ICE to launch sovereign CDS clearing;Exchange targets Latin American swaps;IntercontinentalExchange is to offer the first clearing services for sovereign credit default swaps, launching clearing for contracts on Latin American debt this month.ICE, which was the first exchange to offer clearing for corporate CDSs – the over-the-counter derivatives widely blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis – has long said it wants to extend its services to sovereign CDSs, identifying contracts on European and Latin American debtor countries as its first target markets.Regulators around the world are keen to see swaps pushed through clearing houses to reduce the counterparty risk associated with the privately negotiated derivative contracts.ICE announced on Thursday that ICE Clear Credit, its CDS clearing house, had received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer clearing for Latin American CDSs. ICE will launch the service on October 31 with clearing for Brazil and Mexico before extending to Argentina and Venezuela in November.The company is still awaiting approval for clearing European sovereign CDSs, which has been delayed due to volatility in the eurozone.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said in the company’s last earnings conference call in August: “These are extraordinary times in looking at underlying sovereign debt, and so both the regulator and our board are being quite cautious in picking our moment in entering that.”Scott Hill, ICE’s chief financial officer, said at the same time that the company wanted to extend its offering beyond Europe and Latin America. “There are other sovereign products that we could launch,” he said. “There is a large part of the market that still is untapped.”Christopher Harris, an analyst at Wells Fargo said launching Latin American sovereign CDSs could enable ICE to tap bigger markets.“We do not expect a significant increase in revenue from Latin American sovereigns, but this is an important first step to gaining approval in larger markets like Europe,” he wrote in a research note. “Importantly, ICE will once again have a first-mover advantage by offering sovereign CDS clearing ahead of its competitors”.
382;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-10-19T15:35:39Z;Race on to launch Canadian cereals derivatives;;The end of the Canadian Wheat Board’s monopoly has triggered a race to develop futures contracts for the country’s farmers between the Winnipeg-based ICE Futures Canada and the US-based Minneapolis Grain Exchange.The battle between the two small commodities exchanges is the latest sign of how the end of the CWB’s monopoly next year would revolutionise the agribusiness sector in the world’s fourth biggest wheat and fourth-largest barley exporter.The CWB has enjoyed a monopoly to trade wheat and barley from the prairie provinces of western Canada since 1942. But the ruling Conservatives introduced legislation on Tuesday to end it by August 2012, although the CWB is fighting against the move.ICE Futures Canada on Wednesday said it would launch milling wheat, durum wheat – used mostly for pasta – and barley futures contracts if the monopoly ends as expected.The exchange, owned by Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange since 2007 and formerly known as the Winnipeg Commodities Exchange, said it planned to list the new contracts for delivery in October 2012.ICE will compete against the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, which in August said it would allow the delivery of Canadian wheat against its 128-year-old US spring wheat contract from mid-2013.The MGEX has until now banned the delivery of non-US wheat against the contract, a benchmark for bread bakers.The new ICE contract will be denominated in Canadian dollars, creating an advantage against the MGEX’s contract which is denominated in US dollars.But the MGEX could still attract business from Canada on the back of the liquidity of its well-established contract, which is widely used by traders in the US midwest.Industry executives and analysts said that the end of the CWB’s monopoly would pave the way for big traders such as US-based Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Geneva-based Louis Dreyfus Commodities and Glencore to buy cereals directly from Canadian farmers, boosting the need for hedging.But Dan Basse, of consultants AgResource in Chicago, warned that the farmers would need time before they felt comfortable about using futures contracts for hedging.“It is going to be a learning curve for them,” he said, warning that in Australia, where the government dismantled a few years a similar wheat board, futures trading has not picked up.Brad Vannan, president of ICE Futures Canada, said, nonetheless, that market participants had expressed substantial demand for global benchmark futures contracts designed specifically for Canada.“These contracts recognise Canada’s central role in the global agricultural market place and they serve an essential role in providing transparent price discovery and risk management tools,” he said.The battle for CWB echoes the fight when Australia dismantled the country’s grain monopoly, the Australian Wheat Board, in 2008, which has reshaped the country’s agribusiness industry.Cargill, the world’s largest agricultural commodities trader, bought AWB, and rivals such as Viterra, GrainCorp, Glencore, Nidera, Toepfer and Bunge entered the market, although wheat futures traded in Australian exchanges have not seen a meaningful pick-up in activity.
383;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-10-12T16:49:50Z;Emerging market bourses in Brics deal;;"Six of the world’s largest emerging markets exchanges on Wednesday unveiled an alliance in an unprecedented arrangement that aims to capture investor interest in leading emerging markets in each other’s markets at a time when exchanges globally have been consolidating.Under the alliance Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, BM&FBovespa of Brazil, the National Stock Exchange of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the two Russian exchanges that are in the process of merging – Micex and RTS – will cross-list each other’s stock index futures and index options contracts. They will be listed on each exchange in the local currency of each exchange, the exchanges said at the annual meeting of the World Federation of Exchanges in South Africa.The arrangement means that, for example, a Brazilian investor would be able to buy or sell a Hang Seng index futures contract – currently only available on HKEx – and denominated in the Real currency, on the BM&FBovespa exchange.The six bourses will also work towards devising a “Brics” index that traders could use to gain broad exposure to emerging market indices.The development is a sign that exchanges in the Brics countries see an opportunity to expand globally at a time when their older rivals in the US and Europe are battling pressure on profit margins from competition in cash equities trading from other platforms and “dark pools”. Edemir Pinto, chief executive of BM&FBovespa said the growth of trading on emerging market exchanges was “exactly the opposite of the developed market exchanges”.Last year the volume of futures traded on exchanges in Asia exceeded that in North America for the first time, according to the Futures Industry Association.Ronald Arculli, chairman of HKEx and of the WFE, said: “The alliance enables more investors to gain exposure to the emerging economies of the Brics group whose economic power is on the rise. From a global perspective [it] highlights the growing significance of the Brics economies and financial markets for the coming decade, and further underlines the importance of enhancing co-operation between the Brics members.”The idea for the alliance was devised by HKEx, which first approached the other exchanges in June. Romnesh Lamba, head of the market development division at HKEx, said: “From a revenue and investor perspective, we don’t expect there will be cannibalisation of each others’ markets.”The arrangement is also a sign that some exchanges believe that forging alliances is a more effective way to grow their business after the failure of a series of big-ticket mergers. Singapore’s SGX exchange was earlier this year blocked by Canberra in its attempt to take over ASX, the Australian exchange; the London Stock Exchange abandoned an attempted merger with TMX Group; while a joint attempt by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange to break up the planned combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext was scuppered by US antitrust regulators.CME Group has been forging similar alliances involving cross-listing and distribution of its products with BM&FBovespa, the BMV exchange in Mexico, the JSE and Osaka Securities Exchange. Eurex, the futures arm of the Börse, last year started offering futures contracts based on the Korean exchange’s Kospi stock index.Asked what effect CME’s alliances would have on the new emerging market alliance, Mr Pinto said: “Our agreement with CME does not conflict in any way with what we are doing here.”The first stage of the project will lead to the exchanges beginning cross-listing of financial derivatives on their benchmark equity indices by June 2012.Charles Li, HKEx chief executive, said: “At the beginning it’s not necessarily going to be a ‘big bang’ for any of us but over time we’re very confident that this will bring a lot of interest and we may be able to create a new asset class.”"

With all these attempts at [industry] consolidation we’ve had no shortage of investment bankers knocking on our door with ideas that they think are great.”His comments, made at the World Federation of Exchanges’ annual meeting, confirm that while HKEx has looked at the LME, it is not seen as among the most likely of bidders, which people familiar with the matter say are CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and SGX, the Singapore exchange.While HKEx has recently started overhauling its business, including building a data centre to attract automated traders and has announced plans for clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, it has signalled little appetite for foreign deals or large acquisitions. It is more concentrated on building its China-related business.Mr Arculli said: “We’ve always said that partnerships or alliances are things that we can look at without having to go through a full merger,” Mr Arculli said in an interview with FT Trading Room.He was speaking ahead of an announcement by HKEx and five other exchanges - BM&FBovespa, the National Stock Exchange of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange - that they had forged an alliance to cross-list each other’s stock index futures.Mr Arculli said that for HKEx to “divert itself” from its focus on China would be “downright silly”.He also cast doubt on the rationale for big exchange mergers, referring to the difficulties experienced in big mergers in other industries. “You had the merger of Daimler and Chrysler, where the common theme was steering wheels and so on. But if they can’t culturally get together, how the bloody hell do you get exchanges with different cultures and languages to combine effectively?”

Mr Spahr lowered 2012 and 2013 earnings estimates for Franklin Resources by 12 per cent “to reflect much lower average AUM than expected”.Franklin Resources fell 2.9 per cent to $96.85. Legg Mason fell 1.3 per cent to $26.80. BlackRock fell 1.4 per cent to $153.06 and Federated Investors fell 2.4 per cent to $17.72. But some analysts said Franklin Resources’ woes might not be mirrored at other firms.“Asset declines at Franklin were mainly down to the performance of the Templeton Global Bond Fund, mainly invested in international bonds, which have been hit by emerging market currency weakness,” said Jeff Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “There’s really not much read-across to domestic fixed income funds,” he added.The broad S&P 500 eked out a 0.1 per cent rise to close at 1,195.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 11,416.3 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.7 per cent to 2,583.03.But after hours, Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, marked the start of the quarterly earnings season by missing forecasts for the first time in four quarters. Alcoa reported earnings per share of 14 cents excluding restructuring costs, compared with analyst expectations of 22 cents. The stock was down in after-hours trading.Insurers were among the biggest beneficiaries of another Europe-fuelled rally. Genworth Financial, which sells a consumer debt insurance product in Europe, was up 3.1 per cent to $5.62. Fears that Europe’s financial crisis could herald a spike in unemployment, and lead to pay-outs on the policy, have weighed on Genworth’s stock price.Lincoln National rose 1.9 per cent to $16.34, and MetLife was up 0.6 per cent to $30.58, as the insurance sector rallied on hopes that European equity assets may recover in value.Derivative exchanges sold off, with CME Group down 3.4 per cent to $257 and IntercontinentalExchange off 2.3 per cent to $123.10, though analysts struggled to explain the moves.The New York Stock Exchange was up 2.3 per cent to $26.46, tracking its potential merger partner, German exchange Deutsche Börse, which rose 1.4 per cent while German markets were open.Fashion group Nordstrom was down 2.8 per cent to $49.26, after a filing showed executives had sold shares last week.Video streaming service Netflix continued its downward momentum, falling 2.7 per cent to $108.66. On Monday the company reversed a previous decision to hive off its DVD delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster, but did not row back on a 60 per cent price rise for the joint DVD and streaming service.Fertiliser maker Mosaic Company rose 4.3 per cent to $55.77 after Credit Suisse increased its estimates for fertiliser prices, citing strong demand for grain.Reits fell, with Equity Residential down 3.1 per cent to $52.91 and AvalonBay Communities falling 2.2 per cent to $118.50.Store chain 99 Cents Only Stores rose 4.4 per cent to $21.39 after agreeing to a $1.6bn cash takeover by alternative asset manager Ares Management and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

386;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-10-11T22:47:08Z;Brent crude added to Dow Jones-UBS index;Shift will have big implications for commodity investors;Brent crude oil futures are poised to attract billions of dollars more from investors after a leading index added the benchmark to its basket of commodities.More than 5.3 per cent of the Dow Jones-UBS commodity index will as of January track Brent, increasing the number of contracts followed by the basket by one to 20.As of June, $80.2bn in investor money tracked the index, making it the second most widely followed after the S&P GSCI.The shift will have big implications for commodity markets. Brent, linked to crude from the North Sea, is the flagship futures contract on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.Buying associated with the reallocation may increase open interest, which now stands at 900m barrels equivalent.Brent’s debut in the index, known as the Dow Jones-AIG upon its launch in 1998, will also reduce the weighting for West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, which now sells at a discount due to logistical issues around its Oklahoma delivery point.WTI’s target weight will fall from 14.7 per cent this year to 9.7 per cent in 2012.The index supervisory committee, which approved the change, cited Brent’s economic significance as a global benchmark, the liquidity of the futures contract and production levels of the crude stream.The committee wants “commodities that reflect a broadly diversified basket,” said Jamie Farmer, director of global business development and communications at Dow Jones Indexes, which markets the index.UBS, the investment bank, acquired the index from AIG in 2009. Dow Jones Indexes is 90 per cent owned by futures exchange operator CME Group, whose leading energy contract is WTI traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.News Corp has a 10 per cent stake in Dow Jones Indexes.“By giving it 65 per cent of the crude oil component, Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index has reffirmed that Nymex WTI is the benchmark of choice,” CME said.ICE parent IntercontinentalExchange said the addition “confirms Brent’s status as a leading global benchmark for crude oil pricing and its increasing adoption by commercial and financial market participants”.Brent settled Tuesday at $110.73 a barrel, almost $25 more than WTI.
387;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-10-11T09:15:09Z;Quick View: UK wakes up to Europe threat;Cameron comments indicate change in British attitudes;"“The French wouldn’t have us trying to move their aerospace industry to Poland, so I’m not having them trying to move our financial services industry to Frankfurt - forget it.”With these punchy words- in an interview with the FT - British prime minister David Cameron has signalled that, finally, the UK has woken up to what is going on in the eurozone when it comes to the City of London and efforts coming out of the eurozone to undermine its role as Europe’s financial centre.Whether it is the battle over the scope of Emir, the question of listed derivatives competition and the “vertical silo” in the Deutsche Börse/NYSE Euronext merger, the UK has been sleepwalking through the past year or so, apparently oblivious to, or powerless to act on, the coming threats that these issues pose.Paris has made no secret of its intention to use the aftermath of the 2008 crisis to build itself up as a hub for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearing, dating back to 2009 when the Banque de France produced a report calling for French banks to rally round and create a credit default swap clearing capability so as to ensure that London did not get all the business.The Deutsche Börse/NYSE Euronext deal will clearly bolster Frankfurt, with the prospect that the important function of clearing its futures and options contracts moving to Eurex Clearing there.Perhaps the City never really believed that these posed threats. The City accounts for the vast bulk of trading activity and employment in Europe. How would that really change?But one wonders if London has underestimated the depth of resentment , post-2008, at the role of “Anglo-Saxon” financial wizardry in helping to create the problems that led to the crisis (conveniently forgetting, it has to be said, the enthusiasm of German banks for a lot of the structured products that were subsequently vilified).Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, has said that the big data centre that his company built in Basildon is unlikely to be closed (as some fear) in favour of building up such infrastructure in Paris. He said at a recent briefing at the FT that the merger was probably “neutral” for London.Reto Francioni, his counterpart at the Börse, has been clear that the combined DB/NYSE would not de-emphasise London since - for example - most of Eurex’s derivatives customers are based there.None of this is a ringing endorsement of London; the City is not really a net beneficiary, it seems, even as it isn’t a great loser.Xavier Rolet, London Stock Exchange chief executive, has said that there is a threat to London, and it’s been under-appreciated.At the same time it’s not been sufficiently appreciated that London has paid a price for championing an open, mercantilist approach to financial services that has helped it become such a globally powerful financial centre.It has welcomed banks from all over the world and it is home to the largest OTC derivatives market - bigger than New York’s.Yet some of its key market infrastructures have fallen into the hands of large overseas manager-owners. The International Petroleum Exchange was acquired by a big US exchange, IntercontinentalExchange, and Liffe, the futures exchange, went to Paris-based Euronext - now part of NYSE Euronext, a US-based operator.It would be wrong to argue that British market structures should all stay under British control or ownership (whatever that actually means). We live in a world of globalised shareholding and governance that is transnational.Yet at a time when the whole landscape of financial services is undergoing a radical overhaul, and as political and economic self-interest among EU member states strains a long-held status quo, there is much to play for when it comes to London - and thinking more coherently about the City’s market structures is key to that.It’s not about crude flag-waving, but something more subtle. London’s ability to continue to be Europe’s financial capital will depend on its ability to understand that you have no market without market structures. And you need to think about how they are knitted together in a coherent ecosystem.As critical as industry observers were - including me - of Maple’s attempt to create a more coherent market ecosystem in Canada through its bid for TMX, the group was recognising this reality.Effectively, London now needs to re-aggregate its market structures. This is presumably why the LSE is attempting to take control of LCH.Clearnet, London’s main clearing house. I would be surprised if Mr Rolet was not also looking at the London Metal Exchange for the same reason - ICE and the rival US operator CME Group are top of the list as likely buyers - although it is hard to see how the LSE could afford both deals.Still, it does seem that with Downing Street apparently now weighing in, there is a chance that others in London may wake up."
388;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-10-06T15:18:50Z;CDS clearing nears real time;;Wall Street has continued the slow process of remaking fixed-income trading amid pending regulatory reforms and pressures to cut costs, with announcements this week of new products to clear credit swaps and track bond trades in real time.MarkitSERV, a joint venture between Markit and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, announced on Tuesday it had completed near-real time clearing for credit-default swap trades by several large dealers.Most credit-default swap trades, along with most over-the-counter derivatives, will be required to be centrally cleared as part of the Dodd-Frank reform act. The current process takes up to five days, with batches of trades sent to the clearing house, but the Dodd-Frank rules require real-time clearing.Using MarkitSERV’s process, trades last week by Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were sent within minutes to the clearing house owned by the IntercontinentalExchange, ICE Credit Clear.“The building blocks of the new Dodd-Frank world need faster connections between trading venues and clearing houses in a real-time manner, and then reporting of those trades to repositories,” said Jeff Gooch, chief executive of MarkitSERV. “That real-time clearing is the last building block we didn’t have in production for credit.”MarkitSERV, which connects to several clearing houses, estimates that about 20 per cent of the notional $15,000bn CDS market is cleared. Rules for mandatory clearing are still in process.Also on Tuesday, Knight Capital, among the world’s largest market-making firms, launched a new tool for analysing fixed income trades, called BondScope.The software platform allows clients of Knight, typically brokers who are trading bonds on behalf of clients, to track the execution of orders more closely and provides support in “identifying where an issue has previously traded or evaluating where similar bonds are priced”, Knight said.Bonds are typically traded manually between brokers, rather than as shares are on electronic exchanges where automated algorithms execute millions of trades every minute. Efforts by exchanges, such as NYSE Euronext, to create bond exchanges have been slow to take off in the past.“Over the last few years there has been a real push throughout the fixed-income industry to improve market transparency and execution quality,” said William Vulpis, managing director for Knight’s bond trading platform.Looming cost cuts at banks will drive further automation, according to Jay Bennett, managing director at Greenwich Associates.Revenues for trading of interest rates and credit by US commercial banks declined by 6 and 13 per cent, respectively, in the second quarter, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, versus only a 1 per cent slip for equities.“As banks increasingly look at the cost side of the equation, they are going to ask why more fixed income isn’t traded more electronically. I think it’s an area where you will start to see a lot more efficiencies,” he said.
389;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-10-06T12:13:26Z;LCH.Clearnet to accept gold as collateral;;Clearing houses are moving to beef up their financial ballast amid market volatility by allowing more gold to be used as collateral to back transactions processed through them by traders.The move is a sign that volatility in the markets and regulatory pressure for higher collateral in over-the-counter derivatives markets are prompting clearing houses and their customers to reassess the value of relying largely on cash and government bonds as collateral.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, using assets such as cash and government bonds as security, or collateral, posted at the clearing house by its members to help bail out a defaulting member or their customer.Gold, which investors perceive as an increasingly “safe haven” asset, has only recently been considered worthy of use as collateral by clearing houses.LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French clearing house, on Thursday became the latest clearer to allow gold as collateral. It said the service was available to customers that had signed up to clear OTC gold bullion and gold contracts on the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange.“Globally, gold has seen rapid growth in investment and regulators are looking for more OTC derivatives to be cleared,” LCH.Clearnet said.It added that the initiative “is supported” by the World Gold Council, the gold mining industry lobby group which recently suggested the metal could be included in banks’ “Tier 1” capital reserves – the buffer of safe assets meant to protect banks from losses on their investmentsDavid Farrar, director of commodities at LCH.Clearnet, said the move had been under consideration for some time and was largely the result of demand from customers using the London Metal Exchange, whose trades are cleared at LCH.Clearnet.“Banks now want to use gold alongside cash so they can optimise returns and they typically have large holdings of gold. The background is increasing margin liability that has to be put up to us because of volatility in the markets,” he said.LCH.Clearnet’s move follows that on Monday by CME Group, the US-based operator of futures exchanges and clearing houses, to increase the amount of gold accepted at its US-based clearing house.CME, which first accepted gold as collateral in October 2009, raised the amount that can be posted by a member to $500m, from $200m. It said this was “in response to customer demand” and was done “in conjunction with regular review of market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage”.The financial world is scrambling to find “safe” assets as nations deal with sovereign debt issues and seek to devalue their currencies. Some large banks now offer “collateral transformation services” promising to turn less-liquid assets, such as corporate bonds, into cash that can be used by their clients as security at clearing houses.New rules such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US and the upcoming European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) are driving increasing use of clearing for OTC markets, which in turn is putting pressure on market participants to put up more collateral than before.JPMorgan began accepting gold to satisfy collateral requirements in so-called repo transactions, meaning banks could use it as security when lending to each other under JPM’s framework.IntercontinentalExchange, a CME rival, started accepting gold at its London-based clearer, ICE Clear Europe, in November last year. It is used to back trades in energy and credit default swaps. ICE does not yet accept gold at its US clearing houses.ICE Clear Europe last year also introduced a “triparty collateral management arrangement” with Euroclear Bank, the international central securities depository, through which European government bonds may be used as collateral to fulfil initial margin requirements.Both the addition of gold collateral and the availability of collateral via Euroclear Bank were intended to “enhance the stability and flexibility of the clearing house, particularly during periods of intensive economic stress, while providing alternatives to customers,” ICE said at the time.
390;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-10-03T15:11:31Z;London Metal Exchange;Buyer will have to find improbably large synergies to justify £1bn price tag;"Its members have likened the London Metal Exchange to a golf club, but those certainly don’t carry price tags of about £1bn ($1.6bn). Since the LME announced last month that it would consider offers, more than 10 groups have expressed interest. The golf club analogy is accurate in that the LME is run by its members, for its members. But there the comparison ends; there are plenty of places to spoil a good walk, but only one centre of the metals trading world.It is this scarcity that is producing the £1bn price suggested by LME members. That represents a multiple of more than 100 times 2010 earnings, or about 60 times the £17.3m that UBS analysts expect the exchange to earn in 2012. Three of its rumoured suitors – CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and SGX, the Singapore exchange – trade at multiples to estimated 2012 earnings of 13, 16 and 20 times respectively. Whichever wins the LME’s hand is going to have to find improbably large synergies. There are some, such as adding the LME’s business to an existing in-house clearer, should the winner own one. The most obvious way to squeeze value, however, will be through raising trading fees. On that point, bidders will have to tread carefully: LME members are its users and are sensitive to higher costs. There are also worries about the commodities supercycle. The industry seems content to consider the recent sharp sell-offs as a correction rather than the end of a decade-long bull-run, but trading volumes are vulnerable to a weakening of the market mood.Expectations are that the LME will eventually be sold at some price guaranteed to make its members happy. The problem for the winner, however, will be explaining to its shareholders just how much of the price tag was simply down to the value of not letting a rival grab this one-off prize.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
391;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-10-03T08:48:32Z;LME Week focuses on demand uncertainty and deal making;The upbeat tone of last year’s annual gathering is missing;"LME Week, the annual get-together of the mining and metals industry, started in London on Sunday. Until Thursday, the debate among the 3,000 or so executives, traders and bankers will resonate beyond the metals industry, offering insight not only about the health of the broader commodities sector but also about the global economy.If the first two events of the 2011 LME Week are representative of the rest of the week, the conversation will centre around the outlook for demand, the potential for merger and acquisitions after the collapse in valuations, the sale of the LME and warehousing.•Demand: Ask two mining executives about demand and you will get three answers. That is the level of uncertainty in the sector. Nonetheless, almost everyone agrees that consumption growth has slowed, particularly in Europe and, to a lesser extent, in the US. Some customers have asked miners to delay shipments. Others have cancelled cargoes. Top customers in China continue to buy copper and other metals in large quantities; but smaller and medium-sized enterprises and traders are not buying as much.In general, customers are running down inventories, in part to take advantage of falling prices, as they know they will be able to re-stock at lower costs, and in part because they are worried about the economy or have little visibility about next quarter’s volumes. The key question is whether China, which accounts for about 40 per cent of global base metals consumption, will continue buying at its current pace or if it will slowdown.Overall, executives, traders and bankers believe that China and the rest of the world – and the metals and mining industry – is not heading for a repetition of the 2008 crisis, but the upbeat tone of last year’s LME Week is missing.•M&A: Mining share prices are at the level of mid-2009 when the sector was starting to recover from the global financial crisis, after a 20-30 per cent drop over the last year. For many industry executives, the low valuations provide screaming opportunities for mergers and acquisitions. And some are putting their money to work.Rio Tinto, the London-listed miner, and Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp have offered A$1.5bn to buy out minority investors in Australia’s Coal & Allied Industries. And Glencore, the commodities trader, is trying to buy Optimum, South Africa’s fourth largest thermal coal exporter. KGHM, the Polish miner, plans to spend about $3bn in M&A over the next two years, with the company’s executives saying that the current drop in valuations offer a great buying opportunity.At one of the first dinners of LME Week, an executive complained that bankers were pitching M&A ideas non-stop. Yet, there are deep worries. The memory of 2008-09 is recent and the so-called “90 per cent Club” – those companies which lost that much equity value from the peak of 2008 to the trough of 2009 – was full of miners.•LME sale: The idea of a sale has divided the London Metal Exchange’s 94 members, with some reluctant to give up control of the exchange amid worries about a hefty increase in fees, while others are keen to profit from their shareholdings.Nonetheless, there is a growing consensus that, sooner or later, the LME will change hands.Likely bidders include CME Group, the US exchange; SGX, the Singapore exchange; and IntercontinentalExchange, according to people familiar with the situation. Bidders should expect a hefty price tag. A week ago, when the LME revealed that it had received several approaches, members talked about a valuation of about $1.6bn. Now, some members are talking – or maybe they are joking – about valuations as high as $2bn. The higher the valuation the more money Goldman Sachs, the biggest LME shareholder, would make. The Wall Street bank is also the talk of the industry, having bought a significant chunk of LME shares over the last two years – more recently a month ago.•Warehousing: The LME’s long-awaited decision to to change its warehousing rules has not satisfied its critics, which are numerous and vociferous during this LME Week. The exchange told warehouses they should double the rate they deliver metal, but consumers say that is not enough. The consumers, along with several traders, banks and metal producers, argue that long queues to take delivery of aluminium, used in the manufacture of everything from drinks cans to cars and aircraft, have driven up the cost of metal in the physical market.The debate is focused on Detroit, where some 200,000 tonnes of aluminium are waiting to be delivered from warehouses owned by Goldman Sachs.Martin Abbott, the LME’s chief executive, is likely to raise the question in a traditional speech at the LME’s annual dinner on Tuesday. He could get a frosty reception from some of the world’s biggest consumers of metals."
392;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-10-02T21:58:11Z;Europe warned on reform of derivatives;;The biggest users of derivatives, including banks and asset managers, have warned the European Commission that imminent reform of derivatives markets risks “embedding lack of choice” and call for the business of clearing to be opened up to competition.The call, in a letter to Michel Barnier, EU commissioner for the internal market, marks a ratcheting up of efforts to challenge the status quo in the clearing of derivatives, in particular exchange ownership of clearing houses in an integrated “vertical silo”.“We consider that choice and efficiency in clearing services in the EU may diminish dramatically if the current trend towards concentration in the provision of clearing (and trading) services continues,” said the letter, signed by the British Bankers Association, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, all of which represent banks.It was also signed by the Investment Management Association, which represents UK pension fund and asset managers, the European Fund and Asset Management Association, the Association of Corporate Treasurers and its European sister association.Exchanges that operate silos – which include Deutsche Börse, CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange in the US - have come under fire from rivals that do not – such as the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq OMX – claiming such structures impede the ability of others to compete.Deutsche Börse and CME argue that ownership of clearing allows savings for traders and that rivals are free to compete if they can come up with viable products.Clearing has been a source of friction over the years between exchanges that own their own clearers and the banks that are big customers of them.But it is coming to a head as a wave of EU financial regulations are set to create new market structures for over-the-counter derivatives, with clearing of them a key requirement of wider G20 reforms.Clearing is a key feature of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) which requires that many OTC derivatives be cleared to help safeguard the system against the effect of a big default.It is also central to a probe by Brussels antitrust authorities into the proposed combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse. That would not only combine the group’s respective futures platforms, Liffe and Eurex, but would also strengthen the Börse’s clearing house, Eurex Clearing, as it would act as clearer for the combined platforms.The LSE, Nasdaq and many banks argue that access to clearing houses should be made easier and that silos should accept for clearing contracts from any trading venue. They also say this should apply to existing exchange-traded derivatives, not merely to OTC derivatives that are set to be cleared as part of the Emir reforms and its equivalent in the US, the Dodd-Frank act.“Specifically we believe that Emir contains insufficient safeguards in this respect. A fundamental shortcoming in the text is that such safeguards as exist are not applied across all financial instruments but only to a limited set of OTC derivatives,” the associations said.“Such open access requirements should ensure that a clearing house must accept instruments for clearing regardless of the venue on which they are traded, and that a venue must provide data feeds and other assistance to any clearing house that wants to clear the instrument in question.“We are concerned that the forthcoming European Markets and Infrastructure Regulation does not take proper account of the likely concentration of clearing provision. It may thus inadvertently, through legislation, embed lack of choice in European financial markets.”
393;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-10-02T20:37:30Z;Goldman set to be LME sale winner;;Goldman Sachs has more than quadrupled its stake in the London Metal Exchange in the past two years, making the US investment bank the biggest potential winner from the proposed sale of the 130-year-old exchange.The LME, the centre for global metals trading, said last week it had been approached by more than 10 suitors over a sale that shareholders hope will value it at more than £1bn ($1.6bn). That would give the shares a value of about £77.50 each, 15 times the last traded price, putting Goldman and other shareholders in line for a large windfall.Ownership of the 130-year-old exchange, which houses the last open outcry trading pit in Europe, is restricted to its 94 members and shares rarely come on the market. The most recent trade in LME shares was the sale of the shareholding of Lehman Brothers’ European arm, which Goldman bought in July, according to people familiar with the situation. Since August 2009 it has raised its stake from 300,000 shares to 1.23m.The buying spree has made the bank the LME’s largest shareholder with a stake of 9.5 per cent, potentially worth as much as £95m ($150m).The prospective sale of the LME will be a central topic at the main annual gathering of the metals industry, LME week, which begins on Monday in London.The idea of a sale has divided the LME’s members, with some reluctant to give up control of the exchange while others are keen to profit from their shareholdings. Likely bidders include CME Group, the US exchange, SGX, the Singapore exchange, and IntercontinentalExchange, a CME rival, according to people familiar with the situation.Goldman, which has the leading commodities business by revenues among investment banks, is an active participant in the metals market. having the leading commodities business among investment banks by revenues The head of its metals trading business, Stephen Branton-Speak, is a member of the LME’s board.A person close to Goldman said its LME shareholding was managed separately from its trading operations. Goldman declined to comment on whether it was advising any party in the potential sale, although bankers believe it would be unlikely to do so given its large stake in the exchange. The LME is being advised by Moelis.In addition to the Lehman Brothers stake, Goldman has bought shares from Investec Bank UK and Phibro Futures & Metals, according to the LME’s filings with Companies House.The US bank is not the only LME member whose shrewd acquisitions have put it in line for a potentially large windfall.The second-largest shareholder with a 9.4 per cent stake is the family of Raj Bagri, the former chairman of the LME, through its ownership of metals brokerage Metdist. The company most recently bought shares in September 2009, but the majority of its 9.4 per cent stake was acquired soon after the demutualisation of the exchange in 2000. Other top shareholders include JPMorgan, MF Global and UBS.
394;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-09-30T20:16:20Z;Rolet goes through a change of fortune;;This week marked a turnround in the fortunes of Xavier Rolet, the French chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, and a new chapter in London's position as a global financial centre.Three months after the failure of his attempt to merge the LSE with TMX Group, operator of Canada’s exchanges, Mr Rolet had good news from the board of LCH.Clearnet, London’s biggest clearing house.It approved the LSE making a €20-a-share offer for 51 per cent of LCH.Clearnet to the clearer’s 98 shareholders – mostly banks that are users of the institution. Mr Rolet beat a rival bid from Markit, a derivatives post-trade company run by Canadian Lance Uggla.Now Mr Rolet, 51, finds himself with much more to handle than just trying to clinch the deal. He and the LSE have become embroiled in a bigger chess game involving the consolidation of all three of London’s main market infrastructures: the LSE, LCH.Clearnet and the London Metal Exchange.This week the LME, the largest metals market in the world, said it had received more than 10 expressions of interest from many of the biggest exchanges, thought to include CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange, two US futures exchanges, and SGX, the Singapore bourse.Icap, the interdealer broker run by leading City figure Michael Spencer, has said it is interested. Others expected to run the slide rule over the 164-year-old exchange – where traders still shout orders from red leather benches in a “ring” – are TMX Group and ASX, the Australian exchange.The LME has been “top of everyone’s M&A list for about five years”, says one industry insider.The whirlwind of developments around the Square Mile is a sign that the epicentre of exchange mergers, which had sputtered recently amid nationalist and antitrust hurdles, has been restarted around London.That hands Mr Rolet a starring role in the process, along with his counterpart at the LME, Martin Abbott – a former publisher of Metal Bulletin magazine – and Ian Axe, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet.At stake is a redefinition of London’s market structures at a time when trading flows are shifting to Asia and a raft of new EU regulations is emerging. The new rules will require London to build up its exchange and clearing business. A merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext looms, too. That would create the world’s largest exchange group with four times the revenues of the LSE. In recent years London has lost the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) to US ownership – it was bought by ICE – and Liffe, the futures exchange, to NYSE Euronext, robbing the LSE of the chance to own a London-based futures exchange.Lynton Jones, chairman of Bourse Consult and the last chief executive of the IPE, says the City’s loss of control over the two UK exchanges was “a failure to see that these market structures are global”. He adds: “I think Xavier sees that, but the problem is it’s a little bit late so he has a fight on his hands.”The urgency to think global may explain why the LSE has enlisted the help of SGX, the Singapore exchange, as a minority partner in its bid for LCH.Clearnet, says one person familiar with the matter. There are also reports that Mr Rolet has discussed teaming up with SGX counterpart Magnus Böcker on a bid for the LME. The LSE declined to comment. Mr Rolet, recently recovered from pneumonia, will need all the energy he can muster to play the chess to his advantage.
395;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;LME has already seen a ‘raft of interest’;Martin Abbott says metal exchange approached by more than 10 suitors;"The London Metal Exchange has been approached by more than 10 suitors and expects to open its books for inspection in early December, Martin Abbott, chief executive of the exchange, told the Financial Times.The LME, which hosts the futures contracts used as global industry benchmarks for base metals from copper to nickel, is seen as the last great prize in a wave of consolidation as exchanges seek to capitalise on booming interest in commodities.In his first public comments since announcing the possible takeover last week, Mr Abbott said there had been a “raft of interest” in the exchange. Asked how many expressions of interest the exchange had received, he said: “We’re into double figures.”Likely bidders include CME Group, the US exchange, SGX, the Singapore exchange and IntercontinentalExchange, a CME rival, according to people familiar with the matter. LME shareholders are hoping for a valuation of £1bn or more.The approaches come ahead of the largest annual gathering of the metals industry, LME week, starting this weekend. The LME’s flagship copper contract has hit a series of daily volume records in the past week as the price of the metal has tumbled after soaring to record highs earlier this year. Total LME volumes have risen 18 per cent so far this year.The prospect of a takeover promises to deliver a windfall to the exchange’s 71 member-shareholders. The family of Raj Kumar Bagri, a former LME chairman, which owns metals trader Metdist, holds a 9.4 per cent stake that could be worth as much as £100m. Goldman Sachs is the largest shareholder with 9.5 per cent.Mr Abbott, who was publisher of Metal Bulletin, a metals magazine, stands to profit thanks to a scheme that has awarded him options that would convert into LME shares in the event of a takeover.He suggested that money alone would not be enough to win control of the exchange, which was founded in 1877 and is the last “open outcry” exchange in Europe.“I actually think anyone trying to buy this exchange has a bit of a mountain to climb to persuade shareholders that there is good reason to sell the shares,” he said.“Obviously money talks, but my guess is it will take more than just money …It will be a combination, I think, of money and undertakings around the future model of the business. Don’t forget that what we’ve got here at the LME is reasonably tightly held ownership by corporates, not individuals.”The intense interest in the LME reflects its scarcity value as one of the few exchanges with a large franchise in commodity derivatives, which are generating more profits for exchanges than any other.The LME is also at the heart of intense manoeuvring among London’s market infrastructures. On Wednesday LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house for the LME, said it had entered exclusive talks with the London Stock Exchange about a possible acquisition by the UK bourse. The LME is a roughly 8 per cent shareholder in LCH.Clearnet and Mr Abbott sits on its board. He declined to comment on the deal.Mr Abbott said the LME expected to open up its books for potential bidders to perform due diligence in early December.He declined to comment on the identities of potential bidders or a likely valuation.Mr Abbott said a sale was not a foregone conclusion. “There is actually no need to sell the LME,” Mr Abbott said. “We’re really on top of our game; we’ve never been stronger.”"
396;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-09-28T14:41:51Z;Wall Street inches up despite Europe fears;;Semiconductor manufacturer Jabil Circuit jumped 8.4 per cent to $18.84 on strong results for the quarter ended August 31.Earnings per share of 62 cents were 10 cents up on a year ago, and 6 cents higher than forecast by a Bloomberg poll of analysts. Although revenue only increased moderately, a higher return on capital allowed the company to boost profitability.Semi stocks have suffered all summer, as data showed companies carrying large inventories, and declining sales of end products, such as personal computers.Citigroup analyst Jim Suva wrote in a client note that “competitors will struggle to match [Jabil’s] results.”and investors appeared to agree with the Philadelphia semiconductor index closing down 2.9 per cent.The wider Wall Street rally evaporated, as hopes of a European deal on sovereign debt again hit a snag, with the European Commission reportedly wading into the argument about whether private banks should take a bigger hit on Greek bonds.The S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent to 1,151.06, shedding half of its gains from Monday and Tuesday’s rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6 per cent to 11,010.90, and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 2.2 per cent to 2,491.58.Management consultancy Accenture reported earnings per share of 71 cents for the quarter ended August 31, 2 cents higher than expected, despite falling revenue from its financial and European arms.Shares were up 0.3 per cent to $55.83.But David Koning, analyst at Robert W Baird, warned the recent appreciation in the dollar meant the company could incur foreign exchange losses in 2012.“Further appreciation [of the dollar] could negatively impact revenue and earnings per share,” he added.Materials and energy stocks were hammered on renewed fears for global growth.Amazon shares were up 2.4 per cent to $229.50, after the company unveiled a tablet to compete with Apple’s Ipad.Coal miners Alpha Natural Resources, down 11 per cent to $18.92, and Peabody Energy, off 8 per cent to $35.73, were particularly hard hit.John Bridges, JP Morgan’s coal analyst, said US coal miners faced a dual challenge of a falling metallurgical coal price, and a return to production in Australia, after flooding earlier this year.“When the floods knocked out Aussie production, the Appalachian miners were able to squeeze more of their coal into the higher priced met market. Now they may try and sell this material into the thermal market, and the gap between the two prices is huge,” he said.Cliffs Natural Resources,was off 8.4 per cent to $55.66 after the company announced it would take a $30m hit to earnings, after deciding to idle production at a biomass production facility in Michigan, which has also been put up for sale.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar was down 10.4 per cent to $64.75. Most First Solar revenue comes from Europe, where the weak financial sector is making it difficult for the company to raise finance for new projects.Chesapeake Energy fell 1.4 per cent to $27.27, even after the company reported successful exploratory drilling in its Utica shale field in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The field could yield oil and ethylene, which fetch higher prices than natural gas.All five exchange stocks in the S&P 500 fell after José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, declared his support for a financial transaction tax in Europe, which could hit on-exchange trading.The New York Stock Exchange fell furthest, down 6.3 per cent to $24.01. According to UBS analyst Alex Kramm, the NYSE is the most exposed to Europe of the US exchanges. The planned merger with Germany’s Deutsche Börse, which fell 4.6 per cent on the news, also weighed on NYSE.The CME Group, fell 3 per cent to $254.32, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange also fell 3 per cent to $26.35, although the US derivatives exchanges are not significantly exposed to Europe.Nasdaq OMX, whose Nordic cash and derivatives business represents 6 to 7 per cent of revenue, was down 4.3 per cent to $23.99. Mr Kramm said a 30 per cent hit to revenue from the Nordic business would reduce his guidance for Nasdaq’s 2012 earnings per share from $2.83 to $2.58.Intercontinental Exchange fell 2.1 per cent to $121.42. Its European businesses are based in London, which may escape a transaction tax.Family Dollar was off 1.6 per cent to $53.31, despite reporting earnings per share of 66 cents on sales of $2.1bn for the quarter ended August 31, a record for the company.Good results were already priced into the stock, which is one of a handful in the S&P 500 whose share price has risen since market volatility began on July 25.
397;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-09-27T15:36:26Z;Rolet aims to land knock-out blow;;It was like waiting for the white smoke in a papal election. But the board of LCH.Clearnet has decided to approve the London Stock Exchange’s offer for the clearer over a lower proposal from Markit, the post-trade and data company.The LSE’s offer of up to €21 a share for a 51 per cent stake values the clearer at about €1bn (£870m), and is significantly higher than Markit’s offer of €12 a share, plus an earn-out, for the whole company. It now goes to LCH.Clearnet’s 98 shareholders for approval – but this is not a done deal.At least two questions arise.First, why is Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, proposing to pay so much?The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation was offering €739m when it went after LCH.Clearnet in 2008, while the “Lily” consortium of banks, including Icap, the inter-dealer broker, offered €11 a share a year later, valuing the clearer at about €830m at the time.Not only is LCH.Clearnet hard to value, being a not-entirely-integrated product of the 2003 merger of the London Clearing House and Clearnet SA, but its financial results have hardly inspired in the past two years. Profit before tax in the 2010 financial year was €32.3m, compared with €163.5m, after net revenue fell 21 per cent to €355.6m.Tariff reductions took their toll in cash equities clearing as the clearer engaged in a price war on clearing fees against smaller rivals like EMCF and Euro CCP. Pressure on fees remains, as “interoperability” – the ability to choose equities clearer – came into play this summer.LCH.Clearnet also has been losing customers – notably ICE and Liffe, the futures exchanges – although it has tried to make up the shortfall by winning some new business, notably in Asia. And its RepoClear repo clearing business does make decent money.Second, how would Mr Rolet handle SwapClear, LCH.Clearnet’s interest rates swaps clearing service and the banks heavily involved in it? The largest of those banks are leading shareholders in LCH.Clearnet and members of the OTCDerivNet corporate governance committee that “runs” SwapClear.Moreover, the LSE has no track record in SwapClear’s business of clearing over-the-counter interest rate swaps.In answer to the first question, Mr Rolet needs to deliver a knock-out blow to secure LCH.Clearnet. And judging by the fact that – as I undertstand it – only 3 of the 15 banks on the LCH.Clearnet board voted for Markit, the banks were looking a gift horse in the mouth.Fortunately, Mr Rolet can afford it. The LSE’s net debt (of £370m) to ebitda ratio in March was one times. Daniel Garrod, a Barclays Capital analyst, says LSE management has indicated it could leverage up towards two times earnings, suggesting firepower of £650m-£700m.There are also possible synergies – building on an ongoing restructuring under Ian Axe, LCH.Clearnet chief executive. Progress has been made in integrating the clearer’s IT systems, which are spread between Paris and London, but more could be done. Overheads could be shrunk, for example.On the revenue side, the LSE could bring new products (especially derivatives) to the table. Having its own clearer would help get those products to market fast – just as CME Group and Eurex, the Deutsche Börse futures unit, have shown in the past.Arguably the bigger opportunity is on the treasury management side. Clearing houses make most of their money from lending out the margin collateral that members and customers deposit with them (last year, the value of collateral held on behalf of clearing members at LCH.Clearnet was up 15 per cent up at €510bn). The LSE has done well recently improving the treasury side of its only existing clearing business, Borsa Italiana’s Cassa clearing house.As for the banks, they will naturally be concerned to ensure that clearing fees are not ramped up. But Mr Rolet used to sit on their side of the table when he was at Lehman Brothers, and knows that he cannot do any deal without assuaging such concerns.The solution might be to create a governance structure where the banks have enough skin in the game to act as a check on pricing and other powers. Mr Rolet has already had success with this model at Turquoise, the former 100 per cent bank-owned equities trading platforms that the LSE now controls (the banks retain 49 per cent). Turquoise has done well, proving that the “re-mutualisation” of the relationship between exchanges and banks can work.But there is one complication: the London Metal Exchange, which along with NYSE Euronext has 17 per cent of the shares in LCH.Clearnet.Martin Abbott, the LME’s chief executive who is a board member of LCH.Clearnet, has spiced things up in London. First, he has said that the LME is looking at building its own clearing house, a move that would see it cutting ties with LCH.Clearnet, which clears its metals contracts. Second, he revealed that the LME is itself in play.Were LME to sell itself to another exchange – ICE, say – then that would immediately affect LCH.Clearnet’s valuation. But, if the LSE is really serious about building an integrated exchange and clearing house, even that may not be problematic. It just depends on how determined Mr Rolet is to get hold of a clearer. The answer seems to be: very.
398;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-09-26T20:58:27Z;Casino stocks hit by fears of Asian slowdown;;Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands slid to their fifth consecutive sessions of losses, and Melco Crown Entertainment its fourth in five, as investors fretted that a potential slowdown in the Chinese economy might effect their casino operations in Macau.“There seems to be an awful lot of concern that a slowdown in the Asian economies will reduce the funding that’s available for the corporate junket business, which is really the engine of these businesses’ growth in Macau,” said David Katz, an analyst at Jefferies.Wynn depended on its Macau operation for about a third of revenue, LVS for more than 40 per cent, and Melco for almost its entire business, Mr Katz said. All three operators are now down more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday, significantly underperforming the broad S&P 500.On Monday Wynn was down 1.4 per cent to $136.78, off more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday. LVS fell 1.6 per cent to $43.69, down 11.2 per cent over the five days. Melco fell 3.3 per cent to $9.85 and is off almost 17 per cent since Tuesday.But most analysts said company data did not suggest a slowdown was imminent. Carlo Santarelli, gaming analyst at Deutsche Banks said, “I’m not seeing anything fundamental out of Macau to make me believe there is anything changing in the VIP. I think the share price moves are more reflective of general macro fears in the equity markets.”Elsewhere, the S&P 500 bounced a healthy 2.3 per cent to 1,162.95, to snap a five day slump, driven by a strong rally in bank stocks.Financials in the S&P 500 rose 4.4 per cent, significantly more than any other sector. Citigroup jumped 7 per cent to $26.72 and JPMorgan was also up 7 per cent to $31.65. Bank of America also outperformed the sector, up 4.6 per cent to $6.60, as crisis meetings involving European and American officials once again raised hopes of a solution to the eurozone crisis, which has battered bank stocks.Gains for big banks pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 2.5 per cent to 11,043.86, but the Nasdaq Composite index, which has a lower weighting of financials, and whose bank stocks tend to be small domestic lenders, lagged behind, up only 1.4 per cent to 2,516.69.Consol Energy was the best performer in the S&P 500, gaining 9 per cent to $37.17, after announcing the $193m sale of royalties on a Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to Antero Corporation.Berkshire Hathaway shares rose 8.1 per cent to $108,449, after Warren Buffett’s company announced it would use some of its $48bn cash hoard to repurchase shares. The buy-back programme allows for unlimited purchases as long as the stock is trading at a premium of less than 10 per cent of book value, and the company’s cash pile remains above $20bn.Netflix was up 2.2 per cent to $132.22, despite reports of a deal with DreamWorks Animation to stream the studio’s content. Netflix’s share price has fallen by more than 50 per cent in recent weeks after it broke off negotiations to renew a content contract with the Stars cable network, and a move to separate its streaming and DVD delivery business lost it up to 1m subscribers.Expedia, the online travel company, jumped 4.7 per cent to $28.44 after Piper Jaffray analysts upgraded the stock to “buy”, arguing international bookings could account for 50 per cent of revenue by 2013.Clorox Company, the cleaning products manufacturer, was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, down 4.3 per cent to $66.44, after investor Carl Icahn withdrew his nominees to the board of directors, citing shareholder resistance to his attempted buy-out of the company. Clorox had been up almost 10 per cent for the year before Monday on expectations of a takeover.With the S&P 500 down 17 per cent from its April 29 peak at the start of the day, most analysts notes on Monday were discussing the probability of a bear market and how to position for it.Adam Parker, Morgan Stanley’s US equity strategist, said the high correlation among sectors in the S&P 500 leaves few obvious defensive plays. Less than a quarter of healthcare stocks and only half of consumer staple stocks have a correlation to the index of less than 0.9. The 80 per cent of utility stocks, which are exhibiting low correlation to the S&P 500, may be the best bet for investors expecting the market to enter bear territory.But, Mr Parker warned “low beta stocks have seen a recent increase in trading volume relative to high beta stocks”, which has driven up prices, so investors would have to pay a price to buy into defensive stocks.Two less intuitive candidates for defensive plays are exchanges and brokers. Exchanges have seen trading volumes spike during recent market volatility, which has increased revenue. Several analysts have recommended buying into the sector, and Nasdaq OMX, CME Group and Intercontinental­Exchange have all outperformed the S&P 500 since July 25.On the day, Nasdaq OMX was 0.3 per cent higher at $24.47, CME Group had gained 0.7 per cent to $259.83 and Intercontinental­Exchange had risen 0.4 per cent to $122.58.But Alex Kramm at UBS, who has “buy” ratings on all three names, said: “We still think there’s value in exchanges as a defensive play within financials.”The New York Stock Exchange is down 29 per cent since July 25, almost twice the fall in the S&P 500, although it has largely moved in tandem with potential merger partner Deutsche Börse, so has suffered from falls in European markets.Despite NYSE’s underperformance, “I’d hesitate to pick it as a favourite given uncertainty around the merger”, said Mr Kramm.Brokers have also benefited from a sharp rise in trading volumes. In a note last week Brad Hintz at Bernstein Research said Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and LPL Investment Holding, all of which have significantly underperformed their indices, had “relative near-term opportunities” from elevated trading volume.But on Monday he revised down earnings per share estimates for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, arguing that the impact of depressed IPO and M&A activity on investment bank earnings would outbalance any sharp rise in revenue from their brokerage businesses. He predicted Goldman Sachs would deliver a 20 cent loss per share in the third quarter.
399;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-09-23T16:31:41Z;LME is target of £1bn consolidation;;The London Metal Exchange on Friday became the latest exchange to be swept up in consolidation when it said it had “received several expressions of interest with regard to potential strategic transactions”.Likely bidders for the 130-year-old exchange, which is the world’s biggest metals market by volume, are CME Group, the US exchange, SGX, the Singapore exchange and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), a CME rival, a person familiar with the matter said.The exchange could be worth more than £1bn, members believe. The illiquid ordinary shares of the exchange last traded at £4.952, according to JPMorgan Cazenove, its broker, implying a valuation of about £65m.”All three potential bidders offer trading in metals on a smaller scale than the LME. Any purchase of LME would give the buyer by far the dominant metals trading business in the world at a time when China is emerging as a serious rival in key metals such as copper, traded on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.CME trades precious, ferrous and base metal derivatives at Comex, part of the former New York Mercantile Exchange, which CME bought in 2009. Its biggest contract is gold futures. CME declined to comment.The LME accounts for 80 per cent of traded volume in global metal futures transactions. LME prices are used as benchmarks by miners and consumers. The LME offers futures and options contracts for aluminium, copper, tin, nickel, zinc, lead, aluminium alloy, steel billet as well as minor metals – cobalt and molybdenum.While the exchange generated just £12.5m in pre-tax profits last year, shareholders believe it could produce significantly higher earnings by raising fees to levels comparable with other exchanges. The LME charges about 25 cents in fees per trade, compared to CME’s fees of about $1, traders said.To succeed, any bidder would have to negotiate a price with the LME’s 92 members, many of whom also own shares. The largest shareholders are Goldman Sachs, Metdist, the privately owned metals trader, JPMorgan, MF Global and UBS, which between them hold a third of the company.The exchange is one of the few left not to have demutualised and listed on a stock exchange. It also retains one of the world’s last remaining trading pits – known as “rings” at the LME – where traders shout orders to each other.“Until now, probably people have always thought that it may never happen,” said an executive at one shareholding company. However, a valuation above £1bn “may start to get people interested”, he added.The LME said its board, which is being advised by Moelis, an M&A advisory firm, would begin a formal process “which may or may not lead to an acceptable offer for the company being received”.It said: “The interest shown in the LME, where total trading volumes are currently at record levels, reflects the importance of the exchange in global commodities markets.”Martin Abbott, chief executive of the LME, said: “The LME’s future as the world’s leading metal exchange is more secure today than at any point in its history.”Average daily volume is 18 per cent higher so far this year than the average daily volume for the whole of last year.Last year, the LME saw record trading volumes of 120m lots, the equivalent of 2.8bn tonnes of metal.The LME in May said it was considering building its own clearing house and this month hired its first head of post-trade business.
400;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Clearing: Policymakers get down to the detail;Jeremy Grant reports on worries about changes to the rules for central counterparties;Two years on from the start of a huge overhaul of financial market infrastructure, it has become a central tenet for policymakers that one way to make the financial system safer is through greater use of clearing, especially in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.That change is enshrined in the Dodd-Frank Act on financial regulation in the US.It is also the thrust of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) rules being finalised in the European Union.Dodd-Frank, for example, mandates that all clearing-eligible derivatives be processed through clearers, or central counterparties (CCPs) to help reduce risk.The seller of a security sells to the CCP. The CCP sells to the buyer at the same time – if one party defaults the CCP can absorb the loss. It uses margin or collateral provided by the defaulting member to enable it to do this and can call on pooled resources.This sounds relatively simple, but complications have started to arise as regulators come up with the fine print on how it should work and market participants grapple with how to adjust.There are concerns that, if CCPs are to take on new risks – which is what clearing much more of the $600,000bn in notional outstanding value of OTC derivatives would entail – the risks they are taking on should be adequately managed.As Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the University of Houston, says, this is because CCPs are “important interconnectors in the financial system and thus likely to be systemically important financial institutions”.That, experts argue, means there should be adequate oversight and on a worldwide basis, since the derivatives markets they will handle are global.No cross-border system for CCP oversight exists, although this is being worked on.At the same time, the drive for more central clearing is already pitting the world’s biggest CCPs – those operated by CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange of the US, Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing and LCH.Clearnet, the UK clearer – against each other.The concern is that increased competition could lead to laxer financial thresholds and standards in the name of attracting customers to CCPs. And that this could lead to increased risk.For these reasons, debate is raging over the ownership model and governance structure for CCPs.The Bank of England notes that, from a risk perspective, “not-for-profit, user-owned CCPs provide strong incentives for effective risk management”. Whereas for-profit companies are less able to do that, it says.Yet Mr Pirrong points out that most CCPs were originally created by exchanges to serve their members’ interests, and were not “designed as macro-prudential institutions”.Others are worried about the level of new risks moving into CCPs.Manmohan Singh, a senior economist at the International Monetary Fund, says the OTC derivatives markets are under-collateralised by $2,000bn, meaning that banks using them may have to post more collateral than they had thought.There are also questions about who should be allowed to be members of a CCP.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator that is writing rules to implement Dodd-Frank, is grappling with whether to open CCP membership to a relatively wide group of financial institutions – to help spread risk – or to restrict it to the largest that would be strong enough financially to handle big defaults.Banks that will act as intermediaries between users of derivatives – such as asset managers and companies – and the CCPs themselves are also worried about the relationships emerging between CCPs, banks and their customers.A key aspect is “guaranteed portability”, an agreement between clearing members – banks, for example – to take on client portfolios cleared via another member, should one default.While not required in law, this facility is increasingly being asked of some banks by their clients. Yet banks are uneasy, as this could expose them to what they claim would be unmeasurable risk.JPMorgan says clearing members that sign these agreements “commit to unknown additional risk, unknown funding requirements to the clearing house, and an unknown impact on their capital measures, right at the point of extreme market stress” – such as a default.Dale Braithwait, global head of credit clearing at the bank, says: “We believe that guaranteed portability is pro-cyclical and potentially dangerous if widely adopted …The problem is where to draw the line, since this is the ultimate ‘wrong-way risk’.”
401;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-09-14T15:50:27Z;Britain to sue ECB over threat to City;UK claims new clearing rules put London at risk;Britain is to sue the European Central Bank for setting rules that allegedly handicap the City of London and would force one of the world’s largest clearing houses to decamp operations to the euro area.The unprecedented legal action underlines the depth of ministerial concern over the ECB policy, which comes as the UK engages in a turf war with France and Germany over Europe’s financial markets infrastructure.An ECB policy paper, released in the summer, requires clearing houses to be based in the eurozone if they handle more than 5 per cent of the market in a euro-denominated financial product.Britain will ask the courts to strike down the rule on the grounds that it restricts the free movement of capital and infringes on the right to establish cross-border businesses across a multicurrency European Union.The policy, if enforced by the ECB, would undermine London’s financial market infrastructure since it would require that clearing houses shift many of their operations to the eurozone – most likely Frankfurt or Paris.A Treasury spokesperson said: “This decision contravenes European law and fundamental single market principles by preventing the clearing of some financial products outside the Euro area. That is why we have begun proceedings against the European Central Bank through the European Court of Justice.”British diplomats have long feared that Paris was leading attempts to rig market regulations in a bid to shift the centre of gravity for financial services from the City to the continent.The UK fought off French attempts in recent months to insert into an EU directive a requirement for clearing houses to have access to central bank liquidity – a measure effectively confining most euro-denominated clearing to the eurozone.The lawsuit is expected to be filed imminently at the European Court of Justice. It is the first case brought against the ECB by Britain.London is home to LCH.Clearnet, which processes most share trading that takes place on the London Stock Exchange and operates an over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearing service, making it one of the largest clearing houses in the world. The clearer also operates a clearing house in Paris, called Clearnet SA.Clearing houses have assumed heightened importance to maintaining the stability of the financial system due to G20 regulations designed to clean up after the 2008 financial crisis.The ECB argues that, in the interests of financial stability, it is necessary to locate financial market infrastructure in the eurozone so that crises are not handled by multiple central banks with conflicting interests.“As a matter of principle, infrastructures that settle euro-denominated payment transactions should settle these transactions in central bank money and be legally incorporated in the euro area,” its policy states.The ECB’s policy would immediately hit LCH.Clearnet, since it has a large portfolio of euro-denominated business split between clearing of European government bonds and repos, and euro-denominated over the counter interest rate swaps.The ECB declined to comment on Wednesday.Michael McKee, partner at DLA Piper, a law firm, said: “There would certainly appear to be a prima facie arguable case that any attempt to require a clearing house, located in the EU but outside of the eurozone, to relocate inside the eurozone breaches EU Treaty free movement requirements.”Two US exchange groups, CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange, recently set up clearing houses in London to serve as their beachhead in Europe as they take advantage of post-2008 crisis regulations pushing more clearing of derivatives – instruments in which London acts as Europe’s main hub. However their euro denominated business is minimal at this stage.The ECB policy also said: “Given its mandate to promote the ‘smooth operation for payment systems’, the Eurosystem has major concerns with regard to the development of major euro area financial market infrastructures that are located outside of the euro area”.In 2009 a confidential memo by the Banque de France was leaked, in which the bank called for the establishment of a Paris-based clearing house for credit default swaps, a type of derivative instrument, to prevent the business being dominated by London.
402;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-09-12T21:55:04Z;ICE to name US commodity futures chief;;IntercontinentalExchange plans to name a new chief of its US commodity futures exchange as president Thomas Farley assumes new responsibilities at the company.Ben Jackson, named chief operating officer of the ICE Futures US exchange in July, is set to add the title of president later in the year, a person familiar with the company’s plans said.ICE Futures US is the leading American trading venue for soft commodities, such as sugar, cotton and coffee. The bourse also hosts equity index and currency futures. Mr Farley has headed the exchange since ICE bought the former New York Board of Trade in 2007.As president, Mr Farley led the exchange’s rapid move into electronic trading, overseeing the end of open-outcry futures in 2008 and parrying critics of high-frequency strategies.He is expected to remain at ICE, whose other businesses include a London-based energy exchange and platforms for trading and clearing over-the-counter derivatives.Both Messrs Farley and Jackson joined ICE from Sungard, a trading technology company, where each separately led the Kiodex commodities unit. In 2009, Sungard bought ICE Risk, a position-keeping system for the commodity markets, from ICE.In the eight months until the end of August, average daily trading volume at ICE Futures US rose 1.7 per cent from the same period a year ago. In August, index futures and options volumes surged 70.1 per cent on the year, while agricultural commodities volumes were roughly unchanged.Commodity options trading continues on the ICE’s New York floor, rented in a building owned by ICE competitor CME Group. The lease expires in June 2013.
403;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;CME takes aim at ‘parasitic’ derivatives;;"The head of the largest US futures exchange has labelled derivatives that track the price of traditional commodity futures “parasitic”, stoking tension over proposed US curbs on speculators.Craig Donohue, chief executive of Chicago-based CME Group, said that pending US rules limiting commodity speculation would prompt banks and hedge funds to abandon futures that require physical delivery and pour money into contracts that settle in cash.The reason for this, he said, was that the US commodity regulator had proposed allowing traders to hold five times more cash-settled contracts than traditional futures contracts.“What you’re doing is you’re encouraging people to leave the physical delivery, price discovery contract and move to what I would call a parasitic, second-order derivative,” Mr Donohue told the Financial Times. CME’s exchanges list leading physical commodity futures, including West Texas Intermediate crude oil, natural gas, corn and soyabeans.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is in the next month set to vote on its proposal to cap speculation in 28 commodities. Congress required the new rule as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms passed last year.Position limits have been among the most controversial of the dozens of new derivatives rules advanced by the CFTC, drawing more than 13,000 public comments.The different treatment for cash-settled and physically-settled products has pitted older exchanges such as CME and the Kansas City Board of Trade against the newer IntercontinentalExchange, which hosts cash-settled products that track CME’s benchmark US natural gas and crude oil futures. ICE and CME have lobbied CFTC officials heavily on the issue.“In the end you’re dealing with an incentive for regulatory arbitrage,” Mr Donohue said. “People will go to the area that they have the most headroom.”A form of the new limit regime has been in place on both CME and ICE natural gas markets since February 2010. CME also has some cash-settled futures, though they are not as heavily traded as futures linked to actual delivery points such as Cushing, Oklahoma, for crude.“Position limits and large trader reporting have already been implemented ahead of financial reform, and they are working; today, natural gas prices remain near historic lows and price volatility is low. The CFTC’s establishment of these limits has been effective and policy should not be changed to suit the commercial needs of an exchange at the expense of the market,” Atlanta-based ICE said.The CFTC would allow traders to hold cash-settled commodity positions up to the limits as long as they did not also own more than a quarter of the deliverable supply for the underlying commodity. The text of the proposed rule said that higher limits would help to ensure “market liquidity and efficient price discovery.”"
404;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-08-29T00:38:23Z;Clearstream in trading service talks with ASX;;Clearstream, the settlement and custody business owned by Deutsche Börse, has entered into exclusive talks with the Australian Stock Exchange to provide a service that addresses the exposure that banks and brokers face when trading on the Australian market.The Sydney-based bourse plans to outsource to Clearstream the part of its business that calculates and manages the amount of collateral that participants have to post as a guarantee of a trade.The move highlights how market infrastructure operators are being forced to reshape their businesses by a tide of global regulatory reforms.Members of the G20 group of economies have pledged to move more of the vast but opaque $6,000bn over-the-counter derivatives market on to exchanges or other electronic trading platforms, and send trades through clearing houses.Many of the world’s bigger exchanges, such as Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, are eyeing opportunities in post-trade services – like clearing and settlement – that have been thrown up by the reforms.In July, IntercontinentalExchange, the US exchange and clearing house, agreed to buy a minority stake in Cetip, a Brazilian clearer, for $512m.At the same time, ASX is facing domestic competition in share trading for the first time after Australian regulators granted a licence to Chi-X Australia, an alternative trading platform, earlier this year.The ASX and Chi-X have also agreed a deal that will see the newcomer pay to use the ASX’s clearing services.Luxembourg-based Clearstream is set to take over the real-time management of collateral held in Austraclear, the sole central securities depository in Australia, and Chess, a settlement house.All financial products traded on ASX are cleared and settled through Austraclear and Chess and both businesses are owned by the ASX.“ASX is working to expand the range of its post-trade services in the Australian market to meet the rapidly changing needs of financial market participants,” said Peter Hiom, deputy chief executive of ASX.Clearstream is expanding globally and already derives about 20 per cent of its revenues from Asia, mainly through custody services to banks, exchanges and central banks.Australia would become the second market to use Clearstream’s real-time collateral management outsourcing service, following Brazil’s Cetip.While rivals also offer collateral oursourcing services, Clearstream said it is the only one that keeps assets in domestic markets, under local authority jurisdiction.Many regulators prevent assets used for collateral to be taken out of the country.Stefan Lepp, head of client relations and a member of the executive board at Clearstream, told FT Trading Room that the group had been approached by 17 potential customers, including banks, regulators and central banks, about using the system.
405;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
406;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-08-23T10:10:30Z;NYSE Euronext-D Börse deal passes US hurdle;;The planned merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, which would create the largest exchanges company in the world, has moved a step closer after a key US regulatory body approved the $9.4bn merger without objection.Clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, a government panel that vets foreign takeovers of US assets, means the deal faces only one more serious hurdle – clearance from European competition authorities.A green light from CFIUS is a notable exception for an industry that has seen nationalist sensibilities scupper other exchanges mergers around the world in recent months. A joint Nasdaq OMX- IntercontinentalExchange bid for NYSE Euronext, the London Stock Exchange’s bid for Canada’s TMX Group and SGX Group of Singapore’s bid for the Australian Stock Exchange have all failed in recent months amid vocal opposition that has viewed national exchanges as important strategic assets. CFIUS is chaired by the US Treasury and includes representatives from the justice, commerce, state, defence and homeland security departments.The Deutsche Börse -NYSE Euronext deal has elicited muted opposition in the US. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, an influential Democrat, has backed the deal, saying it could protect jobs and strengthen New York’s position in the derivatives markets.However, the deal faces an in-depth probe from regulators in Brussels, who are focusing their investigation on its potential to shift market power in derivatives trading and clearing, rather than defining and protecting so-called “strategic assets”. It comes amid fierce debate in Europe over forthcoming financial markets regulation that will reshape the rules governing trading and clearing in the derivatives marketDerivatives generate substantially more profits for exchanges than share trading. Banks, inter-dealer brokers and exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange have expressed concern that the combination of Eurex and Liffe, the derivatives trading platforms of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext respectively, would create an overwhelmingly dominant player in Europe.Rival derivatives platforms have worried that they could be blocked from accessing the merged company’s enlarged post-trading facilities, which, rivals say, could prevent them from entering certain derivatives markets.Deutsche Börse has argued that it faces competition from the off-exchange or over-the-counter markets, where banks – the exchanges’ biggest customers – are active.“We are continuing to work with regulatory authorities to achieve the remaining approvals and deliver this compelling combination to shareholders, clients and partners,” said Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext.A decision is expected by the European Commission by December 13. Shareholders in NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse both backed the deal last month.Deutsche Börse shares closed down €1.20 at €38.73 while NYSE Euronext shares traded flat at $25.50 in morning trading.
407;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-08-17T17:23:59Z;Merkel and Sarkozy pledge to defend euro;;Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, on Tuesday pledged to defend the euro with plans to reinforce economic governance even as Germany’s economy suffered a sharp slowdown in the second quarter.The two leaders, speaking after a two-hour meeting in Paris, said they were committed to greater integration in the eurozone. They pledged to prepare annual budgets on harmonised economic outlooks, work towards a common corporation tax by 2013 and proposed a twice yearly summit of eurozone leaders. They also want all 17 members of the eurozone to be obliged to produce balanced budgets a constitutional requirement, and plan to revive proposals for a European tax on financial transactions.“Germany and France feel absolutely determined to strengthen the euro as our common currency and further develop it,” Ms Merkel said.“We have to converge,” said Mr Sarkozy. “The status quo is impossible.”But both leaders firmly refused to bow to pressure to reinforce the €440bn European Financial Stability Fund or to consider commonly issued eurozone bonds. Mutualising debt while the 17 members pursued divergent fiscal and economic policies made no sense, they said. “We could imagine this, but at the end of the process of integration of the eurozone, not at the beginning,” Mr Sarkozy said.Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy were meeting as gloom over the future of the eurozone was intensified by a sharp slowdown in Germany’s economy, which came to a near standstill in the second quarter.German gross domestic product increased by only 0.1 per cent in the three months to June compared with the previous quarter, the country’s statistical office reported. Data for the first quarter were also revised down to show a rise of 1.3 per cent compared with the 1.5 per cent originally reported.The euro and US stocks fell amid talk in Paris of a tax on financial transactions such as derivatives.It also hit the share prices of exchange groups. NYSE Euronext, parent company of the UK’s Liffe futures exchange, was down 8.4 per cent to $26.54 in New York. IntercontinentalExchange, which owns a London energy derivatives market, traded 4.47 per cent lower at $111.22. Nasdaq OMX, with its Nordic derivatives exchange, was 2.75 per cent lower at $22.97.Market analysts expressed some disappointment at the lack of detail in the Franco-German proposals, such as whether there would be automatic sanctions for members who did not abide by the balanced budget rule. “The framework has been set but there was not a lot of detail,” said Phlippe Waecheter, head of research at Naxtixi Asset management.The latest German growth figures meanwhile will add to the pressure on the European Central Bank, which last week spent €22bn buying eurozone government debt to prevent borrowing costs soaring out of control for Spain and Italy. The ECB may have been overly hasty in raising interest rates twice this year, analysts said.German economic activity in the second quarter remained below its pre-crisis peak, according to the revised figures – whereas earlier data had shown it had exceeded that level already in the first quarter.Economists revised down 2011 and 2012 growth forecasts after Tuesday’s data, and warned that an escalation of the eurozone debt crisis posed significant risks. Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said the slowdown was more worrisome “because there is not much chance of a rebound in the third or fourth quarters”.Additional reporting by Telis Demos in New York
408;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-08-16T18:55:42Z;CME and ICE at odds over cash contract rules;Exchange operators squaring off over new rules;The rivalry between CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange has spilled into the regulatory arena, with the exchange operators squaring off over new rules for commodities trading.At issue are position limits, the controversial caps on speculation in 28 commodities that are set to grow broader under rules proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.The rules would prevent speculators from amassing futures contracts totalling more than 25 per cent of the deliverable supply of a commodity in the days leading up to expiry. But speculators could hold five times as many contracts if they settle only in cash, and do not result in delivery.The distinction has special relevance to the US natural gas market, where CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange and ICE are battling for trading volume and a form of the limit regime has been in place since February 2010.Nymex is home to both physically-settled gas futures for delivery in Louisiana as well as cash-settled natural gas futures whose prices are linked to the physical contract. US gas traded on ICE is only cash-settled.CME, in a letter dated Monday, opposed the more generous limits for cash-settled contracts, saying they increase the threat of price manipulation and were unfair.“The commission also fails to explain why cash-settled contracts that are designed to be linked to the price discovery of a physically delivered contract should have a material, government-imposed, built-in advantage to attract liquidity through a disparate, five times higher speculative position limit,” wrote CME general counsel Kathleen Cronin.“Favouring some markets to the detriment of others – particularly where those markets settle against and price off of the adversely impacted physical delivery market – is not a legitimate use of position limits nor is it an appropriate action for a regulatory agency. Based on the record, the only obvious motivation for conditional limits is favouritism of the cash-settled market for all physical commodities.”ICE, in a letter last week, said its rival’s “request that the conditional limit be decreased or eliminated is a change in the status quo that is not supported by the broader marketplace.”Both Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE chief executive, and Terry Duffy and Craig Donohue, respectively CME chairman and chief executive, have met with CFTC staff and chairman Gary Gensler this month to discuss position limits, records show.Mr Gensler has said he hopes to present a final rule on position limits next month. The issue has divided the five-member commission.
409;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-08-16T14:33:23Z;Financial stocks drag down S&P 500;;Falling financial shares dragged the S&P 500 index down 1 per cent to 1192.76, ending a three-day rally on Wall Street.The main US exchanges were hammered after Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, said France and Germany would push ahead with proposals for a Europe-wide tax on financial transactions.NYSE Euronext lost 8.4 per cent to close at $26.54, while IntercontinentalExchange was down 4.5 per cent at $111.22.News that hedge fund manager John Paulson had reduced his positions in both Bank of America and Citigroup dragged both stocks down more than 4 per cent. Bank of America closed at $7.40 and Citigroup at $29.94. Overall, financial stocks were down almost 2 per cent.Although the stock market has calmed this week, the S&P 500 index remains more than 5 per cent down for the year.On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also down 0.7 per cent at 11405.93 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.2 per cent to 2523.45.Consumer staples was the only sector of the S&P 500 not to record a fall, thanks to strong earnings reports from large US retailers.Home Depot led a small group of advancers in the S&P 500, gaining 5.3 per cent to close at $33.12.The housing goods retailer earned 86 cents a share versus forecasts of 82.4 cents and raised its forecast for full-year earnings to $2.34 per share from $2.24.Frank Blake, chief executive, was cautious, saying strong sales were driven in part by a one-time boost due to floods and storms throughout the US during the second quarter.David Strasser of Janney Capital Markets said Home Depot had benefited from weak results announced by its rival Lowe’s yesterday. Mr Stresser expects the company to continue to gain market share from its rival.Walmart also beat earnings forecasts to report $1.09 a share compared with expectations of $1.08. Its shares added 3.9 per cent to end the day at $51.92.Though Walmart’s same-store sales declined for the ninth consecutive quarter and its chief executive warned of pressures on customers, it raised its 2012 earnings guidance to as much as $4.51 a share from $4.41.Barclays Capital’s Robert Drbul, whose target price of $62 a share is above the Wall Street consensus, said the company’s proved ability to deliver cost savings more than made up for falling same-store sales.But shares of Urban Outfitters, a clothing retailer, fell 6.3 per cent to $27.84 after same-store sales declined versus a year ago, the largest non-financial decline on the S&P 500.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets lowered their price target on Urban Outfitters from $38 to $35 a share but still recommended holding the shares, saying they “continued to view [it] as an attractive turnround story”.Marshall Edwards, the San Diego-based medical company, was the biggest gainer of the Nasdaq Composite index. Its shares rose almost 40 per cent to $1.91 after the Food and Drug Administration approved its application to trial a new cancer drug.Gilead Sciences was up 4.2 per cent to $38.85. Analysts at JPMorgan said the shares were “de-risked” following the approval of a new drug and strong testing results for another. They said the current price did not reflect the potential of those two drugs, which could result in as much as $23 a share’s worth of earnings.Shares in Google continued to fall after its announcement of a $12.5bn bid for Motorola Mobility, slipping 3.3 per cent to $539.Standard & Poor’s Equity Research cut Google to sell from buy recommendation, and reduced its target price to $500, arguing “the purchase of [Motorola Mobility] would negatively impact growth, margins and balance sheet.”Mobility’s shares closed at $38.02, close to Google’s $40-a-share bid.Stock in Sprint rose for a second day. The telecoms group was up 3.2 per cent at $3.59 amid speculation that Google might seek to acquire a network, as well as a handset manufacturer.News Corp shares gained 1.4 per cent to close at $17.14. But earlier in the day they had traded close to the $18 last seen before phone hacking allegations in the UK engulfed the company. Allegations resurfaced in London in the afternoon, reversing the shares’ rise.
410;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-08-07T21:43:54Z;Asia and LatAm ripe for bourse consolidation;;The failure of a string of exchange mergers means bourses in Asia and Latin America stand the best chance eventually of consolidating, leaving their western counterparts to limit themselves to less ambitious partnerships, a new report says.PwC, the auditor and consultancy, says in the report out on Monday that with growth in emerging markets set to outstrip the west, exchanges in Asia and Latin America would benefit.The value of share trading in Asia grew by 20 per cent in the decade to 2010, while value in the Americas and Europe, the Middle East and Africa fell by 14 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively.Shamshad Ali, partner at PwC, said: “Talk of an end to consolidation in the stock exchange sector may be largely true for the more mature western European markets, but Asia and Latin America are likely to see significant mergers and acquisitions in the future – if regulatory hurdles can be overcome.“Over the next five years, significant M&A activity will be driven from the emerging markets as local exchanges seek growth opportunities outside their home markets,” Mr Ali said.A wave of global exchange mergers kicked off last October when SGX, the Singapore exchange, agreed to combine with its counterpart in Australia, ASX.Four months later Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext unveiled a $9.4bn deal to combine, followed the same week by the London Stock Exchange and TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses.Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), then teamed up on a counter bid for NYSE Euronext.However, all but the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext deal collapsed amid a combination of nationalist opposition in the countries of the target exchanges, and antitrust hurdles.PwC said that the Asian exchange landscape was still limited by the lack of “cross-border market liberalisation measures” and less reliance than in the west on sophisticated electronic trading. Many exchanges in the region are also partly owned by local interests, and not publicly listed.However, the firm said it may only be a matter of time before demutualisation gained ground and regulatory hurdles were broken down. High operating leverage and heightened competition have suppressed margins across the sector and would “continue to provide a compelling economic rationale for consolidation”.Western exchanges could even face the prospect of becoming targets themselves, as economic growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China – so-called “Bric” countries – could fuel the emergence of a next generation of “mega exchanges” from those regions.The report suggested that the most viable growth options for western exchanges are to focus on developing post-trade clearing and settlement capabilities or fostering ties with emerging market players.Mr Ali said: “Traditional exchanges cannot afford to ignore the dominant role the emerging markets are likely to play in the future exchanges landscape. They will need to look closely at different models to compete against, or collaborate with, their emerging market counterparts.”
411;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-08-04T21:59:40Z;ICE lowers threshold on CDS clearer;;IntercontinentalExchange, the US exchange and clearing house operator, has lowered the financial threshold that banks and brokers need to meet to become members of its North American credit default swap clearer to over $100m, from $5bn.The move comes as there is debate over the appropriate level of financial safeguards – in the form of capital buffers – that clearing houses should hold to help them deal with a default of one or more members.The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator, has proposed that clearers “shall not set a minimum capital requirement of more than $50m” – a level that has sparked fierce debate.ICE has cut the threshold for “futures commission merchants”, or futures brokers, at ICE Clear Credit, from an earlier much higher threshold, which applied to an earlier membership category of banks at ICE Trust, as ICE Clear Credit was formerly known.ICE Trust was set up in 2009, in partnership with some of the bigger dealer banks in OTC credit default swaps. Regulated by the New York Federal Reserve and the New York State Banking Department, it was set up to meet regulators’ demands that the industry start moving CDS trades into clearing houses to help safeguard the financial system against defaults.But ICE last month switched the clearer to being a “designated clearing organisation” under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as required under the Dodd-Frank act.As part of that switch ICE has lowered the minimum “adjusted net capital” threshold for membership to $100m.But at the same time it also requires that FCMs have “excess net capital” that is greater than 5 per cent of their “required segregated customer funds” – that is, any collateral they hold on behalf of customers.At least one independent FCM was critical of the new thresholds, saying that they would still be required to hold far more than $100m given the added 5 per cent requirement.A senior executive at that firm also questioned why customers’ segregated funds were part the arrangement since they were part of the firm’s exchange-traded business and not connected to any OTC activity.He said: “Frankly we are a little surprised because we don’t really understand what our segregated funds have to do with the risk of us potentially clearing on ICE, because segregated funds have nothing to do with OTC. That’s being used as a measure of the kind of money we need to have around in connection with proposed OTC activity.”ICE said: “FCMs guarantee the performance of their clients. The most reliable publicly-reported metric of the amount of risk held by an FCM is customer segregated funds.“The clearing house must ensure FCMs have sufficient capital to guarantee the performance of their clients across all clearing houses - especially in highly asymmetric new products with more complex risk profiles, such as CDS [credit default swaps]. We believe 5 per cent excess net capital is a prudent buffer,” ICE added.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, told analysts this week the $100m threshold had been chosen after “extensive conversations” with the CFTC.“Whether they promulgate a rule that says $100m or whether it’s higher or whether it’s lower, I can’t predict, but I can tell you that that there was a consensus view that this was a good landing point for us to start.“And we wanted – we were pushing as a clearing organization to get started ahead of Dodd-Frank and to make buy-side clearing available and to allow people to get tested and get started so that we could hit the ground running when the rules were promulgated,” he said.The move came as OTC derivatives dealers and clearing houses are waiting to see what the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will decide on clearing member thresholds.There is also debate over the extent to which clearing houses should lower capital thresholds in a bid to allow a wider array of firms in as members, or keep such thresholds high so as to ensure only the strongest firms are members.In a position paper issued this week, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which represents OTC dealer banks, said: “Broadening access to FMIs (financial market infrastructures) is a worthy policy position only if the associated risks are addressed to ensure FMI safety is not compromised.”
412;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-08-04T17:41:48Z;D Börse and NYSE Euronext tie-up faces probe;;Plans to create the world’s largest exchanges group by combining Deutsche Börse with NYSE Euronext are to be submitted to an in-depth probe after European antitrust authorities raised “significant concerns” over its dominance in derivatives trading.The move came after Brussels launched an initial investigation in June into the planned $10bn tie-up, which would create a transatlantic group larger than the CME Group, ICE or Nasdaq OMX in the US, as well as the London Stock Exchange.It also marks the first time that exchange ownership of the crucial post-trade business of clearing in a so-called “vertical silo” has come under antitrust scrutiny in Europe.Deutsche Börse owns its own futures exchange – Eurex – and clearing house, a position that would be strengthened with the addition of NYSE Euronext’s Liffe futures exchange, based in London.Banks, which are among both exchanges’ biggest customers, have expressed concern about what they say is the increased market power in derivatives trading and clearing. Derivatives generate significantly more profits for exchanges than share trading.A combined Eurex and Liffe would give the group a combined share of almost 95 per cent of exchange-traded derivatives.The commission said: “At this stage, [we are] mainly concerned that due to the removal of an important competitor, the merger would have a negative impact on innovation in derivatives products and technology solutions.“Moreover, the possibilities for fee competition may be reduced due to increased difficulties for competitors to enter the market. Customers who could be affected by this include pension funds, mutual funds and retail banks, as well as professional brokers and investment banks.”Brussels said its investigation had revealed concerns that without access to the merged company’s enlarged clearing facilities – “ie: in the presence of a closed ‘vertical silo’” – entry by rival derivatives platforms would be made more difficult in a market already characterised by high barriers to entry.It also singled out concerns over equities trading and settlement, and index licensing. That refers to the ownership by exchanges of companies that compile stock indices, such as Deutsche Börse’s ownership of the Stoxx index company.Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said: “The Commission needs to make sure that markets which are at the heart of the financial sector remain competitive and efficiently deliver to users.”Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext argue that their derivatives combination would face significant competition from over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets, including when such instruments are shifted on to formal trading systems, as required under the Dodd-Frank act and similar reforms working their way through Europe.“[We] remain confident that [our] planned combination will be approved,” they said. It would “bring together two complementary derivatives businesses, giving them the scale and depth to compete effectively in a global industry with many powerful participants – exchanges, OTC platforms, banks and clearers – and to keep pace with increased competition driven by technology and regulatory changes”.Both exchanges have won overwhelming shareholder support for the deal, with Deutsche Börse saying this week it had received 95 per cent acceptance rate from its shareholders.Brussels has 90 working days to complete its probe.
413;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-08-03T18:49:14Z;ICE posts record results for second quarter;;IntercontinentalExchange, the US exchanges operator, reported record second-quarter earnings after strong demand for over-the-counter derivatives and commodity futures trading.Revenues at the Atlanta-based ICE rose 10 per cent year on year to $325m in the three months to June. Net income rose 19 per cent to $121m compared with a year ago. Diluted earnings per share rose 21 per cent to $1.64.The results outstripped an 8 per cent profit increase earlier this week from its principal rival CME Group, the world’s largest futures market. They also underlined how exchanges focused on trading of over-the-counter and energy derivatives have outpaced the earnings of rivals focused on equities.NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, the two largest US equity exchanges, found trading tough in cash equities and derivatives trading, particularly in Europe, but their performances were boosted by non-trading revenues, such as listing fees and providing IT services to other exchanges.ICE said its earnings had been driven primarily by record trading volume in ICE’s Brent crude and gasoil futures and options contracts, as well as solid OTC energy volumes.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive, said the WTI crude contract, owned by rival CME, was no longer the world’s benchmark for oil prices. “While WTI remains an important US oil benchmark to us, it no longer reflects global prices,” he said.The period also saw ICE pull out of a joint $11bn bid with Nasdaq OMX for NYSE Euronext, which would have given ICE a strong position in the European derivatives market. The failed bid contributed to a 14 per cent increase in operating expenses in the period.However, shares in ICE fell $3.09 to $116 in New York after it lowered guidance for revenues from clearing credit default swaps. The group made $30m from CDS clearing in the first half but forecast it would make $65m to $67m for the year, down from its previous estimate of about $70m to $73m.The group added it was preparing to set up platforms to comply with incoming regulatory changes in the Dodd-Frank Act, even though some rules will not be finalised until the end of the year. Authorities in Washington and Brussels are looking to move more over-the-counter derivatives trading, such as swaps, through electronic trading platforms and clearing houses.“Despite delays, we’re moving ahead on key provisions to bring needed certainty to the markets,” Mr Sprecher said.
414;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-07-18T08:56:42Z;Nasdaq OMX mulled US listings split;;Nasdaq OMX held talks with BATS Global Markets about the possibility of selling it a significant share of the combined primary listings business of Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange in an attempt to overcome any antitrust hurdles, two people familiar with the issue said.The disclosure is a sign of the length to which Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, was prepared to go to ensure that his joint counter-bid for NYSE Euronext with IntercontinentalXchange (ICE), would pass scrutiny by the US Department of Justice.A key issue in the department’s examination of the joint bid, which was designed to prise NYSE Euronext away from its agreed merger with Deutsche Börse, was the combination of the initial public offering business of the two US exchanges.It was that which eventually scuppered the deal, after the department made clear to Mr Greifeld and his counterpart at ICE, Jeff Sprecher, that combining the two listings businesses would reduce choice of IPO platforms for US companies.The decision surprised some, since BATS announced plans during the antitrust review that it planned to launch a primary listings business, which would compete against NYSE and Nasdaq.Mr Greifeld approached Joe Ratterman, BATS chief executive, suggesting that it buy a portion of the Nasdaq-NYSE listings business, the two people said.Nasdaq OMX and BATS both declined to comment.Mr Ratterman was interested in Mr Greifeld’s offer, one person said. But the talks broke down after it became clear that antitrust authorities were unlikely to support the Nasdaq-ICE counter-bid.
415;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-07-17T19:52:32Z;Exchanges ‘need rethink’ over failed tie-ups;;Exchanges will have to “rethink their global strategies” because of unexpectedly strong scrutiny of proposed bourse tie-ups from antitrust regulators, according to IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), one of the world’s biggest exchanges.A string of proposed mergers has come unstuck in recent months, either through nationalist opposition in the home market of exchanges perceived as the targets of takeovers, or as antitrust authorities have moved to stymie combinations amid concerns they could reduce competition.The London Stock Exchange’s planned tie-up with TMX Group of Canada evaporated last month after the UK bourse failed to convince enough TMX shareholders to back the deal.A rival bid for TMX from a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds, known as Maple, appeared to have helped swing the decision by arguing against Canada’s exchange falling into foreign hands.Also last month a planned purchase by BATS Global Markets, a US operator of trading platforms, and Chi-X Europe, a pan-European share trading facility, was thrown into doubt after the UK’s Office of Fair Trading referred it to Britain’s main antitrust authority.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said: “There’s been a marked change in the way regulators look at exchanges generally. The good news is that they are looking to exchanges to provide more transparency to prevent another meltdown.“The bad news is that they want to ensure a lot more exchanges to ensure competition. So the impediments are now higher than they were a few years ago and I think it’s going to cause everyone to rethink their global strategies,” he told the Financial Times.Mr Sprecher was a victim of antitrust scrutiny in April, when the US Department of Justice told Nasdaq OMX and its partner ICE that a proposed joint counter-bid for NYSE Euronext, the US exchange operator, would not be approved because it involved combining Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchanges’ company listings businesses. That would have reduced choice in the primary listings business for US companies.Last month antitrust authorities at the European Commission sent market participants a detailed questionnaire on the proposed combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse – target of the failed Nasdaq/ICE counter-bid.Last week, Börse shareholders gave overwhelming support to the deal. But it still faces formidable hurdles in Brussels which will examine – among other issues – its creation of the dominant market for trading and clearing of derivatives in Europe. It would also create a company with about 30 per cent of trading in cash equities in the region.Canada’s competition bureau is in the throes of reviewing a hostile bid for TMX by Maple. Its decision is expected in the autumn.Reports surfaced last week that Maple is in direct talks with TMX. The exchange group was precluded from negotiating with Maple while the LSE offer was still on the table.Additional reporting by Bernard Simon in Toronto
416;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-07-15T17:21:05Z;Interview: ICE passed on Cetip in 2009;Sprecher aims to license technology to Brazilian group;IntercontinentalExchange, the US exchange and clearing house operator, looked at taking a stake in Cetip as far back as 2009, when the Brazilian post-trade group received its first investment from the private equity firm that this week sold its stake to ICE.The disclosure, by Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, is a sign that Brazil’s financial market infrastructure was attracting the attention of many of the world’s large exchange operators earlier than many investors may have realised.CME Group, ICE’s main rival, signed a letter of intent in 2007 with BM&F, then Brazil’s standalone futures exchange, covering a proposed cross-investment between them.Mr Sprecher said that ICE had looked at Cetip in 2009 but that “it wasn’t the right time for us”.Since then, the Bovespa stock market index has risen by 135 per cent in dollar terms and 58 per cent in local currency terms.Late on Thursday, ICE said it had agreed to buy a 12.4 per cent stake in Cetip at R$25.50 a share or about $512m, from Advent International and some other smaller shareholders. Advent took Cetip public in October 2009. Advent sold a portion of the 32 per cent stake it acquired earlier that year in the company’s IPO and sold additional shares in a block trade in January this year.ICE will take a board seat on Cetip.Speaking to FT Trading Room, Mr Sprecher said Cetip was a logical move for ICE given growth in emerging market commodities businesses and that many Brazilian banks were already using it for their post-trade needs.“Our company’s been benefiting from emerging economies because of coffee, sugar, oil and emissions – in all of which demand has been going up. And of all of the ‘Bric’ countries, Brazil is the country where we felt like having a direct investment could have long-term benefits because of how far along they are in developing a financial services infrastructure,” Mr Sprecher said.Earlier this year, ICE said it was launching BRIX, an electricity futures market, in partnership with Eike Batista, Brazil’s richest manMr Sprecher said Cetip was “going to become an important player in Brazil and it’s an entrepreneurial entity that the banks have been using for their post-trade needs, so it felt like a very good fit with ICE”.“Cetip has been looking to license world class technology and deal with the rapid growth of its business. We have a lot of pre- and post-trade matching technology that we hope over time we can licence to them,” Mr Sprecher said. “Cetip’s shareholder registry contains a lot of the Brazilian banks so this gives us an opportunity to work directly with them to develop post-trade services.”Asked whether it was planned to develop cash equities clearing that could be used by competitors wanting to challenge the near-monopoly of BM&FBovespa, Mr Sprecher said that was “not a priority right now”.BATS Global Markets, the US exchange group, has teamed up with Claritas, a Brazilian asset management firm, to explore the launch of a low-cost exchange in Brazil.Cetip already has a relationship with Clearstream, the settlement and custody business owned by Deutsche Börse, as part of a Bric strategy that Clearstream is pursuing.Mr Sprecher and Bob Greifeld, the Nasdaq OMX chief executive, were forced to abandon a hostile counter-bid in April for NYSE Euronext, which had agreed to merge with Deutsche Börse.“Given that Deutsche Börse is tied up with its merger, it seemed to us to make sense to enter and take a board seat and work with [Cetip] management,” Mr Sprecher said, adding that he was comfortable with Cetip continuing to do business with Clearstream.
417;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-07-15T02:37:17Z;ICE buys into Brazilian clearing firm;;The IntercontinentalExchange has bought into a Brazilian clearing firm as it prepares to launch an electricity market and try to challenge BM&FBovespa’s dominance.ICE, a US futures exchange operator, has agreed to buy a 12.4 per cent stake in Cetip, the clearing group, at R$25.50 a share or about $512m. Advent International, the private equity firm that took Cetip public in 2009, sold its remaining 10 per cent stake as part of the deal.“We are committed to contributing to the growth of these markets while supporting increased transparency and security,” said Jeffery Sprecher, ICE chief executive.He said their investment in a growth-oriented leader such as Cetip extends ICE’s work in clearing and in financial and commodity markets in Brazil.The entry of another potentially formidable competitor comes as Bovespa, Latin America’s largest capital market, prepares for greater competition. It has lowered its pricing on equity trading, while raising fees on post-trade clearing services. The net effect would be neutral for customers, the exchange has said.Meanwhile, BATS Global Markets, the US exchange group, has partnered with Claritas, a Brazilian asset management firm, and has been exploring the launch of a low-cost exchange in Brazil.Earlier this year, ICE said it was launching BRIX, an electricity futures market, in partnership with Eike Batista, Brazil’s richest man. The first BRIX contracts, set to launch later this month, will be bilateral deals that are not centrally cleared.BM&FBovespa, Brazil’s national exchange group, is the only approved depository clearinghouse, and its central bank does not favour the launch of another central counterparty, which could alter the market’s risk profile.ICE has not said how BRIX contracts will be cleared as it expands, but Cetip would be a natural partner for launching a competing central counterparty clearinghouse, said Bernardo Mariano, an analyst at Equity Research Desk.“If Bovespa is giving them resistance, it would be the clear next step to get Cetip to clear the business,” he said.Cetip is a clearing and settlement agent for various financial products in Brazil. Last year, it bought GRV, which registers individual auto loans for review by consumer banks.Mr Mariano said one concern for ICE would be exposure to Brazilian consumers and the broader economy, which economists think is in danger of overheating as the real rises and inflation risks loom.“I would have thought it was unlikely for an exchange to buy a piece of Cetip, because its other business is not related,” he said.Beyond electricity futures, ICE has a growing slate of businesses in Brazil. Its European futures trading screens were approved for use locally in March, and it is preparing to launch Brazilian coffee futures, Brazil Arabica, in 2013.Additional reporting by Joe Leahy in São Paulo
418;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-07-14T15:56:33Z;D Börse investors back NYSE merger;;Deutsche Börse shareholders have supported the German exchange group’s plan to merge with NYSE Euronext, ensuring the proposed deal has cleared one of its biggest hurdles.The owners of more than 80 per cent of shares in Deutsche Börse accepted a tender offer made by the Netherlands-based holding company that will be created out of the merger. The deal had needed an acceptance rate of at least 75 per cent by the end of Wednesday.“Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext have accomplished what other recent proposed mergers were unable to: secure shareholder approval on both sides of the deal. That said, the most difficult hurdle for the proposed merger to pass still remains, which is to obtain European regulatory approval on terms that are acceptable to the two exchanges,” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James.NYSE Euronext investors already voted last week in favour of the transatlantic tie-up, which was announced in February and will create the world’s biggest exchange group by revenues.The two groups sweetened their offer in May by pledging a special dividend of €2 per share, after also revising upwards the estimates of synergies they could obtain from their merger.The deal – valued at $10.1bn at current share prices and exchange rates, including the special dividend if paid in full – may still need several months to win approval from European antitrust regulators.The merger is being forged after initial attempts to break up the deal through a possible counter-offer for NYSE by the two US exchanges Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange, which was abandoned in May.It is one of a string of plans for high-profile exchange tie-ups that were announced, but London Stock Exchange abandoned its bid for TMX Group of Canada while SGX of Singapore failed in an attempt to buy ASX of Australia.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE, will be chief executive of the enlarged group and Reto Francioni, his counterpart at Deutsche Börse, will be chairman. No name for the new group has been announced, in part reflecting the sensitivities over cultural differences and various national interests that the new company intends to try to balance with a geographical spread of key staff and functions.Deutsche Börse investors are set to own 60 per cent of the enlarged group. Any who initially opposed the deal will now have an extra window in which to tender their shares, meaning the final acceptance rate may not be known until later this month.
419;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-07-11T14:53:48Z;Eurex appoints new head of EEX;Peter Reitz to drive push into carbon auctions;Eurex, the derivatives trading venue, has named Peter Reitz the new head of the European Energy Exchange, the carbon trading platform it took control over earlier this year.Mr Reitz, who spearheaded Eurex’s first moves into carbon trading four years ago, will drive EEX’s push to operate the new central platform for carbon auctions in the European emissions trading scheme.The European Commission is preparing for a radical reshaping of carbon permit auctions in its flagship scheme in 2013 and wants its new central platform to be an exchange. EEX, the derivatives unit of Deutsche Börse, has has already registered its interest in running it while rivals such ICE Futures Europe, part of Intercontinental Exchange, and Green Exchange, owned by a mixture of banks, brokers and CME Group, are considering their plans.It is also looking to expand its operations around Europe and opened an office in London last month.Mr Reitz will retain his position as executive board member of Eurex, and begin his new role on August 1. He replaces Hans-Bernd Menzel, who quit the company he had led for eight years after Eurex took control.Eurex secured control over the platform in February when it agreed to buy the 22.96 per cent shareholding in EEX owned by Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, adding it to the 35.2 per cent of EEX it already owned. Eurex paid €7.75 per share, valuing the equity of EEX at just over €310m.Since Mr Menzel’s departure, the carbon trading platform had been run in the interim by Christoph Mura, chief operating officer, and Iris Weidinger, chief financial officer. They will retain their roles in the new management structure. Mr Reitz will also become chief executive of European Commodity Clearing (ECC), which provides post-trade services for energy derivatives trading.
420;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-07-04T08:23:55Z;LSE open to approach from Nasdaq;;The London Stock Exchange would be open to considering a merger of equals with Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, in the first sign that the British bourse could yet turn its attention to securing its future in another big merger after its attempted tie-up with Canada’s TMX Group collapsed.Nasdaq’s chief executive, Bob Greifeld, is considering an approach for the LSE but people familiar with the matter said advisers were not yet formally involved. Nor had Mr Greifeld spoken with his counterpart at the LSE, Xavier Rolet.The prospect of the combination revives the vision of a transatlantic exchange powerhouse first pushed by Mr Greifeld five years ago when he made a failed bid for the LSE.It would combine two of the most recognised brands in the exchange business and provide a counterweight to a larger combination planned by Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext amid a wave of exchange consolidation that started last October. Nasdaq is separately involved as bidder for a minority stake in LCH.Clearnet, an independent clearing house that clears UK stocks for the LSE.Mr Greifeld’s last, and ultimately hostile, attempt at the LSE involved an offer to shareholders of £12.43 a share, increased from a friendly offer of 950p. The LSE’s shares closed at £10.61 on Friday, valuing the exchange at £2.8bn. Nasdaq’s market capitalisation stands at $4.6bn (£2.86bn).One person said LSE management believed the exchanges’ higher share prices in recent weeks suggested the market did not favour an “aggressive leveraged takeover”. An LSE spokesman said it “did not comment on speculation”.The LSE’s share price has risen 15 per cent since mid-May, amid bid speculation even as it tried to finalise its deal with TMX, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses. The LSE abandoned that last week after insufficient support from TMX shareholders.Explore deals on the table, as well as those which have fallen by the waysideMr Greifeld’s last attempted deal, which ended in April after objections from US antitrust authorities, was a $11.3bn counter-bid for NYSE Euronext, with IntercontinentalExchange as joint bidder.However, any Nasdaq-LSE deal would have to overcome a number of hurdles. It is not clear which of the men would be chief executive. Mr Rolet has been in his job since May 2009, while Mr Greifeld has been chief executive of Nasdaq since 2003. A deal would also have to pass UK regulatory scrutiny.A second person said that while the LSE would consider an approach from Nasdaq, Mr Rolet had made clear recently that the LSE could grow its business independently.Additional reporting by Anousha Sakoui and Helen Thomas
421;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-06-27T18:55:20Z;ISS endorses NYSE-D Börse merger;;The NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse merger moved a little bit closer to completion on Monday when ISS, the influential proxy advisory service, advised US shareholders to vote for the deal at a special meeting in July.But the merger’s fate still lies in Europe, where authorities are expected to give it a thorough review that will not be completed until well after shareholders in the US and Germany are asked to vote next month.“The bigger issue in my mind is, what will happen antitrust-wise in the EU?” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James.The ISS recommendation carries some weight. Funds within large asset management institutions T Rowe Price and BlackRock, which are the two top owners of NYSE Euronext, are often bound by ISS decisions, as they own shares on behalf of clients rather than in their own portfolios.But the deal had already been expected to sail through in New York, where investors now have no alternatives to which to compare the deal after Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their counterbid earlier this year under pressure from US antitrust authorities.The NYSE vote is set for July 7, when a majority of shareholders must vote for the deal for it to be approved.Some shareholders had been attracted to the competing bid because it represented a premium to the agreed merger of some 10-20 per cent to the NYSE-Deutsche agreement, which is now valued at $33.87 a share.That is roughly a 10 per cent premium to the day’s before the offer was announced in February. Last month, the exchanges also approved a €2 ($2.85) a share sweetener dividend to be paid after the deal closes.“The one-day premium, albeit low relative to normal acquisitions, exceeds that of recent merger-of-equal transactions, including those among exchange operators,” wrote ISS in its recommendation.Glass Lewis, another shareholder advisory, was more critical of the deal in a note last week, arguing that NYSE had a “rather focused pursuit of a transaction with DB” and “limited discussion of what other specific alternatives”.However, it said that the unusually strong regulation of exchanges would “limit the number of realistic alternative buyers that could satisfy antitrust scrutiny”, and recommended the deal, which placed the exchanges “in an attractive competitive position.”Glass Lewis had also earlier this year recommended that shareholders vote against approving the pay packages of NYSE Euronext management, giving the company a “D” for tying payment to performance. But shareholders overwhelmingly approved the pay packages, which ISS supported.Meanwhile, there has been some opposition in Germany to the deal, where staff unions have urged rejection following statements by NYSE-Deutsche that the bulk of the cost-cutting synergies will fall in Europe.European antitrust regulators are also still in the early stages of reviewing the merger, which will see Europe’s largest futures exchanges, NYSE Euronext’s Liffe and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex, become one entity.Significantly, that will join Liffe to Clearstream, Deutsche’s market-leading futures clearing business. Regulators have expressed concern about the “vertical” and “horizontal” elements of the deal. No final decisions are anticipated until next year.But it is still anticipated to receive approval by shareholders, who are required to tender three-quarters of shares outstanding for the deal to be approved.
422;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;BATS and Chi-X merger thrown into doubt;;The UK’s Office of Fair Trading has referred the proposed acquisition by BATS Global Markets of Chi-X Europe, a pan-European share trading platform, for further scrutiny, throwing the tie-up into uncertainty.The move is a sign that competition authorities in the US and Europe appear to be flexing their muscles as a wave of exchange mergers is challenging long-held assumptions about the appropriate level of competition in market structures such as trading platforms.The UK watchdog said on Monday that it would refer the merger to the Competition Commission, which undertakes lengthier studies, because of concerns that there would be reduced competition in the market for multilateral trading facilities, a term that describes trading platforms that have emerged since 2007 to challenge established stock exchanges in Europe.After the London Stock Exchange, Chi-X Europe and BATS Europe, the European platform operated by US-based BATS Global Markets, are the two most popular MTFs for trading UK equities. Chi-X has about 21 per cent of trading in FTSE 100 stocks, with BATS on 6.6 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters. Together, they would be the second-largest platform for UK blue-chips after the LSE, with 62 per cent.The OFT said: “We cannot rule out the prospect that such a structural shift in the marketplace would lead to a substantial lessening of competition.”The OFT’s move comes just weeks after US antitrust authorities blocked a proposed joint counter-bid by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), both US exchange operators, for Nasdaq rival NYSE Euronext. They told Nasdaq and ICE that the proposed combination of Nasdaq’s listings business with that of NYSE would reduce the choice of listings venues available to US companies.It also comes as the LSE is fighting off a counter bid for TMX Group, operator of Canada’s exchanges, from a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds, called Maple. The Maple bid for TMX proposes folding Alpha Trading, a Canadian version of an MTF, into the Toronto Stock Exchange. That would boost the Toronto bourses’s share of share trading up to almost 90 per cent - where it used to be before Alpha and others, including a Canadian version of Chi-X, was launched three years ago.The proposed combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext is also attracting scrutiny from regulators, with Joaquín Almunia, the European Union’s competition commissioner, stating in March that the deal was a “complex case” that would be subject to “deep investigation”.If the UK’s Competition Commission approves the BATS-Chi-X deal, it would create a platform trading more stocks on a pan-European basis than Euronext, and just behind the LSE. It would value BATS at $1.2bn.The commission has the ability to prevent a merger or demand undertakings, such as the sale of parts of the businesses to reduce antitrust issues.BATS and Chi-X were set up after the enactment of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) by Brussels, which opened the door to competition against incumbent exchanges.Alasdair Haynes, chief executive officer of Chi-X Europe, said on Monday: “Although we are disappointed by the OFT’s decision, we will engage with our board and shareholders to ascertain next steps. Chi-X Europe will also work with the Competition Commission to address any questions or concerns that they may have about the proposed deal.”The commission is expected to publish its decision in December, according to the OFT.
423;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-31T17:42:50Z;LME concerned about LCH.Clearnet ‘viability’;;The London Metal Exchange has warned that decisions by IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and NYSE Liffe to build their own clearing houses may undermine LCH.Clearnet’s “viability as a clearing house”.The commodities exchange is in talks with members about creating its own clearing house in a move that would bring it into line with rivals such as CME Group and ICE and give it control over launching new products. In doing so, the LME is considering splitting from LCH.Clearnet, the LME’s long-standing clearing house.It comes as LCH.Clearnet is being eyed by exchanges as wave of bourse consolidation sweeps up Europe’s largest independent clearing house. NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange have all tabled bids for the clearer in an effort to profit from sweeping post-crisis reform of the financial system, people familiar with the matter have told the FT. However the LSE has said it is not in any discussions with LCH.Clearnet about any transaction.In a statement to members explaining its reasoning, the LME said it was “concerned” by the effect of the decisions of ICE, NYSE Liffe and the LSE to self-clear.“With its diminishing exchange portfolio, LCH.Clearnet is focusing on the growing market in over-the-counter derivatives clearing. This could be to the detriment of those exchanges that remain,” said Chris Evans, head of business development.Alberto Pravettoni, managing director, corporate strategy at LCH.Clearnet, said: “LCH.Clearnet is committed to continuing to serve both exchange traded and OTC markets and we have invested significantly in our infrastructure in order to ensure we are best placed to do so.“As we stated on May 3, we value our relationship with the LME and shall continue to provide the LME and its members with an excellent service and the benefit of our unique experience in clearing for this complex market – we are a leader in commodities clearing globally. Market participants tell us they are looking for proven, efficient and consolidated clearing offerings. LCH.Clearnet is best placed to continue to deliver this.”A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, stepping in to ensure that a deal goes ahead even if one party defaults. Regulators in Washington and Brussels are keen for central counterparty clearing in the market in order to reduce the risk traditionally associated with such trades. The LME has not yet committed to a decision and has considered partnering with ICE Clear, CME Clear and other houses but self-clearing is its preferred option.“Preliminary discussions suggest that self clearing is achievable, could give the market a more efficient service and will place decisions about the exchange’s independence more firmly in the hands of LME shareholders,” Mr Evans told members.The LME added that its financial advisers have indicated it would have “little problem” raising debt finance to start a clearing house. However, it added: “if there was shareholder appetite for a rights issue to fund an LME-owned clearing house, this would be considered”.LCH.Clearnet collects some £10m annually in direct fees for clearing LME trades, the LME estimated. “Modelling done by the LME Executive and its consultants indicates that treasury revenue from members’ margin funds brings LCH.Clearnet a further return that is a multiple of the clearing fee income,” it said.Regulators have been keen to ensure that clearing houses do not become a potential new weak link in the financial system. The LME said work on the establishment of the size of a potential default fund had not begun. However it envisaged that there would be little change to LME clearing member default fund contributions as the contribution it would normally pay LCH.Clearnet would switch to a potential new LME-operated clearing house.The group added that it was recruiting a director of post-trade services but said the move to build the house was not part of larger plans to sell the exchange.
424;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-29T22:38:06Z;New front opens in battle of exchanges;;"A gigantic game of chess has been playing out between the world’s exchanges for the past few months.The owner of the New York Stock Exchange – NYSE Euronext – is pursuing a merger with Germany’s Deutsche Börse and was until recently fighting a counterbid for NYSE from rival Nasdaq OMX and another US exchange known as ICE.The London Stock Exchange is pushing an agreed merger with TMX Group, operator of Canada’s exchanges, in the face of a counter-bid for TMX from a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds.But now the action is moving to the arcane business of clearing.LCH.Clearnet, one of the world’s largest clearing houses, confirmed at the weekend it had “various proposals indicating an interest in pursuing some form of possible business combination or other co-operation”.People familiar with the matter say LCH.Clearnet recently received three bids – from NYSE Euronext and Markit, a UK financial information company; Nasdaq; and from the LSE – valuing the business at €350m-€1bn ($500m-$1.4bn).Since then the LSE has distanced itself, saying it is “not engaged in any discussions with LCH regarding a possible transaction”.The London-based clearer is a product of the merger in 2003 of the London Clearing House and Clearnet, a Paris clearer. It clears cash equities for the LSE as well as commodities, energy, freight, repos and – the big attraction for any bidder – off-exchange, or over-the-counter, derivatives.This shows that the wave of exchange mergers is being driven as much by growing exchanges as by capitalising on post-financial crisis regulatory reforms forcing greater use of clearing in key markets.A clearing house stands between parties in a trade, ensuring that a deal is completed even if one side defaults. More clearing in the OTC derivatives markets is a key part of G20 reforms aimed at preventing another crisis, and is enshrined in the Dodd-Frank act in the US.Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman, a consultancy, say this will create an available “pool” of clearing revenues of about $1bn by 2013, more than double the pool in 2009-12.LCH.Clearnet is well positioned. It runs, with OTC dealer-banks, a service called SwapClear that has been clearing interest rate swaps since 1999.Pre-tax profits at LCH.Clearnet last year fell 80 per cent to €32.3m, while revenues were 39 per cent lower at €553.6m. Clearing fees from equities fell by 26.9 per cent to €44.3m. But revenue from clearing OTC derivatives rose more than 26 per cent to €21.2m.The International Swaps and Derivatives Association puts the notional value of OTC derivatives contracts outstanding at about $601,000bn as of December, of which 77 per cent is interest rate swaps.Industry experts say the opportunity to clear swaps will only grow as they shift from being negotiated bilaterally in large contracts to traded electronically on exchanges and other platforms, since this will slice orders into smaller sizes – increasing volume.Exchanges with clearing houses are already jostling to capture this business, with CME Group launching last year and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing also preparing a service.SwapClear launched a rates clearing service in the US in February. Nasdaq OMX hopes to compete through International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearer set up a year ago. But it has gained little traction, which may explain its interest in LCH.Clearnet.NYSE Euronext’s choice of Markit reflects the importance of regulators’ desire to see derivatives data that flow from trading and clearing made more transparent as well. Yet structuring any deal will be delicate. Any acquisition of LCH.Clearnet risks removing from the industry the only remaining derivatives clearer that is not controlled by an exchange, with trading and clearing integrated in a “vertical silo”.Market participants complain that silos – such as CME and Deutsche Börse – give their owners undue market power and fret that this will only increase as consolidation deepens.LCH.Clearnet is a not-for-profit utility owned by 98 shareholders, from banks and other market participants – which own 83 per cent – to NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange, with the rest.Any acquirer would face complex talks with the SwapClear banks, which take most of the revenues from OTC clearing, with LCH.Clearnet earning a fee. LCH.Clearnet cautioned its “considerations are at a preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that these proposals will result in any transaction”."
425;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-26T11:32:16Z;Oslo Børs plans to go public;;"Oslo Børs, Norway’s exchange operator, said on Thursday it was planning to remain independent after announcing plans to go public, even amid global exchange consolidation and tough domestic competition.The group said it would not issue new shares or sell existing stock for a planned flotation, for which it hopes will receive approval from shareholders before the end of the year.Its move comes amid fevered consolidation among US and European exchanges and as Oslo faces competition from Nasdaq OMX, the dominant exchange in the Nordic market, as well as from new trading venues such as Burgundy and Chi-X Europe.Oslo Børs said the move had been made after consultations in recent months with its shareholders, who wanted the share to be traded on automated trading platforms. At present, shares in Oslo Børs can only be traded over-the-counter via a broker in Norway.Shareholders include Vital Forsikring, Norway’s largest life assurance company, which has a 22.8 per cent stake; Kommunal Landspensjonskasse, an insurance group with a 11.9 per cent; Pareto Securities with 8.5 per cent and Orkla, the consumer goods group, with a 9.7 per cent stake.“A listing does not imply any change in company strategy,” Bente Landsnes, chief executive, told FT Trading Room. “We aim to remain independent.”She also said the move was not prompted by the consolidation moves involving many of the world’s largest exchanges. “A year ago we promised shareholders we would come back to it. We had some internal restructuring first.”Nadaq OMX, together with the IntercontinentalExchange, was unsuccessful with a bid for NYSE Euronext while the London Stock Exchange, one of Europe’s few independent exchanges, faces a challenge from a Canadian rival looking to break-up its agreed bid to buy TMX Group, operator of Canada’s largest bourse.Oslo Børs is also fighting fierce domestic competition from rival exchanges, particularly Nasdaq OMX, the New York-based stock exchange operator. The Norwegian group is the only incumbent Nordic exchange the Nadaq OMX does not own. Relations between the two parties, once allies, grew more strained when Oslo ended a technology alliance between the pair last year and struck an alternative deal with the London Stock Exchange.Nasdaq OMX launched trading in Norwegian derivatives in 2009 but has failed to take significant market share. Oslo Børs has an 82 per cent market share, down from a near 100 per cent share two years ago, according to the Fidessa Fragmentation Index.Ms Landsnes also said that no decision on its future trading platform had been made “but it’s very near.” The bourse is mulling whether to switch over to using the London Stock Exchange’s new MillenniumIT trading system. It currently uses TradeElect, the LSE’s outgoing system.A listing on either Oslo Børs or Oslo Axess, the exchange for junior companies, would also require approval from the Norwegian finance ministry. The group plans to make its application in a couple of weeks in order to have regulatory approval before the shareholder meeting."
426;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-24T14:31:36Z;DB, NYSE Euronext may still approve special payout;;Shareholders of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse may still see a billion-dollar dividend before the July deadline to vote on the proposed merger, even though the threat of a counterbid has dissippated.Following a meeting with NYSE management, Richard Repetto, an experienced analyst at Sandler O’Neill, told clients on Tuesday he believed it was likely that some kind of dividend or special cash payment would be made – something that NYSE had talked about while it was still fending off a since-withdrawn higher offer made by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange.“Though they felt they were always shareholder friendly, the higher counter bid made them take a long hard look at how they were interacting with shareholders and what the shareholders were signaling to them,” Mr Repetto wrote in a research note, of NYSE’s top executives.With a leverage ratio target of 1.0 to 1.3 net debt to cash flow, Mr Repetto believed that NYSE could pay a dividend of between $1.5bn and $2.7bn within a year of the deal closing.He added that while the two companies could not do a share repurchase, they also could not pay a dividend payment after shareholders approved the deal, according to law in the Netherlands, where the joint holding company is set to be headquartered.“Therefore with little appetite for M&A activity at present, the potential remains for NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse to optimize their capital position and pay a one-time dividend to shareholders at the closing of the deal,” he wrote.“We also believe a special dividend would likely be structured to benefit both Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext shareholders equally,” he added. NYSE Euronext shares were trading 0.1 per cent lower at $35.20 while shares in Deutsche Börse were 0.1 per cent higher at €54.64.NYSE shareholders are set to vote on the deal on July 7 and must vote a straight majority of the shares to approve the deal. Though many shareholders have said they believed NYSE ought to consider Nasdaq-ICE’s counterbid, there is expected to be little opposition to the merger without an alternative on the table.However Deutsche Börse shareholders – who must tender 75 per cent of their shares by July 13 – may be more difficult to convince. Unions who control shares and are influential in Germany have expressed opposition to potential job losses as part of the merger’s synergies.Mr Repetto said NYSE made no definitive statements on the matter.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext told shareholders at the annual meeting in April that NYSE and Deutsche Börse had the cash and operating strength to pay substantial dividends in their first few years as a combined company.A spokesperson for Deutsche Börse declined to comment.
427;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-20T20:49:31Z;Weak retail profits drag on Wall Street;;Barnes & Noble rose sharply after Liberty Media offered to buy the struggling US bookseller for $1bn, but worrying earnings reports from the retail sector led the wider markets down for their third successive week of losses.Barnes & Noble, the largest book retailer in the country, was up 30 per cent to $18.34 after an announcement late on Thursday.But Liberty Media, which offered about $17 per share for the group in a move that will diversify its holdings, was down 1.5 per cent to $17.70.The bid comes during tough times for booksellers, which are struggling to remain solvent as customers buy more books online, especially from Amazon, and adopt e-books.Borders, the second-largest bookseller in the US, filed for bankruptcy in February and has struggled to find a buyer.The offer for Barnes & Noble failed to lift the wider markets as sentiment was weighed down by disappointing earnings reports from the retail sector.The S&P 500 closed 0.8 per cent lower to 1,333.27, down 0.3 per cent over the week.This follows losses of 1.7 per cent and then a fall of 0.2 per cent in the first two weeks of the month.Shares in Gap, the largest US clothing chain by sales, fell 17.5 per cent to $19.21 after it reported a 23 per cent drop in first-quarter profits and slashed its earnings forecast as profits were hurt by higher commodity costs.The company said costs would rise 20 per cent in the second half and it would not be able to pass on all of this to consumers.Shares in retailer Aéropostale dropped 14.3 per cent to $18.30 after it reported a 64 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings as the company struggled with rising material costs.The S&P retail index was 1 per cent lower, down 2.9 per cent over the past five days, as other earnings also disappointed thanks to high commodity costs.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.7 per cent to 12,511.89 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.7 per cent lower to 2,830.32.Sentiment was also weighed down by worries over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.The Dow lost 0.7 per cent over the week while the Nasdaq fell 0.9 per cent.A bright spot was the initial public offering from LinkedIn, the networking website. It made a spectacular first day of trading on Thursday, jumping 109.4 per cent from its initial public offering price.The stock largely maintained those gains on Friday, falling only 1.2 per cent to $93.09, still over double the $45 IPO price and nearly triple its valuation at the beginning of the week when bankers set a price tag of $32-$35.In the energy sector, Cheniere Energy soared 32 per cent to $10.14 after announcing it had received approval from the Department of Energy to export US natural gas to more countries overseas.However the past five days on Wall Street have been generally downbeat, with sentiment weighed on by disappointing economic data.Traders were unnerved by worrying reports on the US housing markets as well as data showing a sharp drop in manufacturing activity this month.The influential Philadelphia Fed index of mid-Atlantic manufacturing showed a reading of 3.9, a sharp decrease from the 18.5 reading in April and lower than the 20 points that economists had been expecting.“Some people are arguing that we are seeing the start of a protracted slowdown in global growth as rate hikes in the emerging markets begin to bite, but I think this weakness will only last a few months,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at ING Investment Management.The negative sentiment over the week was limited as weekly employment data came in stronger than expected, but overall the mood was downbeat and investors continued to move their money from the cyclical to defensive stocks.Since the start of the second quarter, defensive sectors like healthcare, consumer staples and utilities are up 6-9 per cent while energy, financials and materials are all down 3-6 per cent.The worst performing stocks of the week were in the consumer discretionary and the technology sectors.The technology sector was helped lower by Hewlett-Packard, which disappointed investors by lowering its full-year earnings forecasts.The stock was down 11 per cent to $35.98 over the week. The S&P technology index was 1.5 per cent lower.
428;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-20T17:51:04Z;Big exchange mergers stopped in their tracks;;With stunning speed, the week saw the unravelling of two large exchange mergers, casting a cloud over the wave of consolidation that has swept the business since October last year.First, London Stock Exchange’s attempt to forge an all-share merger with TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses, was stopped in its tracks by a rival C$3.6bn bid from a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds.The consortium, named Maple, is positioning itself as guardian of TMX’s independence from foreign entanglements.But the deal has yet to pass antitrust tests. The Maple bid would involve folding the domestic post-trade operator – currently owned by the banks – into TMX, creating a powerful, integrated exchange and clearing house.Meanwhile, a day after the Canadian development, Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their $11.3bn bid for NYSE Euronext, after it became clear that their move would fail US antitrust tests.They were told by the US Department of Justice that their plan to merge the New York Stock Exchange with the Nasdaq market would reduce the choice of listings venues available to US companies, effectively ending the deal.The development came as a relief to NYSE Euronext, which can now proceed with a planned $9.4bn combination with Deutsche Börse, although this faces antitrust hurdles in Europe.www.ft.com/tradingroom
429;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
430;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-17T01:32:31Z;BATS unveils cheaper listings fees;;BATS Global Markets has unveiled a cheaper pricing structure for its planned stock listings market the same day US regulators cited a lack of competition as a reason for spiking Nasdaq’s proposed merger with the New York Stock Exchange.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Kansas City-based BATS said that top-tier issuers would pay a flat fee of $35,000 annually, after an initial fee of $100,000.That compares to an initial fee of up to $225,000 and annual fees up to $99,500 for Nasdaq’s stock market, depending on the size of the company’s stock float. NYSE-listed companies pay as much as $500,000 annually, with initial fees of up to $250,000.“While not necessarily cheaper for all issuers at all other markets, [the fees] are roughly equivalent or less than issuers would pay at other exchanges,” BATS said.BATS, among the four largest US stock exchanges by daily volume, is launching a competing US equity listing platform, set to go live by the end of this year pending SEC approval of its pricing and rules. The shares will be listed on BATS’s BZX exchange.BATS says the long-planned move will bring the same ultra-competitive, low-cost approach it used to break into stock trading in competition with Nasdaq and NYSE. The pair currently dominate listings of companies, as well as convertible securities, closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds.Among the first participants in the market will be BATS itself. Last week, BATS revealed that it planned to raise $100m in a public offering, and would list its shares on its own market.BATS named Brian King, who previously managed client relations for the company, as its listings director.The market envisioned by BATS will have similar standards to Nasdaq’s listings market, it said in the filing. To list on the top tier of BATS, a company’s shares must trade at $4 a share or more and the company must have at least 400 investors and 1.1m publicly held shares.The requirements are slightly different than those of the NYSE, which requires that the market value of listed shares must be at least $40m. BATS would allow some companies meeting other criteria, such as past profits or having market makers, to have just $8m in market value.BATS, like Nasdaq, will also have a junior listing, or “Tier II”, for smaller companies or US-listed foreign securities.“As we ready for the launch of our listings business, we remain very excited about bringing companies a fresh alternative venue to access the capital markets,” said Joe Ratterman, BATS chief executive. “BATS listings will be focused on the key differentiators that have set BATS apart from the incumbent exchanges since day one: simple and competitive pricing, innovative tools and technology, and leading customer support and education,” he said.The US justice department, in saying it would sue to stop Nasdaq from merging with the NYSE stock market – a central piece of the joint bid by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange to buy NYSE Euronext – cited a lack of competition in listings as a key concern.“If they were to merge, they would have the ability and incentive to raise the cost of stock listings, increase listing fees and reduce the quality of services,” said Christine Varney, head of the US justice department’s antitrust division, on a conference call on Monday. “Virtually all, if not every” one of the US-based Fortune 500 companies is listed on NYSE or Nasdaq, she said.
431;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-16T21:47:32Z;Nasdaq and ICE withdraw bid for NYSE;;Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange have abandoned their $11.3bn break-up bid for NYSE Euronext after a US competition regulator threatened to sue the companies to block the potential deal.The Department of Justice said that combining the NYSE’s stock market operations with Nasdaq’s would have “substantially eliminated competition” in listings, trade reporting and other areas.Nasdaq and ICE were seeking to derail an agreed merger between the NYSE and Germany’s Deutsche Börse but on Monday withdrew their proposal, adding that they were “surprised and disappointed” by the DoJ’s decision.The abrupt end to Nasdaq-ICE’s counterbid leaves the way clear for NYSE to court shareholders ahead of a July vote on the Deutsche Börse deal.Nasdaq’s failure could increase pressure on Bob Greifeld, chief executive, to explain how the US bourse plans to compete as exchanges consolidate for global scale and greater exposure to derivatives.“This was opportunistic for Nasdaq but history has repeated itself,” said Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, referring to Mr Greifeld’s failed hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange in 2007. “As the other exchanges grow in global scale, Nasdaq will still be focused on US equities. I think investors will view them in a narrower scope.”Nasdaq and ICE have yet to reveal how much the abortive bid will cost.The DoJ on Monday said it would file an antitrust lawsuit if the bid continued, highlighting numerous concerns about a merged Nasdaq and NYSE including listings, opening and closing auctions, off-exchange stock trade reporting services and real-time data products.Nasdaq stock fell 2.5 per cent to $26.23 while NYSE shares fell nearly 13 per cent to $35.73 as investors’ hopes faded over a sweetened Deutsche Börse offer.The demise of Nasdaq’s bid comes as other proposed exchange combinations also falter. The LSE faces competition for TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal exchanges, from a group of Canadian banks and pension plans, which have lodged a C$3.6bn (US$3.7bn) counterbid designed to preserve TMX for Canada.The Australian authorities in April blocked a bid by Singapore’s SGX for the ASX exchange on national interest grounds.NYSE’s deal with Deutsche Börse, unveiled in February, is expected to face a tough antitrust review in Europe where combining the pair’s derivatives platforms would create a dominant pan-European futures exchange.But Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said on Monday that the NYSE-Deutsche Börse deal could protect jobs and strengthen New York’s position in the derivatives markets.
432;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-16T21:30:05Z;Economic data weigh on Wall Street;;Shares in NYSE Euronext fell sharply after Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their bid, while in the wider markets the week kicked off in negative territory after a slew of disappointing economic data and some mixed earnings results.NYSE Euronext dropped 11.1 per cent to $36.36 after a joint bid from Nasdaq and ICE for the exchange was withdrawn. The $11bn offer had been higher than NYSE’s already agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.The two exchanges, which had been threatening to go hostile with their bid after it was rejected by the NYSE board, blamed the move on a failure to secure regulatory approval from US authorities.Shares in Nasdaq lost 2.5 per cent to $26.23 while ICE was up 3.3 per cent to $122.22.In the wider markets the S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent to 1,329.147 as weak data on housing and manufacturing left investors feeling uneasy.Figures from the New York Federal Reserve showed that manufacturing growth in the New York area had fallen to its lowest level in five months.The Empire State manufacturing index fell from 21.7 in April to 11.9 in May, the lowest level since December and well below economists’ expectations of 19.9.Separately, the National Association of Home Builders’ housing market index stayed at low levels, highlighting the weakness of the US housing market.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.4 per cent to 12,548.30 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,782.31.This follows a loss of 1.9 per cent on the S&P 500 over the past two weeks as commodity prices tumbled lower and investors worried about the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Greece.The retail sector lost ground in the session as a week of earnings reports from big industry groups kicked off in a mixed fashion after JC Penney surpassed expectations but Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, released disappointing results.JC Penney, the mid-range US department store, reported first-quarter earnings up 7 per cent, benefiting from cost reductions and from strong sales in its exclusive brand names.But sentiment in the sector was weighed on by Lowe’s lacklustre results.First-quarter net income for the home improvement store fell 6 per cent, as the weak housing market limited demand for remodelling projects.The company blamed the 1.6 per cent fall in sales on poor weather and the housing market. Lowe’s reported earnings of 34 cents a share on net income of $461m, short of the 36 cents a share expected by analysts.Shares in Lowe’s fell 3.6 per cent to $24.83 while JC Penney fell 3.2 per cent to $37.21, dragged down with the rest of the sector.The S&P retail sector was down 1 per cent, one of the worst performing on Wall Street. Last Monday, Macy’s reported strong results and later this week Home Depot, Walmart and Target will report their first-quarter earnings.The general ‘risk off’ trade hit technology stocks the hardest, with the S&P technology index falling 1.5 per cent.These losses were led by Monster Worldwide, the jobs listings service provider, was down 8.3 per cent to $14.99 while Yahoo fell 4.5 per cent to $15.81. Salesforce.com, which provides an online service for salespeople to manage their customer data, lost 4.4 per cent to $128.96.In deal news, Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, bought equipment maker LeTourneau Technologies from Rowan for $1.1bn. The news sent Joy Global up 1 per cent to $88.36, but Rowan lost 0.2 per cent to $37.96.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Siga Technologies added 2.3 per cent to $14.52 after the pharmaceutical company said it had won a $433m contract with the US Department of Health and Human Services to deliver 2m courses of its smallpox antiviral.The contract includes options that would raise the total value to approximately $2.8bn.Merck, another drugmaker, was up 0.6 per cent to $37.30 after it won approval to launch a new hepatitis C drug after the Food and Drug Administration evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the treatment in clinical trials.Iron Mountain, the US information storage company, was up 0.7 per cent to $32.67 after Autonomy, the UK software group, said it had agreed to buy selected assets of the company’s digital arm for $380m in cash.
433;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-16T19:29:53Z;Chill wind blows over plans for market mergers;;Another day, another global exchange merger turns to dust.The withdrawal by Nasdaq OMX of its audacious counter-offer, in partnership with Intercontinental-Exchange, for NYSE Euronext is as stunning for its timing as well as for falling a day after another exchange combination was all but scuppered.The London Stock Exchange is licking its wounds after a consortium of Canadian financial institutions on Sunday tabled a C$3.6bn ($3.7bn) bid for TMX, which had earlier agreed a tie-up with the British exchange.So, with the failure of the Singapore exchange’s takeover of the Australian exchange only five weeks ago, was the much-vaunted wave of exchange consolidation merely a gigantic spasm of executive hubris?After all, for Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, it rankled that his crosstown rival Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, had managed to pip him to a deal by tying up with Deutsche Börse.“We are moving into a period where any deal is going to be hard to get off the ground. This will really test the mettle of CEOs and differentiate between those who thrive on buzz of deal-making versus those with the real strategic vision to grow their organisations organically,” said Niki Beattie, managing director of The Market Structure Practice, a consultancy.More importantly, it may even be the wrong time for exchange consolidation to be taking place.In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, regulators and market participants are struggling to figure out how market structures – exchanges, trading venues, clearing houses and banks – should best be built for a post-crisis world.They know they must be run in a way that safeguards both the stability of the financial system to prevent another crisis, but also allows enough competition to keep markets liquid and functioning smoothly. The question is: does allowing structures like exchanges to get bigger and more powerful achieve that balance?That tension is causing uncertainty as market participants wait for regulators in the US to implement the Dodd-Frank act on over-the-counter derivatives and clearing houses, and as Europe grapples with similar issues.“Everyone’s struggling with putting the right regulations in place for future market structures and until those are squared away it’s going to be difficult to do any cross-border deals, particularly these megamergers,” said Robert Hegarty, global head of market structures at Thomson Reuters.Crucially, there are signs that antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have concerns about the bulking up of certain businesses and the market power they appear to have.A few weeks ago the European Commission launched a sweeping probe into the arrangements that ICE has with leading banks in OTC derivatives for the clearing of credit default swaps at its clearing house in London. The concern is possible abuse of a dominant market position, since ICE has built the clearing service in a revenue-sharing partnership with dominant dealers in OTC markets.Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said on Monday: “Competition control should ensure that the actual evolution of the market does not lead to structures that harm users and legitimate market participants. In particular, we should prevent that any one entity or group controls essential infrastructure – be it a trading platform, a clearing platform or a pre-trading service – to the benefit of a restricted few.”In the US the failure of Nasdaq’s proposed merger with NYSE to pass antitrust tests is another sign of increased scrutiny.It stands in contrast to the approval that the justice department gave for the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade in 2007, even as that created a near-monopoly in US futures trading, showing that US antitrust watchdogs are paying close attention too.Matthew Cantor, a partner at US law firm Constantine Cannon, said: “I think that in the last six months the [US] antitrust authorities have really stepped it up a notch and are shown they will be a vigorous force.”That may complicate matters for the only exchange merger left that has not run into trouble: NYSE Euronext’s agreed tie-up with Deutsche Börse which Mr Greifeld had been attempting to break up.It faces a deep and lengthy probe by Mr Almunia’s department, which is likely to study plans to combine the Börse’s Eurex futures business with Liffe, NYSE Euronext’s London-based futures exchange. This would create a near-monopoly in European futures markets, with clearing of futures contracts all taking place at the German group’s clearing house.Mr Almunia, speaking at the Cass Business School at the City University London, did not address the German-US tie-up. But he said: “Lack of competition is always a red line.”
434;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-16T19:06:11Z;Maple consortium upbeat on antitrust issue in TMX bid;;The consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds bidding for the TMX stock exchange group expressed confidence that intense competition from US exchanges and other trading platforms will allay disquiet at the banks’ heightened dominance of the domestic securities industry.Luc Bertrand, vice-chairman of Quebec-based National Bank of Canada, representing the consortium known as Maple, said on Monday that “we believe the applicable provisions of the Competition Act will be satisfied”.He noted that most big Canadian companies maintain listings on both sides of the border.For instance, about 80 per cent of trading in Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, takes place in the US.Such competition, he added, “will continue to be a major constraining factor on trading fees”.Mr Bertrand said that Maple’s approach was “very, very different” from the aborted bid by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange for control of NYSE Euronext.While the US deal would have given Nasdaq control over listings on US markets, the Maple offer involved no change in listing arrangements in Canada.The C$3.6bn ($3.7bn) Maple cash-and-shares bid, valued at C$48 a share, offers a 24 per cent premium over an earlier merger proposal between the London Stock Exchange and TMX.Under the Maple proposal, the banks will create a “vertical silo” by folding into TMX their existing interests in CDS Clearing and Depository Services, the Toronto exchange’s clearing house, and Alpha, an alternative trading platform that has captured close to one-fifth of equity trade in Canada.The Maple group foresees significant efficiencies from combining CDS’s platform with the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation, which handles trades on the Montreal exchange.Mr Bertrand said that, unlike Nasdaq/ICE, Alpha provides limited services as a trading platform, with no authority over listings.Furthermore, Mr Bertrand said, “Canada has a unique regulatory environment from a securities and a competition law perspective”, with trading fees and access to markets subject to public interest oversight by securities commissions.
435;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-16T17:19:31Z;Nasdaq in strategic quandary after failed bid;;Nasdaq OMX, after announcing the end of its effort to acquire NYSE Euronext, now finds itself in the same strategic quandary that led it to make the high-risk, high-reward offer in the first place.It is the second time that Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, has failed to capture a target he has gone after. A hostile bid to buy the London Stock Exchange in 2007 failed after shareholders rejected the approach.The same is true for Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of IntercontinentalExchange, which was bidding alongside Nasdaq. He had tried to buy the Chicago Board of Trade, but failed to break up its merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.But the effort to buy NYSE Euronext was viewed as being far more critical for Nasdaq, among observers and even internally among the bidding group. While ICE has grown organically in the fast-growing derivatives markets from scratch in the past decade, and is highly valued by investors, Nasdaq has struggled to grow as US equity markets have seen volumes shrink and an explosion in competition. “Yes, Nasdaq can exist as a standalone, but they have a huge handicap on the derivatives side,” says Georges Ugeux, chairman of Galileo Global Advisors and a former exchange executive.Mr Greifeld was far more visible than Mr Sprecher in selling their bid, and the focus of the deal’s purportedly vast synergies – more than $700m for an $11bn deal – was on the combining of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, the two historical rivals.Whenever asked, Mr Greifeld argued that a singularly focused global equity-focused exchange could deliver superior returns than the “supermarket” to be created by NYSE Euronext-Deutchse Börse. On a recent earnings call, he made the semantic point that equities were a “derivative” on US economic growth.However, it was the strategic logic of combining the leading US equities exchanges that also ended up sinking the bid. US antitrust regulators seized upon the competitive implications of turning two US listings venues, which also manage opening and closing-bell price auctions, into one.Nasdaq OMX now faces the daunting question of what to do next. “By making such an aggressive bid so quickly, Greifeld aided and abetted the perception out there that he needs to do something strategically,” says Jamie Selway, a market structure analyst at brokerage ITG.Nasdaq has made strides in businesses other than cash equities, in particular technology and equity derivatives. Nasdaq’s trading technology platform is a world-beater, powering dozens of markets around the world, and potentially a better way to deliver value than via NYSE’s expensive data centre business.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, says that Nasdaq will probably continue to search for outside opportunities for growth in equities. At the very least, he says, Nasdaq “has demonstrated it is not afraid of levering up for the right deal”. However, many logical combinations – such as with the Singapore Exchange, or joining the proposed London Stock Exchange-TMX Group deal – face their own political hurdles as well.
436;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-16T17:19:31Z;Nasdaq/NYSE: monopoly trouble;Back to the blackboard for Nasdaq’s chief;Most American schoolkids could have guessed this deal might be blocked. OK class, name a US stock market. The New York Stock Exchange – very good! Does anyone know the other big one? Nasdaq – well done! The US Department of Justice also receives full marks on Monday for knowing the word monopoly. In its announcement that Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange had abandoned their bid for NYSE Euronext, the DoJ simply pointed out that the two companies “operate the major stock exchanges in the United States”.So back to school for Nasdaq chief executive Bob Greifeld. But he done well, tripling revenues since 2005, partly thanks to eight sizable acquisitions. Sure, he will be teased for being chased away from America’s oldest bourse just three years after failing to win the London Stock Exchange. But Mr Greifeld can still point to 34 per cent earnings per share growth since 2007. Nasdaq shares have outperformed NYSE’s over the last five years by 25 percentage points.Still, investors should be miffed. Nasdaq’s shares are trading at half the level they were at the end of 2007 and the pursuit of NYSE was a big distraction. Worse, the chance to bag a share of an estimated $740m in annualised synergies is off the table. That Nasdaq’s market capitalisation did not plummet on Tuesday shows that no one thought it had any chance capturing those synergies.What next for Nasdaq? The most important thing is not to be panicked into action. The fear of missing out on all the exchanges deals happening around the world these days could lead to bad moves. Rather, Mr Greifeld should concentrate on growing Nasdaq’s equity options and derivative businesses and on improving returns – making the company an attractive target. There are two sides to the consolidation game.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
437;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-16T14:42:01Z;Quick View: Are exchanges doomed not to merge?;;Knocked right out of the ball park, before half time.That is what the US Department of Justice has just done to Nasdaq OMX’s attempted break-up of the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext merger.Bob Greifeld must be hurting.If there is one thing that can be said for the guy, he pursued this counter-bid aggressively, with his partner Jeff Sprecher of IntercontinentalExchange.One thing stood out as odd, however. That was how over-confident he seemed of getting through the anti-trust process.Early on Mr Greifeld made some public comments on how long he thought part of the process would take. Not a good idea when you are supposed to let the justice department get on with it and keep schtum.Then last week, apropos of nothing in particular, Nasdaq OMX issued a press release saying it was “working closely” with the justice department on its review of the offer for NYSE Euronext, and that it “makes no comment on the specifics of these discussions or how they are progressing, has received no assurances from the Department of Justice as to the timing or outcome of the review”.Something must have prompted them to put that out.So far, so historical. So what now?For Mr Greifeld this is clearly a shattering blow. His move, in partnership with ICE, was pretty much the last roll of the dice for him when it came to keeping Nasdaq OMX in the global consolidation game.And the deal itself was a stretch, involving a leap of faith by NYSE shareholders in Mr Greifeld’s ability to turn a combined NYSE-Nasdaq cash equities and listings business into a proper money-spinner – when everyone knows that cash equities is a low-margin commoditised business.We heard repeated statements from Mr Greifeld that he could run the US and European cash equities businesses far more efficiently than NYSE and Deutsche Börse would.I think he probably could have, as he has a deserved reputation as cost-cutter-in-chief in the exchange business, coupled with a track record of running businesses efficiently.But that was never going to move the dial enough on the cash equities piece of this. And in any case shareholders in this sector are interested in derivatives – futures, mostly – and clearing. Mr Greifeld even tried to make the case on an April 20 earnings call that cash equities was “the original and the most important derivative product” since it was “a derivative of the economy”. Hello?And Mr Greifeld was the most leveraged of his peers in the exchange sector. That was before he lined up $3.8bn in financing from a consortium of banks for the NYSE counter-offer.Mr Greifeld is not known for giving up easily on anything, so this will have been hard. His next option might be to have another go at the London Stock Exchange, for which he famously pursued a hostile bid which ultimately failed in 2006.The LSE’s own attempt to combine with TMX Group of Canada lies almost in tatters after a bank and pension fund-led consortium tabled a C$3.6bn bid for TMX on Monday. The market certainly jumped to that immediate conclusion, puhsing the LSE shares as high as 899p, its highest level since it agreed to merge with TMX.But is it not also possible that, after three of the four exchange deals to have emerged since October last year – the first being SGX of Singapore’s attempted takeover of ASX of Australia, it may actually be that none of these deals happen?The US antitrust decision in the Nasdaq OMX-NYSE case could be interpreted as making it all the easier for European antitrust regulators to erect barriers to the DB/NYSE deal, if not blocking it outright.And with the mood music among European antitrust regulators being distinctly pro-competition – you only have to look at the recent case launched against ICE in credit default swaps clearing – it may be that DB/NYSE’s path to approval may be more complicated.
438;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Banks lead European stocks lower;;"Banks were the biggest weight behind losses for European equity markets as renewed debt fears hit the region, but merger activity helped brighten an otherwise gloomy sessionDeutsche Börse, the German exchange operator, climbed 3.8 per cent to €56.40 as it became the frontrunner to take over NYSE Euronext after Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their combined rival bid.In a statement, Nasdaq chief Bob Greifeld said it had become clear to the two bidders that they would not secure regulatory approval from the antitrust division of the US Department of Justice.Deutsche Börse’s strong performance helped lighten the mood and most European equity markets ended well off their worst levels of the session, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 finishing just 0.2 per cent lower at 1,138.74, having earlier been down by nearly 1 per cent.Commerzbank was the worst performer on the Eurofirst 300, down 3.5 per cent to €3.80, after WestLB cut its rating to “sell” from “reduce”.Banks were broadly lower across the region as uncertainties surrounding the eurozone debt crisis weighed. But the sector bounced from its lows after Angela Merkel, German chancellor, said any immediate debt restructuring would damage the integrity of the eurozone.Italy’s Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena dropped
2.3 per cent to €0.90, while National Bank of Greece lost 2.7 per cent to €4.68 and France’s Crédit Agricole fell 1.3 per cent to €10.93.Carmakers lost out on concerns that rising eurozone interest rates could damp demand if finance deals become more expensive.The European Central Bank is not expected to raise rates at its June meeting but data showing that eurozone inflation rose in April, to 2.8 per cent from 2.7 per cent in March, lifted expectations of a July increase.Renault declined 1.8 per cent to €40.06 and Volkswagen dropped 0.8 per cent to
€127.45.However, there were some gains in the retail sector after Swedish clothier H&M posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter sales. The company’s shares rose 2.9 per cent to SKr237.90.Hermès International, the French luxury goods group, rose 3 per cent to €177."
439;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-15T18:21:04Z;Counterbid for TMX catches LSE on the hop;;"If the Canadian banks and pension funds trying to scupper the London Stock Exchange’s merger with TMX Group chose their moment to inflict maximum embarrassment on the UK bourse, they chose well.Xavier Rolet, the LSE’s chief executive, ended a long day on Friday buoyed by reporting its best set of results for years. Efforts to diversify into lucrative areas such as derivatives and clearing are starting to pay off.The same day, the LSE had even filed applications with provincial securities regulators in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia for approval of the LSE’s planned merger with TMX Group, unveiled in mid-February.But on Saturday news started to filter through that what could be his crowning achievement since taking over in 2009 – a transatlantic merger – had run into a significant roadblock.Last night, a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds codenamed Maple unveiled a C$3.6bn (US$3.7bn) counterbid for TMX Group to keep the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange and Montreal’s derivatives exchange in Canadian hands. The LSE has said it stands by its agreed merger with TMX. But it seems unlikely that if TMX shareholders accept the Maple offer, the LSE would risk a protracted and expensive battle to defend its deal.The LSE would have few options but to quietly drop the bid, given the financial firepower that Maple is bringing to bear, coupled with a tailwind of nationalist sentiment.Niki Beattie, managing director at The Market Structure Practice, a consultancy, says: “It’s a massive blow for them [the LSE].”Fortunately, as Friday’s full-year earnings showed, Mr Rolet’s efforts are paying off. The LSE is earning more from high-margin services such as clearing – at its Italian clearing house – than from fees charged when traders place a trade.The exchange’s customers have also benefited as its UK clearing service provider, LCH.Clearnet, has cut fees. Mr Rolet says the LSE is set to attract “high-frequency” traders from the US with the launch of a new service that will allow them easier access.For Mr Rolet and observers in London, the surprise is that the TMX deal, of all the deals in the current wave of exchange consolidation, encountered such problems. Other moves – such as Deutsche Börse’s planned merger with NYSE Euronext and the subsequent spoiler bid from Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental­Exchange – have been more obviously contentious.By contrast, says Ms Beattie, the LSE-TMX deal “is the most benign deal out there”, with no antitrust issues. Both exchanges share the same language and legal system.Mr Rolet and his counterpart at TMX, Tom Kloet, were careful to stress that the Canadian exchanges in the combined group would be run by Canadian residents; that the group would have joint headquarters in London and Toronto; and that the board would be made up of seven Canadians, five Britons and three Italians.The LSE even fielded two fluent French speakers – Mr Rolet and Nic Bertrand, his French head of markets – to help lobby regulators and others in Quebec. But the fact the LSE would end up with 55 per cent of a holding company, leaving the Canadians with the rest, still rankled in Canada.The Maple consortium will have to prove that control of TMX by a handful of powerful Canadian banks and pension funds will not disenfranchise big customers that are not owners in TMX.Mr Rolet will be hoping he has time to secure the LSE’s future before his larger rivals figure all that out – and pounce on the UK exchange."
440;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Banks look to counter LSE’s TMX deal;;"This week a giant blue illuminated ball and electronic ticker tapes were inaugurated at the London Stock Exchange as the UK bourse launched a new market opening ceremony to kick off trading each day.It was probably a welcome distraction for Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, from having to follow the progress of his planned “merger of equals” with TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal exchanges, thousands of miles away in Canada.Unveiled three months ago, the LSE-TMX deal has been overshadowed by a bigger battle revolving around NYSE Euronext, the US exchange that owns the New York Stock Exchange. Although it agreed a $9.4bn combination with Germany’s Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange are pursuing a bid to snatch NYSE Euronext away.Now Mr Rolet and his TMX counterpart, Tom Kloet, could be facing a possible counterbid for the TMX from a group of local financial institutions.Banks opposed to the merger, led by Toronto-Dominion, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Quebec-based National Bank of Canada, are exploring other options for TMX with institutions such as pension funds, one person familiar with the discussions said.He said the talks were prompted by a desire to build on TMX’s strengths rather than allow it to fall under the control of a foreign institution, such as the LSE. He noted that both Mr Rolet, a Frenchman, and Mr Kloet, an American, are foreigners with little appreciation of Canadian sensibilities.Mr Rolet and Mr Kloet have stressed that the Canadian exchanges in the combined group would be run by Canadian residents; that the group would have joint headquarters in London and Toronto; and that the board would be made up of seven Canadians, five Britons and three Italians, from Borsa Italiana.The banks have a sizeable stake in TMX’s fate, owning two-thirds of CDS Clearing and Depository Services, Canada’s main securities clearing house. TMX and a securities industry regulator own the remaining 33 per cent, and CDS is run as a non-profit partnership.The banks, through their brokerage arms, also control Alpha Trading Systems, an alternative trading platform which has captured 19 per cent of the value of equities traded in Canada. The Toronto exchange’s share has slipped from 87 per cent two years ago to 65 per cent in the first three months of this year, as share trading has fragmented across venues, as it has in the US and Europe.The banks see an opportunity in giving the exchange greater control of CDS.Such a move would transform the clearing house from a low-margin, user-owned utility into a money-spinner along the lines of Deutsche Börse, which has its own clearing house in what the industry calls a vertical silo.Exchanges that have their own clearer tend to have higher stock market valuations since they are able to collect clearing fees on the trades that are done on their platforms.But the banks face some daunting obstacles. They have conflicts of interest stemming from their stakes in Alpha and CDS. The banks would gain a near monopoly over securities trading if they were allowed to control both Alpha and the Toronto and Montreal exchanges.Mr Rolet said this week: “If there is another project out there that materialises we will see what it is.“It will also highlight the benefits of our transaction. It is an exchange-to-exchange transaction which is by definition neutral.“And the concept of certain clients or constituencies controlling an exchange raises a whole host of other questions,” he said.Canadians have a love-hate relationship with the banks, respecting their stability while chafing at their size and influence.Any TMX deal involving the banks would force politicians and regulators to choose between the potential rewards of creating a national champion and the risks of the banks abusing their extra power.Tom Caldwell, a Toronto securities dealer whose company, Caldwell Financial, invests in exchanges, said a bid for TMX involving the banks “would be a terrible thing for Canadian markets”, adding that “exchanges should be neutral”.The dilemmas facing the banks are already on display in the LSE-TMX deal. Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s biggest financial institution, and Bank of Montreal have publicly supported the LSE deal. But each is an adviser to one of the parties.Still, Mr Caldwell said he would not be surprised to see a counterbid: “If the banks do come in, it depends on how they package it and the price.”"
441;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-12T10:54:58Z;D Börse raises NYSE revenue forecasts;;Deutsche Börse on Thursday raised its estimates for revenue synergies that could be achieved in its planned combination with NYSE Euronext from €100m ($141m) to €150m partly through expanding the group’s clearing service across the proposed new group.Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse chief executive, also attacked the counter-bid for NYSE Euronext by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange, saying it would lead to a monopoly in US listings, weaken New York as a financial centre and “marginalise” European cash markets through “a US-oriented Nasdaq and NYSE Euronext combination”.Mr Francioni told the German group’s shareholder meeting that cost synergies would now likely be €400m, up from an original estimate of €300m, confirming a new figure earlier disclosed by Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times.Mr Francioni said: “We have also made advances in recent days with NYSE Euronext in calculating revenue synergies. Instead of a figure of €100m, as originally estimated, we now expect to see synergies of €150m.”He said the larger synergies would come from the “progressive introduction” of Eurex Clearing across the whole group and extension of risk management to all cash and derivatives markets.“A global clearing infrastructure will be formed which will significantly enhance risk management and efficiency in the use of capital for our customers,” Mr Francioni said.Extra revenue would also come from the combination of equity and derivatives markets, allowing “cross-selling across European spot markets”.Customers would also benefit from “stronger hosting and management of technology and data services”, and the extension of the Stoxx index benchmark business to the US.Mr Francioni made his most vocal criticism of the Nasdaq OMX-ICE counter-bid, saying huge jobs cuts would result in New York as a result of a “high degree of overlap in structures”.“By bringing together complementary business areas, the [DB/NYSE] merger will create the world’s leading exchange organisation which will be unique in addressing the needs of the market for global presence and breadth of product offering.“By contrast, the Nasdaq and ICE bid is focused on breaking up NYSE Euronext to form a cash market operator focused on the US market with very limited growth potential and a monopoly for US listings,” Mr Francioni said.Mr Francioni also sought to play up the impact on Frankfurt as a financial centre of the planned combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext.“When negotiating the [merger], we placed utmost importance on protecting the interests of Deutsche Börse and of Frankfurt as a financial centre. Frankfurt has so far served as an important financial centre in Europe. But with the merger, Frankfurt will become a key location in the global capital market,” he said.“What is better – being globally connected up in a globalised world, or cocooned in a local environment? To me, the answer is obvious: the merger in the form we have agreed will strengthen Frankfurt as a financial centre and will therefore also strengthen Germany as a financial location.”
442;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-12T06:45:50Z;City fortunes in flux as exchanges merge;;In the centres of Paris and Brussels two neoclassical buildings, each with the word “Bourse” engraved above their entrances, tell a story of once-proud national stock exchanges, their floors teeming with traders.But for years the buildings have been empty, or have provided office space, as trading has gone electronic and the bourses have become part of the NYSE Euronext group, operator of exchanges in the US and across Europe. But their disappearance does not mean that national pride in hosting key market infrastructure has entirely disappeared from Europe too.As a wave of exchange mergers sweeps the globe, a tense game is being played by exchanges as they seek to assure political leaders in Europe’s financial centres – from the dominant one in London to tiny Lisbon – that they will not lose out as the mergers move towards their endgames.NYSE Euronext is trying to finalise a planned $9.4bn merger with Deutsche Börse, of Germany.This would create by far the largest exchange in the world, a sprawling entity including the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Euronext’s four European stock markets of Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon, with the German exchange’s Frankfurt Stock Exchange.The Börse’s big Eurex derivatives business would be combined with the NYSE Liffe futures exchange, which is based in London.Yet NYSE rival Nasdaq OMX has teamed up with another US exchange, IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, to thwart the merger, with a $11.4bn cash and shares offer to NYSE Euronext shareholders for the NYSE Euronext business.Each permutation has significant implications for London, Frankfurt, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, since each places different emphasis on where certain businesses will be located.But what is making matters politically charged is how big changes to the trading landscape since 2007, combined with the financial crisis a year later, have turned Europe’s capitals into competitors like never before.The London, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam share markets lost their near-monopolies in share trading with the enactment by the European Commission in 2007 of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid).That created competition for the first time, provided largely by London-based upstarts and giving the UK financial centre a boost at the expense of its smaller rivals. In the wake of the crisis, London’s Anglo-Saxon financial model became an easy target for continental European capitals eager to encourage market infrastructures to their centres instead.Against this backdrop, the merging exchanges are playing “a high-stakes game”, says Niki Beattie, managing director of the Market Structure Practice, a consultancy.“Paris and Amsterdam and Frankfurt have all felt they probably ceded something to London post-Mifid [Europe’s markets in financial instruments directive], so all of them probably want to take something back. Everyone’s looking to be appeased,” she says.That explains why the chief executives of each exchange have been shuttling from capital to capital trying to reassure politicians and regulators that their city will be a winner from the deals.In recent weeks Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, met the chief of staff of French president Nicolas Sarkozy. This week Mr Greifeld revealed that he had offered the French to restore the name “Paris Bourse” to France’s stock market if Nasdaq-ICE wins the battle for control of NYSE Euronext.When the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext tie-up was announced, Paris Europlace insisted the two exchanges ensure that Paris remain “the largest stock-listing activity in the eurozone”.Speaking before the Nasdaq-ICE bid emerged, French finance minister Christine Lagarde said of the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext deal: “It was my initial concern – is that going to be a New York-Frankfurt alliance and Paris will fall between the cracks? I don’t think so.”The chief executives of these two groups, respectively Reto Francioni and Duncan Niederauer, have also done the rounds. While Frankfurt looks set to benefit in any US-German deal, both men have been careful not to ignore Paris and Amsterdam in their public statements. For London, the key factor will be what happens to Liffe, the futures exchange run by NYSE Euronext. The Nasdaq-ICE camp argue that Liffe would eventually be “gutted” because it would become subsumed in the Eurex business in Frankfurt. NYSE Euronext rejects the notion, saying that while the ancillary business of providing clearing services may move to Frankfurt, over time Liffe will remain intact.Diego Valiante of the European Capital Markets Institute, a Brussels thinktank, says London will ultimately keep its position as top financial centre.“It is complicated as there are a lot of national interest arguments. But London will survive.”…………………………………………..NYC flashpointThe fate of New York city has become a flashpoint in the exchange takeover battle, writes Telis Demos in New York.Both potential deals, the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse tie-up, and the Nasdaq OMX-IntercontinentalExchange offer to buy NYSE, are promising at least $700m in synergies, primarily from cost-cutting.US politicians, notably Charles Schumer, the senior senator from New York, have asked both NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq to detail potential job losses that might result from those cost cuts. He suggests any entity keep “New York” at the front of its name.In Nasdaq’s vision, it would combine trading platforms and data centres for the six US equity and options exchanges it would control after acquiring NYSE, and create a near-monopoly listings exchange. NYSE has argued that 800 jobs would be lost in New York with Nasdaq’s savings. However, Nasdaq has not said how many job cuts could result, arguing that NYSE has blocked it from doing due diligence.Nasdaq argues its deal could restore New York city as a global financial hub by creating a national champion of listings.Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, has pointed to the Prada initial public offering, which chose Hong Kong, and Glencore, which chose Hong Kong and London, as evidence that New York is losing its appeal.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE chief executive, has instead pointed to a rush of Chinese groups listing in New York, primarily on NYSE, as evidence the city has not lost its edge.
443;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-11T18:56:53Z;D Börse staff urge rejection of takeover;;Deutsche Börse’s employee representatives have urged shareholders to reject the stock exchange operator’s takeover proposal for NYSE Euronext, reflecting worries about job cuts in the wake of a merger.The works council, which represents the German stock market group’s employees, called on shareholders to vote against the proposed offer.“The targeted merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext to form a ‘super stock exchange’ is not a merger between equals and gravely disadvantages Deutsche Börse,” Irmtraud Busch, head of the works council, wrote in a statement.She added that a merger would endanger the group’s business model and the functionality of Europe’s financial markets.Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext agreed in February on a deal to create the world’s largest stock market operator by sales and profits.Last month, the companies said the deal would save €400m and lift revenues at the combined group by €100m.The planned deal prompted a higher counter-offer by Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental Exchange, which however has been rejected twice by NYSE Euronext on the grounds that a deal would lead to too much debt and more regulatory hurdles.Last month, the chief executives of Nasdaq OMX and ICE publicly called on NYSE Euronext’s shareholders to urge its board to consider their offer.Deutsche Börse’s shareholders, which are unlikely to be influenced by the works council’s opinion, have until mid-July to decide whether they want to swap their shares.NYSE Euronext shareholders will vote on the deal on July 7.The employee representative statement is part of a 100-page strong recommendation by Deutsche Börse’s executive and supervisory boards that is set to be published on Thursday at the group’s annual shareholder meeting.Deutsche Börse strongly rejected the works council’s views.“The statement is neither factual nor in a perspective that matches the understanding of the executive board and the supervisory board . . . The management and supervisory boards recommend the merger explicitly as the best option for all shareholders, clients and financial centres involved and thus also for the employees,” a spokesman said.The works council’s views mirror similar worries about the deal voiced by local politicians and parts of the German press, which fret that the merged group would in the end be dominated by NYSE Euronext and that Frankfurt could lose out as a financial centre.
444;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-10T21:34:05Z;Nasdaq in offer to Paris over NYSE bid;;Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange group, has offered to restore the name “Paris Bourse” to France’s stock market, if it wins the battle for control of NYSE Euronext, current operator of the Paris exchange.The disclosure, by Nasdaq chief executive Bob Greifeld, is the latest twist in an increasingly aggressive effort by Nasdaq and its partner IntercontinentalExchange to persuade NYSE shareholders of the merits of its counter-bid for NYSE Euronext.Nasdaq and ICE are trying to break up a $9.4bn agreed merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, unveiled in mid-February. This week Mr Greifeld met arbitrage hedge funds, as part of a campaign to persuade shareholders to vote against the Deutsche Börse deal.Mr Greifeld and Jeff Sprecher, ICE’s chief executive, have also swept through Europe in recent weeks to sell their deal to regulators and the French and Dutch authorities.Their support for either deal will be crucial, given that the French stock market and Dutch options market are key parts of Euronext, which Mr Greifeld and Mr Sprecher would run if their bid is successful.Mr Greifeld said on Tuesday that he had offered the French authorities to resurrect the Paris Bourse name, which was lost when it was subsumed in the Euronext group of exchanges – including Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon – in 2000.However, he said the response had been muted. “I’m all for it. I went there [to Paris] expecting that we would be universally applauded for that approach, but the response has been more nuanced,” he told the Financial Times.Wooing Paris is important because the French government is keen that market infrastructures such as exchanges and clearing houses be based in Paris as a counterweight to London.Mr Greifeld has pledged to run the European cash equities markets more efficiently than NYSE Euronext, as part of achieving cost synergies of $740m. A combination of OMX, Nasdaq’s existing Nordic markets and the Euronext markets would create “the first and most comprehensive pan-European [cash equities] market”, he has said.Mr Greifeld originally offered to move a large data centre and trading systems built by NYSE Euronext outside London back to Paris. But he said he had all but abandoned this idea after customers told Nasdaq they would not support the move. “It was our hope that we could do that. We have been in intensive dialogue with customers and they are saying we didn’t want that to happen,” he said.Instead Nasdaq was in talks with Clearnet SA, the French arm of UK-based clearing house LCH.Clearnet, about ensuring that clearing of cash equities would stay in Paris.
445;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-10T20:31:46Z;Quick View: How to woo the French?;;Ever since Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange announced their counter-bid for NYSE Euronext, one of the key elements of Nasdaq OMX chief executive’s strategy has been one of paying close attention to Paris.Robert Greifeld said on numerous occasions that it was an option to move the data centre that NYSE Euronext built in Basildon, England (at vast expense) to Paris, effectively moving back to the French capital the trading system that has long been used to handle cash equities on Euronext back to Paris.But as of Tuesday, that idea appeared to be off the table.In an interview, Mr Greifeld said customers expressed that they were not keen on the idea. “It was our hope that we could do that. We have been in intensive dialogue with customers and they are saying they don’t want that to happen.”This is not surprising. Moving the data centre back to Paris – where Euronext’s “UTP” trading platform was before – would entail yet more costly reconfiguration of connections and technology only a few months after banks and brokers did what they had to do to connect up to Basildon. That omelette is made, and can’t be unscrambled, basically.So, how else to please Paris? Because Paris needs to hear how it will benefit from a combined Nasdaq-ICE deal.(And by the way, I understand that Nasdaq-ICE are not making any changes to their cost synergy numbers immediately, just because the data centre issue is not going in Paris’s favour).Mr Greifeld said he had offered the French authorities the restoration of the “Paris Bourse” name, which was abandoned when “NYSE Euronext” became the banner over the markets in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon in 2000.That was a nice touch, and included reverting the Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon exchanges to their original names too. But Mr Greifeld was candid enough to admit that it was met with a lukewarm response. “The input has been more positive on this side of the pond [the US] for changing the names back, more thoughtful in Paris and the other centres,” was how he put it, diplomatically.The fact is, merely re-labelling the Paris exchange does not amount to what the French want: building market infrastructures in Paris.That probably explains why Mr Greifeld is, as he told me, in talks with Clearnet SA, the French arm of LCH.Clearnet, about ensuring that cash equities clearing of French stocks stays in Paris. “We certainly believe a better path for us is to commit to having the clearing business stay in Paris,” he said.With clearing and market structures generally in such flux in Europe, thanks to the Mifid review and the tensions emerging between EU member states over Emir, or the European Market Structures Regulation – Europe’s equivalent of Dodd-Frank when it comes to over-the-counter derivatives and clearing – these issues are central to how things will play out between Deutsche Borse/NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq-ICE with its rival bid.Each side will have to play a very careful game with French, Dutch and other authorities, because there is a lot at stake for certain European capitals in the ultimate outcome – jobs, markets and national pride. And I have not yet got into the issue around Liffe, and whether the NYSE Euronext derivatives exchange would be better in the hands of Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, or under Deutsche Borse (see the current video on FT Trading Room for a discussion of that). Or the Dutch options market, for that matter.Mr Greifeld has spent quality time in Europe of late. That is because while the US analyst and investor community is focused on the US implications of his proposed takeover of NYSE, the European context is arguably just as important. Ditto the European antitrust issues around the Deutsche Borse/NYSE Euronext deal, which I think continue to be underestimated by the US analyst community.Mr Greifeld said Nasdaq-ICE is preparing responses to “a detailed set of questions” that the French authorities have raised (and which I understand have been sent to all four exchange protagonists).He is clearly determined to get the European piece of this sorted out. Not being able to do due diligence on Euronext’s books will continue to be a handicap, as he has indicated on previous analysts calls. So in the meantime he is forced to offer what he can to make this work for various European capitals. Not easy.“With the data centre having moved out of Paris, it makes the job [of building up Paris in a Nasdaq-ICE deal] a little bit harder but certainly not impossible,” he said, adding that Paris is “not as strong a financial centre” as it was before the New York Stock Exchange bought Euronext in 2007.The question then comes back to …how to woo the French?
446;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-09T22:19:20Z;Nasdaq and ICE try to woo arbitrage hedge funds;;Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange have been holding talks with merger arbitrage hedge funds, hoping to get them to vote against NYSE Euronext’s proposed merger with Deutsche Börse, according to people familiar with the talks.Nasdaq and ICE have been talking directly to NYSE shareholders and potential investors after the NYSE board twice rejected formally considering their rival, higher bid for the exchange, moving to press ahead with a shareholder vote for July 7 on merging with Deutsche Börse.A letter sent on Monday addressed to NYSE shareholders from Robert Greifeld and Jeffrey Sprecher, the chiefs of Nasdaq and ICE respectively, argued that NYSE would lose the option of considering the rival bid if stockholders vote to approve the Deutsche Börse merger, which could be blocked by antitrust authorities in Europe. Deutsche Börse has said it does not expect approval for several months or even until next year.“You won’t know on July 7 whether regulatory approvals for the Deutsche Börse transaction can be obtained or, even if obtained, the conditions or remedies regulators may require in order for the transaction to close, which may reduce the value of the combined organisation,” they wrote. “But if the proposed Deutsche Börse transaction is approved by stockholders, it would be impossible to consider our financially superior proposal.”“Demand of your board that they meet with us and at the same time ask them, ‘What’s the rush?’” they wrote.NYSE Euronext declined to comment on the letter. A person close to the company said that NYSE was trying to respect a German law that exchange offers must be made within a certain number of weeks of the announcement of a deal.The Deutsche Börse deal was announced February 15, following a leak in the German press, giving the German exchange until May 4 to make a formal exchange offer to its shareholders. Following that, D Börse shareholders would have until July 12 to tender their shares.Meanwhile, hedge funds have been hesitant to accumulate positions in NYSE even though its shares are trading at roughly a $2 discount to the Nasdaq-ICE offer. They cite regulatory uncertainty with both bids, plus the potential that the German exchange could offer inducements to close the $1bn gap between the value of its all-share offer for NYSE and Nasdaq-ICE’s cash-and-shares offer.Mr Greifeld and Mr Sprecher face some pressure of their own to improve their bid to clinch shareholder support, which they will likely address in their meeting with some 60 hedge funds on Monday. They have also been asked by some investors to detail the financing agreements to fund their bid.The two have already offered a $350m reverse breakup fee and have challenged the additional cost savings NYSE and Deutsche Börse have claimed to narrow the gap between the prospective gains offered by the two bids.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant and Helen Thomas
447;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-08T17:29:51Z;NYSE Euronext investors play waiting game;;Investors looking to profit from competing bids for NYSE Euronext are hesitant to build large positions until closer to a July shareholder vote on its agreed tie-up with Deutsche Börse.NYSE’s board has twice rejected a higher, rival offer by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange.Nasdaq and ICE have pursued shareholders to solicit the board to reconsider, and have said they intend to make a formal hostile offer.That is also meant to draw arbitrage hedge funds, which seek to profit from the gap between NYSE’s share price and the Nasdaq-ICE offer by buying shares below the value of Nasdaq-ICE’s bid and voting against the Deutsche Börse deal.But many hedge funds are not yet heeding the call in great numbers.They cite the likelihood that Deutsche Börse may offer inducements to close the 11 per cent gap – as of Friday’s close – between the offers, in addition to uncertainty over how regulators will view the two deals.One hedge fund manager, who has already acquired a small position, said: “I’m not going to buy any more shares, and not many other people are either. The tender offer doesn’t address the fundamental antitrust issues. There’s no way this deal is going to close by July, and probably not even by year-end. There’s plenty of time.”The NYSE share price bears out this ambivalence. At $40.09, it is roughly at the midpoint of the two bids, with the Nasdaq-ICE offer at roughly $42 and the Deutsche Börse swap valued at about $38 at Friday’s close.Hedge fund managers pointed to last year’s battle for car rental company Dollar Thrifty. In this case, an agreed deal with Hertz and an interloper proposal from Avis both threatened to require stringent review by competition authorities, making some arbitrage investors cautious.Shareholders voted down Dollar Thrifty’s deal with Hertz last September but, nearly 10 months later, the company is still working with regulators on a possible combination with Avis, leaving investors’ payout still in doubt.Jeffery Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, told analysts last week that the Deutsche Börse merger would “definitely fail” if voted on by NYSE shareholders today.Several large institutions have come out in support of further exploring Nasdaq-ICE’s bid, citing the price gap.He also said NYSE did not do enough to inform shareholders that May 9 would be the last day they could acquire shares and vote in July, known as the record date.A person close to NYSE said it made that date clear in an electronic bulletin.According to another person close to NYSE, only about 10-15 per cent of the shares are held by arbitrage hedge funds, though sources close to Nasdaq and ICE say hedge funds may own closer to 20 per cent.Some investors agreed that the Deutsche Börse-NYSE deal could fail a shareholder vote today because of the value gap, potential moves in the share prices or value of the euro, and because there will not be certainty from regulators, especially in Europe.In a filing this week, Deutsche Börse said it did not expect a formal reply from antitrust authorities until at least next year.However, that may not be enough to draw in arbitrage funds to advocate for Nasdaq-ICE.“Many investors, even if they think [Deutsche Börse-NYSE] is a better deal, cannot make the decision to take the lower offer,” said Georges Ugeux, chairman of Galileo Global Advisors and a former NYSE executive and Deutsche Börse adviser. “But whatever the picture is we have today, it is not relevant. There is too much uncertainty.”Rick Wetmore, portfolio manager with Turner Investments, which owns shares in several exchanges, said: “I think the changes that need to be made by NYSE and Deutsche to appease shareholders are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things.”
448;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-06T09:40:23Z;Lessons for exchanges in oil’s ‘flash crash’;Crude price rout has damaged the reputation of the oil market;The $10-plus rout in oil markets on Thursday has not only brought some big losses to bull investors, it has also damaged the reputation of the oil market. It is ironic that the sell-off happened on the eve of the first anniversary of the equity markets “flash-crash” of 2010.One can look for answers for the rout – the US dollar, fears about economic slowdown, a sell-off in silver, a calmer Middle East after the death of Osama bin Laden, etc. – but the truth is that there is not an easy fundamental reason to explain why oil prices dropped more than $10 in a single day.Over the next few weeks the market will look for its real level. In the meantime, the rout leaves some lessons: oil markets lack effective “circuit breakers” and daily fluctuations limits to manage a panic sell-off, like the one witnessed on Thursday.The New York Mercantile Exchange, owned by the CME Group and home of the popular West Texas Intermediate contracts, has a daily fluctuation limit of $10. After hitting it, trading stops for a while, before resuming and in theory allowing calmer responses. But there are no limits on the last hour of open-outcry trading, which is precisely when the sell-off gathered pace on Thursday. As such, the limit for the after-hours market on the Globex electronic platform was set at a ridiculously wide $20.Worse, ICE Futures Europe, owned by Atlanta-based InterContinental Exchange and home of the benchmark Brent contract, does not have any fluctuation limit at all, so short of an emergency shutdown, prices could fluctuate wildly. That is just plainly wrong.Both exchanges need to revisit their policies: fluctuation limits, both up and down, and circuit breakers are as necessary in commodities markets as they are in equities.Commodities regulators should force them to do something if they do not act soon. The exchanges’ defence is that Thursday’s trading was orderly, a seller was there for every buyer. And yes, that is true. But there was unnecessary panic and distressed forced-selling. We have seen the same problem on the way up, when relatively small geopolitical hiccups have triggered excessive price hikes.With the G20 looking at the commodities markets, a pre-emptive response from the exchanges would be wise. Circuit breakers and a narrower daily fluctuation limit –perhaps set at $5 a barrel –would be helpful.
449;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-05T18:51:46Z;CME launches London clearing house;;CME Group is considering offering clearing services to exchanges in Europe as the largest US futures exchange establishes a beachhead in the region by launching a new clearing house in London on Friday.The move into clearing in Europe highlights the Chicago-based operator’s ambitions to expand into Europe, where CME’s two biggest rivals, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and Deutsche Börse, have established clearing businesses.It comes as clearing has been thrown into flux amid a wave of exchange mergers. The CME’s move to start clearing in London also comes a month after LCH.Clearnet, the dominant clearer in the UK, launched clearing of over-the-counter derivatives in the US in competition with the CME.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, stepping in to guarantee that trades are completed even if one party defaults.CME Clearing Europe, the US group’s London-based clearing house, will start by clearing in 153 OTC commodity contracts such as WTI and Brent crude swaps, freight forwards and swaps on rapeseed oil, which is used in food and cosmetics and in making biodiesel.This pits the CME against ICE, which has offered clearing in similar Brent and WTI swaps for some years on ICE Clear Europe, also based in London.Andrew Lamb, chief executive of CME Clearing Europe, conceded there was a “large overlap” between his business and that of ICE. “There’s no doubt that we are a head-to-head alternative to ICE Clear Europe. But the absolute intention is to expand that initial range [of products] into other areas.”He said the launch of CME’s London clearer meant there were now two competitors for ICE in the US and Europe, including CME’s existing US clearing house.Mr Lamb said that CME Clearing Europe aimed to offer “as complete a range of clearing services” in Europe as CME already does in the US”.“There would also be nothing stopping us clearing for third party exchanges. We’d definitely be open to that,” Mr Lamb said.Speculation has been rife that CME wants to poach the business of clearing trades at the London Metal Exchange from LCH.Clearnet. Mr Lamb declined to comment. The LME this week said it was studying setting up its own clearing house.CME initially applied to the UK regulator, the Financial Services Authority, to set up a clearer in London to clear credit default swaps. But last year CME changed tack, saying it would start clearing OTC energy and commodity contracts.The switch came as ICE grabbed the lion’s share of CDS clearing in the US and Europe. But last week ICE was hit with an antitrust probe from the competition authorities in Brussels, which is investigating special profit-sharing arrangements and preferential tariffs it granted to nine banks with which it is involved in clearing.Mr Lamb said CDS clearing was still on the agenda and it was possible that CME Clearing Europe could launch CDS clearing for non-banks users of such products this year. “We haven’t lost track of financial OTC derivatives, they are absolutely on the radar.”CME Clearing Europe will launch with 15 members, including Bache Commodities, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, futures brokers MF Global and Newedge, RBS and UBS.
450;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-05T14:53:32Z;Cleartrade rules out creating integrated bourse;;Cleartrade Exchange, a start-up commodities bourse, has ruled out joining the London Metal Exchange in mulling the creation of an integrated exchange encompassing trading and clearing.The two-year old group, which is regulated in Singapore, is looking to muscle in on the fast-growing over-the-counter (OTC) commodity derivatives markets, particularly freight and metals.The group’s comments come amid increasing debate among exchanges around the world over whether it should create a “vertical silo” model, an industry term that refers to an exchange that controls both the trading of assets, especially derivatives, and the clearing of them.“I don’t see it as a utopia,” Richard Baker, chief executive of Cleartrade told FT Trading Room. “I understand some of the cost mitigations but I don’t see the benefit for the trading principals.”A vertical silo potentially gives exchange operators the power to keep lucrative contracts and revenue in-house while allowing users to net trades, thus saving on collateral costs, as well as cut IT connection costs.The debate was given fresh impetus this week after Martin Abbott, chief executive of the London Metal Exchange (LME), said the bourse was looking at building its own clearing house “in a world where the horizontal clearing model is being steadily eroded.”Market participants such as banks and interdealer brokers have opposed silos because they wield pricing power over them, derived from control of a clearing house that also helps prevent rivals from offering competing products. Mr Baker said that the freight market was a broker-led market and an integrated exchange would diminish that role.“We hear strong reactions to the IntercontinentalExchange and CME model,” said Mr Baker, who felt the main obstruction in the market was clearing houses not opening up to each other to allow investors a choice over where their trades are cleared – so-called interoperability.“If the clearing houses found a way to interconnect, the argument for the vertical model would soon fall away,” Mr Baker said.Cleartrade connects to three clearing houses. LCH.Clearnet, SGX and Nos Clearing, a Norwegian specialist commodities clearing house, but none as yet interoperate.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, stepping in to ensure that a deal goes ahead even if one party defaults. Regulators in Washington and Brussels are keen for central counterparty clearing in the market in order to reduce the risk traditionally associated with such trades.However many of the world’s largest exchanges, such as CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and NYSE Euronext are already already moving to their integrated transactions and clearing services.
451;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-05T01:52:32Z;ICE steps up attack on deal rival;;Intercontinental Exchange, the US exchange operator, intensified its campaign to take control of NYSE Euronext’s futures business with a blistering attack on a rival bid by Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, which it characterised as “absurd”, “risky” and full of “empty promises”.ICE teamed up with Nasdaq OMX last month to launch an $11bn cash-and-stock offer for NYSE Euronext, attempting to break up an agreed friendly merger between NYSE and Deutsche Börse.ICE and Nasdaq are offering a higher price to buy NYSE with the aim of splitting its futures and equities exchanges between them, giving ICE control of Liffe, the London-based futures exchange. NYSE’s board has rejected the proposal twice, calling it an “empty vessel”.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, hit back on Wednesday, saying: “It’s understandable why NYSE Euronext’s response has been focused on attacking our superior proposal,” he said.“The alternative is to acknowledge and address the serious deficiencies in the Deutsche Börse takeover.”He made his remarks as ICE reported first-quarter net income of $129m, or $1.74 per share, up from $101m, or $1.36 per share, in the prior year quarter.Excluding extraordinary items, net profit was $131m, or $1.77 per share, above analysts’ average forecasts of about $1.69 per share.Mr Sprecher revealed he had first been in talks almost 10 years ago about buying a stake in Liffe – which was acquired in 2002 by Euronext, which was in turn bought by NYSE in 2007 – but had been unable to strike a deal.The ICE chief said that while he wanted to run Liffe as a viable business in its own right, under the Deutsche Börse bid it would “likely be gutted and for all intents and purposes moved to Frankfurt to be subsumed as part of a European product set within the Deutsche Börse”.His comments came as Deutsche Börse published its offer to its investors to tender their shares in return for shares in a Dutch holding company being created for the merger with NYSE Euronext.The deal needs holders of at least 75 per cent of the German group’s shares to approve it. It also needs regulatory clearance by March 2012 from the European Union, as well as authorities in the US, Germany and seven other countries.Investors can tender their shares until July 13, by which time NYSE shareholders are expected to have voted on whether to approve the merger plans.However, Mr Sprecher said it was “absurd” to imply that the combined entity – which would be based in the Netherlands – would be a US company. “Billions of dollars worth of NYSE stock could be dumped on the market by its current institutional shareholders as a result of this new status,” he claimed.ICE shares were down 1.4 per cent at $114.85 in New York.FT Trading Room
452;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
453;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-03T14:31:31Z;LME mulls building own clearing house;;The London Metal Exchange is looking at building its own clearing house to boost earnings as the exchange moves to counter the growing threat of global competition from the US and Asia.The LME’s announcement, made in a notice to members on Tuesday, is a potential blow to LCH.Clearnet, the LME’s long-standing clearing house. If the LME goes ahead with the plan, it would bring it into line with many of its rivals and give it control over launching new products.Martin Abbott, chief executive, acknowledged the study into building its own clearing house was driven by a fast-changing market “in a world where the horizontal clearing model is being steadily eroded.”The move comes at a time when the LME is facing a challenge from metals trading in China, especially Shanghai. The UK group opened an office in Singapore last year and expanded its trading hours to attract the Asian market. It also comes in the same week that the new London-based clearing house of CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, will begin clearing its first products in Europe.“After several months of feasibility studies, we have reached the point at which deeper examination of the issues requires some discussion in the public arena,” Mr Abbott said in a notice to members. “In addition it should be noted that we believe self-clearing would also be accretive to earnings at the LME,” he said.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, steppng in to ensure that a deal goes ahead even if one party defaults. Regulators in Washington and Brussels are keen for central counterparty clearing in the market in order to reduce the risk traditionally associated with such trades.Private companies like CME and IntercontinentalExchange hope ownership of their own clearing house will better enable them to compete globally for business in clearing privately-negotiated derivatives.Building its own clearing house would bring LME into line with other exchanges, which are either already offering integrated transactions and clearing services. CME and ICE have their own clearing houses while NYSE Euronext has already put LCH.Clearnet on notice that it is also building its own model.An integrated model offers traders cheaper IT costs and the ability to net trades, leading to large savings in collateral and other costs. The exchange can introduce new products much more quickly. In the past it has been reliant on whether LCH has been ready.The LME said it would begin consulting with shareholders, members and other stakeholders before a final decision was made. No deadline had been set, it added.LCH.Clearnet said it had not received notice from the LME about withdrawing from its relationship. “We value our relationship with the LME and shall continue to provide the LME and its members with an excellent service and the benefit of our unique experience in clearing for this complex market, we are a leader in commodities clearing globally,” said Ian Axe, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet. LME owns an eight per cent stake in LCH.
454;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;LME mulls building own clearing house;;The London Metal Exchange is looking at building its own clearing house to boost earnings as the group moves to counter the growing threat of global competition from the US and Asia.The LME’s announcement, made in a notice to members on Tuesday, is a potential blow to LCH.Clearnet, the LME’s long-standing clearing house. If the LME goes ahead with the plan, it would bring it into line with many of its rivals and give it control over launching new products.Martin Abbott, chief executive, acknowledged that the study into building its own clearing house was driven by a fast-changing market “in a world where the horizontal clearing model is being steadily eroded”.The move comes at a time when the LME is facing a challenge from metals trading in China, especially Shanghai. The UK group opened an office in Singapore last year and expanded its trading hours to attract the Asian market. It also comes in the same week that the new London-based clearing house of CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, will begin clearing its first products in Europe.“After several months of feasibility studies, we have reached the point at which deeper examination of the issues requires some discussion in the public arena,” Mr Abbott said in the notice to members. “In addition it should be noted that we believe self-clearing would also be accretive to earnings at the LME.”A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, stepping in to ensure that a deal goes ahead even if one party defaults. Regulators in Washington and Brussels are keen for central counterparty clearing in the market to reduce the risk traditionally associated with such trades.Building its own clearing house would bring LME into line with other exchanges. CME and ICE have their own clearing houses while NYSE Euronext has already put LCH.Clearnet on notice that it is also building its own model.The LME said it would begin consulting with shareholders, members and other stakeholders before a final decision was made.

455;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-03T09:20:26Z;Nasdaq and ICE to go hostile on NYSE bid;;Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange have confirmed they plan to make a hostile bid for NYSE Euronext, as the pair attempts to derail the US exchange’s agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.Nasdaq and ICE said on Monday that they intended to launch an offer for the exchange this month, and that the two boards had approved a plan to take its $11bn cash-and-stock break-up bid directly to NYSE shareholders.In April, the exchanges proposed to split the NYSE’s equities and futures businesses, just weeks after NYSE Euronext had agreed an all-stock merger with Deutsche Börse. NYSE’s board has twice rejected the rival proposal, which offers a higher price than the Deutsche Börse bid, calling it an “empty vessel”.Nasdaq and ICE are offering $14.24 in cash, 0.4069 shares of Nasdaq OMX common stock and 0.1436 shares of ICE common stock for each share in NYSE Euronext.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, said: “The NYSE Euronext board has continually challenged the seriousness of our proposal and refused to engage us in discussion despite the positive feedback we have received from their stockholders.”The US bourse on Monday noted that the Nasdaq-ICE’s offer would be launched on the same terms as previously proposed, adding that these had been “unanimously rejected” by its board.People close to the NYSE camp played down the significance of their rivals’ move, arguing that shareholders were already aware of the choice they faced in considering the two proposals ahead of a July vote on the Deutsche Börse deal.As a publicly listed exchange, the NYSE has certain limits on ownership and voting rights, which could make it difficult for Nasdaq and ICE to close a hostile offer, the people added.One party cannot own more than 20 per cent of the exchange, or have more than 10 per cent of the outstanding votes. As the limits must be waived by the board, they impose a condition on Nasdaq/ICE’s exchange offer, effectively functioning as a type of poison pill.Analysts at Raymond James noted this and other conditions to the Nasdaq/ICE offer. “We believe the laundry list of conditions attached to the offer virtually guarantee that it will never be executed,” they wrote.Once Nasdaq and ICE start their offer, the NYSE board will be legally obliged to respond, perhaps offering in more detail its reasons for rejecting the counterbid.Launching the offer could also mean Nasdaq and ICE will have to disclose more information about their bid.The pair have not yet made public the details of their financing commitments.People familiar with Nasdaq’s thinking said the formal launch of the offer would take some time to execute, perhaps a week or two.Yet, the company wanted to make clear its intentions ahead of a deadline this week that will determine who can vote in July on the Deutsche Börse deal.
456;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-05-01T22:04:50Z;Drop in dollar boosts exchange merger;;NYSE Euronext has found some unexpected support for its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse– the sharp drop in the US dollar is propping up the value of the stock-based deal, which is under assault from a counterbid by Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange.Since NYSE and the German exchange unveiled their plan in February, the euro has gained almost 10 per cent against the US currency, boosting NYSE’s implied value under the merger and roughly halving the premium in the Nasdaq-led counterbid.As NYSE investors gear up for a July vote on a more than $10bn deal with Deutsche Börse, the shrinking gap between the headline value of the two options is likely to play a role in their thinking, bankers say. At the same time, the slimmer margin could prompt Nasdaq and ICE, which have yet formally to launch a hostile tender offer, to move more quickly.The dollar has fallen to its lowest level against the euro since December 2009, helping to counterbalance a drop in Deutsche Börse shares.However, in the past few days, the German bourse’s shares have recovered ground, also helping to boost the value of the pair’s all-stock merger. At about $39, the implied value of a NYSE share under the Deutsche Börse deal is back to where it was when the deal was announced.At current share prices, the mooted cash-and-stock offer from Nasdaq and ICE is worth about 9 per cent more per share than the Deutsche Börse merger proposal, according to Financial Times calculations, down from a 19 per cent premium when the counterbid was announced at the beginning of April.Had the dollar not moved against the euro since the merger was announced on February 15, that margin would be about 20 per cent.People close to the NYSE camp argue that their merger represents the chance to own 40 per cent of a larger, more diversified global exchange, rather than a per share value.The falling dollar has also helped balance out the cost savings and revenue opportunities. NYSE has said it could find €500m ($740m) in benefits from the deal. At current exchange rates, that puts the proposal neck-and-neck with Nasdaq/ICE’s $740m in synergies.The dollar’s slump comes as the Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, last week tried to reassure markets that the central bank would remain vigilant in guarding against inflation, as it starts to remove its extraordinary policies to stimulate the economy.However, the greenback continued to slide last week on investor concerns and in the wake of weaker-than-expected economic growth numbers.“Ben Bernanke is an important person in this deal,” commented one person close to Nasdaq and ICE.Additional reporting by Telis Demos
457;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;How clearing helped ICE reinforce ties with banks;;In one of the attempts to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis that shook Wall Street and the City to their foundations, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic trained their sights on the freewheeling credit default swaps market.One of the chief solutions they settled on was to move trading of these complex derivatives contracts away from private dealers to a central clearing house, where they could be better monitored.Now, an investigation launched by the European Commission on Friday suggests that regulators fear their efforts may have succeeded too well.Authorities are probing whether the company that has risen to become the continent’s dominant credit default swaps clearing house, ICE Clear Europe – a division of Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange – ran afoul of its competition laws. Of particular interest to investigators are the special fees ICE granted to nine large banks to lock them in as customers.In a related investigation, the Commission is also examining whether a British firm, Markit, has abused its position as the leading provider of information about credit default swaps.Markit is partly owned by 16 of the largest global investment banks, and may have used preferential pricing and other financial data from them to shut out competitors such as Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg, Commission officials say.Markit said it did not believe it had engaged in any inappropriate activity.The investigations mark the latest blow for a fast-growing market that many European politicians have already blamed for exacerbating the sovereign debt crisis that has threatened the euro.Credit default swaps were created to protect investors in the event that a company or government defaulted on a bond. They have since become a popular speculative opportunity for hedge funds and other investors, who propelled their growth.But in the ICE case, in particular, EU officials acknowledge that they risk being perceived as seeking to tear down the very thing they were once asking companies to build.A legislative proposal issued in September by Michel Barnier, the internal market commissioner, explicitly called for many derivatives contracts to be traded through a central clearing house – rather than between parties directly – to limit the risks of default and bring greater stability to the market.“No financial market can afford to remain a Wild West territory,” Mr Barnier said at the time.His counterpart, Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner, argues that while a single, large clearing house may be the best arrangement for the broader financial system, it is for the market to determine which company prevails in the fight to build one.“Lack of transparency in markets can lead to abusive behaviour,” Mr Almunia said. “I hope our investigation will contribute to a better functioning of financial markets.”ICE has declined to comment. The investigation will cast new scrutiny on the work of Jeff Sprecher, IntercontinentalExchange’s down-to-earth founder.Several larger competitors, such as CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange by trading volumes, and Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, have vied to build their own credit default swaps clearing houses.But Mr Sprecher edged them out. In the two years since his company launched ICE, it has mopped up most of the market, clearing contracts in the US and Europe with a total notional value of $17,500bn, out of a total market of $22,000bn.Mr Sprecher was able to outplay far bigger exchange groups in part because he had developed a close relationship with the big Wall Street banks that control the credit default swaps market and which had backed ICE’s creation.In large measure, the relationship was based on ICE not trying to change the market, as others attempted.CME, for example, created an electronic platform for swaps trading in collaboration with Citadel, a venture it eventually abandoned because of lack of interest from dealers.Instead, ICE focused on clearing swaps contracts via a profit-sharing arrangement with the dealers, a move that satisfied the demands of regulators to remove counterparty risk from the sector, while allowing banks to continue operating much as they had been before.Credit default swaps clearing is not a great money-spinner: it earned ICE a profit of about $15m last year, with a similar amount going to the dealers.However, it strengthened ICE’s ties with the big banks – a useful thing for a company seeking to pick up other clearing business.Additional reporting by David Oakley in London
458;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-29T18:14:56Z;Brussels opens CDS antitrust probes;;The European Commission has opened sweeping antitrust investigations into some of the biggest players in the credit default swaps market, including ICE, the industry’s leading clearing house.The investigations, launched by Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner, open a new chapter in the commission’s attempts to bring to heel a market for exotic securities that played a central role in the financial crisis that brought down leading Wall Street investment banks and required hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded bail-outs.In the first of two investigations, the commission is examining whether Markit, a British company that provides pricing and other financial information necessary to trade credit default swaps, colluded with 16 banks to dominate the market and edge out competitors such as Thomson-Reuters and Bloomberg.The second investigation centres on Intercontinental Exchange’s European clearing business, ICE Clear Europe, and whether special profit-sharing arrangements and preferential tariffs it granted to nine of those banks in effect closed them off from doing business with competing clearing houses.The banks include some of the world’s largest financial institutions – Bank of America Corporation, Barclays Bank, Citigroup, Credit Suisse Group, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and UBS. All declined to comment.US authorities began a similar probe last year. Mr Almunia said the investigations were intended to improve transparency and fairness in the market.“CDS play a useful role for financial markets and for the economy. Recent developments have shown, however, that the trading of this asset class suffers a number of inefficiencies that cannot be solved through regulation alone,” he said.ICE declined to comment, but Markit said it did not believe it had engaged in any inappropriate activity, adding: “Markit has no exclusive arrangements with any data provider and makes its data and related products widely available to global market participants.”Credit defaults swaps are a form of derivatives contract that was originally created to give investors protection in case a party defaulted.Yet, they have grown rapidly in recent years as speculative investments – something that has worried policymakers, who fear that regulatory scrutiny has not kept pace.The investigation marks a setback for G20 efforts to reform the vast over the counter derivatives market.Central to that effort was regulators’ insistence that previously unregulated derivatives be processed through clearing houses to minimise the risk to the broader financial system in the event of another big default, like that of Lehman Brothers in 2008.That policy sparked a race among big exchanges such as ICE, CME Group and Deutsche Börse to be the first to create clearing services for credit default swaps.
459;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-29T13:02:58Z;Quick View: Unintended consequences of swap reform;;It all seemed to be going so well for G20 regulators.For the past year, most of the credit default swaps (CDS) market has been cleared through clearinghouses, as the New York Fed and European Commission insisted should happen back in 2009.Remember how much pressure the industry came under to do this.IntercontinentalExchange was first out of the gate in building a CDS clearing offering, when Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE’s chief executive, decided that the way to do this would be to “mutualise” with the dealer banks to get the job done.Now that has come back to bite him and the banks, with collateral damage felt by Markit, a key cog in the pricing of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.But we should bear in mind that this is not as simple as regulators versus dealers.These are antitrust regulators, quite different from the regulators that are forcing dealers to trade and clear OTC derivatives on exchanges and swap execution facilities (SEFs) , and through clearing houses.The latter regulators, under the G20 protocol and the new Dodd-Frank reforms, forced the industry – exchanges, dealers and clearers – to start clearing CDS as a matter of urgency, under pressure of a deadline.What this antitrust intervention shows is that no one gave any thought to how the dealers might manage to take advantage of the situation by being part of new market structures where they could make profits – and in a fashion that is not transparent, if what Brussels alleges is the case.Also, in their rush to force the industry to do all this, the regulators allowed a winner-take-all situation to emerge, whereby ICE and the banks grabbed the whole CDS clearing market.It is that situation that the Brussels antitrust regulators have pounced on.What it shows is the massive unintended consequence of forcing through massive change to markets without giving enough though to just what kind of new market structures would result.
460;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-28T22:28:33Z;NYSE and D Börse trumpet profits;;"NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse highlighted their “financial flexibility” and ability to control costs in their quarterly results in an effort to rebut claims by rivals trying to break up their plan to merge.However, growth in technology services failed to keep up with the groups’ lofty ambitions for it to be a $1bn-revenue segment.NYSE, which is refusing so far to consider a rival approach from Nasdaq OMX and the Intercontinental Exchange, earned $155m in net income in the first quarter, compared with $130m a year ago. Stripping out one-off costs, including expenses related to the Deutsche Börse merger plans, net income rose 26 per cent to $177m.In presenting NYSE’s results, Mr Niederauer trumpeted declining costs. Nasdaq and ICE have argued that NYSE and D Börse have historically not done a good job of controlling costs, which resulted in writedowns after their respective acquisitions of Euronext and the International Securities Exchange.NYSE said its expenses of $415m had declined 3 per cent versus the first quarter of last year and 2 per cent versus the fourth quarter last year. Mr Niederauer, speaking to shareholders, said that capital expenditure would be less than $200m this year.“A lot of our capex was to finance the building of data centres, and it is returning to more normal levels,” he said.Mr Niederauer also said that the cost reduction was even more dramatic than the figures showed because NYSE had been spending heavily in recent years on its New York Portfolio Clearing and NYSE Liffe US futures businesses, as well as on developing the Amex Options trading floor.Meanwhile, Deutsche Börse said its net income for the same quarter rose 36 per cent to €213m and also cut its cost guidance for the year, saying it had been able to speed up implementation of efficiency measures.The German group said it expected operating costs this year to come in at €890m, €35m lower than previously outlined. Gregor Pottmeyer, chief financial officer, said: “Our progress since we announced our efficiency measures in the first quarter of 2010 has exceeded expectations.”Mr Niederauer said of the two groups: “It’s actually not a one-hit wonder, it’s a continuation of everything we’ve been doing for the last couple of years.""As a result of their falling expenses, NYSE also said its ratio of debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell to 1.8 times, its lowest level since NYSE acquired Paris-based Euronext in 2007.This was critical, Mr Niederauer said, because it would allow the combined group to pay more than $1.2bn in dividends in the year following the deal. This would help close the existing 12 per cent gap between the value of the Nasdaq-ICE cash-and-shares offer and Deutsche Börse’s offer, though neither NYSE nor DB has yet committed to any specific measures.“We have more financial flexibility than anyone in the industry [to pursue] buy-backs and dividends, or to be able to invest in new growth opportunities around the world,” he said.Nasdaq-ICE have said this highlights execution risks with the Deutsche Börse merger, and said shareholders should prefer the offer with more value upfront. Some institutions and individual shareholders have said they want more consideration of the higher offer, though debate is still ranging on antitrust barriers to the competing proposals.Mr Niederauer also highlighted NYSE Liffe US, the newly launched futures platform, which he said “illustrated the strategy” at the heart of the DB-NYSE merger by combining multi-asset class exchange groups.NYSE Liffe US has 100,000 contracts of open interest eurodollar futures as of this week, NYSE said on Thursday, though that is still a tiny fraction of what dominant competitor CME Group has.Analysts were disappointed to see a near-flat result in NYSE’s technology business versus the fourth quarter as they were expecting a sequential gain larger than the 2 per cent achieved, from $114m to $116m.Mr Niederauer has highlighted this business – which he said could generate more revenue than the targeted $1bn in 2015 after the merger – as a reason to oppose Nasdaq-ICE’s plan, which would probably cut the unit sharply and possibly close a data centre to save costs.“While this revenue can be a bit lumpy, we had expected to see a pick-up related to the firm’s two new data centres,” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, in a note. NYSE said that the first quarter is seasonally slow for technology sales and said they had just signed a new “tier one financial services” customer.Gross transactions revenue at NYSE Euronext rose 7 per cent in the quarter versus the same period last year, to $815m. Revenues net of rebates and other fees was $679m, a rise of 5 per cent. Derivatives and cash trading and listings contributed equally to the rise, though rising volumes in US derivatives and European cash equities counterbalanced a drop in volumes in European derivatives and US cash.Nasdaq OMX this quarter saw its net revenues rise, thanks to a big boost in US options, but gross transactions revenue fell due to a steep decline in US equities. Net revenue grew year-over-year, however, due to a reduction in rebates and fees."
461;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-28T20:53:24Z;D Börse backs NYSE synergy claims;;Deutsche Börse executives, including chief executive Reto Francioni, have for the first time publicly backed statements by Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext CEO, that at least €100m of extra synergies can be extracted from their planned merger.That will quiet speculation that NYSE and Deutsche Börse had not previously agreed on what cuts to make, which could be a politically sensitive issue if job cuts are concentrated in one country in Europe or in the US.It also served to highlight what both executives consider to be a core of their vision, a global multi-asset trading exchange group that can cross-sell products in new markets and slash costs by using each others’ technologies.That vision has also been heavily criticised by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, who have made a counter-offer to buy NYSE Euronext and split its futures and equities exchanges and combine with their own similar businesses. They have said that shareholders should be “sceptical” of the discovery of new cost cuts.Mr Francioni, speaking to analysts on Thursday, said: “Following the work conducted by joint teams …we were able to increase our initial synergy estimates … to a new synergy target of at least €500m.”Executives on both sides of the Atlantic highlighted the trading platform as an area of additional savings. Gregor Pottmeyer, DB’s chief financial officer, told analysts that about half of the extra savings would stem from technology synergies. “We are now confident we can develop a common trading and clearing infrastructure, he said.That is potentially significant, since the view from both companies so far has been that derivatives trading would probably be conducted through Deutsche Börse’s Eurex system, while NYSE Euronext’s Universal Trading Platform, or UTP, would be the choice for cash equities.At the NYSE Euronext annual meeting in New York, Mr Niederauer also detailed areas of cost savings, which he said the two groups had delayed studying in detail because they wanted to prevent leaks of the deal.But he said decisions had not been made on exactly how to combine the platforms. In addition to UTP and Eurex, platforms in use by the two groups include Xetra, in European cash equities, and Optimise, recently launched by the International Securities Exchange, the US options exchange owned by Deutsche Börse.“What trading platform you will get is not exactly UTP, not exactly Optimise, not exactly Xetra, not exactly Eurex. It will be a common platform, with pieces from each of those. It won’t feel like a heavy lift or big migration,” said Mr Niederauer.One definite commonality, he said, would be the customer-facing gateway, even if the trade matching engines are still somewhat split. “People get very emotional about technology they’ve built. What you have to try to focus on, there are no winners and losers,” he said.Mr Niederauer also defended NYSE Euronext’s technology strategy, of building data centres in Mahwah, New Jersey, and Basildon, England, and selling infrastructure services to a small group of exchanges. That is in contrast to Nasdaq OMX’s business, which involves selling software but not data services to hundreds of exchanges and financial services groups.“We’re not trying to be the matching engine provider to every exchange in the world,” Mr Niederauer said, in an oblique reference to his rival. “That’s quantity not quality.” He revealed that NYSE had signed up a “truly tier one financial services company” to buy infrastructure products.Both Mr Niederauer and Mr Francioni said that while NYSE’s US data centres would remain, a data centre in Europe could be closed. Mr Niederauer was delicate on this point, and said: “Our friends at Deutsche Börse have nothing like Mahwah, but in Europe it’s a little harder. As proud as we are of Basildon, they are also proud of what they have in Frankfurt,” he said.Mr Francioni also said the groups would be “creating one market operations hub for derivatives, equities, and clearing business in Europe, and one for derivatives in the US”. He further promised an “extended realigning of corporate services, as well as . . adjusting management functions across the entire group”.Mr Pottmeyer gave as examples scope for further savings on purchasing, insurance and property portfolios, and said 30 per cent of the extra savings identified were to do with the combined group’s corporate centres.
462;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-28T20:05:42Z;Deutsche Börse and NYSE stand by deal terms;;"The chief executives of Deutsche Börse and NYSE have rebuffed calls to reconsider the terms of their merger plans while giving more details of the costs they intend to save through their deal.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE chief executive, on Thursday faced down calls at the group’s annual meeting for the board to reconsider its two-time rejection of a joint cash-and-shares offer by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, valued at about 12 per cent more than the Deutsche Börse merger.Meanwhile, Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse chief executive, endorsed a recent estimate by Mr Niederauer that the cost savings from the deal could be €400m ($592m) rather than the €300m previously highlighted.Speaking to analysts in Frankfurt, Mr Francioni said the companies were working on how to achieve more revenue synergies. They hope the promise of further savings may help fend off the approach from Nasdaq and ICE.At the meeting in New York, Mr Niederauer responded to individual shareholders who suggested the German group contribute 0.5 shares per share of the combined entity, rather than the current 0.47 ratio.“If we push that ratio too far and the other side doesn’t get the vote, I’d hate to miss out on the accelerating opportunity [of the Deutsche Börse merger] because we got a touch greedy,” he said.Mr Francioni said in Frankfurt: “We believe that the structure and terms are very attractive to both sets of shareholders. We stand by the terms.”Deutsche Börse will require 75 per cent shareholder approval, versus the 50 per cent needed by NYSE Euronext.Also on Thursday, NYSE reported first-quarter earnings per share of 68 cents, versus 54 cents a year ago; Deutsche Börse said earnings were €1.14 per share, versus €0.84 a year ago. Both said the results were driven by stronger derivatives revenues and lower costs. Expenses are a sensitive issue, as Nasdaq-ICE have argued that their rivals are not efficient at controlling costs.Mr Niederauer also highlighted his group’s falling leverage ratio, which he said will enable the group to pay large dividends and close the value gap with the rival offer; it also served to illustrate DB-NYSE’s argument that Nasdaq is too heavily indebted to take on its rival.Echoing comments earlier this week by Mr Niederauer, Mr Francioni said the group also promised more savings for customers.“Consolidating clearing services is expected to provide efficiencies in the range of several billion euros per year,” he said.After questions from shareholders about the nationality of the new group, NYSE said the companies would reveal the composition of the board before July 7, when NYSE shareholders will asked to vote on the merger. Membership will reflect discussions with European regulators who want to have national representatives on the board, highlighting the political risks involved in the deal."
463;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-28T16:53:47Z;CME criticises NYSE-DB merger plan;The biggest US futures exchange group vowed that the bidding war over NYSE Euronext would not deter it from its strategy of expanding its business internationally;CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, vowed that the bidding war over NYSE Euronext – which has pitted two of CME’s main rivals against each other – would not deter it from its strategy of expanding its business internationally.NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have agreed a friendly merger that would create a powerful transatlantic exchange, while Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental Exchange want to break up that deal and buy NYSE with the aim of splitting up its futures and equities exchanges.CME, which has undertaken two large exchange takeovers in recent years, has declined to be drawn into making a bid for NYSE. The group insisted on Thursday that it was committed instead to link-ups with international exchanges that enable traders in other countries to access CME’s markets.International business is growing faster than in the US, CME said, with trading volumes during non-US hours up by 27 per cent in the first quarter of 2011 from last year, compared with 20 per cent growth during the US trading day.A central part of CME’s international expansion is the imminent launch of a London-based clearing house, which the group said will initially clear 150 over-the-counter commodity contracts before extending its offering to other OTC and listed futures contracts.“We have more strategic investments and commercial linkage arrangements with major exchanges around the world,” said Craig Donohue, chief executive. “I don’t think that changes whether Nasdaq and ICE are successful or whether NYSE and Deutsche Börse are successful in completing their transaction. Our focus is on expanding our global distribution network and acquiring more customers.”CME also weighed in on the relative merits of the bids for the first time, pouring cold water on the proposed DB-NYSE merger.Mr Donohue said the merger would not benefit traders. “We’ve never, frankly, been big believers in the large, multi-asset class exchange concept,” the CME chief said. “It’s not clear that it has actually delivered demonstrable value to customers in terms of increased efficiencies.”“The synergy opportunities from those very different and very differently regulated businesses are inferior to the synergy opportunities of combining much more similar derivatives businesses as we have done,” Mr Donohue said.Terry Duffy, CME chairman, told the Financial Times that from a cost-saving perspective, the ICE-Nasdaq bid might make more sense. “The way the plan is laid out, ICE would get the Liffe businesses [NYSE’s European futures arm] and that would be more synergistic,” he said.The executives spoke as CME reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter on record revenues, boosted by surging commodity markets and uncertainty in the global economy.Excluding extraordinary items, CME made a net profit of $292m or $4.36 per share, up from $240m or $3.62 per share in the same period last year and ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about $2.40 per share. Revenues were $832m, up from $693m a year earlier.Shares in CME were trading down 1.9 per cent at $303.94 by noon in New York.
464;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-27T23:36:49Z;Shareholder urges NYSE to consider rival bid;;"A large institutional shareholder urged NYSE Euronext’s board to consider a counter-bid to its agreed deal with Deutsche Börse – a cash-and-shares bid by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange.Bill Miller, portfolio manager of Legg Mason, said in an e-mail distributed to reporters on the eve of NYSE Euronext’s annual meeting: “We think it is in the shareholders’ interest that the board work to maximise value for owners, and we don’t see how being unwilling to meet with Nasdaq furthers that goal.”Legg Mason is among the top five NYSE Euronext shareholders, owning 2.9 per cent of shares outstanding.NYSE Euronext declined to comment on Mr Miller’s statement.The NYSE Euronext board has twice rejected the approach by Nasdaq-ICE, which offers a higher price than the current value of the all-shares bid by Deutsche Börse.But the counter-offer has piqued the interest of some shareholders, ranging from institutions such as Legg Mason to M&A arbitrageurs, who have privately been urging for the board to consider Nasdaq-ICE’s offer for NYSE Euronext.The rival bid is valued at 12 per cent more than the Deutsche Börse share swap, according to Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, or $11.2bn versus $10bn.However, many shareholders also have questions about the antitrust implications of Nasdaq buying NYSE and creating a near-monopoly in US listings, say people who have spoken with shareholders.Though the merger is likely to be a backdrop at NYSE’s meeting, it will not be on the table for a vote at the annual meetings of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, both taking place on Thursday. The two groups will also present first-quarter earnings.NYSE has scheduled a vote for its agreed deal with Deutsche for July 7, at which it will require a majority vote. Deutsche Börse also plans to set a deadline for shareholders to tender their shares by July; they will need 75 per cent support.On Tuesday, Jeffrey Sprecher and Robert Greifeld, chief executives of ICE and Nasdaq, respectively, sent an open letter to shareholders urging them to ask the board to reconsider its decision.Shareholders will have limited opportunity to express their views on Thursday. NYSE board members are not facing opponents, as proxies were submitted before the Nasdaq-ICE bid. Votes have also been cast, and shareholder advisory ISS recommended re-election of all directors.“What [Mr Miller] said is what everybody is thinking. NYSE’s board members will get their votes, but maybe not as much as normal. But at this point, the real showdown will be in July,” said one shareholder, who is in contact with other shareholders but has a relatively small position in NYSE Euronext."
465;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-27T22:11:33Z;Antitrust rumblings over index ownership;;As shareholders in NYSE Euronext ponder the bid battle raging between the US exchange and its partner Deutsche Börse on the one hand, and Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange on the other, they may not be paying much attention to the Eurostoxx 50 index.They may be more focused on the cost synergies and revenue opportunities touted by the two camps as they try and convince shareholders that their proposal is best amid the current wave of global exchange consolidation.However, the low-key business of indices, such as the Eurostoxx and in the US the S&P and Dow Jones indices, are emerging as a controversial issue in Europe.That is because ownership of such indices – more precisely of the companies that compile them – is being concentrated among a handful of exchanges. They see them as a lucrative new source of revenue since products such as derivatives and exchange-traded funds can be created that are based on them.Yet rivals wanting to spin off products based on those indices cannot be sure they will be able to, since the power to license products on an index rests with the owner of the index compiler – the exchange.Some see this as a potential antitrust issue. Edmund Parker, global co-head of derivatives and structured products at law firm Mayer Brown, says: “You do have a potential tension, if it comes down to bigger and bigger exchanges deliberately closing out other exchanges. If that happens, this seems to me the sort of thing that competition authorities can take a look at.”The Eurostoxx 50 index is central to the debate in Europe because it is owned by Stoxx, an index compiler controlled by Deutsche Börse and SIX Group of Switzerland, operator of the Swiss exchange. In 2009 the pair took control of Stoxx after buying out a stake held by Dow Jones.Revenue generated by Stoxx grew at a compound annual rate of 20 per cent from 2006-08, the latest period for which figures are available.While the S&P index is owned by publisher McGraw-Hill, the Dow Jones index has been owned by CME Group, the Börse’s biggest rival in derivatives, since last year.Critics of the status quo include the London Stock Exchange, which last month unveiled plans to start competing against Deutsche Börse’s Eurex derivatives exchange, and NYSE Liffe, owned by NYSE Euronext, starting with derivatives based on the FTSE 100 stock index.The LSE would also like to be able to launch derivatives based on other indices, including those run by Stoxx.Yet an application to license the Eurostoxx by the LSE was rejected last year by the German group. People familiar with the matter say the LSE recently raised the issue with the European Commission.Separately LCH.Clearnet, the UK clearing house, is also in contact with Brussels after being similarly rebuffed after applying to Stoxx to be able to offer clearing of OTC equity derivatives based on the Eurostoxx 50.Neither the LSE nor the LCH.Clearnet would comment.So far there is no indication that the antitrust authorities in Brussels are including the index issue in their impending review of the proposed NYSE Euronext/Deutsche Börse merger.And Stoxx counters any suggestion that index ownership is unfairly exclusive, saying Stoxx faces “strong competition worldwide from other index providers and also from OTC private-label derivatives”.It also argues that an index does not “define a market by itself”.“All indices are calculated and maintained using data which is generally available to the public and in particular to Stoxx’s current and future competitors,” Stoxx says.Yet the index issue could yet become part of a wider debate in Europe over fair access to services such as clearing, often also controlled by exchanges.A key element of Europe’s version of reforms of the vast over-the-counter derivatives markets – mirroring the Dodd-Frank in the US – is how to ensure that clearing houses allow open and fair access to their services from any trading platform, not just one that happens to also be owned by the same exchange.Says one Brussels-based industry observer: “This [index] issue is a fairly close sibling to the issue of access to clearing.”
466;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-27T00:08:14Z;Nasdaq and ICE reach out to NYSE shareholders;;The chief executives of Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange have publicly called on NYSE Euronext shareholders to urge its board to consider their offer for the company.Nasdaq also reached out to corporate issuers, offering NYSE Euronext listed-companies who pay the exchange’s highest annual listings fees a $50,000 discount if the groups merged.Nasdaq and ICE are attempting to buy NYSE Euronext and split its futures and equities exchanges while breaking up the agreed deal between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse to merge to create a global exchange supermarket.The Nasdaq-ICE offer is valued at about 14 per cent more than the agreed $9.5bn share exchange between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse.In an open letter just ahead of NYSE Euronext’s annual meeting on Thursday, Robert Greifeld of Nasdaq and Jeffrey Sprecher of ICE said they “encourage NYSE Euronext’s stockholders to call on their directors to meet with us to address any concerns they have and start a mutual due diligence process”.This is their first public appeal to shareholders, although they have been holding private meetings in the US and Europe.Mr Greifeld and Mr Sprecher wrote that the NYSE-Deutsche Börse agreement allowed the board to consider “a proposal that may possibly be superior”.“Our proposal offers substantially greater short and long-term value and creates a compelling opportunity for the NYSE Euronext board to meet with us while presenting no downside risk and only upside for stockholders,” they said.But NYSE’s board has twice rejected Nasdaq-ICE offer after hearing presentations from its financial advisers and management, voting unanimously to favour the Deutsche Börse deal, which preserves NYSE Euronext’s diversification strategy.No deal on the table at the annual meeting on Thursday. Shareholders could vote, although it is unlikely, not to re-elect current board members. A vote on the Deutsche Börse deal has been set for July 7.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief, who would become chief of the combined company, has said that the Deutsche Börse deal preserves NYSE Euronext’s diversification strategy and creates more value in the future via savings to customers, additional revenues and dividends.Separately, Nasdaq sent letters to issuers saying it would keep its listings fees steady and lower NYSE’s fees if the two groups merged, forming a near-monopoly in US listings.The US Department of Justice this week sent Nasdaq and ICE a second request for information. According to market sources, department officials have been holding meetings with other exchanges and trading firms to gather data and insight on competition.Bruce Aust, Nasdaq‘s head of listings, told Nasdaq issuers the exchange would retain its $99,500 cap on annual fees. He said NYSE’s top rate of $500,000 would be lowered to $450,000.NYSE has a tiered pricing system in which the largest companies pay more. About 165 companies would be affected by the top rate change, according to NYSE figures.
467;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-25T23:44:51Z;Rival bidders warn on NYSE Euronext cost savings;;Shareholders should be “highly sceptical” of NYSE Euronext’s plans to reveal additional cost savings from its planned merger with Deutsche Börse, its rival bidders have warned.The caution came after Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, told the Financial Times that his group and Deutsche Börse, which agreed a friendly merger in February, would be raising their synergy estimates by nearly a third, from €300m to some €400m ($583m).The additional savings and revenue estimates – to be detailed at NYSE’s annual meeting on Thursday – would put the proposals on a par with the $740m of synergies that Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange have proposed as part of their rival bid for NYSE Euronext.In a joint statement the two said: “Investors should be highly sceptical that after two years of exploratory merger discussions, including more than six months dedicated to finalising the transaction, NYSE Euronext has suddenly found a reported €100m in additional synergies.“This increase appears not to be a matter of sharpening a pencil, but an unexplained shift in strategy.”Savings have been a critical part of Nasdaq-ICE’s argument that their offer is superior. Their cash-and-shares bid is valued at about 14 per cent more than the $9.4bn all-shares NYSE-DB deal. The Nasdaq-ICE rebuttal came as Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE chief executive, embarked on a trip across Europe to explain the counterbid to regulators.Charles Schumer, Democratic senator from New York, has raised concerns about Nasdaq-ICE’s cost-cutting. On Monday he asked Nasdaq and ICE to detail planned job cuts. He said NYSE Euronext estimated to him that Nasdaq’s cuts would eliminate 800 jobs in New York. “I am concerned with the potential impact …on jobs in and around New York City. This would be a major consideration in judging any potential transaction,” he said.Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, told the FT, “Clearly there is not a number [on jobs] out there until we get to do due diligence. It’s impossible for [NYSE] to know.”Mr Greifeld said that many cuts would come from NYSE’s “mystifying” amount of money spent on capital expenditures and from rationalisation of systems and data centres.NYSE Euronext’s board has twice rejected allowing shareholder consideration of the rival bid, although privately some institutional NYSE shareholders have said they want to hear more from Nasdaq-ICE.NYSE Euronext said it would move up its first-quarter earnings report to Thursday, April 28, to coincide with its annual meeting, where shareholders will be able to discuss, but not yet vote on, the Deutsche Börse deal. That vote is scheduled for July 7.Separately, Nasdaq-ICE said the US Department of Justice had made a second request for information on their bid. The rival bidders are racing to get antitrust approval for their offers first.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant in London
468;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-25T20:50:28Z;Weaker earnings weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street receded slightly from the strong gains seen last week after a string of disappointing earnings reports from companies such as Advanced Micro Devices, Kimberly-Clark and Johnson Controls.Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, released particularly lacklustre earnings, reporting a 9 per cent fall in first-quarter net income as higher raw material costs ate into its profitability.The company also revised up its estimate of input inflation for the rest of the year in response to the rising price of pulp, oil and resin. This worried investors, pushing the stock down 2.7 per cent to $64.24, amid wider unease over the effect of rising commodity costs on margins.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Advanced Micro Devices, one of the largest makers of processors for personal computers, reported that profits had more than doubled to $510m, or $0.68 per share, for the first quarter.But investors were a little disappointed by the news, and the stock lost 0.1 per cent to $8.70. This was largely because expectations for earnings in the tech sector were high after bumper earnings results from Intel, Apple, IBM and Qualcomm in the previous week. AMD added 5.3 per cent last week as sentiment jumped for such stocks.These results left the S&P 500 down 0.2 per cent to 1,335.26 at the close, paring some of the sharp gains on Wall Street in the previous week.Of the 124 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 80 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations compared with 73 per cent last quarter. Before the season started, analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that there would be a 65 per cent surprise rate overall.This week, 181 S&P companies will report their earnings, setting the tone for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to 12,479.88, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 2,825.88 in the session. The broadly negative sentiment was offset by the news that new family home sales rebounded 11.1 per cent to 300,000 in March from the previous month. This was higher than expected but “still miserable in absolute terms”, said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Volumes were very low as many markets around the world were closed for Easter Monday and investors were reluctant to place large trades ahead of the announcement on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve on US monetary policy.“People are waiting to see what is going to happen with the Fed, but my expectation is that there will not be much news,” said Timothy Holland, portfolio manager of the Aston/Tamro Diversified Equity Fund.“Core inflation has not moved dramatically, and employment and gross domestic product are still not that great, so the Fed will likely just continue to be supportive,” he said.In corporate news, Johnson Controls, a maker of battery systems for hybrid-electric vehicles, reported profit up 29 per cent in the first quarter as volume growth helped offset its higher costs. But investors were hoping for more and the stock was down 2.8 per cent to $39.60.RadioShack, the cons­umer-electronics chain, reported first-quarter earnings down 30 per cent and lowered its full-year earnings estimate by 10 cents a share. Earnings were affected by lower margins, weakness in its T-Mobile business and the expense of rolling out its branded wireless kiosks in Target stores. But the stock was still up 0.1 per cent to $15.85.Polycom, the maker of video conferencing equipment, said its first-quarter earnings had risen more than sixfold. Its shares were up 12.6 per cent to $58.43.In deal news, Barrick Gold, the world’s biggest gold producer, announced a C$7.3bn cash offer for Equinox Minerals, the Australian-Canadian copper miner. This sent shares in Barrick down 6.8 per cent to $51.86, while shares in Equinox Minerals added 10.5 per cent to $8.74. Equinox is already the target of a hostile offer by China’s Minmetals Resources. Barrick offered C$8.15 a share, compared with Minmetals’ C$7.NYSE Euronext said it was set to increase its forecast for cost savings by up to a third from a deal with Deutsche Börse, in a further effort to counter an $11.3bn bid from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange.Shares in NYSE were down 0.7 per cent to $38.76 while Nasdaq and ICE were down 1.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively, to $27.23 and $122.
469;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-25T14:42:44Z;Duncan Niederauer, chief executive, NYSE Euronext;;"We looked at all the different possibilities on the landscape, and we concluded that with where we were trying to go as a company and where we thought the competition was trying to go, we thought that [Deutsche Borse] was the best strategic partner we could find….One [deal] is about today’s prices, one’s about tomorrow’s value. In the DB deal, there was a transfer of value right upfront, because the view was that our management team and our way of approaching things would contribute more than our relative market cap suggested. So we got $1bn for our shareholders upfront.I think they do understand to a person the long-term value creation opportunity, and what we’re trying to figure out is that value gap that exists right now. I think the only thing that would change that in their mind is if the anti-trust risk on one of the two deals, which in their mind, I think incorrectly, seems similar. If that changed in their mind, they might feel differently.I don’t know that it’s unfair. In a lot of deals that you would do in any industry, you might not have clarity prior to the vote. And really what you’re asking the shareholders to do at that point is say, give us the vote of confidence that we can do everything we can to consummate the merger.I’m proud of the job I’ve done here. If the shareholders decide that someone else should be doing the job, I guess that’s okay, too…. In fact, at one point in the DB discussions, I volunteered not to be the CEO, because if that what it was going to take to get the deal done, that was totally fine with me. I felt that strongly that this was the right thing for the company.I’m not sure why it matters. We’re competitors. Hopefully there’s mutual respect there, but we’re not having dinner tonight if that’s what you’re asking.You’d have to ask the people who are at those meetings…. I think the only time a personality really does come into play is when you’re trying to execute a merger. Because it might look great on paper, and it might look like the smartest thing you’ve ever thought of; it cannot be executed if the two leaders don’t see eye-to-eye. And I think that’s what I’ve got with [Reto Francioni, DB chief executive].Francesco Guerrera

470;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-25T10:04:03Z;Quick View: Mr Niederauer borrows from Chicago;;It has taken a while, but the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse camp seems finally to be fighting back.The past two weeks has seen a relentless campaign by Bob Greifeld and Jeff Sprecher, respectively chief executives of Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), to talk up their $11.3bn cash and shares counter bid for NYSE Euronext.Now Duncan Niederauer, NYSE’s chief executive, has revealed that, as a result of some “pencil sharpening” with its bankers, cost synergies in the Börse deal could be up to €400m - a third more than originally advertised.That should please shareholders. It suggests total synergies could reach about €500m ($728m), including revenue opportunities, compared with the $740m in net synergies touted by Nasdaq and ICE, most of which is cost-cutting.But arguably more interesting was something Mr Niederauer merely hinted at: massive savings that the biggest customers of both exchanges would get from netting. He put that figure at over $3bn.What does he mean?Here is what he said: “There’s a lot of good in this combination for customers that can not be extracted today. Right now they have to pay to connect to both platforms, you’ll only have to connect to one platform in the future.“And I think the most important thing is the capital efficiency savings by being able to net the short end [of the interest rate yield curve] and the long end, and the pan-European equity derivatives against the in-country derivatives.”Stripping away the jargon, this is the savings that banks and brokers will get by not having to connect to both the NYSE Liffe futures exchange to trade euribor interest rate futures, and to the Eurex futures exchange for Bund, Bobl and Schatz German bond futures – the short and long end of the yield curve, respectively. The positions taken on each contract could be considered together from a risk management perspective, and netted off against each other.Nor would customers have to connect to the clearing houses of each exchange. The NYSE/Börse deal envisages customers using one clearing house (Eurex Clearing) meaning they only have to put up one set of margin collateral at one clearing house to trade products on each exchange, instead of two (obviously more expensive).And we’re talking big money here, given that Liffe and Eurex’s flagship contracts are, along with the Chicago futures exchanges’ main products, the most-traded derivatives by value in the world.Mr Niederauer and his counterpart at Deutsche Börse, Reto Francioni, are effectively doing exactly what the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade did back in 2003 when they were faced with competition from – ironically – Deutsche Börse.Faced with an attack on its futures franchise by Eurex, which had set up a US futures exchange, the CBOT switched to using the clearing house owned by the CME, abandoning its former clearer which had recently agreed to act as clearer for the upstart new Eurex venture, based in Chicago.That meant that banks and brokers using both the CME and CBOT no longer had to deal with two clearing houses, saving $1.6bn in collateral and other costs, according to claims by the two exchanges at the time. I recall some of the Wall Street banks telling me that this was a big deal for them.Mr Niederauer said the $3bn figure was conservative, adding: “That’s a pretty important value proposition given what’s in front of them as their business models change.”By which he means the wrenching changes being felt by banks and brokers as they try to comply with the new clearing requirements in the Dodd-Frank act in the US, and similar reforms coming out of Europe.The one area where the banks claim they are feeling pain is the costs involved in having to connect to multiple trading platforms that are starting to emerge to offer trading in over-the-counter derivatives, with all the margin collateral commitments at the clearing houses level that this will inevitably involve as well.Eraj Shirvani, European head of fixed income at Credit Suisse, told me recently: “As a result of the broad range of regulatory changes, the type of business we’re going to be doing in the future will be very different from what we’ve done in the past.”If the exchanges’ biggest customers can get some relief on the exchange-traded derivatives side of the business from NYSE/Börse, along the lines of what Mr Niederauer is proposing, that could well drive even more business through the combined exchange – something that shareholders should also like.
471;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-24T22:00:28Z;NYSE boosts case for Deutsche Börse;;NYSE Euronext is set to increase by up to a third its forecast for cost savings from a deal with Deutsche Börse, as the US exchange operator raises the stakes in efforts to counter an $11.3bn bid from Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental-Exchange.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE, told the Financial Times in a video interview that the companies now believed they could find “closer to €400m” in cost savings than the €300m unveiled in February.That suggests that the total synergies could reach about €500m ($728m), with revenue opportunities from the deal, compared with the $740m in net synergies touted by Nasdaq and ICE, most of which is cost-cutting. However on Monday Nasdaq OMX and ICE shot back, saying NYSE Euronext shareholders should be “highly sceptical that after two years of exploratory merger discussions, including more than six months dedicated to finalising the transaction, NYSE Euronext” had “suddenly found” the extra €100m in additional synergies.“This increase appears not to be a matter of sharpening a pencil, but an unexplained shift in strategy. The discovery that initial synergies having been understated by one-third comes after receiving a superior proposal from Nasdsq OMX and ICE that achieves greater synergies,” Nasdaq and ICE said in a joint statement.Mr Niederauer also revealed that NYSE and Deutsche Börse estimated that their biggest customers would save at least $3bn through the combination of the exchanges’ two European derivatives platforms. As part of that, banks would no longer have to tie up money at the platforms’ two clearing houses because only one would be used for the combined derivatives platforms.A shareholder vote on the deal was slated for July 7, Mr Niederauer revealed, while NYSE was set to provide details on the proposed savings at its annual meeting this week.The comments come as NYSE seeks to defend its agreed deal against a break-up bid from Nasdaq and ICE, worth about 13 per cent more than the Deutsche Börse offer at current share prices.The higher cost savings promised by Nasdaq and ICE have been a key sticking point and Mr Niederauer’s new forecast is aimed at allaying shareholders’ fears over the value of the Deutsche Börse deal.However Nasdaq and ICE said if NYSE and Deutsche Börse were to find additional synergies “after the merger economics have been agreed”, then this would be “at the expense of NYSE Euronext stockholders because there has been no increase in the price they are being offered”.“NYSE Euronext should describe these newly-found synergies in detail in order to support the credibility of these revised estimates, particularly in light of commitments to retain two technology platforms and two headquarters. Increasingly it appears that NYSE Euronext is more focused on protecting the transaction than its stockholders,” they said.In the video interview, Mr Niederauer also cast doubt on the savings proposed by Nasdaq and ICE, arguing they had underestimated the business that might be lost through their bid.“When we did similar analyses of the competitive landscape, we think the revenue dis-synergies are understated,” said Mr Niederauer. “In fairness to them, they’re just looking at public filings. I have a feeling if they looked more closely, they’d find the expense synergies may be a bit exaggerated as well.”Mr Niederauer did not rule out sweetening the Deutsche Börse deal through special dividends or the promise of share buy-backs but said he remained confident the company could convince shareholders of the combination’s strategic merits.
472;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-21T19:42:28Z;NYSE: Spurning Nasdaq and ICE;Market scepticism of rival takeover bid seems justified;"NYSE Euronext’s board has unanimously rejected the bid by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange, even though it offers a premium of some 13 per cent to the price placed on the NYSE by the offer to merge with Deutsche Börse and includes some cash. How can they justify this?The time value of money narrows the gap somewhat, as NYSE shareholders would presumably not receive the cash until more than a year into the future. ICE’s multiple may be inflated by the commodities boom, narrowing it a little more. But rejecting such a competitive bid still implies big doubts about its commercial logic and its chances of closing. Are these justified?The Börse proposal offers a diversified group, not
reliant on any single business line – but critics could call it an unwieldy supermarket. Nasdaq/ICE would create two coherent entities – but one would be in the steadily decaying business of US cash equities.On competition, both have big questions to answer. Merging NYSE and Nasdaq creates a virtual US listings monopoly, while putting NYSE’s Liffe and Börse’s Eurex together, whatever the precedents from the big Chicago futures exchanges, creates a troublingly dominant European futures player. Nasdaq/ICE’s pledge of a reverse break-up fee of $350m if their proposal falls foul of the antitrust authorities and its line-up of financing show commitment and confidence – but theirs is still an opportunistic and hastily arranged “catch-up” bid.Cutting through all this, the current NYSE share price is $39.01. This is a 9 per cent discount to Nasdaq/ICE’s bid, suggesting merger arbitrageurs are extremely sceptical about its chance of closing the deal; and the price is a 3 per cent premium to the Deutsche Börse offer, betokening a belief that that bid will need to be beefed up a bit to close the deal. The market has it about right.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
473;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;NYSE reaffirms support for D Börse deal;;The board of NYSE Euronext once again rebuffed an approach by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, and reaffirmed its belief that the already agreed Deutsche Börse merger is the better deal.Nasdaq and ICE revised their initial, also-rejected offer from earlier this week, adding a fee they would pay to shareholders if regulators blocked its bid and announcing they had secured financing for their bid.However, the NYSE board was unmoved. Jan-Michiel Hessels, chairman, said in a statement: “Our board has …concluded that this proposal is substantially the same as what was previously rejected. Consequently, our view has not changed.”Mr Hessels said the board still viewed the Nasdaq-ICE bid as having “unacceptable execution risk”.But the move was immediately attacked by Nasdaq and ICE, with Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, hitting out at NYSE and Deutsche Borse’s refusal to engage which he said made it appear “as if they are protecting their deal rather than acting in the best interest of their shareholders”.People close to the NYSE board said the reference to execution risk was mostly based on a concern that anti-trust regulators in the US will block the deal, which would create a near-monopoly in US stock listings, as well as a belief that Nasdaq cannot execute on the ambitious synergies it promised.The war of words between the two sides this week have revealed the two main battle lines over which the bids are being fought. NYSE and Deutsche Börse continued to stress what they see as the long term benefits of their deal, including the creation of a fully integrated cash equities, derivatives and clearing business straddling the US and Europe.Nasdaq and ICE are criticising that as an “exchange supermarket”, touting their deal as the best way for NYSE shareholders to get access to a cash equities business that would be run more efficiently, while avoiding what is likely to be a prolonged antitrust probe in Europe of the proposed german-US deal’s derivatives plan.Some analysts had predicted the additional $350m “reverse” break-up fee would not be sufficient, even though Nasdaq had also agreed to pay the existing €250m ($357m) NYSE-D Börse break-up fee.A 4 per cent rise in Deutsche Börse shares since Wednesday also meant that the premium offered by Nasdaq-ICE had narrowed. The Börse offer is now valued at $37.26 a share, versus $42.68 a share for Nasdaq-ICE, a differential of 13 per cent. It was about 20 per cent when Nasdaq-ICE initially approached NYSE.The two groups have said they do not intend make a hostile, formal approach to NYSE shareholders, believing that the board can be convinced of the logic of their deal, and that US anti-trust regulators will ultimately give them a green light.Timing is a consideration, as both Nasdaq-ICE and NYSE-D Börse, which faces a full review of its plan to create a near-monopoly listed interest-rate futures market in Europe, pursue regulatory approval for their deals.NYSE has said it intends to put its agreed deal to a vote with shareholders in July, and Deutsche Börse has said it will set a July deadline for shareholders to tender their shares for a deal.“Clearly, anti-trust approval will have a significant impact on shareholders’ view of either deal,” said Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.Mr Greifeld, speaking to analysts on Wednesday said that his group would “pursue this to the end-game”.In his latest statement he said: “We will not be deterred by the [NYSE] board’s attempts to protect an inferior transaction.”Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said: “We do not understand why the NYSE Euronext Board continues to protect the lower-premium Deutsche Boerse takeover, despite urging from its shareholders that they consider our transaction. There is no risk in engaging with us to ensure that the best interests of NYSE Euronext shareholders and markets are served.”The financing commitment his company and Nasdaq have received from a syndicate of banks will last until April 2012.Nasdaq and ICE said in their statement: “Not only does this [our offer] represent a significantly higher short term valuation for NYSE Euronext’s shareholders, but as a significant portion of our offer is in shares of two best in class exchange leaders with proven records of creating value for their shareholders, we believe this offer will result in higher long term value creation as well.”
474;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-20T16:44:07Z;Nasdaq OMX reports 19.6% rise in net income;;"Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator trying to break up an agreed combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, reported a record earnings-per-share of 61 cents for the quarter, helped by a big boost in options trading.However, operating expenses rose as a result of a string of acquisitions in trading technology and market surveillance.Net income rose to $110m in the first quarter, compared with $92m in the same quarter a year earlier, a rise of 19.6 per cent. That translated to earnings of 61 cents per share – Nasdaq’s best ever – after taking out one-time transaction costs, compared to 43 cents a year ago.The figures come as Nasdaq OMX is pressing its case, together with IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), that its $11.3bn cash-and-shares offer for NYSE Euronext is superior to a $9.3bn all-share deal already agreed between the owner of the New York Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse of Germany.While NYSE-D Börse would create a leading European futures exchange, NYSE-Nasdaq would create a dominant US cash equities exchange. Analysts have expressed concern that cash equities are a lower-margin, slower growing business.But Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, said that this quarter’s record earnings-per-share showed the earnings power of a cash-equities focused business. “A well managed cash equity and equity derivatives franchise can perform well on an absolute basis, it can also perform well versus derivative exchanges on a relative basis,” said Mr Greifeld on the earnings call.An uptick in interest rates, which will drive derivatives, will also reflect a stronger economy, he said. “Cash equities is the derivative of the economy of the market that it serves and its success over the medium and the long-term will be a multiplier of GDP growth,” he said.Revenues from trading and clearing – a mainstay of any exchange’s business – jumped 26 per cent to $195m after taking out fees paid to traders and exchanges, compared with the year previous figure. They were up 7 per cent on the fourth quarter.The boost was primarily in US options trading and clearing. Volumes for Nasdaq grew as it increased its marketshare from 21.3 per cent to 23.5 per cent, making it the largest US options operator. Revenues were $124m in the quarter, up from $73m a year ago.US cash equity revenues increased from $55m to $62m, but only net of rebates and fees, which were lower due to lower volumes than the same quarter a year ago. Revenues in issuer services and market technology also improved, bringing total group net revenues to $415m, versus $360m a year ago.A further argument used by Nasdaq in its counter-offer for NYSE Euronext is that the combined Nasdaq-ICE proposal will result in more cost synergies than the Deutsche Börse deal: $740m compared with around $400m promised by German-US operators.Mr Greifeld has also made much of his record in removing costs from the exchange businesses he has run, including the OMX Nordic network, acquired by Nasdaq in 2006.In the first quarter, Nasdaq OMX’s operating expenses rose by 12 per cent compared with the same quarter a year earlier, to $225m, from $201m.That was mostly due to higher expenses associated with the acquisition of FTEN, a company specialising in pre-trade risk management, of Smarts, which makes market surveillance systems, and of Nord Pool, a Norway-based electricity market.Overall group operating expenses increased by 4 per cent in the quarter compared with the fourth quarter.Nasdaq OMX and ICE this week stepped up efforts to try and persuade the board of NYSE Euronext to engage with it on their offer for the owner of the New York Stock Exchange.They submitted a fresh offer that involved agreeing to pay NYSE shareholders a $350m “reverse break-up fee” and pay the NYSE-D Börse break up fee of some $350m if the Nasdaq-ICE deal failed to win antitrust approval; secured $3.8bn in committed bank financing; and started to buy NYSE stock.Mr Greifeld said the fee was based on a study of 80 deals, and the percentage of NYSE’s market capitalisation it represented – about 3.5 per cent – was in line, and that his group had “zero inclination” to make it larger."
475;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-20T03:46:56Z;Quick View: Breaking down break-up fees;;Breaking up is hard to do – especially when someone is offering billions of euros to stay.Just ask shareholders of the warring participants in the most recent exchange consolidation battle, on the one side Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, and on the other side NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse.In the original agreement unveiled in February, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse agreed to pay €250m ($357m) to the other’s shareholders if one of them broke off the deal.It was meant to discourage rival bidders. Though the $9.4bn all-stock deal contained little premium for NYSE shares, the $357m fee is substantial, larger than the $288m break-up fee in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange-Chicago Board of Trade merger.Yet Nasdaq and ICE were not discouraged. They made an approach to NYSE to jointly acquire it for $11.3bn. Some shareholders approved of the higher bid, but wanted compensation for the risk that the deal would not close due to regulatory scrutiny. They also wanted to know they would be covered if NYSE was forced to pay €250m to Deutsche Börse.So Nasdaq and ICE have proposed a so-called reverse break-up fee, in which they would jointly pay $350m to NYSE if NYSE agrees to their deal – thus triggering the obligation to pay a fee to Deutsche – but authorities subsequently block it.In the fine print, they have critically also agreed to pay the NYSE break-up fee, too. In all, they are offering almost $700m in insurance, or roughly 7 per cent of NYSE’s market cap.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, points as a precedent to the recent AT&T bid for T-Mobile – a deal with its own antitrust shadows – in which AT&T offered $3bn, or roughly 7.5 per cent of T-Mobile’s market value.NYSE, however, stands to receive only the reverse $350m fee – the NYSE-D Börse break-up fee will be paid to Deutsche Börse shareholders.If the NYSE board looks at just the $350m reverse fee, it may not be compelling. Considering the whole $700m, it may be hard to convince Nasdaq and ICE to offer much more.
476;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
477;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-20T01:39:42Z;Ontario fears over LSE-TMX deal;;Canadian politicians have expressed concern that the “centre of gravity” in a proposed merger between the London Stock Exchange and TMX Group – operator of the Toronto and Montreal exchanges – could shift to London.They recommended ensuring equal Canadian and UK membership on any combined group’s board and measures to ensure that key exchange functions stayed in Canada.The comments came on Tuesday in recommendations by a select committee of the Ontario legislative assembly, one of the key bodies in Canada that have a say in approving the deal. Last week it gave its conditional support for the deal, leaving final reservations for publication on Tuesday.The LSE and TMX in February unveiled an all-share deal that would create a platform with the world’s largest number of mining company listings at a time of surging commodity prices.It comes amid a wave of exchange consolidation that also on Tuesday Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange of the US sent a strengthened bid for NYSE Euronext to the company’s board, which has already agreed a deal with Deutsche Börse.The final decision on the LSE-TMX deal rests with Canada’s federal government, which must determine whether the deal provides a “net benefit” as required by the country’s foreign investment law. Reviews are also under way by securities regulators in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta.Critics of the deal say it is less a merger than a takeover of TMX, which owns the Toronto and Montreal exchanges. Existing LSE shareholders would hold 55 per cent of the enlarged group’s capital and Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, would head the group.The committee said that witnesses at hearings it held were “not convinced that the proposal was a merger of equals”. It recommended that the board be split equally between UK and Canadian members, rather than being made up of seven Canadians, five UK members and three from Italy under the LSE-TMX proposal. The Italian board members would come from Borsa Italiana, which the LSE bought in 2007.The Ontario committee said witnesses had expressed concern about a provision of the merger agreement under which, at the end of four years, Canadian representation on the new board could be reduced from seven of 15 members to a minimum of three.The concerns reflect similar issues that dogged the ultimately failed attempt by SGX, the Singapore exchange, to buy the ASX Australian exchange.The LSE and TMX said: “We will review the report in detail and look forward to continued open dialogue with all stakeholders.”
478;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-19T23:43:16Z;Nasdaq-ICE make fresh offer for NYSE Euronext;;"Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange have raised
the stakes in their bid to buy NYSE Euronext, offering to pay the Wall Street-based exchange $350m if an agreed deal ­were to be blocked by regulators.The move comes little more than a week after the NYSE Euronext board rejected the $11.3bn approach from Nasdaq and ICE and backed NYSE’s already agreed $9.4bn merger with Deutsche Börse, citing concerns that the rival deal would not be completed.Nasdaq and ICE also touted their capacity to fund a takeover, saying that they had secured $3.8bn in financing commitments for a deal. The two exchanges now hope the NYSE board will reopen talks.“As we go through all the check boxes, we clearly are the superior offer,” Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, told the Financial Times. “We are in the lead in the pure economics and in committed financing. I am sure independent members of the board will come to the rational conclusion.”The groups also said that they would pay NYSE and Deutsche Börse’s agreed €250m ($358m) break-up fee as part of their offer. They further said they intend to purchase at least $66m in NYSE Euronext stock.Nasdaq and ICE’s higher offer has attracted the interest of some institutional shareholders, which would see Nasdaq buying the cash equities markets, which includes the New York Stock Exchange and Paris’s Euronext, and ICE buying its futures exchange, London-based Liffe.But the shareholders were hesitant to give their full support, people close to them have said, fearing Nasdaq and ICE would not be able to secure financial backing.Nasdaq said it had won commitments from Bank of America, Nordea Bank, SEB and UBS. ICE had agreements with a syndicate of banks including Wells Fargo and Bank of America.The two had said when they unveiled their bid on April 1 that they had not finalised bank funding as they were not at that stage ready to pay banks the fees needed to clinch funding, with people close to the companies citing the cost of doing so.The reverse break-up fee responds to antitrust concerns around Nasdaq and ICE’s deal, which would create a single dominant US company listings venue.The fee would be triggered if NYSE agreed to the Nasdaq-ICE bid, but saw it blocked by regulators. Mr Greifeld was in Washington on Monday speaking to US justice department officials.European regulators have said they will give a full review to the NYSE-Deutsche Börse deal, which would create a monopoly in listed European interest rate futures.The NYSE board said in a statement it would consider the revised offer. People close to the board said Nasdaq’s credit ratings, at the lower end of investment grade, were still of ­concern.Deutsche Börse said in a statement: “We are moving ahead with our integration planning and look forward to the successful completion of the strategic merger by the end of this year.”Nasdaq-ICE said its new offer to NYSE Euronext valued the exchanges operator at $42.67 per NYSE Euronext share, a 21 per cent premium to the value of the Deutsche Börse-NYSE deal. Its original offer was valued at $42.50.Mr Greifeld, speaking to the FT, denied reports that he had received indications from US antitrust officials that they would give a preliminary view on his deal in just 5 weeks.“I hope to hear something from the justice department [in due course], that’s my desire clearly,” he said, adding that he had a three-and-a-half hour meeting with department officials on Monday.He also gave further details of the proposed $740m in cost synergies that Nasdaq and ICE believe they can achieve, well above the $423m proposed by his rivals.Mr Greifeld said he would “rationalise” the data centres that both NYSE and Nasdaq use to house traders’ computer systems, increasingly the way banks, brokers and automated traders gain access to an exchange.Analysts have said this implies deep cuts in the cash equities operations at the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq and at Euronext’s four stock exchanges in Europe, moves that could provoke political and worker resistance.Asked what he would do with the two main data centres built recently by NYSE Euronext in Mahwah, New Jersey, and in Basildon, England at a total cost of $500m, Mr Greifeld said there would be one data centre in the US for the combined Nasdaq-NYSE.But he declined to say whether that would mean shutting the one in New Jersey or ending Nasdaq’s lease agreement with a third party for use of its data centre.Asked if he would shut Basildon, Mr Greifeld said: “We really need to get [due] diligence on that.” He said Nasdaq was unclear about similar Euronext infrastructure in Paris, where he has pledged to retain some businesses.He said he was likely to adopt the same approach to Paris and the three other Euronext centres of Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon that Nasdaq used when it took over OMX, the Nordic group of exchanges.“We adopted a local and global approach there,” Mr Greifeld said. “We created enough of an appeal in the Nordic marketplace to entice the London and global players to come there.“The opposite approach was taken by Euronext, where the lure of London has in certain ways eviscerated Paris as a financial centre,” he said. “We’d like to see if we can reverse that trend line and that means making sure that Paris has a financial infrastructure.”"

related charges. J&J was hit by $271m of charges related to its DePuy ASR, a hip replacement which had to be recalled. The stock had been losing ground since the start of the year, but after Tuesday’s gains is up 1.4 per cent year to date.Elsewhere in the sector, Forest Laboratories added 2.4 per cent to $34.10, helped by the strong results, while the wider S&P healthcare index was up 0.9 per cent.This helped the wider markets bounce higher, with the benchmark S&P 500 index closing 0.6 per cent higher at 1,312.62. This followed a 1.1 per cent loss in the previous session after S&P, the rating agency, surprised traders by lowering its outlook on US debt from “stable” to “negative”.Sentiment on Wall Street was helped by news that housing starts and permits for future home construction had risen by more than expected in March, rising 7.2 per cent from the previous month to 549,000.But the improvement was largely a bounce back from the sharply lower levels in February when the figure was depressed by the winter weather, and so did not have a profound impact in the session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent to 12,266.75 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4 per cent to 2,744.97. “The market did react positively to some good earnings, but the gains were not dramatic as traders are in a cautious mood at the moment,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “The markets will likely stay in a tight 3-4 per cent trading range for the time being,” he added.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs reported profits down 72 per cent in the first quarter as the bank’s trading revenue declined and earnings were hit by a $1.64bn dividend payment to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.These results were better than analysts’ had expected, but shares in the investment bank still lost 1.3 per cent to $151.86.This weighed many financial stocks, but failed to drag down the overall sector. Bank of America lost 0.6 per cent to $12.34 while US Bancorp fell 1.2 per cent to $25.25, but the KBW banking index was flat.Losses on the broader financial indices were pared thanks to Zions Bancorporation, which added 3.9 per cent to $23.85 after the bank reported its first quarterly profit in 2½ years, surprising investors who were expecting a loss.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Texas Instrumentslost ground after reporting lower-than-expected profits and revenues, becoming the first large chipmaker to report on the effect of the Japan earthquake on earnings. Texas Instruments said after the closing bell on Monday that two of its three Japanese factories were damaged in the disaster and warned that the biggest impact on revenues would take place in the second quarter. The stock fell 0.7 per cent to $34.54.After the closing bell Intel reported earnings of 59 cents a share, ahead of the 46 cents expected. IBM also reported earnings above expectations, with earnings of $2.41 a share, ahead of the $2.30 expected. Both stocks were up in after-hours trading.NYSE Euronext rose 1 per cent to $38.70 after Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange made a fresh offer for the exchange. Nasdaq and ICE fell 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent to $27.40 and $119.33, respectively.The materials sector saw some of the strongest gains on Wall Street led by steel stocks after Steel Dynamics reported strong first-quarter earnings and said that the current quarter looked “solid”. Shares in the steel producer were up 5.7 per cent to $18.46, while US Steel added 4.5 per cent to $52.74. The S&P materials sector added 1.8 per cent.Industrial stocks were also higherCaterpillar, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues, was up 2.1 per cent to $106.10.The energy sector was also higher. Halliburton, the oilfield services company, was up 4 per cent to $49.01. The S&P energy index climbed 1.1 per cent."
480;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-19T19:50:12Z;Antitrust issues haunt proposed D Börse-NYSE tie-up;;"When Deutsche Börse last tried to expand in Europe by bidding for the Euronext group of exchanges in 2006, it was met with derision from Hugh Freedberg, then chief executive of the target’s derivatives business.“This creates a European monopoly,” he said, arguing that by combining the Börse’s Eurex derivatives business with Liffe, Euronext’s derivatives arm, customers would be deprived of choice.Five years on, Mr Freedberg’s business is under the ownership of NYSE Euronext, which, with its merger partner Deutsche Börse, argues that there is no problem with the Eurex-Liffe combination.This curious about-turn might come back to haunt both exchanges as they try to persuade shareholders of NYSE Euronext of the superiority of their $9.4bn all-share merger over an audacious counter-bid, worth $11.3bn in cash and shares, from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange.Indeed, the antitrust obstacles faced by Deutsche Börse/NYSE are potentially more complex than those faced by Nasdaq/ICE, as they contemplate combining the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange listings platforms.The Deutsche Börse/NYSE deal involves combining not only two big derivatives exchanges but also clearing houses, currently the centre of heated discussion in Europe over competition and access to such post-trade structures.That matters to NYSE Euronext shareholders, since an assessment of the relative merits of each deal will rely heavily on which of the two deals faces the least antitrust risk. In the US, Nasdaq is likely to face scrutiny over its plans to combine the NYSE and Nasdaq’s listings business.Bruce Weber, professor of information management
at the London Business School, says: “I think clearing as a complementary business to trading is far more interdependent and difficult to understand and disentangle than listings. Listing is a fairly straightforward business activity.”Last month, Joaquín Almunia, the European Union’s competition commissioner, said the Deutsche Börse/NYSE deal was a “complex case” that would be subject to “deep investigation”.The German-US side is expected to make several core arguments. First, they will argue that the exchange-traded element is only a small portion of the entire derivatives market and that competition will come from an expected proliferation of new swap trading platforms that will emerge from reforms of the over-the-counter derivatives markets under way in the US and Europe.They will also argue that the Eurex and Liffe offerings are complementary, rather than in competition with one another, and stress the efficiencies of having these traded in a single venue.Eurex offers futures on German government bonds, known as Bunds, while Liffe’s main product is euribor interest rate futures.Second, the two exchanges will stress that the derivatives marketplace is global and that not only is there a big competitor in the US in the form of the CME Group but that there are other operators globally.Indeed, competition has just started in futures trading in Liffe’s own backyard. This month, the London Stock Exchange took aim at Liffe and Eurex with its first serious push into futures trading, with futures on the FTSE index.And BATS Europe and Chi-X Europe, two rival trading platforms that will soon merge, are set to join the fray.Deutsche Börse/NYSE are also likely to argue that a precedent was set in 2007 when the US Department of Justice approved the take­over of the Chicago Board of Trade by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.That brought together the CME, dominant in eurodollar interest rate futures, with the CBOT, big in Treasury bond futures – similar to the Eurex-Liffe product mix. Together they control 98 per cent of US futures trading.Some observers argue that Europe needs a combined Eurex-Liffe derivatives platform as a counterweight to CME in the US.Deutsche Börse/NYSE and its advisers acknowledge, however, that their case is unusual in that it is running in parallel with EU OTC derivatives and clearing reforms that will substantially alter the environment in which exchanges and their customers operate.A key part of those reforms, known as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, deals with competition between clearing houses in the
OTC derivatives markets.Awkwardly for the
German-US proposal, this has thrown a spotlight on exchange ownership of a trading platform and clearing house together in a “vertical silo”. Critics of the vertical silo argue that it locks out competitors.So far, proponents of the vertical silo appear to have convinced policymakers that this model has its merits. Meanwhile, people close to Deutsche Börse/NYSE say they are ready to consider some “mitigants” involving Clearstream, the Börse’s custody and settlement business, should it become necessary to offer some remedies to Brussels.But the key issue for Deutsche Börse/NYSE is time. Both exchanges have said they expect the Brussels process to take about a year. With NYSE Euronext shareholders set to vote on the deal in July, that may weigh on their minds."
481;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-19T16:39:17Z;SGX chief plays down failed offer;;Magnus Böcker, chief executive of the Singapore Exchange, said he was under no pressure to achieve a significant strategic deal following the collapse of an A$8.3bn (US$8.7bn) bid for the Australian Securities Exchange.Mr Böcker played down the prospects of another pan-Asian exchange deal emerging and said that the transatlantic exchange merger proposals on the table were mainly driven by European and North American consolidation.Reporting a 10 per cent fall in net profit to S$67m (US$53.8m), for the third quarter to March 31, largely because of costs of S$12m associated with the aborted ASX deal, Mr Böcker said on Tuesday he felt “no pressure at all” to deliver another deal.“I am here to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders, and I think that is a clear focus,” he said, dismissing suggestions that his job might be in jeopardy without another big deal.Mr Böcker, who touted the ASX proposal as a chance to build an Asia-Pacific exchange powerhouse, only to see it dismissed two weeks ago by the Australian government, said exchange mergers in Asia would be very difficult because of the fragmentation of rules, regulations and economic policies.He said the proposed merger between the London Stock Exchange and Canada’s TMX Group offered few synergies for customers, while the merger proposal between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext and the competing $11.3bn bid for NYSE by Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental Exchange, were “continental” rather than global proposals.“I think you need to see [the proposals] not as an isolated thing that is happening now, but as a trend over seven or eight years [of consolidation in the European and North American exchange markets],” he said.He added that the opportunities for organic growth and strategic co-operation short of mergers were greater in Asia because of the faster rates of economic growth there.SGX said operating revenue rose 10 per cent to S$169m, but net profit was affected by expenditure on initiatives such as new equipment intended to facilitate high-speed electronic trading as well as the ASX bid expenses. Trading volumes have recovered in the past two years after tumbling in 2008, as the financial crisis dragged the world’s economies into recession.Singapore’s benchmark Straits Times index sank by a record 49 per cent in 2008, then surged 64 per cent in 2009 and rose 10 per cent last year, as stimulus measures helped revive the global economy.Singapore Exchange shares dropped 1.6 per cent to S$7.95 on Tuesday.
482;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-18T16:36:38Z;Quick View: NYSE scores a (small) win;;Niederauer 1-0 Greifeld?Last week was a more enjoyable week for Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext. His first win was his board rejecting the combined Nasdaq-IntercontinentalExchange bid. It allowed him to speak out in public about his preferred merger again.His second win came from his own company, which secured a notable coup with the listing of Sequans Communications, the French 4G chipmaker, listed on NYSE on Friday.Sequans’ choice for its New York listing was a little surprising. Paris has a healthy technology investment scene with many knowledgeable investors and plenty of companies large and small. As an aside, London as a listing venue was a non-starter. Investors’ regard for technology stocks is – with a few exceptions – at its lowest point in a decade.But the choice should trouble Nasdaq. While Sequans raised a relatively small $77m in gross proceeds, it has not been the first technology company in recent months to see its future on the Big Board.For the rest of the world, Nasdaq is regarded the natural home for technology companies, and the preferred venue for the industry giants Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, Intel, Ebay and Baidu. Web groups Skype and Kayak will issue shares on the index later this year.Yet increasingly technology companies at home and abroad are choosing the Big Board. So far this year Interxion, Demand Media, NeoPhotonics and MagnaChip Semiconductor have opted for NYSE.The battle for listings of technology companies between Nasdaq and NYSE has become increasingly competitive in recent years as they look not only to gain new listings, but also pull listings from each other’s markets. Upcoming battles for LinkedIn, Pandora, RenRen, the Chinese social media group, will be interesting to watch.But the listing was noteworthy in another, perhaps more startling, way. Sequans’s move was, surprisingly, the first French company to list on NYSE since 2002.NYSE’s acquisition of Euronext in 2006 was supposed to help the New York Stock Exchange compete head-on with London, which had been beating NYSE in the listing of international shares in the middle of the decade. That no French company has until now listed on NYSE in the five years existence suggests that Nasdaq hasn’t suffered too badly from the merger.The unknown is whether is says more about NYSE Euronext or whether the way international capital is allocated is changing as rival centres like and London, Hong Kong vie with emerging hubs like São Paolo and Moscow.As the LSE pointed out five years ago: “There are many things that weigh on a company’s mind when it seeks a listing, and the market capitalisation of the exchange isn’t one of them.”Yet Nasdaq’s bid to break up the Deutsche Börse-NYSE merger plan rests in part on the ability to attract international companies. If it succeeds in buying the NYSE, it would then have to show it could thrive where rivals have failed.The performance of companies listing offers little encouragment for others to step forward. Interxion’s shares have barely moved since it listed in February and MagnaChip shares are marginally lower. Neophonetics shares and Demand Media have slumped by around a fifth.Sequans’s debut performance on Friday – when its shares tumbled 18 per cent in spite of a lowered price range – only adds to the uncertainty.
483;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-15T01:20:39Z;Nasdaq OMX appoints permanent CFO;;Nasdaq OMX has hired a new permanent chief financial officer, Lee Shavel, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch banker and key adviser in Nasdaq’s efforts to buy arch-rival NYSE Euronext.Nasdaq’s previous CFO, Adena Friedman, a long-time top company strategist, had left the company in February, just after NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse announced they planned to merge. At the time, Nasdaq was in the early stages of launching its offer to buy NYSE in a joint effort with the IntercontinentalExchange.Mr Shavel was head of financial institutions investment banking for the Americas. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has been a critical partner to Nasdaq and ICE’s $11.3bn cash-and-shares bid for NYSE Euronext, for which BofA Merrill and Wells Fargo have agreed to provide financing, if necessary. Nasdaq and ICE have not yet made a formal bid.During his 18 years at BofA and Merrill Lynch, Mr Shavel helped sell the International Securities Exchange, a US options market, to Deutsche Börse, with whom Nasdaq is currently wrangling to take over NYSE.He also helped sell the New York Mercantile Exchange to the CME Group, and Brut, an electronic trading network, to Nasdaq. He advised on initial public offerings for major exchanges and brokerages, including Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.“Lee has been a valued adviser to Nasdaq OMX for the past seven years on a variety of mergers and acquisitions, funding and capital transactions,” said Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, in a statement.Mr Shavel will take over officially from Ronald Hassen, interim CFO, on May 23. Mr Shavel has also been named vice-president of corporate strategy.The departure of Ms Friedman had raised eyebrows, coming at a critical time for the company as its top rival planned to join with Europe’s biggest exchange group. Nasdaq has lost other top executives in recent years as its share price struggled and it lost equity trading market share to new market entrants.However, Ms Friedman left to take the same position at The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that is mulling a transition to public company. It was an opportunity she wanted to pursue to be nearer to her family in the Washington area, where Carlyle is based, people with knowledge of her decision have said.
484;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-14T15:44:06Z;NYSE and D Börse consider measures to boost deal value;;"Deutsche Börse is considering a share buy-back and NYSE Euronext is looking at a special dividend as ways of bolstering the value of their proposed tie-up, according to people familiar with their thinking.The two groups are fending off a potentially higher offer for NYSE Euronext by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange.The chief executives of Deutsche Börse and NYSE began meeting shareholders this week, following the NYSE board’s rejection of an informal $11.3bn cash-and-shares offer by Nasdaq and ICE to buy the company and separate its equities and futures businesses.NYSE has told investors it has the option of paying a one-off dividend if the deal closes, as a way to narrow the price gap with the proposed counterbid, a person familiar with the talks said.Deutsche Börse has said it probably cannot alter the price of its $9.4bn deal, in which its shareholders will receive 60 per cent of the joint entity, because it must receive 75 per cent shareholder approval, a person close to the company said.However, it would consider a share buy-back after the deal closes, which would boost the value of the combined group, in essence raising the promised return, the person said.Deutsche Börse and NYSE have also told shareholders that the synergies of their deal will be higher than the $426m outlined, as they have proposed in recent days, but they have not finalised new figures.The companies declined to comment.A buy-back would also be possible for ICE, the US futures exchange, which has some $200m remaining in an authorised buy-back. However, a person close to ICE said the option was not under consideration.ICE declined to comment.Deal-related buy-backs are not an unfamiliar route for the exchanges. The CME Group made a similar offer during its merger with the Chicago Board of Trade, which ICE had made an unsuccessful hostile bid to buy.Nasdaq and ICE have said they will not raise their proposed bid, though analysts have suggested other tools that could improve their offer.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst at Raymond James, said in a note that Nasdaq and ICE could “potentially make things more interesting” by offering a reverse break-up fee for their deal, which would give investors protection if regulators blocked it. It could also help match the large $340m break-up fee agreed by NYSE and Deutsche Börse.Mr O’Shaughnessy estimated that NYSE could receive as much as $50 a share in an auction, but he said the board was unlikely to go down that route. Nasdaq and ICE suggested they could pay some $42 a share; the Deutsche Börse offer is worth about $37 a share."
485;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-14T00:42:47Z;Shareholders may urge NYSE board to address Nasdaq deal;;Some shareholders in NYSE Euronext, which has agreed to merge with Deutsche Börse, may urge the company to consider a rival offer by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange at the upcoming general meeting on April 28.NYSE Euronext has agreed to a friendly all-stock $9.4bn merger with Deutsche Börse, but also the target of an $11.3bn takeover proposal by Nasdaq and ICE, who would split the group’s equities and futures arms.All the groups’ chief executives have been meeting US shareholders, with NYSE and Deutsche Börse stepping up their efforts this week following the NYSE board’s rejection on Sunday of the Nasdaq-ICE offer.Some shareholders, notably those that also have large positions in Nasdaq and ICE shares, have expressed concern that NYSE board did not take the higher offer seriously enough, and are awaiting DB-NYSE to match or challenge their rivals’ promise of higher cost savings.“The opportunity to buy the New York Stock Exchange doesn’t come along every day,” said Rick Wetmore, portfolio manager at Turner Investments. “A premium has to be paid. This is an iconic global brand, and it’s being sold at a cyclical low.”Some of those institutions are weighing whether to vote on a proposal at the April 28 general meeting that would allow them to call a special meeting with their own agenda if 10 per cent of shareholders agree, people familiar with matter said.“There is noise around these issues, and voting for them would send a signal,” said a person familiar with several shareholders’ thinking.The measure, which has been proposed but failed the past two years, is not endorsed by NYSE, which said in a regulatory filing that it poses a “real risk of …diversion of management and financial resources”. It would also be subject to regulatory approval, and likely not be available in time for the merger discussion.The proposed DB merger is not on agenda at the general meeting. It set to be voted on at a meeting in early June.For NYSE, 50 per cent of shareholders are required to approve the deal. DB needs 75 per cent of its shareholders, a majority of whom are in the US, to agree. It plans to set a July deadline for investor approval.Reto Francioni, DB chief executive, has travelled to the US to speak to shareholders. Along with Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief, the two are arguing that their cost savings estimates were “conservative”. They also say they can achieve cuts without up to 1,000 job losses they say Nasdaq would require.One large institutional investor said that was a critical factor: “The only way Nasdaq’s deal can work is with lay-offs. I’m not sure how that will go down politically.”Mr Niederauer and Mr Francioni also say the Nasdaq-ICE proposal offers investors no protection – such as a reverse break-up fee – in the event that antitrust regulators reject the creation of a singular US listing venue. The DB-NYSE deal has a large break-up fee of $340m.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, said in a note on Wednesday that though he expected the DB merger to be approved, such a fee could “potentially make things more interesting” for Nasdaq and ICE.Nasdaq and ICE, which have not yet made a formal offer, are also continuing to meet with shareholders. Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief, has previously said that a combined NYSE-Nasdaq, which would compete globally rather than in the US – and therefore is not anti-competitive – would be a “direct benefit for New York City” by “ensuring New York is a financial centre, ensuring that we have continued job growth”.
486;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-12T23:52:40Z;ICE to open electronic platform in Brazil;;IntercontinentalExchange has made its first big move into Brazil by teaming up with one of the country’s most famous businessmen to create an electronic marketplace for power contracts.The world’s biggest bourses, which are fighting for pole position in a rapidly changing industry, have increasingly looked to emerging markets such as Brazil to get ahead of their competitors.Rival Chicago-based CME Group already has a strong presence in the Latin American country after forming a strategic partnership with the country’s exchange BM&FBovespa in 2008.ICE said on Tuesday it had formed its own partnership with Eike Batista, Brazil’s richest man, and other top executives to create BRIX, a new marketplace for electrical power contracts.“ICE was founded more than a decade ago to serve global energy markets, and we believe our history of providing transparency and market-based prices will bring important risk management tools to the Brazilian power industry,” said Charles Vice, president and chief operating officer.The electronic platform, which is set to open in June this year, follows an agreement with the country’s regulator last month to allow Brazilians access to ICE’s oil futures.At the same time, ICE is embroiled in a takeover battle in the US, where it has teamed up with Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange group, to take over the NYSE Euronext.ICE’s goal in that deal is also international expansion. In that proposal, in which ICE is contributing the majority of an $11.3bn bid, it would take control of Liffe, the UK-based European futures exchange.It would be ICE’s second big European deal, having acquired the International Petroleum Exchange in 2001, which was renamed ICE Futures Europe.Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE chief executive and former power trader himself, is a well-respected dealmaker, having built ICE into a formidable global exchange in just over a decade.Mr Sprecher and his counterpart at Nasdaq OMX, Robert Greifeld, have been reaching out to US shareholders of NYSE Euronext to convince them to back their deal, rather than NYSE’s proposed friendly tie-up with Deutsche Börse.Mr Sprecher told reporters in Brazil that his group had received a “great response” from NYSE shareholders and said he would “continue to talk to shareholders” as NYSE and DB hold their own talks.NYSE’s board rejected ICE and Nasdaq’s bid on Sunday. NYSE and DB believe their combined group, which would be the world’s largest exchange group, would be in a leading position to partner with exchanges in fast-growing markets like Brazil and Hong Kong.Trading groups and brokerages in the US and Europe are increasingly turning their attention to markets such as Brazil as opportunities compress in developed markets.Additional reporting from Reuters
487;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-11T21:22:50Z;CME-linked index looks at tracking Brent;;A leading commodity index marketed by CME Group is to look into tracking benchmark European crude, potentially draining billions of dollars from the exchange operator’s flagship energy contract.Supervisors of the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index will consider adding Brent crude to the basket of 19 futures contracts tracked by about $77bn in assets.Crude oil makes up 16.5 per cent of the index.The proposal would likely shift more oil trading volume, and investor money, to Brent, the main rival to CME’s own benchmark oil futures contract.The only crude type now in the index is West Texas Intermediate, the blend that has lagged behind Brent by $10 or more this year as a glut has grown at the contract’s US delivery point.WTI is mainly traded on CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent is chiefly traded on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, a unit of IntercontinentalExchange.On Monday, Nymex May WTI settled at $109.92, down $2.87 a barrel, and ICE May Brent closed at $123.98, down $2.67 a barrel.“If they do a reshuffling in January 2012, they are going to have to buy Brent and sell WTI,” said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix, a consultant in Switzerland.CME has defended the benchmark in newspaper advertisements and videos and pointed out that open interest in WTI futures reached a record last month. However, traders from the Saudi state oil company to Delta Air Lines have lost faith in WTI as a pricing tool.CME owns 90 per cent of Dow Jones Indexes, which markets the commodity index. The index handbook this month said a supervisory committee “intends to consider whether storage and delivery characteristics of crude oil” would make an “allocation to Brent crude oil in the index appropriate” in 2012. The handbook cited a research note by the International Energy Agency titled: US WTI Price Structure Collapsing Under Weight of Surplus Inventories.CME told the Financial Times that commodity indices “make weighting decisions in accordance with transparent policies and rules. And, while we can’t comment on the prospective changes, we respect those processes and believe adherence to transparent and clear rules is sound policy.”
488;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-11T20:47:43Z;Wall St energy shares hit by growth report;;News that Endo Pharmaceuticals was acquiring American Medical Systems helped lift the healthcare sector, but the wider markets lost ground, led by commodity stocks after the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecasts for the US and Japan.The S&P healthcare sector saw the strongest gains on Wall Street, rising 0.5 per cent, after Endo announced a $2.6bn acquisition for AMS, a maker of medical devices. The deal is set to close in the third quarter of this year and is expected to create $50m in synergies by 2013.Shares in Endo rose 0.5 per cent to $41.06, falling back in late trading from earlier 5 per cent gains, while AMS shares surged 32.1 per cent to $29.50. Elsewhere in the sector, Biogen was up 7.2 per cent to $78.55 after a successful trial for its multiple sclerosis treatment while Forest Laboratories added 4.1 per cent to $34.21.But in the wider markets, the S&P 500 index lost 0.3 per cent to 1,324.46, adding to the 0.4 per cent losses on Friday. The energy sector saw the sharpest losses following the IMF report which reduced its forecast for US growth in 2011 to 2.8 per cent from 3 per cent.Cameron International, the oilfield services company, was down 3.5 per cent to $53.54 as oil prices lost ground while Baker Hughes lost 3.2 per cent to $69.31. The S&P energy sector was down 1.9 per cent.The material sectors also saw strong losses with Freeport-McMoRan, the copper producer, falling 3.1 per cent to $55.44 and Consol Energy, the coal miner, losing 4.2 per cent to $50.34.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat in the session at 12,381.11 while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent at 2,771.51.Before the IMF report the markets were slightly higher with traders looking optimistically towards the upcoming earnings season. Over the next few weeks almost two-thirds of the companies in the S&P 500 will report their first-quarter earnings.“We look set to have a very healthy earnings season,” said Kate Warne, market strategist at Edward Jones. “Although I think that there will likely be fewer earnings surprises than in recent quarters.”Analysts are expecting that stocks on the S&P 500 will see earnings per share growth of 11 per cent in the first quarter from the same period a year ago, according to Bloomberg data. This is a significantly slower growth rate than the 36 per cent jump in the fourth quarter of 2010, but the growth is coming from a higher base.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, reported earnings that topped analysts forecasts after the closing bell on Monday.The company reported earnings excluding restructuring costs and other one-time items of 28 cents a share, topping the 27 cents expected by analysts. The stock was down 0.8 per cent to $17.77 ahead of the result.This week will also see earnings reports by JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday and Google on Thursday.There was more deal activity in the telecommunications sector. Level 3 Communications, the internet video and communications network operator, said it had agreed to acquire Global Crossing, the IP solutions provider, in an all-stock offer valued at roughly $1.9bn.The news sent shares in Level 3 up 18.1 per cent to $1.70 and Global Crossing up 68.7 per cent to $24.97.In other deal news, Tyco International jumped 3.3 per cent to $48.72 following unconfirmed reports that Schneider Electric was weighing up a takeover offer for the maker of security systems.Shares in NYSE Euronext, the largest exchange operator in the US, lost ground after its board unanimously voted on Sunday to reject the offer from Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, which was intended to break up the planned merger with Deutsche Börse.In a statement, the NYSE Euronext board said the deal with Deutsche Börse would “create substantially more long-term value for shareholders, and is significantly more likely to close”.Shares in NYSE lost 2.9 per cent to $37.59. Nasdaq fell 1.5 per cent to $28.03.Viasystems Group, the electronics manufacturer, was down 2.7 per cent to $25 after saying that it expected “minor impacts” from the Japanese earthquake on the flow of supplies.Monsanto, which reported disappointing results last week, was up 1.4 per cent to $67.17 after the seed producer was upgraded by Deutsche Bank to “buy” from “hold”.
489;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-11T18:53:19Z;Exchange chiefs mount defence of planned deal;;The chief executives of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are presenting shareholders with a defence of their proposed tie-up to fend off interest in a rival, higher bid to break-up the deal by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange.Following the NYSE Euronext board rejection on Sunday of the joint Nasdaq-ICE $11.3bn cash and share bid for the company – versus the $9.7bn value of the Börse all-share offer for NYSE – Duncan Niederauer, chief of NYSE Euronext, and Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse chief, plan to meet shareholders. This was difficult to do before the board’s decision, Mr Niederauer told CNBC.Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, and Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, have already been meeting shareholders. The rival bidders said on Sunday that they would step up their outreach to shareholders.Mr Greifeld said in a statement: “The feedback we have received from NYSE Euronext stockholders is very positive, and we would expect NYSE Euronext would, at the very least, meet with us and our advisors to discuss the merits of the proposed combination.”Nasdaq and ICE have touted the superior price and cost and revenue synergies from their deal, according to people familiar with the talks. Nasdaq would combine with the NYSE and Euronext stock markets, while ICE would take Liffe, the UK futures exchange owned by NYSE Euronext. Some shareholders have said they have a duty to consider Nasdaq and ICE’s larger offer. One portfolio manager at a large institution said he was disappointed at the NYSE Euronext board’s rebuff. “For better or for worse, we are charged by our investors to look for the best price,” this person said.One person said that ICE had also touted some $200m spare capacity in an authorised share buy-back, which could boost the value of its shares as an acquisition currency. A source close to ICE said the option existed, but it was not being considered.The NYSE board did not have a fiduciary duty to consider the higher offer, because the Börse-NYSE tie up is an all-share deal and termed a “merger of equals”, not a “sale of the company”. Only the latter would legally bind the board to consider other offers.In contrast to Mr Greifeld and Mr Sprecher’s tandem approach, Mr Niederauer and Mr Francioni were not in contact over the weekend. Mr Niederauer told CNBC that “we need to get better, particularly on [the Börse] side, at telling this great story that we’ve got to tell”.Mr Niederauer and Mr Francioni, who at this point are not expected to raise their bid, will argue that they can achieve greater cost savings than previously promised. Nasdaq-ICE said it could achieve savings of $710m, versus $426m outlined by Deutsche Börse-NYSE, which Mr Niederauer has called “conservative”.These people said that Nasdaq and ICE touted their history of creating merger synergies and raised questions about Börse and NYSE’s records.A dip in NYSE Euronext shares suggested traders had downgraded the likelihood of the rival bid succeeding. The shares fell 1.9 per cent on Monday, to $37.96, their lowest since the rival offer was unveiled.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant in London and James Wilson in Frankfurt
490;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-11T13:46:44Z;Quick View: Discord between DB and NYSE?;Germany has much to learn when trying to sell a deal;If you don’t tell, you don’t sell.It’s an age-old saying but could this be an Achilles Heel in the proposed NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse combination’s sales pitch in the last week or so?This morning Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, was pretty open on CNBC in admitting that the two exchanges had a job of work to do in selling the story of their deal to shareholders.Here’s what he said: “I think we have a collective job to do that we haven’t been able to do for the last 10 days.” The last 10 days have been taken up by the emergence of a counter offer for NYSE Euronext from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), and the NYSE board’s assessment of it which culminated in a rejection on Sunday.But here’s the really interesting bit. Mr Niederauer – in a clear reference to his counterpart Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse chief executive – said: “We need to get better, particularly on your side, at telling this great story that we’ve got to tell.”It doesn’t sound to me that the New Yorkers feel that their German friends are doing a good enough job of selling this deal.For the past 10 days, the NYSE Euronext people have been in lock-down mode, unable to say much in public as the board has deliberated. But Deutsche Börse wasn’t constrained and could – should, it seems to me – have stepped up to the plate.We are dealing with two different cultures here. Deutsche Börse and its top executives are not known as the most open and communicative – at least on the media air waves. That’s not uncommon among German companies, which are still only now realising that investor relations is not always enough when it comes to communicating with shareholders. Media relations is often just as important since it’s another channel through to your shareholders.Contrast this with Mr Niederauer and his colleagues. They are (by and large) accessible and vocal and rarely miss a chance to talk up the NYSE’s business.Deutsche Börse did a miserable sales job back in 2002/03 when it was trying to persuade traders to use Eurex US, its (ultimately failed) Chicago-based futures exchange. Selling a business proposition is Job One in America. They do it very well over there.Case in point: the slide presentation that Nasdaq OMX and ICE made when they unveiled their deal. The sales pitch wasn’t a home run, but it hit quite a few bullseyes. And you wouldn’t put many exchange executives up against Bob Greifeld and Jeff Sprecher on the sales front (except Mr Niederauer, to whom it comes naturally, as well as his chief operating officer Larry Leibowitz).I understand Deutsche Börse last week hired top New York communications firm Joele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher to help make its case in the US. And Mr Francioni is jetting to New York today and will be joining Mr Niederauer on a sales pitch.Better to get this right now, than have it part of a post-mortem when it’s all over.
491;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-10T23:09:25Z;NYSE chief defends merger plan with D Börse;;"Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext and potential chief of a combined NYSE-Deutsche Börse exchange group, on Sunday defended his deal from an attack by arch-rival Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange.Nasdaq and ICE have proposed a richer cash-and-stock takeover of NYSE, potentially breaking up the friendly all-stock combination that Mr Niederauer has agreed with his counterpart at Deutsche Börse, Reto Francioni.The NYSE board rejected that offer on Sunday, which would involve splitting the New York Stock Exchange from the Paris-based Euronext exchange and Liffe, the UK futures exchange owned by Euronext. Nasdaq would take NYSE and Euronext, and ICE would take Liffe.“The only factor that matters is that the proposal that we received would require us to dismantle the company. We felt that was a strategic mistake, and not in the best interest of shareholders,” Mr Niederauer told the FT.“We went through an exhaustive analysis to make sure we’re comfortable with the strategy, and we are, and the Deutsche Börse merger is consistent with that,” he said.There is much at stake for Mr Niederauer, who left Goldman Sachs to join NYSE Euronext, taking the top job in 2007. In the DB-NYSE deal he would stand to run the world’s largest exchange group; he would likely lose his role to Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief, if the rival bid succeeded.The Nasdaq-ICE group has been aggressive in arguing that its deal would save more money by combining like-for-like exchanges, $710m versus $426m in proposed savings by DB-NYSE. Mr Greifeld has argued that the NYSE-Euronext merger itself was poorly executed, and suggests the DB-NYSE merger could similarly fail to deliver.Mr Niederauer, who inherited that deal from his predecessor John Thain, bristled at the suggestion. “We take a little bit of offence about …our record. We’re comfortable with how [our shareholder return] stacks up,” he said.“We’ve reduced expenses by hundreds of millions while investing in clearing, derivatives and data centres. It’s hard to get the facts out there, but hopefully facts will prevail,” he said. NYSE reported a $600m run rate of annual cost savings in 2010 versus 2007 levels.He also said that his group was “if anything conservative” in its projection of cost savings from a DB-NYSE tie-up.“We like being ‘under promise’ and ‘over deliver’. While we thought about this combination for quite some time, we did not think it was in our collective interest to do a deep dive, there was too much risk of leakage. We agreed we would sharpen our pencils after the announcement, and we are now in the process of doing that,” he said.Nasdaq has also proposed slashing costs significantly in the US by dismantling NYSE’s efforts to build data centres, which in the past were criticised by analysts for being too expensive and underutilised by customers, to build data centres in Mahwah, New Jersey, and Basildon, UK.Mr Niederauer said that would be a mistake: “Mahwah is fully subscribed, and Basildon is nearly fully subscribed. We’ve been able to put everything inside that ecosystem and more will come with the DB merger. Why you’d want to unwind that is unclear to me.” NYSE has said it projects $1bn in revenues in that business by 2015.Meanwhile, there is “no question” regulatory issues stand in the way of both deals, Mr Niederauer conceded, declining to offer a prediction of what regulators might say. European regulators have said they will look closely at Deutsche Börse and Liffe creating a near-monopoly in listed interest-rate futures trading and clearing.However, Mr Niederauer said that potential antitrust hurdles for his rivals’ bid in Europe – as Nasdaq would take the Paris-based Euronext exchange, and ICE would take UK’s Liffe – had been understated.“There’s some execution risk in Europe that’s being overlooked – national interest risk,” he said.“What you just saw in Australia was a perfectly reasonable decision by a policymaker”, he said, referring to Australian authorities’ decision to turn down the Australian Stock Exchange’s proposed merger with the Singapore Exchange.”“I think it shouldn’t be lost on us that two companies are walking in and going country by country and deciding which institution to take. It is not a routine discussion,” he said."
492;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-10T22:28:07Z;NYSE rejects Nasdaq’s joint bid;;The board of NYSE Euronext unanimously voted on Sunday to reject the offer from Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange to break up its planned merger with Deutsche Börse, setting the stage for a tough fight for control of the US’s largest stock markets.At the same time, Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, promised additional cost savings in the Deutsche Börse-NYSE proposed all-stock deal, and Reto Francioni, chief of Deutsche Börse, suggested other European exchanges could be included in the deal.In a statement, the NYSE Euronext board said the deal with Deutsche Börse, which has been in the works for several years, would “create substantially more long-term value for shareholders, and is significantly more likely to close”.Mr Francioni, who would become chairman of the joint group, told Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Switzerland’s main daily newspaper, that it was possible the Swiss and Spanish exchanges could be included in the merged group.“The main principle of the combinations we’re working towards with NYSE Euronext is that each cash equities market stays independent,” Mr Francioni said.“One could also include Spain and Switzerland,” he added.Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange responded late Sunday to NYSE Euronext’s rejection of their joint proposed bid by reaffirming that their cash and stock offer is superior to Deutsche Börse’s.“The feedback we have received from NYSE Euronext stockholders is very positive, and we would expect NYSE Euronext would, at the very least, meet with us and our advisers to discuss the merits of the proposed combination,” Robert Greifeld, chief executive officer of Nasdaq, said in the statement.NYSE Euronext’s decision, which was not unexpected, sets the stage for a protracted battle for the fate of the US’s largest stock exchanges. Nasdaq and ICE are prepared to press forward with a hostile bid if they deem it appropriate, according to people close to their thinking.It would create a dominant European futures exchange and combine three US options markets. Nasdaq has teamed up with ICE, a large US futures exchange, to offer NYSE Euronext $11.3bn in cash and shares, a 19 per cent premium to the value of the Deutsche Börse-NYSE deal. Nasdaq would take the stock markets and ICE would take Liffe, the UK futures market owned by NYSE Euronext.Nasdaq has said that it could offer that price because it would slash costs by $710m, versus $426m in proposed savings by NYSE-DB.Some large NYSE Euronext shareholders have said privately they wanted to consider the higher offer.But Mr Niederauer, due to stay as chief of the combined Deutsche Börse-NYSE entity but not in the Nasdaq-ICE deal, speaking to the Financial Times on Sunday said his group’s initial savings estimate was “if anything conservative”.“We agreed we would sharpen our pencils after the announcement, and we are now in the process of doing that,” he said. It also said it would avoid antitrust difficulties in Europe, and believes US regulators would have all-American ownership for the NYSE.Euronext is made up of the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon exchanges. The Swiss exchange is owned by SIX Group, a holding company that jointly owns Eurex, Europe’s largest futures and options exchange by volume, with Deutsche Börse. It has ramped up efforts to attract so-called high-frequency traders and last month became the first exchange in the world to link up with Liquidnet, a US-based operator of “dark pool” block trading facilities.The Spanish exchange, Bolsas y Mercados Españoles, already has a business relationship with Deutsche Börse. Since December it has operated, with the Börse’s Clearstream settlement unit, a trade repository – or electronic data warehouse – for over-the-counter derivatives trades. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have not so far said what their planned deal would mean for the ownership of Eurex, but the platform is set for a key role in the combined group, the bulk of whose revenues will come from derivatives and clearing.
493;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-07T21:26:22Z;Börse tie to NYSE focuses cuts on Europe;;Europe would bear the brunt of €300m in cost cuts planned by NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse as the two exchanges revealed details of how their scheme to create the world’s largest bourse came about.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the two groups revealed that Reto Francioni, chief executive of the German exchange, contacted his NYSE Euronext counterpart, Duncan Niederauer, in August last year to revive earlier merger talks that had stalled in 2008.The 894-page filing is the first detailed look at the deal since the two exchanges unveiled it three weeks ago.Under the terms of the proposed deal, each Deutsche Börse share would be exchanged for one share of the new company, and each share of NYSE Euronext share would be exchanged for 0.47 shares of the new company. That would leave the new company 60 per cent owned by Deutsche Börse shareholders and 40 per cent by NYSE Euronext investors.However the deal faces a joint counter-bid from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), two rival US exchange operators.They have made NYSE Euronext shareholders a $11.3bn cash-and-shares offer that would see the New York Stock Exchange combined with Nasdaq and the NYSE Liffe futures exchange in London absorbed by ICE.Nasdaq and ICE claim they can achieve synergies of $740m by stripping out costs more aggressively than the German-US combination – in 18 months, compared with their rivals’ three-year time frame.In the filing, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse said the biggest share of their synergies – €98m, or 32.5 per cent of the total – would come from savings in European cash markets and derivatives markets, and US equity options.That suggests the axe will fall at the Euronext network of exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon, and on NYSE Liffe. Frankfurt, home to the Börse’s Eurex futures exchange, is set to benefit by becoming a global derivatives hub in the combined group.Removing “duplicative operations and planned operating expenses” in the two groups’ clearing businesses will deliver 22.5 per cent of the overall synergies. NYSE Liffe’s London-based clearing house looks set to be replaced as part of the “progressive introduction” of the Börse’s own clearing systems. The remaining synergies will come from technology – at 26 per cent of the total – and corporate operations.NYSE Euronext’s board has yet to respond to the offer made by Nasdaq-ICE offer but is expected to address it as early as next week.
494;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-07T20:30:09Z;Nasdaq plays cost-cutting card;;Nasdaq OMX believes that it has a significant advantage over its rivals in its attempt to win the favour of NYSE Euronext shareholders – a proven ability to cut costs.Nasdaq, which along with the IntercontinentalExchange bid $11.3bn for NYSE Euronext, believes that it can cut the costs of running NYSE by $710m by combining like-for-like US stock exchanges.NYSE and Deutsche Börse say their proposed tie-up would cut costs by $426m, primarily in European futures and clearing across the markets.Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, has used his reputation as a cost-cutter to suggest that his track record is superior to his rivals’.However, there are complexities that Nasdaq does not lay out for shareholders, sparking questions from analysts.Nasdaq said that it integrated electronic exchange Instinet’s trading platform, acquired in 2005, in just nine months.Today, the INET platform runs all of Nasdaq’s exchanges globally, including OMX Group, acquired in 2007, and is at the heart of a lucrative business selling the software to other exchanges.By contrast, Nasdaq claims its rival was never able to integrate the NYSE and Euronext trading platforms, and did not achieve the targeted savings, resulting in a $1.6bn impairment charge in late 2008.“Greifeld and Nasdaq’s acquisition record in terms of price discipline and implementation ability is about as good as it gets,” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James.But NYSE Euronext’s leadership has changed since its merger was agreed in 2007. Then-chief John Thain left to run Merrill Lynch, replaced by Duncan Niederauer, a trading executive at Goldman Sachs, and his top deputy, Larry Leibowitz, then head of Americas equities at UBS, who became chief operating officer.It would be “a stretch to say that Duncan and Larry are not good integrators,” said Jamie Selway, a market structure analyst and managing director at brokerage ITG.In their time running NYSE Euronext, they have acquired the American Stock Exchange and Nyfix, a trading technology group.Both of those deals achieved synergies on time, according to financial reports. The NYSE deals also reduced its expense base by $600m versus 2007.Nasdaq also faces a challenge of combining many stock exchanges – six separate licensed exchanges – and not losing significant market share to alternative venues. Deutsche Börse and NYSE, via its Liffe futures market, are at less risk of that because they maintain near-monopolies in individual futures products.When Nasdaq acquired Instinet, there were few alternatives to the NYSE-Nasdaq duopoly for stock trading.Since then, BATS Global Markets and Direct Edge, exchanges backed by broker-dealers, have arrived and taken about 25 per cent of the total market.“When Nasdaq says this deal will be accretive, the numbers assume they will hold on to a lot of market share. But why will this time be different?” said Diego Perfumo, an independent analyst at Equity Research Desk.Nasdaq will attempt to retain market share partly by keeping each marketplace separate, in order to retain differentiation. However, this is similar to NYSE and Euronext’s strategy of building a common engine while not combining the exchanges’ order books.“The advice ‘people in glass houses should not throw stones’ seems appropriate,” said Mr O’Shaughnessy.Nasdaq could additionally see revenues fall in other business which would undermine cost savings.Nasdaq rents space from third-party data centres, versus NYSE’s expensive effort to build their own data centres in the US and UK. Nasdaq says it could handle all the markets’ capacity at its own centre, cutting costs sharply. But it would need to argue that NYSE’s $1bn in projected revenues by 2015 from selling data services is not realistic.Nasdaq also has a lower cap on fees paid by issuers to list on its market, $99,500 in comparison with $500,000 at NYSE. Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, says that lowering to Nasdaq’s rate could reduce revenues by $50m. “Listing fees would be an area Nasdaq would need to delicately handle,” he said.
495;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-05T18:28:14Z;Quote MTF sees boost from industry consolidation;;Quote MTF says the consolidation of alternative trading platforms has reignited interest in the newly launched multilateral trading platform as brokers realise they face fewer choices.The Hungary-based group went live with its trading platform on Monday and Christian Bower, commercial director at Quote MTF, said on Tuesday that the launch had been “technically flawless”. Participants have been able to trade in more than 1,400 single stocks and exchange-traded funds securities.It is the latest “multilateral trading facility” for equities, many of which have emerged in Europe in recent years in the wake of deregulation. However its launch comes amid questions whether Europe can support more MTFs.Fierce competition has hit the market as incumbent exchanges, aiming to prevent further loss of market share, fight a price war with new entrants to the market such as Chi-X Europe, Turquoise, BATS Europe and Equiduct. However, the battle has led to BATS Europe and Chi-X Europe merging to create Europe’s largest share trading venue.At the same time a wave of merger and acquisition activity is sweeping through larger exchanges, most recently with the $11.3bn offer from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange last week for NYSE Euronext.However Mr Bower said industry consolidation, both among national exchanges and MTFs, had “breathed new life” into the Quote MTF proposition.“In this mad rush to reach economies of scale in terms of competition …brokers are worried about seeing competition ebb away,” said Mr Bower. “”Before we found brokers had rather an ambivalent attitude to us but now we’re greeted with enthusiasm.”Eight investment banks and electronic liquidity providers plan to take a 40 per cent equity stake in the group. It has a target of 4-6 per cent of European market share in equity trading by the end of 2012.Quote MTF sells itself as the lowest-cost trading venue by basing most of its operations in Budapest and says it only needs a fraction of Europe’s liquidity for the company to break even.The platform is charging 0.14 basis points on the value of an order to traders willing to come in and match orders posted on its order book. That is the lowest of any MTF. The platform is not paying rebates to encourage posters of liquidity, however.
496;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-05T10:15:35Z;Schneller Blick: Frankfurt patient on NYSE prize;;Nasdaq and ICE’s interest in taking over NYSE Euronext is of course a potentially big complication for Deutsche Börse’s own plans to merge with NYSE. But anyone expecting the US partners’ proposed counter-bid to trigger an urgent reaction in Frankfurt got it wrong.Sure, the German group knows it is in a fight and may have to raise its offer along the road. But Deutsche Börse shows no sign of rushing to show its hand.At one level this is obviously appropriate: after all, the Nasdaq/ICE pitch is to NYSE Euronext investors, so it is up to that company to respond first, beyond Deutsche Börse’s bland statement that it believes its bid is still the best.But Deutsche Börse also hopes time will do it a favour by allowing investors and rating agencies to turn their attention to the weaker financial standing of the Nasdaq/ICE bid and chip away at some of its mooted merits.One of the private reactions from the Frankfurt side is that Nasdaq looks financially stretched. Nasdaq promises greater extra synergies – about $610m in cost savings – but says these will only be meaningfully accretive to earnings from 2013.And of course, as people on the German side also point out, Nasdaq/ICE have done no due diligence on NYSE – which is well under way in talks with Deutsche Börse. “Our bid is not just two guys on a video screen,” is how one person in Frankfurt puts it.The Nasdaq and ICE proposal admittedly creates a large US exchange operator. But Deutsche Börse is trying to make sure one question hangs in the air: does it give the NYSE the international presence that a combination with Deutsche Börse would?Nor does Deutsche Börse expect the Nasdaq and ICE proposal – which has wrapped itself in the Stars and Stripes to emphasise the advantages for the US – to get such a free ride in its home turf.After all, people in Frankfurt reason, synergies from the Nasdaq and ICE plans would mean significant job losses in New York, while corporate America – and anti-trust authorities – might prefer the US to maintain more than one significant stock listing venue. And the Nasdaq/ICE deal would amount to a break-up of NYSE: hardly the treatment that many influential US voices might prefer for the “iconic” institution.Some of this logic has valid counter-arguments, of course – including the view, aired here a couple of days ago, that US equities trading is still nowhere near a level to worry anti-trust authorities. And Deutsche Börse’s plans for NYSE Euronext face their own considerable anti-trust hurdles at the level of derivatives markets in Europe.But so far the message in Frankfurt is that there is no need to deviate from merger plans, which have been presented as a delicately weighted balance between Deutsche Börse and NYSE that give shareholders of the German group 60 per cent of the new company.Significantly altering that balance, perhaps by adding a cash component to Deutsche Börse’s offer, may not be easy and is not being considered at this stage, a person close to the company says.But one thing the German group could consider doing in conjunction with NYSE Euronext is revising its estimates of the cost synergies to be obtained from the deal. Some analysts have said they think the original €300m estimate is conservative – potentially giving the Germans some wiggle room if they want to find a little more for investors.Deutsche Börse is due a break-up fee of €250m/$340m if the NYSE deal does not go ahead – which people familiar with the German group hope will also persuade NYSE investors that the 19 per cent premium offered by Nasdaq and ICE is less attractive than billed.All in all, the prevailing view from Frankfurt is that the Nasdaq/ICE attention is not a crisis but a complication – and there are still plenty of them to come.Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse’s chief executive, has said in other contexts that creating volume in some of his group’s businesses is “a marathon, not a sprint”. So it will also be with his attempted transatlantic merger.
497;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-05T09:26:53Z;Quick View: What next for Singapore and the ASX?;;Five months ago SGX kicked off the current wave of global exchange consolidation by unveiling a merger with ASX, its Australian counterpart.But on Tuesday the deal was effectively killed by federal treasurer Wayne Swan. He said he was “disposed” to rule that it was not in the country’s national interest. Although he said this was not his final decision, that’s more or less it.This is a bit of a shocker on two counts, even though the deal had run into political opposition the moment it was unveiled last October, and clearly had stoked national interest concerns.The last time a big deal was blocked in Australia was as far back as 2001 when Shell was trying to take over Woodside Petroleum.Second, the timing. It comes a week before the country’s Foreign Investment Review Board was due to make a decision under a statutory deadline timetable of 30 days. It’s unusual that a decision would be made before that deadline. There was even a further 90-day period baked into the process that won’t come into play either.The feeling in Canberra is that with so much on his plate, including a looming budget, Mr Swan felt he needed to decide this thing quickly and get it out of the way.The temptation will also be there to see this as a somewhat populist move. After all, the proposed SGX-ASX deal marked the first time that one country’s exchange was proposing to take over another country’s (aside from the Nasdaq takeover of OMX, the Nordic network of bourses, and the Vienna exchange’s purchase of Budapest and Ljubljana).So, what next? There are at least two implications for ASX.First, it puts the ASX back in play as exchange consolidation continues. Packs of bankers are roaming the globe trying to persuade exchange chief executives that they can not be left out of this game and need to do deals.The obvious play is to become part of the London Stock Exchange’s proposed merger with TMX Group of Canada, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses. That deal is a play on natural resources and mining listings, in which the two exchanges are world leaders. ASX is strong there too. And all three exchanges are in Commonwealth countries – same language, legal system. That’s compelling.But a deal would be hard given that Canberra’s already signalled it wants ASX to stay independent.Second, now that ASX looks set to stay independent, its shareholders will have to realise that it will never again be valued this highly. Its shares were at A$41.75 at their peak the day after the SGX deal was announced. It is a measure of the effect of political doubts that they have slumped back some way below where they were the day before the SGX deal was unveiled. ASX shares closed on Tuesday at A$33.70 compared to the A$34.96 they traded at before the SGX approach became public.At the same time, the ASX is about to feel the cold blast of competition in share trading as new entrants – like Chi-X - establish a beachhead for the first time in Australia. The ASX has done a good job of preparing itself for competition.But consider this scenario, suggested by Niki Beattie of Market Structure Partners, a London-based consultancy: what happens if a small privately owned trading platform like Chi-X takes a 30 per cent market share and then sells out to an Asian exchange. How does the Australian government react?At least with SGX the ASX had a strong partner that would have helped it grow in Asia and compete better at home.Both exchanges said they would continue to explore ways to co-operate. I think that even without a corporate merger, there is plenty that SGX chief executive Magnus Böcker and his ASX counterpart, Bob Elstone, can still do.Mr Böcker told me a few weeks ago at a Florida conference that this was “an opportunity-driven merger”, not driven by any regulatory changes. Both exchanges could still grow without merging, but could grow even faster together. If the deal didn’t work, they could still explore cross-listing of products, and shared distribution.Finally, back to the London Stock Exchange and TMX Group. They will be watching this very closely as their deal also faces a “national interest” test in Canada.On Monday an Ontario legislative committee investigating the LSE-TMX deal delayed publication of its report, which had been due to by Thursday. The committee’s findings are likely to play an influential role in decisions by the federal and Ontario government on whether to allow the deal to go forward. Under the Investment Canada Act, the LSE and TMX must show that the deal provides a “net benefit” to Canada.The lesson for all these exchange M&A deals is that no matter how much due diligence you do with your advisers on likely regulatory obstacles, it is almost impossible to predict and plan for political opposition.It will be interesting to see if this starts to infect the even bigger deals out there: Nasdaq OMX’s proposed joint counterbid with IntercontinentalExchange for NYSE Euronext, for one.
498;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-04T18:16:06Z;M&A: careful on the financing;Highly leveraged deals not in vogue;Yes to deals, but careful on the financing. That is a reasonable summary of the recent trends in mergers and acquisitions. In the first quarter of 2011, announced cash-only deals accounted for 53 per cent of the total deal value, the lowest proportion since 2001, according to Mergermarket. Whether or not shares are a good deal, cheap financing is not encouraging highly leveraged deals.Consider NYSE-Euronext. It agreed to an all-stock deal from Deutsche Börse and is considering a 66 per cent stock deal from Nasdaq and ICE. Cash is not king. Monday’s big deals may look different. Solvay for Rhodia (€3.4bn), Vivendi to Vodafone (€8bn) and Minmetals for Equinox (C$6.3bn) were all cash offers. But these deals are not efforts to stretch balance sheets.Solvay is just trying to improve a painfully flabby financial structure. The Belgian chemicals maker has €2.9bn of net cash (€5.7bn gross), but paid €146m of net interest expense in 2010 (23 per cent of operating profit), thanks to a 5.1 per cent interest rate on €2.8bn of debt. Even at a 44 per cent premium share price, French Rhodia will bring a better return than cash. Its product diversification, emerging markets exposure, greenhouse gas emission rights and synergies are also welcome.Vivendi’s acquisition of the minority interests in a French mobile phone partnership is more financially aggressive, as the company starts with €3.9bn of net debt. But more than half of the deal is funded by the €5.8bn sale of its stake in NBC-Universal. The company is determined to keep its triple B rating.And Minmetals? Equinox might stretch the balance sheet of the Hong Kong company making the actual offer. The ultimate backer, though, is the Chinese government, which has more low-yielding foreign cash than it knows what to do with.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
499;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-04T17:57:31Z;Greek stocks fall on fear of debt reduction measures;;European markets edged higher on Monday but banks continued to suffer and Greek stocks fell amid speculation about possible measures to reduce the country’s debt.The Athens SE General Index was down 2.2 per cent to 1,492.44 after a report that suggested the International Monetary Fund was pressing Greece to restructure its debt. The IMF later denied this.Speculation that the 2010 budget deficit could be revised upwards added to investor concerns and Piraeus Bank fell 5.8 per cent to €1.31, with EFG Eurobank losing 4.1 per cent to €4.10.In Italy, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena lost 1.9 per cent to €0.88 as newspapers claimed it was considering a €2bn capital increase. UBI Banca, Popolare di Milano, Banco Popolare and UniCredit also fell by more than 1 per cent, but Intesa Sanpaolo reversed losses to gain 1 per cent to €2.13 after its Slovakian subsidiary VUB announced a €59.7m dividend.Fresenius Medical, the dialysis provider, rose 2.2 per cent to €49.31 in Frankfurt after Citigroup raised its price target to €55. RWE rose 1.4 per cent to €46.29 after reports that Germany would build or refurbish 51 power plants in the next eight years, and following the company’s threat to sue the state over its decision to idle seven nuclear plants.Deutsche Börse slipped 1.4 per cent to €52.05 after its bid to acquire NYSE Euronext was threatened by a rival offer from Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental Exchange.In France, Alstom rose 1.7 per cent to €43.91 after winning a €650m contract to provide equipment to a coal-fired power plant in Malaysia. Vivendi climbed 0.6 per cent to €20.64 after agreeing the €7.95bn purchase of Vodafone’s 44 per cent stake in SFR, giving Vivendi full ownership of France’s second-largest mobile phone company.Banks lost ground, however, with SocGen down 2.8 per cent to €45.81, helping the CAC 40 index slide 0.1 per cent to 4,046.20.Irish banks maintained their pattern of Friday following stress test results on Thursday. Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks continued to rise after their additional capital requirements proved smaller than some people had feared: they climbed 9.3 per cent to €0.34, and 9.5 per cent to €0.23 respectively. But Irish Life, which was shown to need €4bn in new capital, fell 16.2 per cent to €0.14.Nokia gained 1.8 per cent to €6.10 in Helsinki after Stephen Elop, chief executive, said the company was set to take on Apple by entering the tablet device market.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.04 per cent to 1,141.86.
500;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-03T20:38:59Z;Investors in NYSE face deal choices;;Shareholders in the NYSE Euronext have – potentially – an interesting decision to make.The $11.3bn counterbid by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange for the NYSE offers investors a premium of about 19 per cent, based on Thursday’s stock prices, to the deal agreed with Deutsche Börse in February.But where New York’s tie-up with Frankfurt promised global scale, emerging markets exposure and a strong presence in derivatives, Nasdaq and ICE are instead asking shareholders to plump for old-fashioned consolidation, based around cost-cutting and management teams with a track record in delivering promised savings.Nasdaq and ICE’s spoiler bid includes the highly unusual feature of offering stock in two companies. As well as limiting the debt required, shareholders are being offered ongoing exposure to both the fiercely competitive cash equities business and a company focused on higher-margin derivatives trading.As well as about a third of the consideration in cash, investors get a stake in what feels like the past and the future of the exchanges industry.The first decision, however, falls to NYSE’s board. It must determine whether Nasdaq’s offer might lead to a “superior” proposal compared with the Deutsche Börse deal.That is not a choice purely based on value. NYSE’s team must also consider the relative risks of the two proposals, including the likelihood of antitrust problems. Deutsche Börse’s deal faces European resistance to combining the German group’s Eurex derivatives business with NYSE’s Liffe platform, while Nasdaq must justify putting together the two largest US listings venues.In addition, the fact that the Deutsche Börse deal was billed as an all-stock merger gives NYSE some additional flexibility under US law. The group has not – officially at least – committed to a sale and therefore is not yet obliged simply to find the highest price.Privately, NYSE’s camp concedes that Nasdaq’s proposal is one they must seriously consider. Aside from the higher price, Nasdaq and ICE say they have identified about $800m in total cost savings – double what the German exchange had laid out.Deutsche Börse will also be considering its next steps. Assuming NYSE bites, allowing Nasdaq and ICE access to the company’s private information, the German group faces a strategic quandary, argue some advisers.Bridging the gap between its proposal and the Nasdaq’s will be tough using only stock. On Friday, Deutsche Börse’s share price fell 1.38 per cent, aptly demonstrating how its own investor base might diminish its firepower.Adding cash to its offer – which the company has capacity to do – would risk upsetting the delicately constructed story around the NYSE deal, with its balanced board and dual headquarters. The deal would start to more clearly resemble a takeover of the US exchange by a foreign bidder.Should Deutsche Börse fight for NYSE, it has certain advantages. Under the terms of its deal, it has the right to match a competing proposal before NYSE’s board changes its recommendation and can demand that its deal is put to shareholders. It is also due a $340m fee if the deal does not go ahead.However, people close to the company argue that the German group may choose not to go into battle. While Deutsche Börse’s target for $400m in cost synergies was conservative, they add, the company probably cannot promise the $610m, before savings passed on to customers, that Nasdaq thinks it can achieve, with an extra $200m on offer from ICE.Given its rivals’ ambitious goal, the German group could let them take on the messy business of disentangling NYSE’s operations, instead looking for opportunities elsewhere.Turning to Asia is one possibility, where Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, after a long period of isolationism, is exploring its international options.Politicians, too, have thinking to do. While the Deutsche Börse deal caused some angst in Washington, a Nasdaq/NYSE combination is likely to involve more job losses than the German proposal – something the interlopers have thus far declined to elucidate.Charles Schumer, the Democratic senator for New York, on Friday expressed concern about job losses for the city. Nasdaq’s all-American solution still faces a long road to success.Additional reporting by James Wilson
501;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-02T03:33:06Z;Bold move by Nasdaq and ICE;;When the wave of exchanges mergers reached a peak of intensity five weeks ago with Germany’s Deutsche Börse proposing to merge with the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, Robert Greifeld quickly reached for the phone.The chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, rival to the NYSE Euronext, wanted to suggest making a counterbid with Jeff Sprecher, his counterpart at IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), a big US exchange.To many, his call may have seemed a long shot. The German-US combination would create the largest bourse in the world by most measures. Nasdaq is ninth-largest by its own market capitalisation, smaller even than the exchange in Singapore.Mr Greifeld admitted on Friday: “There was an air of disbelief and we certainly saw it as an opportunity that we had not anticipated.” But he and Mr Sprecher teamed up in brassy bid to break up the larger deal.Essentially, the two men are making a string of big bets. The first is that their proposal – which will not involve the two companies merging – will skirt a knotty antitrust issue that their rivals now face. Deutsche Börse and NYSE propose to combine their Eurex and Liffe derivatives platforms in Europe, creating a near-monopoly in these high-margin financial products. Brussels has already signalled a long and deep probe.But in a coup for Mr Sprecher, ICE would grab the Liffe business. That would give ICE a substantial presence in European derivatives and in the US at a time when expected interest rate rises are likely to drive volumes in key interest rate derivatives that are Liffe’s biggest contracts.Sang Lee, managing partner at Aite Group, a consultancy, said: “In my mind ICE looks the potential winner as it gives them an instant entry to derivatives outside the US. Liffe is not a small piece of the puzzle, it puts them on a par versus CME and Eurex.”Crucially, however, this would also maintain Liffe as an independent competitor for Eurex – neutralising the antitrust issue.London would benefit since the Liffe business looks set to be demoted under the German-US deal, where much of its operations could move to Frankfurt, designated the combined group’s global derivatives business hub.At the same time, New York’s position as a leading global listings venue would be strengthened by the proposed combination of Nasdaq and NYSE’s US share trading venues, of which the flagship is the New York Stock Exchange.Mr Greifeld would not say what jobs would be lost as a result of combining the two equities businesses – a potential political hot potato in the US. But he at least pledged not to close the NYSE trading floor.Nasdaq may not face antitrust problems in the US either. While combining the share trading of NYSE and Nasdaq unifies the two biggest platforms in New York, combined they will still only account for 52 per cent of US share trading, according to Thomson Reuters.With US regulators concerned that share trading may be dispersed across too many trading platforms, Mr Greifeld has cleverly read the regulatory mood. “There’s an opportunity to begin to reassemble liquidity and renew investor confidence in US equity markets,” he told analysts.Yet, for NYSE shareholders, the decision will be whether the allure of cash and shares in ICE and Nasdaq outweigh the all-share offer from Deutsche Börse.ICE, the world’s fourth-largest exchange and one of its most profitable, is a strong business. Nasdaq is exposed to the lower-margin cash equities business but analysts credit Mr Greifeld for cutting costs.Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said, “They’ve made this game interesting. It’s higher risk-higher reward [than New York-Deutsche Börse] but they’ve made the numbers credible because there’s more overlap in the businesses and you can’t discredit them.”Until NYSE responds to the offer, none of this theory can be put to the test.So far, according to Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James: “The only clear winner here is NYSE Euronext shareholders …It’s shaping up to be a soap opera”.Lex
502;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-01T23:38:43Z;US exchanges in $11bn NYSE bid;;Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange have challenged a plan to create the world’s largest exchange, making an $11.3bn offer for NYSE Euronext weeks after it had agreed a merger with Deutsche Börse.Friday’s counter-bid, which Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, described as “an unexpected opportunity”, suggests that a wave of exchange consolidation triggered five months ago has entered a new phase. The world’s biggest bourses are fighting for pole position in a hyper-competitive industry confronted with regulatory changes.The battle for NYSE will also shape the fates of the world’s leading financial centres. Nasdaq-ICE’s cash-and-share offer would bolster New York’s position as a global listings centre, while strengthening London’s position in derivatives.Nasdaq OMX and Atlanta-based ICE are proposing to pay $42.50 a share for NYSE Euronext – 19 per cent above Deutsche Börse’s all-share bid. It is also 27 per cent higher than NYSE Euronext’s share price on February 8, the day before the owner of the New York Stock Exchange said it was in talks with its German rival.According to Nasdaq OMX and ICE, their spoiler bid would create “a unified US equities market” and “ensure that the US is better able to compete globally in a rapidly changing international market for equity trading and capital-raising”.“Our industry is undergoing a period of historic change,” Mr Greifeld added. “During the last five years, more than 90 per cent of the top 100 global listings chose not to list in the US, depriving US investors of the opportunity to easily invest and trade in these companies.”If successful, the deal would also give ICE a US futures business to compete with the CME Group in Chicago and Deutsche Börse in Europe.“We have the backdrop of a new regulatory regime sweeping the world and these markets are changing as we speak,” said Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive. “Bob [Greifeld] and I will be able to set the example … as to how [these] businesses should be formed as we move towards greater transparency and a better market structure.”In the wake of the global financial crisis, leaders from the G20 nations advocated reforms that would move previously opaque derivatives trading on to formal trading platforms, to be processed by clearing houses.Under their proposal, ICE would buy NYSE Euronext’s futures businesses, known as NYSE Liffe, while Nasdaq OMX takes over NYSE’s remaining operations including the Euronext group of stock exchanges in New York, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon, as well as its US options business.As a result, Nasdaq OMX would acquire a presence in pan-European share trading which combined with its existing Nordic business, would be able to challenge Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange. Nasdaq and NYSE, meanwhile, would merge their trading, listings, options and market technology businesses.Nasdaq and ICE plan to finance the acquisition through cash-on-hand and a combined $3.8bn “financing commitment” from a syndicate of banks led by Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The two exchanges said they could save $740m within three years. Neither disclosed how many jobs could be lost, although Mr Greifeld pledged not to close NYSE’s famous trading floor.Standard & Poor’s placed the credit ratings of NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq on watch pending the outcome of the bid, saying the combined company would have about $6.5bn in debt and warning that the “key credit metrics, at least initially, would not be those of an investment-grade company”.NYSE Euronext shares were up 12.6 per cent at the close. Nasdaq was up 9.25 per cent but ICE dropped 3 per cent.Nasdaq and ICE said they believed they could “secure EU competition clearance in contrast to the expectation of a deep and extended probe for the proposed Deutsche Börse’s transaction”.Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would together dominate European derivatives trading by controlling Liffe and Eurex, the Börse’s futures exchange. But that dominant position is likely to be a key part of European antitrust scrutiny of the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse deal.Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Evercore Partners are advising Nasdaq OMX, while ICE has retained Lazard, Broadhaven Capital Partners and BMO Capital Markets.
503;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-01T21:05:37Z;US equities rise after positive jobs data;;The second quarter of the year kicked off on a high note after better-than-expected non-farm payrolls data, while elsewhere on Wall Street shares in NYSE Euronext were in focus after news of a second bid for the exchange.Shares in the largest stock exchange in the US were up 12.6 per cent to $39.60 after rivals Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) made an $11.3bn cash and share offer for NYSE, only weeks after it had already agreed a merger with Deutsche Börse.The rival bid is offering $42.50 a share for the company, representing a 19 per cent premium over Deutsche Börse’s offer last month.It is still far from clear which bid, if any, will actually go through – which explains why the stock did not jump the full 19 per cent.Shares in Nasdaq were up 9.3 per cent to $28.23 on the news while ICE lost 3.1 per cent to $119.75. In Europe, shares in Deutsche Börse also lost ground.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,332.41 following a strong non-farm payrolls number, helping the index to post a 1.4 per cent gain over the week.Data by the US Labor Department showed 216,000 jobs were formed in March, better than the 190,000 expected and the largest increase in jobs since May. Unemployment fell to 8.8 per cent from 8.9 per cent.“The data reinforce the widely accepted view that the US economy is gaining momentum, which ultimately bodes well for risk assets,” said Joseph Tanious, market strategist at JPMorgan Funds.But “as the economy improves the Fed is less likely to keep this accommodative monetary policy in place”, said Mr Tanious.That concern was given weight in the session by Charles Plosser, the Philadelphia Fed president, who said interest rates may have to go up in the “not-too-distant future” to limit inflation.“The employment data [have] encouraged the hawks at the Fed, but there are still many fewer of them and so it is likely that the earliest rates will go up will be the fourth quarter this year and more likely early next year,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 12,374.75 in the session, also helped by a strong ISM number suggesting US manufacturing was expanding at a robust pace.The Nasdaq Composite added 0.3 per cent to 2,789.60. The Dow and the Nasdaq were up 1.3 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively over the week.In corporate news, Ford Motor reported a 19 per cent gain in US sales from March 2010, overtaking General Motors as North America’s top-selling carmaker. Shares in Ford were up 1.7 per cent to $15.16.The previous session saw the close of the best first quarter in the US markets since 1998, with the S&P 500 rising 5.6 per cent in the three-month period.These gains were in spite of headwinds from Middle East turmoil, the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the Japanese disaster.The markets have generally been inclined to shrug off such bad news to date this year and to focus on positive indicators at a broad sense of optimism about the US economy.But markets have been volatile, falling 6.4 per cent in four weeks on worries about Japan and the Middle East, before bouncing almost all the way back in the following month.This week saw markets similarly resilient in the face of mixed economic data. For example, figures from the Conference Board on Tuesday found consumer confidence slumped in March on gloom about the economy. But the markets were still up 0.7 per cent on that day.Both the weekly employment number and housing data during the week were also disappointing, but the markets still strode forward.Among stocks in focus was Berkshire Hathaway, which fell 1.8 per cent to $83.65 at news that David Sokol, a leading contender to succeed Warren Buffett as chief executive, had resigned only weeks after the investment company agreed to purchase Lubrizol for $9bn.Mr Sokol had traded in and out of Lubrizol stock before recommending it to Mr Buffett.Elsewhere Valeant, an acquisitive speciality pharmaceutical company, was up 18.5 per cent to $53.26 over the week after saying it was making a $5.7bn hostile offer for Cephalon, another drugmaker. The target company added 31.3 per cent to $76.04 over the five days.
504;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-01T19:41:29Z;Nasdaq / ICE;Hopes of seeing off another nasty foreigner;George Washington was also aided by ice as he famously crossed the Delaware River to rout the British in 1776. This time America’s Nasdaq OMX has patriot IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) by its side as it hopes to see off another nasty foreigner. Certainly Nasdaq and ICE’s attack shows Washington-style gusto. Its cash and share offer for NYSE Euronext is a fifth higher than that implied by the so-called merger with Deutsche Börse and a 27 per cent premium to the target’s undisturbed price.Like Washington’s advance, the Nasdaq bid appears strategically bonkers compared with the Deutsche Börse deal. The latter has the potential for genuine size and geographic breadth. More importantly, NYSE shareholders would suddenly become all-powerful in high-margin derivatives, with a combined 37 per cent of revenues coming from derivatives and clearing. By acquiring NYSE, in contrast, Nasdaq doubles down in highly competitive cash equities trading and would emerge with only a combined 13 per cent of revenues from derivatives.As industry consolidation continued, Nasdaq had to do something or risk being a footnote in exchange history. On its side are an expected $610m of total annual cost synergies and a better track record than Deutsche Börse in delivering them. Taxed and capitalised, that equates to an equity value of 1.5 times the size of the premium Nasdaq and ICE are offering above the undisturbed equity capitalisation of NYSE.Even at only half the size, the cost synergies from the Deutsche Börse deal also exceed the premium offered. If nothing else, that suggests – assuming that the cuts are delivered – that NYSE shareholders should hold out for more money, whoever it comes from. Normally, more generous terms from Deutsche Börse would be enough to see off Nasdaq. But with national flags waving and regulators mobilising on both sides of the Atlantic, this battle has only just begun.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
505;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-01T18:09:34Z;Plain-speaking operators forge alliance;;Around the exchange sector, there will be little surprise that a bid to break up the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Borse merger is being launched by Robert “Bob” Greifeld of Nasdaq OMX, and Jeffrey Sprecher of IntercontinentalExchange.The two plain-spoken men share reputations as aggressive consolidators. Both have previously made hostile, though failed, bids for rivals, Mr Greifeld for the London Stock Exchange, and Mr Sprecher for the Chicago Board of Trade.On Friday, they said they had learnt from past efforts and that their joint $13.3bn bid to split NYSE Euronext was driven in part by their personal partnership.“I think we both became more and more convinced we had the right partners,” Mr Greifeld said.Mr Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq since 2003, was an outsider to the clubby world of New York exchanges, having formerly been an executive at a west coast technology company. Leaning on his experience, Mr Greifeld acquired Instinet, the electronic marketplace, in 2005, and the OMX Group of Nordic exchanges in 2007. The failed bid for the LSE in 2006 raised questions about Mr Greifeld’s leadership, as Nasdaq and LSE had previously discussed a mutual partnership. Nasdaq has also lost key executives under him. But he has continued to charge ahead, launching new equity marketplaces in the US and buying the PHLX options market.Like Mr Greifeld, Mr Sprecher began his career elsewhere, in the power industry in the 1980s. He developed important ties with Wall Street, which enabled him to found ICE in 2000, take the company public in 2005 and entering the credit default-swap clearing business by establishing ICE Trust in 2009 in consortium with the big dealer banks. In just over a decade, ICE has become a critical financial institution and demonstrated Mr Sprecher’s skill as a dealmaker, with moves for the International Petroleum Exchange in London in 2001 and the New York Board of Trade in 2007.While his bid to break up the Chicago Mercantile Group’s merger with CBOT in 2007 was unsuccessful, Mr Sprecher said he came away with a higher profile and forced his main competitor to increase its offer price.
506;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-01T17:03:18Z;ICE-Nasdaq bid: What they are saying;;"Nasdaq OMX has teamed up IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) to make an $11.3bn offer for NYSE Euronext. Here is some early comment on the deal.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX: “I never thought we’d get the opportunity to bid for NYSE. I was surprised when we got the chance. We will deleverage in around 18 months, then look at a capital return programme that could include dividends.“We think these steps will be positively received by all. We’re keeping the NYSE floor. There should be no scepticism about that statement.”“The synergies comes from consolidating the platforms. We have the ability to process every transaction on our processors.”Jeff Sprecher, chief executive and chairman of ICE: “I have become convinced that this is the right thing for the market and the right thing for ICE shareholders. This merger is about who can take cuts out of the business. Bob [Greifeld] and I have engineered a deal that does it much better.”On the creation of ICE-NYSE LiffeJeff Sprecher: “I see Liffe better as a nimbler competitor to Deutsche Börse and CME Group. It would also allow London to remain a competitor on the derivatives world. It would be creating a strong global derivatives player but not a dominant one. It would bring [into Europe] a new asset class of interest rates clearing.”Diego Perfumo, analyst at Equity Research Desk: “The New York-Deustche Borse deal didn’t change the landscape for ICE. But when somebody like Nasdaq comes in, it creates an opportunistic deal for ICE. The deal terms are will within what synergies ICE can achieve. They may be paying a bit more than expected, but they are getting more too, such as parts of the equity derivatives business. ICE and Liffe have significant cost synergies in Europe, and some potential revenue syergies in the US as well. Oil traders can now trade interest rate derivaitves with them, too.”On prospects for a renewed offer from Deutsche BörseAnalysts at Citi: “Deutsche Börse could support €666m additional borrowings, or $940m, which is 27 per cent above valuation before the Deutsche Börse offer. Adding in 50 per cent existing on balance sheet cash resources, we believe Deutsche Börse could offer an extra $6 per share, enabling them to match Nasdaq-ICE’s offer. Nasdaq/ICE is targeting $740m synergies by the end of the third year – $540m from Nasdaq/NYSE combination, $200m from ICE/Euronext. This compares to Deutsche Börse’s €300m cost synergies and €100m revenue synergies. But we believe Deutsche Börse and NYSE were lowballing the synergies achievable.”Market share and effect on US equity tradingThomson Reuters: Nasdaq and NYSE Euronext account for 51.75 per cent of all reported US equity trading in 2010. That is almost 5 times the size of the next biggest exchange, BATS, with 11.45 per cent.Additionally, the data shows that in global terms the combination would represent 33.7 per cent of all reported activity in US, European & Asia stocks compared with the 22.4 per cent share that the combination of Deutsche Börse & NYSE Euronext represents.Anthony Conroy, head of trading at BNY ConvergEx said: “One centralised exchange would help alleviate the fragmentation of US equity trading.”Sang Lee, managing partner at Aite Group: “In the short team, it makes sense to consolidate US cash equities trading and a combined Nasdaq and NYSE would give them a decent position in US equity options.”“The move by Nasdaq is not a surprise and you have to think both NYSE and Deutsche Börse have a contingency plan to counter this.”“In my mind ICE looks the potential winner as it gives them an instant entry to derivatives outside the US. Liffe is not a small piece of the puzzle; it puts them on a par versus CME and Eurex [part of Deutsche Börse].“For shareholdersDiego Perfumo, analyst at Equity Research Desk: “As a shareholder, I might feel more comfortable waiting for someone like LSE or Singapore to come in and buy Nasdaq in two years, avoiding the significant execution risk in integrating the platforms and trying to deleverage.”Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James: “The only clear winner here is NYX [NYSE] shareholders. We are sceptical about the upside for Nasdaq OMX…. Although Nasdaq OMX will certainly be able to create substantial synergies and more operating scale, an acquisition of NYSE Euronext’s US equities and options businesses would represent a doubling down on businesses that are currently out of favour with investors.”“Another failed hostile bid might be frowned upon by [ICE] investors,” he added."
507;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-04-01T16:16:09Z;Quick View: Does Nasdaq-ICE move make sense?;;"“Seizing the NYSE Euronext Opportunity”.That is the headline on one of 34 slides that Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange are showing to persuade analysts of the merits to their plan to bust up the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse deal.It is bold and brassy – typical of both Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, and Jeff Sprecher, his counterpart at ICE.The length of time that it took for Mr Greifeld to show his hand after his rival, Duncan Niederauer at NYSE Euronext, did his deal with Deutsche Börse’s Reto Francioni had many wondering if he really did plan to try and break up the deal.With $2.1bn of debt on Nasdaq’s balance sheet, many wondered if Mr Greifeld could pull something off, even with the aid of ICE and bank financing that is not yet fully committed. Only weeks ago Mr Sprecher was on the record saying how hard it was to break up mergers that already have been agreed. He seemed to be signalling he had doubts. Something must have happened since then, because he now has none.But does the Nasdaq-ICE plan stack up? It is actually a pretty clever play on three counts, quite apart form the fat premium that NYSE Euronext shareholders are being offered (which includes cash, unlike the DB/NYSE deal).First, it should pose far fewer regulatory issues than the DB/NYSE deal.On the US cash equities side, Nasdaq would combine with NYSE’s business, creating a single pool of liquidity. Some might suggest a US antitrust issue here, but I would not jump to that conclusion.The story of US cash equities market structure in the very recent past has been one of fragmentation – excessive fragmentation, in the minds of many including Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Mary Schapiro. Since the “ flash crash” she repeatedly has said that this has made it hard for investors to navigate markets and know what they are dealing with.By bringing Nasdaq and NYSE together – in effect re-aggregating liquidity – Mr Greifeld would be reversing that trend. Regulators will like that. And a combined Nasdaq/NYSE would still only account for just more than half of US equity trading – nowhere near enough to be a worry to antitrust people. Let us not forget that there are plenty of competitors in share trading - such as BATS Global Markets, Direct Edge, brokers and dark pools.Second, Mr Greifeld argues that the US needs a bigger listings champion at a time when the US has seen its leadership eroded here. Fair enough. Why have Nasdaq and NYSE continue to compete to drive listings to the US when you have London with a free run out of the UK. Then there’s Asia, and on the analyst call, Mr Greifeld cited the potential listing of Prada, the Italian luxury goods group, in Hong Kong as a missed opportunity.Also, competition is on the horizon in the US listings business, thanks to the announcement only the other day BATS plans to launch a primary listings platform. Mr Greifeld told me how “grateful” he was to BATS for that.Third, unlike the DB/NYSE deal, this sidesteps completely any antitrust issue over derivatives in Europe. ICE would take London-based Liffe, continuing its existence as a standalone business, while DB/NYSE will probably face a deep and lengthy antitrust probe of its plan to create a virtual monopoly in European derivatives in the form of Eurex and Liffe.And at the same time it gives ICE a big derivatives presence in Europe, where ICE already has a clearing house in London. That will be boosted by plans, unveiled by Mr Sprecher on a call, to expand into interest rate swaps clearing. At the same time, ICE will take over NYSE Liffe US, which has just started competing against CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, in interest rate and Treasury bond futures.For Europeans, this will all look like the consolidation of US ownership of European market structures. But there is little they can do about it; that is not an antitrust issue.Nasdaq OMX has been slipping down the rankings of global exchanges and is the most leveraged of its peers. But Nasdaq is still investment grade, and the cash flow from this proposed deal, Mr Greifeld says, will get his business back to “normal capital velocity” 18 months after the proposed deal has closed.Mr Greifeld has a record as a deal maker, cost-cutter and integrator. So does Mr Sprecher. Both men admitted on Friday that their proposed deal “fell into their laps” after they saw the DB/NYSE tie-up. As opportunistic as it may look, it might just work."
508;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-03-28T19:35:24Z;Delta Air Lines shifts fuel hedges out of US benchmark;;Delta Air Lines, one of the world’s largest carriers, has shifted almost all its jet fuel hedges away from US crude in the latest sign that the benchmark has run into trouble as a tool to manage energy costs.Delta and other US airlines have traditionally purchased contracts for US benchmark crude oil to hedge volatile jet fuel costs. Jet fuel is refined from crude oil and usually tracks its price.But this year the US crude benchmark, known as West Texas Intermediate, has lagged behind the 27 per cent rise in jet fuel, creating difficulties for US airlines. The rise in Brent, a European benchmark, has been more in line with the jet fuel trend.“We’ve needed to restructure our hedge position,” Ed Bastian, Delta president, told a conference last week. The airline spent $7.6bn on fuel and related taxes in 2010.“WTI, which is the instrument that many of us hedge in this market, has dislocated from Brent in terms of pricing.”The US benchmark has sold at a rare discount of $10 per barrel to Brent for most of this year as a glut developed at the Oklahoma delivery point for WTI crude futures traded on CME Group’s New York Mercantile Exchange.With supplies pouring in from the US and Canada, analysts said the disparity of WTI with Brent and other grades might persist until pipelines reconnect the landlocked delivery point with waterborne markets along the Gulf of Mexico. This could take years.US airlines seeking long-term protection against oil price swings have tended to favour crude oil to refined products because the market is more transparent and heavily traded. Delta uses a combination of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap and option contracts to manage fuel costs.Mr Bastian said Delta had “converted, over the course of the last 45 days, nearly all of our WTI positions” to Brent or heating oil.JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America have also raised concerns about the discrepancy between WTI and jet fuel.Energy exchanges are trying to take advantage of the shift. IntercontinentalExchange, the main Brent futures venue, on March 14 launched futures contracts that track the spread between heating oil, a jet fuel proxy, and Brent. ICE cited “requests from US-based market participants”. On Monday CME listed a similar contract.
509;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-03-21T23:34:13Z;Electronic auctions popular for less liquid derivatives;;"Attention among regulators in Washington and derivatives dealers is being focused on how quickly the most liquid types of swaps will trade electronically, or with minimal human or ‘voice’ assistance, on proposed new platforms known as swap execution facilities.Electronic trading is already flourishing, however, in parts of the over-the-counter market that were expected to remain ‘voice territory’ for some time.So-called matching services or auction sessions are being regularly offered by interdealer brokerages such as Vyapar, BGC, GFI and Creditex during the trading day for dealers in less liquid over-the-counter derivatives markets such as options on interest rate swaps, credit derivatives and inflation swaps.This counters the long-held assertion by dealers that complicated derivative structures, such as options, can only be transacted via voice brokers and not on screens.The auctions concentrate liquidity for a few minutes between multiple dealers. That enables a dealer to price and execute trades far more quickly than relying on voice brokers to find another dealer willing to either buy or sell an option in what are fairly illiquid markets for most of the day.“The auctions help us move risk quickly and anonymously, which can be difficult to do in the voice-brokered market,” says Mayank Chamadia, head of US dollar interest rate options trading at Barclays Capital.GFI began using matching for some credit derivatives in 2006 and has expanded from markets in Europe to Asia, North America and Latin America. Other brokers such as Creditex have also been active in providing matching services for trades in credit.Vyapar started their Volmax service last June in the dollar market and to date have held more than a 1,000 trading sessions in over-the-counter interest rate options and derivatives and executed $250bn in notional trades.The head of swaps trading at a major dealer in New York said: “It’s an underutilised method of trading. Generally, this is a risk reduction trade and to a certain extent we are price indifferent, we just want to the get the risk of a trade off our books.”The growing popularity of the auctions is seen opening up markets such as interest rate options to more customers, one of the aims of Dodd Frank.“Given the regulatory environment, we do want to see more transparency and liquidity in the options market, as it will encourage more participants,” says Mr Chamadia.The use of short-lived electronic auctions is seen by brokers as emulating the essential requirements of Sefs (swap execution facilities).“The Volmax platform meets the spirit of Sefs,” says Vinayek Singh, chief executive officer at Vyapar. “Prices are provided by multiple parties; the platform establishes a fair price for multilateral trading; and all orders and trades are processed electronically,” he adds.It means electronic trading under Dodd Frank could rapidly capture much of the US derivatives market.Matt Woodhams, head of data and analytics at GFI, says its matching service helps markets naturally evolve from voice to electronic trading that is dominated by central limit order books, or CLOBs.“Matching focuses liquidity into a very small window that enables people to transact, but over time, dealers want to interact more with screen as liquidity keeps building,” he said. “In Europe we have gone past the matching stage in a number of markets to interactive screen trading and where liquidity now facilitates CLOBs for credit derivatives and foreign exchange options.”He expects a similar evolution in US derivatives as the market moves towards Sefs."
510;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Eurex aims to allay clearing default fears;;Eurex Clearing, the clearing house owned by Deutsche Börse, is seeking to address a key concern of market participants over the risk to which they can be exposed when traders default on deals put through a clearing house.The clearer also said it would expand into over-the-counter interest rate swaps and equity derivatives clearing, as it tries to catch up with rivals CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange and LCH.Clearnet, which have all launched OTC derivatives clearing to take advantage of regulatory changes under the Dodd-Frank act in the US.Eurex Clearing plans to expand its derivatives clearing service to allow clients of a clearing member to shift their positions and margin to another sound clearing member if the first clearing member defaults.The process, called portability, insulates the margin of the client of a defaulting clearing member from the administrator handling the default of another clearing member. It also does so if the clearing member is brought down by the default of one of its clients.Usually the margin payments of market participants are held at clearing houses mixed in with that of others in “omnibus” accounts. But many so-called buyside market participants, such as asset managers, worry that their funds would be used to bail out other market participants, and could not be legally segregated, or separated, from the margins of others in the case of a default and subsequent bankruptcy process.Eurex Clearing’s new client asset protection service would allow “immediate portability of positions and assets in case of a clearing member default”, the clearer said. The service would apply to its US service, once that is launched, according to Thomas Book, the clearer’s executive board member for clearing.LCH.Clearnet already offers a similar service, which is increasingly being discussed in industry circles as asset managers and hedge funds assess the risks and costs of having to use clearing, as Dodd-Frank requires.At LCH.Clearnet, client funds are held in what it calls “operationally commingled, legally segregated” accounts, which is a different model from the Eurex model. This model is in use at the UK-based clearer’s OTC interest rate swaps clearing service, aimed at the buyside in the US, and launched this month.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet’s outgoing chief executive, said last week at the Futures Industry Association’s annual conference in Florida that giving customers the option of segregated accounts was important because “the risk that one client could submit an unrelated client to risk is incredibly dangerous”.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is considering the issue of segregated, versus omnibus accounts as part of its work of coming up with rules that will allow the industry to implement Dodd-Frank.Eurex Clearing said it was also launching interest rate swaps and OTC equity derivatives clearing. But it did not set a launch date. Mr Book said: “The further expansion of our product coverage is an important part of our strategic agenda enabling our customers to prepare for the new regulatory environment. We will offer all clearing services in the relevant asset classes to our clearing members and buyside clients to comply with new requirements in the most effective and capital efficient way.”The German clearer said it would also introduce a new “portfolio-based” risk management system that takes account of multiple positions held by trades across different asset classes, reducing the overall amount of margin that customers can use.
511;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;ICE chief cools talk of merger disruption;Such break-ups are ‘hard to do’, says Sprecher;IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), a US operator of commodity and derivatives exchanges, sought to damp speculation about its possible involvement in an attempt by Nasdaq OMX to break up the planned combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse saying such break-ups were “hard to do”.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said at a conference in Florida that ICE had “great experience” with disrupting deals. ICE in 2007 tried and failed in a bid for the Chicago Board of Trade, which had recently agreed to be sold to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. That bid eventually went through, creating what is now CME Group.“We have great experience with this and we see that breaking up other people’s mergers is hard to do,” Mr Sprecher told the Financial Times at a Futures Industry Association conference in Florida. “There has to be a really compelling proposition for shareholders and the markets.”However he would “neither confirm nor deny” whether he was involved in an attempt, led by Nasdaq OMX chief executive Bob Greifeld, to pull together a bid for NYSE Euronext, in an attempt to prise it away from Deutsche Börse.The US and German exchange operators last month unveiled an all-share deal that would see Deutsche Börse shareholders control 60 per cent of a new holding company, with NYSE Euronext shareholders holding the rest.People familiar with the matter said Mr Greifeld was locked in talks with bankers aimed at securing financing for a bid that would involve buying the cash equities and options business of NYSE Euronext.They said that Mr Greifeld believes the merger synergies outlined by the US and German operators of €300m ($420m) do not go far enough and that he could take more costs out, faster. “His cost-cutting would be taken more credibly,” one said.The people also said Mr Greifeld believed that NYSE Euronext shareholders may be more likely to consider an alternative offer given that NYSE Euronext’s shares have fallen in value by more than 9 per cent since the deal was unveiled, to just over $35 on Thursday, valuing the company at $9.3bn.However, Nasdaq’s shares have fallen sharply this week alone, and are down 12 per cent at $24.50.Craig Donohue, chief executive of CME Group, told the Financial Times: “I really do not think that bigger is better. What do you achieve through these types of transactions?”
512;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Boca Beat: ICE gives the show a 2007 feel;;If the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) is about to launch a counter-offer for the derivatives business of NYSE Euronext, as part of a joint effort with Nasdaq OMX to break up the planned Deutsche Börse/NYSE Euronext deal, ICE chief executive Jeff Sprecher was giving away almost nothing on Monday night.Standing at the bar at the Boca Raton resort on the first night of the Futures Industry Association’s annual conference, all Mr Sprecher would say was: “I can’t say anything, I can’t legally anyway.” And that wasn’t just because company spokeswoman Kelly Loeffler – who is also his wife – was standing next to him.We may know later whether reports of a Nasdaq-ICE break-up are proven correct. But this, and the fate of the other two exchange mergers, were just about all that delegates were talking about as the conference prepared for record attendance. At 850 registered, this puts FIA Boca back up to levels last reached before the financial crisis in 2007.That year Mr Sprecher stole the show with a surprise counter-offer for the Chicago Board of Trade in an attempt to break up an agreed offer from CME Group. So when it comes to breaking up exchange M&A deals, Mr Sprecher certainly has form at Boca.As far as the idea goes, some analysts are coming round to the idea of a Nasdaq/ICE move, having previously been colder than lukewarm. Rich Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, tells FT Trading Room: “I think [Nasdaq OMX chief executive Bob] Greifeld believes he needs to take part in the current consolidation. But I am still sceptical.”On Monday, Ed Ditmire, an analyst at Macquarie, noted that while Nasdaq’s relatively indebted position means it cannot bid for NYSE Euronext by itself – current NYSE market capitalisation is also about double that of Nasdaq – by teaming up with ICE “each can bid for portions of NYSE Euronext which best mirror their own business, creating high overlaps/cost-synergies”.He thinks Nasdaq/ICE could put a $45 a share offer on the table, with Nasdaq paying $20 per share for NYSE excluding its Liffe European derivatives business, while ICE could pay $25a share for Liffe.Liffe would give Mr Sprecher a big European presence that he currently lacks. He could leverage his ICE Europe clearing house, which is already well-established, and steal a march on the CME in Europe. No coincidence, perhaps, that CME on Tuesday announced a date for the launch of clearing at its new London-based clearer.Mr Sprecher could also be making a very shrewd gamble on what happens on the regulatory front in Europe. We already know that European antitrust authorities are going to take a long, hard look at the planned combination of Liffe and Eurex under Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext proposal.If Brussels decides that it doesn’t like the idea of a derivatives powerhouse with interest rate futures at both ends of the yield curve, and thinks therefore that Liffe and Eurex should not be owned by the same operator, then having clear interest from ICE in ownership of Liffe may give regulators one more reason to look at the landscape this way.And in the US, a combined Nasdaq-NYSE would recreate market share in US cash equities in a single liquidity pool, just as BATS Global Markets is starting to look more of a threat with its recent Chi-X Europe deal, ambitions in Brazil and the possibility of an IPO. Plus Nasdaq-NYSE would be a US-US deal, which would make Chuck Schumer, senior Democratic senator for New York, no doubt happy.Meanwhile as exchanges duke it out, regulators are grappling with Dodd-Frank implementation and budget squeezes. Or so you would think.In an unusual twist, it turns out that four out of five Commodity Futures Trading Commission commissioners are attending FIA Boca. Yet the fifth commissioner, Gary Gensler, the chairman, is not. Instead, he will deliver his keynote address via video link-up from Washington, DC.Normally Mr Gensler attends in person. But this year he apparently wants to demonstrate that he is keeping a tight rein on CFTC spending by declining to travel to Florida.Besides, Mr Gensler will not have a ringside seat on the action should Mr Greifeld and Mr Sprecher decide to liven things up.
513;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Nasdaq sounds out bankers on NYSE bid;;Nasdaq is edging closer to a possible hostile offer for the New York Stock Exchange and has been sounding out bankers about a financing package for a bid.People familiar with the situation said that no decision had yet been made and Nasdaq could shy away from what would be an ambitious attempt by the smaller exchange to break up its rival’s agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.But Nasdaq was working with its advisers, led by Bank of America and Evercore and could shortly agree funding for a counter-offer to the deal announced last month, these people added.Nasdaq could finance the bid with about $5bn in debt organised by Bank of America, DealReporter news service reported. Intercontinental Exchange, the Atlanta-based futures exchange, could be lined up to buy the Liffe business, worth about $5bn. Nasdaq and ICE declined to comment, as did the banks.Nasdaq shares fell 3 per cent to $26.37. NYSE Euronext shares rose 4.52 per cent to $36.55.Attempting to break up the NYSE’s all-share deal with Deutsche Börse would be a high-risk move. The existing deal contains a sizeable break-up fee of €250m ($340m). Deutsche Börse would also have certain rights to match a competing proposal. Nasdaq is already among the most levered of the major exchanges and additional debt could put downwards pressure on its triple B credit rating.Observers have also questioned the merits of Nasdaq doubling down in US cash equities. Most exchange groups are bulking up in higher-margin businesses such as derivatives and clearing.However, Nasdaq has found itself short of options since its rivals began pairing up last year.The London Stock Exchange is pursuing a combination with TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses, while in Asia SGX, the Singapore exchange, is hoping Australian regulators will approve its deal with Sydney-based ASX.Nasdaq may be emboldened by the perception that US regulators would be receptive to an attempt to keep the NYSE in American hands. However, putting together the pair’s listings businesses could raise antitrust challenges of its own.“There is something that appeals to the patriot in us that would wish to see a Nasdaq acquisition of the NYSE and save it for the Americans,” said David Weild, head of capital markets advisory at Grant Thornton and a former Nasdaq vice-chairman.
514;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-03-09T19:59:55Z;High-speed commodities traders under scrutiny;;Just over a week ago, Avery Putter, a commodities broker with Spectron, was preparing to buy cocoa options on the floor of New York’s ICE Futures US exchange. As he glanced at the futures price, it suddenly plummeted. In less than a minute, the cocoa contract had fallen 12.5 per cent.“Stuff like that happens all the time,” Mr Putter says disapprovingly. “It’s the norm these days.”The fall in cocoa, which rebounded within minutes, is the latest example of the extreme volatility that has rippled across “soft” commodities markets including cotton, sugar and cocoa, leading to strong protests to ICE officials.Many people blame the rise of so-called high-frequency trading firms, which use computer algorithms to seek out pricing and other discrepancies in markets and trade in millionths of seconds.IntercontinentalExchange, which bought the old New York Board of Trade in 2007, replaced open-outcry futures trading with computer screens three years ago. Its electronic futures markets have experienced sharp price swings. The raw sugar futures contract, a global benchmark, dropped 6 per cent in a single second on February 3. Trading in ICE cotton futures has been halted in 14 of the past 15 sessions after prices reached exchange-imposed daily movement limits.“We have seen this thing go from functioning to a crapshoot,” Jordan Lea, president of the American Cotton Shippers Association, a merchants’ group, says of the futures market.ICE’s switch to electronics enticed computerised traders into commodities. Some of these traders buy and sell with a computer mouse, while others such as Chicago-based Infinium Capital Management and DRW Trading also use algorithms to trade at blistering speeds.The exchange and analysts, though, dispute suggestions that high-frequency traders are responsible for the price swings. They say such traders have a smaller presence in soft commodities than in other futures. The real cause of the volatility lies elsewhere, they believe.The high-frequency traders argue that they reduce volatility, not increase it. Chuck Whitman, chief executive of Infinium, said in a speech last month that electronic trading would be “exciting” for the agriculture industry, stabilising its profit margins.“This stability will help serve the greater good by helping to dampen volatility in food prices, and helping to keep overall food prices lower,” he said.Thomas Farley, president of ICE Futures US, says high-frequency firms make up “less than 10 per cent of our overall volume” in softs markets. Tabb Group, a consultant, estimates that proprietary trading firms generated 45 per cent of overall futures markets volume last year.Mr Farley says: “If there is a notion that volatility in the softs markets is heightened due to the presence of high-frequency traders, that notion is wrong. I submit that the opposite may well be true: if we had greater participation from that class of trader, the volatility could in fact be lessened.”The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is looking into last week’s decline in cocoa. Traders, meanwhile, have pointed to a large sell order, which in turn triggered “stops”, or automatic orders to sell, driving the market lower, an account that has drawn comparisons with the Wall Street “flash crash” last May. A government advisory committee studying that crash, in which the Dow fell hundreds of points before rebounding, said that electronic trading had cut transaction costs but made markets fragile at times of high volatility.Whether or not high-frequency traders are to blame, the supply-demand balance may be a factor. The sharp price swings also come amid a severe scarcity of some important crops, making markets highly sensitive to news of supply and demand.Last year’s cotton crop is virtually sold out and a political standoff threatens cocoa supplies from Ivory Coast, the largest exporter. Mr Farley says low inventories, high prices and greater geopolitical risk have increased volatility. But electronic trading may have accelerated it. Jim Cassidy, at futures broker Newedge, says: “High volatility is partly a function of high prices. But the flashes – the abrupt, frenetic, substantial price moves that occur in seconds or minutes – that’s a new phenomenon I think is significantly related to electronic trading.”
515;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-03-09T01:04:23Z;Indonesian traders enter global market;;The Indonesia Commodity & Derivatives Exchange (ICDX) said domestic traders could now trade abroad on foreign exchanges – including CME Group and the New York Board of Trade – for the first time.The move highlights how the barriers that have prevented local traders in Asia’s fast-growing commodity derivatives markets accessing trading opportunities abroad are coming down, as regulations are relaxed and technology is making connections easier.It also comes as big western exchange groups, such as CME, are forging links with commodity exchanges in emerging markets as a way of tapping into new customer bases.CME Group in 2009 forged an alliance with Bursa Malaysia to allow the Kuala Lumpur-based exchange’s customers to access CME products in the US.Separately, the Taiwan Futures Exchange (Taifex) is in talks with CME Group to list Taifex’s index futures on CME’s Globex trading platform.“We hope to attract more foreign institutions to trade on our market through Globex,” said Steve Wang, Taifex president.Jakarta-based ICDX offers trading in derivatives on metals, soft agricultural products and energy.Megain Widjaja, the exchange’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that legislation had been passed last year that would allow domestic traders to access foreign markets. Overseas trading had been previously executed by a combination of phone broking and overseas accounts.“We really need to think how to make ICDX more accessible to a broader audience. We just completed the infrastructure and trading systems last week. Now we can allow Indonesian participants to actually trade offshore products,” Mr Widjaja said.“The system was up and running as of last week and we have brokers already signed up. Licences were granted and everything is in place.“Brokers are offering to their clients. Through this we will give them direct access to CME and Nybot.”The move does not involve any alliance with CME or Nybot – the New York Board of Trade, a commodity exchange operated by IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), a CME rival.The arrangement initially involves three local brokers: Sinar Mas, Millennium and Phillips.In 2009, ICDX picked Patsystems, a UK-based trading technology company, to provide the exchange with a new trading system, which will be used to help traders connect abroad.www.ft.com/tradingroom
516;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-03-02T19:55:59Z;Brazilian firms obtain access to oil futures;;Brazilian firms will now be able to trade a wider range of oil futures after IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), a US exchange and OTC trading and clearing business, signed an agreement with the country’s regulator to allow access to its European products.The deal is the latest move by an exchange to expand its global presence and make the most of latent demand in fast-growing countries such as Brazil. Brazil’s own exchange, BM&FBovespa, has also sought to open itself up to the world via its partnership with Chicago-based CME Group and expansion plans in Asia.“Brazil is one of the world’s most dynamic economies and an increasingly important producer of crude oil,” said David Peniket, president and chief operating officer at ICE Futures Europe. “We are delighted to be able to respond to demand for ICE products, particularly given the increased reliance on the benchmark ICE Brent Crude Oil futures contract.”Brazil’s financial regulator, the Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM), authorised the access to ICE Futures Europe products via ICE’s trading screens in the country. ICE Futures US has already been approved to provide screen-based access to its markets in Brazil since October 2009.Oil futures are particularly in demand in Brazil as the country prepares to exploit huge reserves recently discovered deep beneath the ocean floor off the southern coast. The so-called “sub-salt field”, which is thought to hold more than 50bn barrels of oil, would turn Brazil into one of the world’s top energy producers.
517;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-03-02T17:17:32Z;Record listings boost HKEx profits;;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing signalled ambitions to grow in energy, commodities and futures markets through strategic alliances as part of growing its business in China.It also reported a 7 per cent rise in 2010 net profit after attracting a record number of company listings.The exchange operator, the world’s largest by market capitalisation as a listed company, has been swept up in speculation about next moves amid a wave of global exchange consolidation.Its fourth-quarter net profit alone rose by 27 per cent to HK$1.56bn ($200m), from HK$1.29bn the previous month.On Wednesday it reiterated what it had said when Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext two weeks ago unveiled plans to create the world’s largest exchange, saying “we will seek strategic alliances with technology providers, industry participants, and our regional and global counterparts to expedite our growth initiatives”.But its chairman, Ronald Arculli, went further, saying HKEx was interested in replicating what IntercontinentalExchange of the US had done in building one of the world’s largest energy, futures and commodity derivatives platforms. HKEx has a $5bn cash war chest.ICE bought the London-based International Petroleum Exchange in 2001. That formed the basis for the creation of ICE Futures Europe, which trades Brent and WTI oil futures and natural gas futures.“If I could replicate the ICE model from the old International Petroleum Exchange, I would do it tomorrow, today, or now,” Mr Arculli told a Reuters exchanges conference. “If you look at the ICE model, it really is an amazing achievement. They have a lot of components and started out small, but now it’s got a market cap of $8-9bn.”ICE on Wednesday reported record volume and average daily volume across its futures exchanges in February, with average daily volume on ICE Futures Europe volumes 39 per cent higher than in January.HKEx said that any alliance it might pursue “would need to present strategically compelling benefits consistent with our focus on markets in greater China”.Diego Perfumo, analyst at Equity Research Desk in New York, said that meant HKEx was likely to pursue acquisitions in the same business area as ICE. “That is what he [Mr Arculli] seemed to infer, buying smaller pieces and building a market from those pieces. They will look into buying or licensing technology but this is all about developing the Chinese market, anything other than that will take away from their focus.”HKEx also said it had decided to establish a clearing house for over-the-counter derivatives by the end of 2012, starting with interest rate swaps, “to support global regulatory initiatives and take advantage of business opportunities in OTC derivatives clearing”.HKEx shares closed down 1.5 per cent at HK$167.1.
518;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-03-02T15:10:32Z;Tougher rules for high-frequency traders;;Trading firms could be facing a raft of new restrictions, meant to limit the ability of algorithms to disrupt markets, as regulators and exchanges consider new rules.Mary Schapiro, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates stocks and options, said at an event that the SEC was considering fees on traders who place and cancel thousands of orders in a second.That would limit the practice of sending and cancelling thousands of orders per second, also known as “quote stuffing”, which some high-frequency firms are said to engage in. Ms Schapiro described the discussions as “internal” and “very informal”.Separately, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission considered a new report by an advisory committee on pre-trade controls that would place additional checks on traders, exchanges and clearing firms before trades are sent into the marketplace.These considerations come a day after Direct Edge, the exchange, ended its “flash order” programme on Monday, which allowed some traders, notably high-frequency shops, to see quotes before others. It was the last of the equity exchanges to do so.The CFTC committee, which consisted of representatives from trading, clearing and exchange groups, said that all traders should have “kill buttons” to stop algorithmic trades, as well throttles to control the rate messages and trade executions.It recommended that clearing firms oversee traders’ observance of those rules, and the adoption of “price collars” that prevented trades that were too far away from the current market. That would be in keeping with SEC “circuit breaker” rules that halt trading in many stocks when quotes get too far away from the market price too quickly.The report said exchanges – as well as swap-execution facilities – ought to require their member firms to have such controls in place, and have erroneous trade policies that tried to reprice bad trades, rather than cancelling them.Scott O’Malia, CFTC commissioner who convened the group, said that “by raising the standards and establishing best practices, we can ensure that …the markets are protected from untested algorithms that could undermine well functioning markets”.Committee members stressed that the extent of the oversight would be limited, however.“It would be a natural extension of our relationships to bolt on some additional verification,” said Charles Vice, president of IntercontinentalExchange, the futures exchange. But, he said, the exchanges would not “sit on [the trader’s] side of the table”.Gary DeWaal, group general counsel at Newedge, the world’s largest futures brokerage, said he “shuddered” when thinking about cancelling customer trades. “We may only be seeing part of a trade, and we could be wrong. The liability issues would be just dramatic on us after the fact, under the current legal framework,” he said.The fear of “runaway algos” has arisen since the May 6 “flash crash”, when an institutional trader executed an unusually large futures trade, via an algorithm that was set to execute a certain percentage of market volume. That sparked a chain of events that led the S&P 500 stock index to rise and fall 5 per cent within minutes.The SEC has since adopted new rules limiting direct market access by traders. The joint advisory committee convened by the SEC and CFTC, which released its recommendations two weeks ago, also endorsed the SEC’s rule and said the CFTC should adapt similar controls on algorithms.The joint advisory group also recommended forcing exchanges to charge fees for high cancellation of orders, which drive up technology costs for other traders. Exchanges, such as Nasdaq and a new venture from Credit Suisse, have tried to address this by creating marketplaces that screen out traders with high cancellations.Regulators have been hesitant to say they should directly oversee algorithms, such as via a certification or approval procedure. Bart Chilton, CFTC commissioner, said there should be a “basic”, not exhaustive, testing regime, potentially in environments created by exchanges.Partly the hesitance is due to budgetary limitations. The SEC has not able to hire the 5 algorithm experts it intended to after US lawmakers failed to pass a budget that gave it additional funds in 2011.“The CFTC spends less than $31m a year on technology,” said Gary Gensler, CFTC chair. “Less than any of the firms on the technology advisory committee. We can write rules, and rely on exchanges, but I worry there will be a race to the bottom.”Mr Gensler was concerned that without direct rules written by the CFTC, exchanges would compete to have the most liberal environments.Richard Gorelick, chief executive of RGM Advisors, a high-frequency proprietary trading firm, who was not a committee member but was in attendance, said that proprietary firms met frequently to discuss market disruptions and what firms should do to prevent them.“I would caution about having a static list, which gives a false sense of security as best practices change, but also limit [traders] in ways that wouldn’t be pushing us to best risk management,” he said.
519;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Options block-trade battle heats up;;A battle for large block trades in the US equity options market started to take shape on Friday, with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) buying an electronic trading platform for such transactions and a US subsidiary of Deutsche Börse announcing a plan to launch a new service for big orders.Institutional traders often trade large blocks of options to hedge their equity positions, but the fractured nature of the US options market – with nine competing exchanges – means such trades either have to be conducted on traditional trading floors or broken down into small transactions that will not move the market.Currently, most such deals are conducted privately on the telephone or via instant messaging systems. The moves by ICE and International Securities Exchange (ISE), the US options exchange owned by Deutsche Börse, will make it easier for transactions to be conducted electronically, replacing much of the current bilateral trading with a more exchange-like marketplace.ICE struck a deal to buy Ballista Securities, an electronic platform that matches buyers and sellers of options transactions of 500 contracts and bigger. Terms of the takeover were not disclosed.Meanwhile, the ISE said it would launch a new order type next week for transactions of blocks of 1,000 contracts or more, after regulators approved the trades over the objections of rival exchanges.The ISE – the only big US options-trading venue without a traditional trading floor – hopes the introduction of “Qualified Contingent Cross” orders will allow it to take market share from its competitors. ISE was until last year the second-biggest US options exchange, but has since slipped to third as the battle for volume has intensified.
520;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-02-23T17:10:15Z;D. Börse takes majority stake in EEX;;Deutsche Börse has taken a majority stake in European Energy Exchange, the German energy exchanges group, as it expands its business beyond stock and derivatives trading.The German exchanges operator secured an option, via its Eurex derivatives platform, to buy the 22.96 per cent shareholding in EEX owned by Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in December. On Wednesday it secured a majority of EEX shareholders who agreed to waive their pre-emption rights to buy the stake.Eurex and EEX, which operate platforms to trade emissions rights and power derivatives, have had trading and clearing ties for more than three years.Eurex will pay €7.75 per share, valuing the equity of EEX at just over €310m. The move comes as many of the world’s largest exchanges are looking to deepen their push into the commodities trading market.Stock market-focused exchanges such as Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, which have announced plans to merge, have seen their market capitalisations rivalled by commodity and futures exchanges like CME Group, owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Intercontinental Exchange.EEX has already signalled its interest in operating the new central platform for carbon auctions in the European emissions trading scheme. The European Commission is preparing for a radical reshaping of carbon permit auctions in its scheme and wants its new central platform to be an exchange.The first tender to EEX shareholders saw 31 of the 40 eligible voters agree to forego a proportional increase in their stake. It will mean Eurex’s stake will rise from 35.2 per cent to more than 50 per cent although the final total will be determined by the results of a second tender.Earlier this week NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Börse’s planned merger partner, finalised its plans for a joint venture with US-based APX, to expand its trading volume in electricity, renewable energy and carbon dioxide allowances.Called NYSE BlueSM, the venture will see NYSE Euronext fold its 60 per cent stake in BlueNext, the Paris-based exchange for spot trading of carbon dioxide allowances. APX will contribute its systems for trading and settling power and environmental contracts in the US.The two parties have agreed to maintain current EEX jobs at the group’s headquarters in Leipzig. The deal requires regulatory approval but the Exchange Supervisory Authority in Saxony and the German Federal Cartel Office have already given their consent, EEX said.
521;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-02-21T18:09:40Z;Quick View: Battleground drawn for carbon exchanges;EU’s main polluters opt out of auction platform;The European Commission wants to create a pan European carbon emissions trading platform as part of its grand ambitions to cut greenhouse gases under the Kyoto protocol. So it is a bit of blow when Europe’s three biggest polluters decide not to join the EC’s centralised auctioning platform.Spain – part of a group of four main refuseniks – may have decided this weekend to join the scheme. But the UK, Germany and Poland decided to hold back, preferring to conduct their own national auctions.EU member states had until the weekend to decide whether they would participate in a centralised auctioning platform or conduct their own national auctions.Their refusal to join is a serious blow to the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), to be introduced in 2013 with the aim of improving liquidity and price transparency in this market. It also adds a further twist to the drama surrounding cyberthefts. The states’ decisions not to join were in part motivated by security concerns over a new centralised platform.Last month’s scare around security of carbon permits in registries has left the market wary. It highlighted the differences between each country for investor protection and confusion still remains over the legal ownership of outstanding permits that have crossed borders.It sounds technical, but the ETS remains a vital component in a coming radical change in the carbon trading market in two years’ time. It was set up to help achieve the EU’s Kyoto goal of cutting greenhouse gases by 8 per cent by 2012, by imposing caps on emissions from energy-intensive industries, such as steel, cement and power generation. The decision by the UK, Germany and Poland to go their own way introduces complications to a market that the participants, such as electricity and gas companies, want simplified. As a rule, they would prefer a single auction platform with harmonised rules.Germany has argued that the stability of trade will profit when it is spread over different national platforms instead of a central one. Others worry that it will add unnecessary costs while having several venues make it more difficult to provide a robust price signal.But the biggest issue is likely to be between the banks and exchanges to see who hosts both the new central platform and the national auctions.European Energy Exchange, the German body, has already registered its interest and it is unlikely to have gone unnoticed at rivals such as ICE Futures Europe, part of Intercontinental Exchange, Bluenext – founded by NYSE Euronext and Caisse des Depots – and Green Exchange, owned by a mixture of banks, brokers and CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange.Let battle commence.
522;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
523;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-02-10T00:03:54Z;Quick View: Powerhouses for whose benefit?;;Herr Niederauer, how is your German?The prospect that the New York Stock Exchange might fall into the hands of the Germans – that is, Deutsche Börse – is but one of the many fascinating, game-changing aspects of the announcement today that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are in advanced talks that may lead to a sort of a merger. Except that, in the all-shares transaction, Börse shareholders would end up with up to 60 per cent of the shares in the new group. This will surely not go unchallenged by US politicians, in particular Democratic Senator Charles Schumer, long known for defending New York’s corner when it comes to financial services.For those who remember the Börse’s ill-fated attempt in 2002 to take on the Chicago Board of Trade, the US’s then-dominant futures exchange, it is a bit of deja vu. The Germans were rebuffed through a bit of old Chicago-style street fighting. Sensitivities were high. And politics played a part in defeating Eurex, the Börse’s futures arm, in its attempt to prise trading away from the CBOT. This time may be different. The scale of the enterprise is far greater and more complex, and the global exchange business has moved on a long way since 2002. This is about more than simply control of the Treasury bond futures contract in Chicago. It was – and is – a huge pool of liquidity. But the game now is a mixture of an anti-Chicago ploy, building a big derivatives silo in Europe, to match the pool of liquidity that Chicago has and, for Deutsche Börse, making one last attempt to build a transatlantic business. Its latest attempt, the purchase of International Securities Exchange, the options exchange, has been a disaster. Look at the write-downs on that deal, where Deutsche Börse paid $2.8bn.For Mr Niederauer, this fulfils a number of objectives. And let’s dismiss the cash equities piece of this, right off the bat. This is about derivatives and clearing, which is what drives exchange M&A these days (it is also why Mr Niederauer’s predecessor, John Thain, bought Euronext in the first place – to get hold of Liffe, the high-margin futures exchange then-owned by Euronext). Structurally, this is about consolidating an integrated derivatives and clearing business in Europe, not just as a way of heading off CME encroachments in the region (note that CME last month got approval from UK regulators for a London clearing house) but also as there is an almighty battle over the role of “vertical silos” brewing thanks to regulatory reforms such as Dodd-Frank in the US and “Emir” and “Mifid” in Europe.NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are feeling the pressure from competition on the cash equities side from the fragmentation of markets across multiple different types of venues – BATS and Direct Edge, broker networks, “dark pools” in the US, Chi-X and other similar interlopers in Europe. The answer is to reinforce the power of the derivatives-clearing silo. That’s where the obvious returns are.Does this cause an antitrust issue in the European Union, given how much power vertically integrated exchanges with clearing houses have?I think the scaremongers on this are (probably) wrong. Again, go back five years. The US Department of Justice waved through the Chicago Board of Trade’s takeover by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. What were the exchange’s two main financial products? Eurodollar interest rate futures – at the short end of the yield curve – and at the CBOT, Treasury bond futures at the long end.Slam NYSE LIffe and Eurex together in Europe – as the NYSE Euronext/Deutsche Börse deal envisages – and you have exactly the same scenario playing out in the European equivalent of those products. Do we seriously think that antitrust people in Brussels are going to have a problem with this, when the Department of Justice in the US approved it for Chicago? Okay, the staff in that same department expressed serious reservations later in an infamous letter to the US Treasury, but the original decision still stands. And imagine this: let’s say you are the CME and you are lobbying Brussels against any NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse tie-up. You can hardly use the antitrust card, given that you yourself were given a clean slate by your own antitrust people on the same issue a few years ago in the US.I know that some people might say that the CME argued that the CME-CBOT deal was okay from a competitive standpoint because there was a third party, IntercontinentalExchange, to keep everyone honest. But ICE never offered the same products as either Chicago exchange.The real losers here, potentially, are the market participants who hoped that we might have arrived at a point where vertical silos were being challenged by what is coming out of Dodd-Frank and Emir in Europe when it comes to things like open and non-discriminatory access to clearing houses by trading venues. The tendency seemed to be away from big vertical silos, driven by for-profit exchanges. If you are LCH.Clearnet, for example, this has not been a good 36 hours, given your user-owned, quasi-utility structure.The slow death of “interoperability” between clearing houses in Europe in recent weeks is also a blow against those who had hoped for a democratisation of market structures away from the vertical silo.Mr Niederauer and his counterpart at Deutsche Börse, Reto Francioni, had better know what they are doing. All I see in the announcements over the last two days from incumbent exchanges is hyperbole about creating global “powerhouses”. The question is, for whose benefit?
524;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-02-01T02:51:43Z;Natural gas trading briefly halted on CME;;Natural gas trading on a CME Group electronic platform halted unexpectedly on Monday in the latest glitch to bedevil the exchange operator.CME said gas futures and options trading on the Globex platform stopped at 12:11pm central US time due to “a technical issue” it did not specify. It resumed 34 minutes later.“This was a rare occurrence, and we’ve implemented immediate corrective procedures to prevent a reoccurrence in the future,” the exchange said in a statement.The Chicago-based company has been dogged by technology problems in recent months. In September an employee mistakenly placed 30,000 fake orders on active energy and metals markets during a quality assurance test. Days before, in an unrelated episode, the CME inadvertently sent out an e-mail virus to many of the same firms affected by the fake orders.CME’s gas contracts, offered on its New York Mercantile Exchange unit, are among the most widely traded energy derivatives. A rival gas swap is offered by CME competitor IntercontinentalExchange.A New York gas broker said that during the hiatus, “nobody would make markets. No one would trade. But it wasn’t exactly an outbreak of chaos.”Front-month March Nymex natural gas traded at $4.318 per m British thermal units before the halt, then was about a penny higher after trading resumed.CME said some working orders left open before the halt would be cancelled, but no trades were cancelled.…
525;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-01-24T17:39:45Z;Energy options traders cotton on to soft commodity volatility;;Frustrated energy options traders are exiting New York oil and gas pits for sugar and cotton as volatility sweeps through “soft” commodities.Traders are migrating from New York Mercantile Exchange, an energy bourse on the third storey of a CME Group building in Manhattan, to a soft commodities exchange run by IntercontinentalExchange on the seventh floor.The shift reflects divergent trends in volatility, which is vital to commodity options trading. Ample spare energy supply has stifled wild moves in oil and gas, while strong demand and weather problems have induced sharp moves in softs.On Monday, ICE cotton surged by the daily allowable limit to an exchange record. ICE cocoa, also traded on the seventh floor, jumped after an export banin Ivory Coast, the largest producer.“Guys who were trading crude and natural gas downstairs are working their way upstairs,” said Roger Corrado, a softs broker with Spectron. “The volatility in our markets is pretty off the charts.”A common measure of realised volatility in the Dow Jones-UBS softs sub­index has soared 38 per cent in the past year. Volatility in the energy subindex has fallen 31 per cent.Trading volume doubled in ICE cotton options in the fourth quarter of 2010 from a year earlier and rose by half in sugar options. Nymex gas options volume rose 7 per cent and oil volume rose 1 per cent.Ed Hernandez, a natural gas marketmaker, recently moved to the seventh floor to trade cotton options. Volatility “is pretty much everything” he said.“When I made my switch, cotton was limit-up every day. That’s the reason I jumped in here.”Energy traders, used to following gas storage data and Opec statements, will have to get used to markets guided by obscure statistics on cotton stockpiles or tropical rainfall.“But people are trading derivatives more than the fundamentals of any commodity,” said Mark Benigno of Hudson Capital Energy, an options dealer. “It’s a portable expertise.”Steven Williams, volatility strategist at Louis Capital Markets, said thinly traded softs markets could quickly become saturated, cutting traders’ margins.“Softs will be good for a while, but I know from my floor days that once people start talking about how good trading is, it’s the beginning of the end,” he said. “The easy money was likely made before the migration started.”Nearly all commodity futures trading on CME and ICE now takes place on computer screens, but the complexity of options has kept traditional open-outcry trading floors busy.ICE declined to comment on the shift. CME said: “Energy market participants typically trade a variety of products.”
526;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-01-20T14:35:24Z;Carbon exchanges halt spot trading;;Operators of Europe’s carbon emissions trading markets have suspended business in their spot emissions contracts after the European Union said its carbon trading platform had come under attack from cyber-thieves.Exchanges such as ICE Futures Europe, Nasdaq OMX Commodities Europe and Paris-based BlueNext were among those which halted trading in two contracts - the EU emissions allowance (EUA) daily futures and the United Nations- supervised carbon emission reduction (CER) daily futures contracts.LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearing house, suspended clearing of spot EUA and CER markets and added it would not register any transactions in the markets until further notice.The widespread closures raised fears the entire market structure in emissions trading was now compromised.The EU’s emissions trading system is facing the longest disruption in its history after authorities suspended trading for a week as it seeks to combat attacks by cyber-thieves. The Commission revealed late on Wednesday that emissions allowances worth €7m (£5.9m) had been stolen from an account in the Czech Republic. Recent days had seen accounts in Austria, Poland, Greece and Estonia also hacked, the Commission said.The EU trading system is the world’s most successful cap-and-trade system, limiting nearly half the bloc’s carbon emissions by allocating a fixed quota of EUAs to factories and power plants.ICE Futures Europe, the region’s largest emissions trading exchange, confirmed it had halted trading until January 27. In a circular to members, ICE, the London energy exchange operated by the Intercontinental Exchange of the US, said: “an undesirable situation or practice is developing or has developed” and the group was taking legal advice.It also said ICE Clear, the clearing house owned by Intercontinental Exchange, would be allowed to determine whether to suspend deliveries of contracts open at the close of business on Wednesday.BlueNext, the French group founded by NYSE Euronext and Caisse des Depots, added that it plans to quarantine suspicious credits to protect its members.Nasdaq OMX Commodities said it was monitoring the situation to ensure that “orderly trading and clearing” could take place. Separately, the exchange said it would begin trading UK power futures from the end of January.However Germany’s European Energy Exchange, in which Eurex, the futures arm of Deutsche Börse, has a stake of over 46 per cent, said trading had continued as normal as its spot and derivatives markets were only affected to a small degree by the suspension of the EU commission.It added that sales of allowances were only valid if they were covered by the existing European Commodity Clearing holdings of trading members. Only German EUAs are being deposited in the ECC registry account. “Therefore it is nearly impossible that EUAs from hacking attacks are traded on the EEX,” it said..
527;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-01-14T19:16:48Z;Large bets fuel commodity bull run;Speculative trading sends prices excessively high;Still in its infancy, 2011 is conjuring up memories of the start of 2008. Soaring crop prices have stoked fears of a food crisis and oil markets are bubbling.In some parts of the world, inflationary pressure is building: once again, the commodity speculator is centre stage.Prices for corn, soyabeans and wheat have in January returned to highs that only two years ago sparked food riots in more than 30 countries from Haiti to Bangladesh. Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, hit $99 a barrel on Friday, its highest level for 27 months.In America this week, regulators unveiled sweeping rules to keep big traders from wielding too much power over prices, amid fears that another food crisis could jeopardise global economic recovery. US senators warned of a “speculative bubble that threatens to drive up gas and food prices even further”.Many commodity prices are rising for good reasons. Physical demand is rising strongly, whether for petrol (Chinese car sales rose by a third last year) or for corn (the US ethanol industry will consume 40 per cent of the nation’s crop this year).But investors are stoking the commodities bull run with some big bets. Money flows into commodities have been huge. Barclays Capital estimates $60bn was injected into commodities in 2010. Some observers believe speculative trading has sent prices to excessively high levels, making a sharp recoil likely should the fragile economic optimism fade.Figures from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US regulator, reveal very bullish bets among money managers such as hedge funds.In late December they owned a record net “long”, or buying, position in crude oil futures and options on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In September the same types of traders held record net longs in corn.As well as hedge funds analysing global economic trends, money managers include trend followers who use computer programs to ride market momentum and “high-frequency” traders who move in and out of positions in microseconds. Electronic traders helped send volumes last year in energy, metals and agricultural commodities at the CME, the largest US futures exchange, to a record.Boris Shrayer, head of commodities marketing at Morgan Stanley, says: “Our business has changed. In the past there were more hedge fund participants who were fundamental or discretionary, going long or short commodities. Today there is an enormous amount of quant funds.“Look at the correlations: copper goes up and two seconds later oil clicks up. The dollar falls, oil rallies. It’s very clear there’s an enormous amount of this correlation trading going on.”At the opposite end of the speculative spectrum are investors passively tracking baskets of commodities, such as the S&P GSCI or Dow Jones-UBS indices, and who trade once a month at most when they roll out of expiring futures contracts.These investors, which include Calpers, the US’s largest public pension fund, and other big institutions, are strictly buyers, often to hedge against inflation. As such, they have become targets of critics claiming they themselves push up prices.“To me it’s a bubble,” says Amy Myers Jaffe of Rice University in Houston, who has studied the relationship between oil prices and speculation. “The question is: are we going to have an orderly unwind or a disorderly unwind?”Hard evidence, though, of strong correlations between traders’ positions and price movements is elusive.In New York cotton trading managed money’s bullish position has fallen by half since mid-September. Prices hit their highest level in exchange history in December. Money managers, moreover, were bearish on soyabeans as recently as July, just before a months-long rally. They quickly built a record net long position by November.“The weight of evidence points to small marginal impacts at most on the average level of prices,” says Scott Irwin, economist at the University of Illinois.Stung by accusations it was blind to the activity of index investors, the CFTC in 2009 began publishing their overall positions. The data did not help the critics.It showed indexers’ net long position in US crude futures fell 11 per cent in the first six months of 2008, even as oil rose to $140 a barrel. Their cotton position was roughly unchanged in 2010, in spite of the surge to record prices. Even as wheat has jumped since July, the index net long position has declined.Lawrence Eagles, head of oil research at JPMorgan, says: “When oil demand has risen by a massive 2.5m barrels a day [in 2010] and supply is still being held off the market, it’s very difficult to create a case that speculators are pushing oil prices higher.” Oscar Bleetstein, of Credit Suisse, says: “There was a huge bubble and it collapsed. People got out and then scrambled to get back in. Now it seems like it’s more back on track.”The CFTC wants to limit big speculators’ holdings. Yet even some of its members doubt its proposals would affect prices.Alberto Weisser, chief executive of Bunge, one of the world’s biggest agricultural traders, is dismissive. “We don’t feel we have too many speculators, and the speculators we have we don’t like to call speculators. We really need people who like to be long because we need to sell our hedges.”
528;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-01-11T09:46:48Z;Commodites daily: Changing oil benchmarks;WTI is losing its pre-eminence as the leading oil contract;The reign of West Texas Intermediate as the world’s top crude oil benchmark looks increasingly precarious.The problems of the US yardstick are all well known: from time to time, the contract disconnects from the global oil market due to logistical troubles at its landlocked point of delivery in Cushing, Oklahoma.The International Energy Agency, the US Department of Energy and Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, have all raised questions about WTI’s role, which rose to prominence after the New York Mercantile Exchange started using it in 1983 as the basis for its light, sweet crude futures contract.Despite the criticism, investors have kept faith with the contract and Nymex WTI is currently the world’s most liquid oil futures contract, much more so than competitors such as Intercontinental Exchange’s Brent and Dubai Mercantile Exchange’s Oman.But there are signs that investors’ faith is starting to wane.Hussein Allidina, head of commodities research at Morgan Stanley in New York, has recommended favouring Brent over WTI, one of the strongest signs that the problems with WTI could have a consequences for money flows into the oil futures global market.In a research piece headlined “WTI: The misleading benchmark”, Mr Allidina said: “We prefer to express our bullish view on crude through Brent”. He added: “Despite a seemingly constructive fundamental situation globally and in the US, WTI spreads have weakened, pressuring front-month WTI prices.”Oil prices on Tuesday morning were showing Brent’s premium over WTI continued to grow. While Brent prices were at $95.50 a barrel, WTI was trading at $89.40 a barrel, a difference of $6 in favour of Brent, against the traditional discount of $1-$2.Mr Allidina says that the difference is beginning to matter. “We are seeing a flow of passive money from institutional investors moving from WTI into Brent.”If the trend is confirmed – and is sustained – it could have major implications for global oil futures markets, ending WTI’s 28-year reign as the world’s pre-eminent oil benchmark
529;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-01-06T19:48:18Z;Brent crude boosted by Asia demand;Premium over WTI rises to $6 a barrel;The world’s two main oil price yardsticks have diverged by one of the widest amounts in years, reflecting a change in global oil flows and commodity investment patterns, traders and analysts said.Brent crude, the European benchmark, was trading at $94.50 a barrel on Thursday, $6 more than US rival West Texas Intermediate. The price difference is the largest since May 2010 and the fifth largest since 2004. Similar in thickness and sulphur content, WTI regularly fetched more than Brent until recently.The price difference will influence the long-running contest for dominance in oil trading between CME Group’s New York Mercantile Exchange, home of the leading WTI futures contract, and IntercontinentalExchange’s London-based bourse where Brent is the flagship.Both Brent and WTI have risen in the past year as global oil demand recovers from the financial crisis, but Brent has outpaced its counterpart by nearly 10 percentage points.Traders said WTI has underperformed on expectations of a flood of new Canadian oil hitting Cushing, Oklahoma, the tank complex where WTI futures are delivered, with the opening of a new pipeline.“You have more and more crude bottled up at Cushing with nowhere to go,” said Abudi Zein of Genscape, which tracks oil levels at the hub.Cushing has few outlets to evacuate surplus oil, so a glut tends to depress the price of WTI relative to other US and international crude oil benchmarks.The price of Brent has by contrast held firm due to declining supplies from the North Sea, growing demand in Asia and an eastward shift in some Russian crude exports, which traditionally compete in Europe with Brent, traders said.Investors tracking the popular Standard & Poor’s GSCI index, a basket of commodity futures, are set to shift some bets to Brent from WTI starting today.But Michael McGlone, of S&P, disagreed that the pending changes were boosting Brent. “The information has been in the market for quite a while,” he said.Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, in 2009 dropped the widely used WTI oil contract as the benchmark for pricing its oil to customers in the US after another episode in which the price of WTI became separated from the rest of the oil market.The Saudi decision was later followed by other members of the Opec oil cartel, including Kuwait.
530;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2011-01-04T22:16:19Z;Investors seek solid assets as equities waver;Rise in trading volumes contrasts with decline in equity market activity;"Commodity trading surged to records at two leading exchanges last year as investors piled into hard assets and tight supply conditions sparked explosive price moves.The rise in trading volumes stands in contrast to a decline in activity on equity markets, where small investors remained reluctant to trade after losses in 2008 and the “flash crash” undercut stocks in a matter of minutes last May.CME Group, the US’s largest futures exchange, saw record volumes across its commodity categories in 2010, according to Sandler O’Neill, a New York investment bank. IntercontinentalExchange, the home of commodity futures including Brent crude oil, said volume on its UK-based energy exchange rose by a third to a new high.The rising volumes come as benchmark commodity prices have risen to the highest levels in two years; oil is above $90 a barrel for the first time since October 2008 and markets from cotton to wheat have seen dramatic volatility.Investors have also bought raw materials as insurance against inflation, with a record $354bn allocated to commodities as of November, according to Barclays Capital.“With the government printing money, some people have rushed to hard assets rather than paper assets, so in general commodities have done better,” said Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.Futures trading has also migrated on to computer screens and away from exchange floors.“The move to electronic trading and then to high-frequency trading pushes up volumes. It doesn’t show up in 2010 equity volumes because equities are years ahead of commodities with regard to both,” said Doug Hepworth, of Gresham Investment Management, a New York commodity-focused firm.“Large commercial hedgers and hedge funds can now trade significant volumes at very low cost and can take advantage of price discrepancies that would previously not have been profitable,” he said.Energy trading at CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange, which includes US benchmark crude oil and natural gas, rose 11 per cent last year, with a record 1.66m contracts changing hands daily. Agricultural commodities at CME, such as corn, soyabeans and wheat, saw daily volumes grow 23 per cent in 2010 to 913,000 contracts. Metals trading rose 40 per cent to 316,000 contracts daily on CME’s Comex as gold reached all-time highs above $1,400 a troy ounce.At ICE, trading in US-based soft commodities such as cotton, coffee and sugar rose 18.2 per cent to 235,000 contracts a day, but remained below a 2008 record, according to Sandler O’Neill. ICE Futures Europe, an energy exchange, reported volumes rose 32 per cent to a record 862,000 contracts a day.Separately on Tuesday, ICE frozen concentrated orange juice futures rose to $1.87 per pound, the highest point since April 2007, as traders surveyed the impact of a freeze last month in Florida. Later the January contract fell 1.7 per cent to $1.7720 before a broader correction in commodities prices. Copper for delivery in three months hit a fresh record of $9,754 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange before ending down 1.6 per cent at $9,532."
531;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-12-22T22:17:55Z;Clearers’ ownership model under scrutiny;;"Is it better for clearing houses to be run as bare-knuckle, profit-seeking businesses, or as more pedestrian public utilities?The Bank of England has just stirred the debate. It is considering whether banks should be allowed to hold lower capital weightings against positions held in a central clearing party that is user-owned and not-for-profit, a business model it says offers the best opportunity for good governance.Its suggestion, if adopted by US and European regulators, would be a blow to the dominant business model of clearing houses, most of which are owned and operated by exchanges and are viewed as mechanisms to maintain a lock on order flow. The UK central bank flagged its concerns about CCPs in its latest financial stability report, noting that one key way to counter risks to the UK financial system was through toughening capital requirements and risk management at clearers, “fostered by user-ownership and not-for profit arrangements”.Its concern over how CCPs are owned and run echo similar worries that have been raised by US regulators and the European Commission as they have pushed sweeping reform of the over-the-counter derivatives markets.One requirement of the new Dodd-Frank act in the US and of similar proposals now making their way to the European Parliament is that as many OTC derivatives as possible be processed through CCPs to help safeguard the system against the fall-out of another default such as that of Lehman Brothers. A CCP stands between buyer and seller in transactions, ensuring trades go ahead even if one party defaults.All this is set to transform CCPs, once the mundane machinery of the financial markets, into systemically important institutions. Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has said this makes CCPs “a potential single point of failure”.Yet many of the CCPs jostling for a piece of the OTC clearing business stemming from the regulatory reforms are for profit businesses, owned by exchanges – such as Deutsche Börse, which operates Eurex Clearing; IntercontinentalExchange; and CME Group, which runs the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.The worry is that in their zeal to attract business, CCPs may make it easier for customers by lowering thresholds on financial guarantees that need to be posted to a CCP in the form of margin collateral.This is seen as not such a worry at LCH.Clearnet, a UK-based clearer that is 80 per cent owned by market participants in OTC derivatives, and The Options Clearing Corporation, owned collectively by the eight US options exchanges for which it acts as clearer. It plans to launch OTC derivatives clearing next year. Bankers familiar with discussions among regulators about whether a particular ownership model should be encouraged say there is significant disagreement about whether changes are needed.“It has been the topic of wild discussions for months,” one said. “It is an open secret that the Anglo-Saxons prefer the user-owned model while the Germans and the continentals prefer the other.”The Bank’s financial stability report marks the first time it has so clearly stated its preference for user-owned systems: “From a risk perspective, not-for-profit, user-owned CCPs provide strong incentives for effective risk management.” The bank said governance reform of CCPs “might be needed over time given their increasing systemic importance”.For-profit CCPs argue that such concerns are overdone, noting that CCPs are acutely aware of the need to ensure they have adequate capital and robust risk management systems to cope with any default situation. Paul Swann, chief executive of ICE Clear Europe, IntercontinentalExchange’s London-based CCP, acknowledges there is “a natural tension” between the two models.“But I don’t see why people think it’s uniquely different in clearing to any other service business or industry. Running nuclear power plants, for example. Private firms run nuclear power plants. They are systemically important to the economy in terms of assurance of energy supply and actually are highly regulated businesses because, a bit like us, they have to be incredibly safe and secure and well run,” he says.“We think we can develop those services to meet market demand in a commercial environment more quickly …than a pure utility model.”www.ft.com/tradingroom"
532;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-12-20T19:27:40Z;Exchanges also face financial reform;;Exchanges like to boast that, while they are an unusually visible part of the financial markets, they had nothing to do with the financial crisis of 2008. Trading of stocks, options and futures carried on throughout the worst moments of the crisis, with prices being quoted continuously and deals done.However, exchanges are not unaffected by the sweeping changes to the financial landscape as a result of the regulatory overhaul of financial services– the biggest since since the US stock market crash of 1929.Efforts to rein in – and bring greater transparency to – the vast and opaque over-the-counter derivatives markets call for a big shift of such instruments on to exchanges and other as-yet undefined platforms called “swap execution facilities” (SEFs). OTC derivatives are also to be processed through clearing houses, increasingly important structures that help reduce risks in a trade default.The thrust of the reforms, enshrined in the Dodd-Frank legislation in the US and in similar proposals from the European Commission, is that trading of financial instruments should take place as far as possible on formally organised platforms where prices are visible to all before trades are sealed – the classic function of an exchange.This regulatory thrust has played into the hands of the exchanges, which have long competed with the OTC markets, themselves controlled by Wall Street and European banks. Exchange chief executives rarely miss opportunities at industry conferences to highlight their attributes as “trusted infrastructures”, in contrast to the off-exchange markets tainted by the crisis.This month, a report by consultancy Tabb Group and commissioned by the World Federation of Exchanges warned about “continued high risk in today’s OTC derivatives market”.Bill Brodsky, CBOE chief executive and WFE chairman, said the study was needed to “establish a benchmark on how much has been done and still needs to be done to mitigate the risk of OTC derivatives”.The exchanges are expected to be beneficiaries of the reforms but not as much as might be assumed.On the trading side, many OTC derivatives are expected to be traded on SEFs specially designed to trade certain OTC derivatives, not on exchanges that are used to handling traditional futures and options. Exchanges with clearing houses – such as CME Group, Intercontinental-Exchange and Deutsche Börse – do not expect to make huge profits from the anticipated wave of clearing that in theory will come from the regulatory push. Few are willing to predict how big the market for clearing OTC derivatives really is.BANKING AFTER THE CRISIS
533;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-12-16T16:54:16Z;CME Group gets clearing approval in Europe;;CME Group will launch clearing for the over-the-counter (OTC) derivative trades in Europe early next year after the world’s biggest futures exchange received approval from UK regulators on Thursday.The exchange operator hopes the move will better enable it to compete globally for business in clearing privately-negotiated derivatives. It is in the process of building up its staffing presence in London in preparation for a big push in Europe.The counterparty risk inherent in OTC trading was widely blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis, and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are keen for central counterparty clearing in the market in order to reduce the risk traditionally associated with such trades.A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, guaranteeing performance of contracts if either side defaults. CME’s successful application for a licence also signals a broader threat to Europe’s exchanges, since control of a clearing house offers an exchange a way of expanding into new products and geographical areas.It will also allow CME to challenge the dominant market position of IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), its US rival, in the clearing of credit default swaps on both sides of the Atlantic.CME Clearing Europe - a wholly-owned subsidiary of CME that has its own employees, governance arrangements and capital – will initially clear only OTC commodity contracts, but said it hopes to launch financial products “soon after”, building towards to “multi-asset OTC clearing”.Authorities in Europe have been keen to see a European-based credit default swaps clearer to complement initiatives in the US, leading to a race among exchanges to provide lucrative CDS clearing.“Through this new London-based subsidiary, we will provide locally-relevant clearing services to meet the needs of our European customers, a key CME Group market,” said Andrew Lamb, CME Clearing Europe chief executive.Barclays and JP Morgan will act as the first settlement banks for CME Clearing Europe, while JP Morgan will also provide custody and liquidity services.CME Clearing Europe has also applied to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, to become a registered Derivatives Clearing Organisation in the US, a move aimed to help customers that are located both in the US and Europe.
534;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-12-05T23:02:02Z;Q&A: Paul Swann, chief executive ICE Clear Europe;;"Paul Swann is chief executive of ICE Clear Europe, the London-based clearing house owned by US-based IntercontinentalExchange. Launched in 2008, it now has a cash default fund of $5.3bn, a staff of 30 and clears Brent crude futures, over-the-counter derivatives such as credit default swaps and more than 300 OTC energy products such as gasoil futures and North American natural gas products. At launch, it was the first new clearing house in London for decades.Swann left LCH.Clearnet in 2006, setting himself up as a consultant working for what became Euro CCP, the European cash equities clearing house owned by The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.In the first of a series of year-end question and answer sessions, Mr Swann talks to Jeremy Grant.FT Trading Room: Why did ICE decide to launch a clearing house from scratch in London?Swann: Two years ago there was no competition in clearing and one of the achievements that we have attained in clearing in London is that there is now more than one place to go. We’ve spent a considerable amount of time and effort focusing on making clearing a service rather than a utility. This whole debate around whether clearing is a service or a utility I find personally challenging.My plan had been to take a year out of the City. I’d done 25 years at that stage and I felt it was time to have a rest. The Euro CCP thing came along and looked very interesting. You don’t often get an opportunity to start with a blank piece of paper and start something new. And at exactly the same point in time ICE came along and said, ‘we know that you spent time at LCH, you obviously have experience in clearing, we know that we need a clearing presence in Europe, we need someone to lead that’. So I actually joined ICE in March 2007 as a consultant with the job of looking at how we could and would build a clearing house if we needed to. The conclusion of that was ‘we could’. I think it was a fairly binary piece of work. It would either be enormously successful or completely unsuccessful.FT: What was wrong with the clearing landscape before you arrived?Swann: The origination of the company was “electronifying” what had previously been floor-based markets. That model was successful because it gave greater distribution to products, easy access to the desktop which grew the scale of those markets for everybody. The easy opportunities in that area were coming to an end and our last big acquisition along those lines was Nybot [the New York Board of Trade]. Actually when we did that transaction in 2007 it was part of a broader strategy about moving down the value chain. Nybot had an in-built DCO (designated clearing organisation, or clearing house). And at that time the strategy was really going to be that we would build out the clearing base that we’d bought with the Nybot acquisition to be the global clearing provision for the group. That was the initial thinking and that predates me. I think it became pretty clear early on that for a variety of reasons our customers weren’t necessarily supportive of creating a clearing hub and they wanted to be able to have choice about where they did their clearing for ICE products and in particular they wanted ICE to have a clearing presence in Europe.At that point, we had two fairly distinct choices. One was to try and acquire something which had a clearing house in it. Or we could grow a clearing house organically and historically. ICE’s way of developing its business has been through acquisition. The issue with clearing, of course, was that there was nothing to acquire. So we didn’t have much choice; we had to organically grow a clearing house. That’s where my involvement with the group started.FT: How did you go about building this? Clearing houses obviously need default funds for a start.Swann: Actually we had three problems to solve. One was regulatory authority. We were the first clearing house in London to have to go from start-up all the way through the approvals process. Everybody historically had been grandfathered in. So in many ways we trailblazed the setting up [of] a new clearing house from scratch. And if we couldn’t get regulatory approval there was no point in doing anything else; we didn’t have a business. The second piece was what I describe as capacity and capability. We had to build a team. And that isn’t easy because there isn’t a deep pool to draw on. And the third piece was what I call “hearts and minds” – how do I actually get someone to come and use it? We kicked off getting regulatory approvals almost the day I arrived. We knew that would be a relatively long lead time. For the “building the team” piece we very deliberately didn’t go to what you might think would be the obvious talent pools would be, so we didn’t look at other clearing houses or exchanges particularly.FT: Why was that?Swann: Because I wanted to create a clearing house which was customer- and service-focused. So I actually wanted people who had more commercial experience of providing services. So we went and looked at mid- and back-office support people who’d been close to the front office – predominantly at investment banks. I viewed that as a potential game-changer for us. We wanted people who viewed clearing as a service business. We started out calling ourselves “the United Nations of clearing” because we had more non-UK nationals in the team. I’ve got Markus Konz, as head of risk. His last job was Deutsche Bank but had been at Eurex prior to that. Francois Lepart, head of operations. He was at Calyon. Then we have Camiel Janmaat, who’s Dutch and heads treasury. He came from Kas Bank. That’s the core of the team. We view clearing as a service rather than as a utility.FT: So going back to the reason for getting into clearing.Swann: Yes, it was partly because we wanted to move down the value chain. The primary reason in Europe, though, was that Clearport [the energy clearing business owned by CME Group, ICE’s US-based rival] was adding product at a rapid rate. In order to be able to compete with Clearport we needed to be able to roll out product much more quickly. Historically, we’d been able to roll out a handful of new products with LCH a year. Jeff [Sprecher, ICE chief executive] had worked quite hard with LCH in trying to pick up the pace of product rollout without an enormous amount of success. So really in order to compete we needed to be able to develop the clearing service. Almost by extension we had no choice.FT: What were you using LCH for in those days?Swann: International Petroleum Exchange [products] and North American power and gas products. One of the primary reasons for developing our own clearing house was to be able to speed up the innovation in the traded product and therefore the clearing product that supported it.FT: It just shows how having clearing is such a strategic necessity.Swann: It is, if you still have a fast-developing product base. It goes to why I feel so unhappy with people who call it a utility. You only have to look at what we were trying to achieve in trying to add new OTC product. I don’t think it’s a well-recognised fact that we created OTC energy clearing when there weren’t really any other OTC cleared products out there. Interest rate swaps were nascent with LCH, but around 2002 ICE really pioneered a whole range of products as a result of the Enron problems. There was a very deep OTC energy product which hadn’t previously been cleared which ICE in effect provided through the markets that it provides and then brought into clearing.FT: As we look at what’s happening with the Dodd-Frank reforms, this happened before, post-Enron. This idea that we are facing a brave new world of OTC clearing, this happened after Enron already.Swann: That’s exactly the point I’m trying to make. In many ways what we’ve been doing is using the experience we’ve developed at that point in time and applying it to new challenges. It’s not as fundamentally new as people think. Yet as the clearing requirements change, we will react to that and we will work with our customers to provide what regulatory requirements require and what our customers want. One of the great strengths of the business and ICE Clear Europe is how did we finally get clearing member support? It was actually because we sat down and talked and listened to them about what they needed and how could we help enhance their businesses and then sought to deliver those things. For example, there was a strong belief that we needed more OTC energy product available in Europe. And in the first two years we did nearly 250 new products whereas historically we’d been doing a handful a year.FT: So what extra things did you have to do, to get make this sort of thing happen?Swann: We talked to customers about earlier registration of contracts. To do that we committed to doing so fairly significant new work around how risk management operates. Since we launched, we’ve develop a new intra-day risk management system with which we can now calculate P&L across the whole of the energy product every minute of every day.FT: So this idea that clearing houses are rather weak on intra-day risk management, particularly in a “high-frequency” world, isn’t necessarily true?Swann: Definitely not true with us. We literally, on a screen, can watch, every minute through every day, how every position is changing. We should have, where prices are available, real time – or as near to real time - risk management. We send customers reports on important financial information such as margin every five minutes. Others do this only a couple of times a day. You can have a long academic debate around just how frequent does it need to be but the platinum standard is what we are doing in energy.FT: To what extent do clearing houses globally do this already?Swann: There are relatively few that can do what we do now. It’s an area where continued investment is warranted.FT: Do you think that in the current environment, post-crisis where clearing is now so important, there’s a tension between seeing clearing as a quasi-utility given the increased importance to the financial system of clearers, and the desire among end-users for competitive offerings between clearers?Swann: I think there is a natural tension but I don’t see why people think it’s uniquely different in clearing to any other service business or industry. Running nuclear power plants, for example. Private firms run nuclear power plants. They are systemically important to the economy in terms of assurance of energy supply and actually are highly regulated businesses because, a bit like us, they have to be incredibly safe and secure and well run. There’s not this push for governments to run nuclear power plants. I think the point really is about investment. We don’t provide clearing for altruistic reasons, purely to resolve regulatory concerns. We provide clearing as part of a range of services. We think we can develop those services to meet market demand in a commercial environment more quickly I suppose than a pure utility model. And there’s some evidence for that. One of the primary reasons we created a clearing house was because we couldn’t evolve our clearing service fast enough in a model which was described as not-for-profit or for limited profit or utility."
535;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-12-05T22:58:27Z;ICE Clear Europe sees Q1 launch of buyside CDS;;ICE Clear Europe, the European clearer owned by IntercontinentalExchange of the US, plans to launch clearing of credit default swaps for non-dealer business in the first quarter, pending regulatory approval.Last week Eurex Clearing said it was still trying to build an over-the-counter clearing business, which would include CDS for the so-called buyside, or institutional investors, as opposed to the dealer-to-dealer business which is already being cleared by ICE.Paul Swann, chief executive of ICE Clear Europe, said: “Currently we don’t have client clearing for CDS in Europe. That’s a project we’re working hard on at the moment and we’re hoping to launch first quarter next year.”“There is some heat, if you want, around the fact that we haven’t got a client clearing model up and running in Europe and that’s why we’re beavering away trying to correct that.”Speaking in a year-end Q&A with FT Trading Room, he said ICE Clear Europe had not been able to get the service going yet “related to the volume of regulatory change with the desire both on the buy- and the sell-side to implement a model that is sustainable”.“And when the rules are being changed it’s very difficult to know what’s the right model. Actually I think we’re close to overcoming that,” Mr Swann said.Specifically, ICE is finalising a mechanism for securitising client positions with the clearing house.
536;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-12-03T16:21:01Z;Exchanges see November boost from derivatives;;Some of the world’s largest trading venues saw a solid uptick in volumes in November as investors sought out derivatives, especially in commodities, to hedge against the uncertain economic outlook.Monthly statistics from the world’s leading exchanges and trading venues showed year-on-year sequential improvements at CME Group and Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse as investors on both sides of the Atlantic looked to offset risk.Commodity derivatives have proved a hot spot, amid continued volatility in demand and supply in raw materials from cotton to copper and energy.Robert Ray, head of international products and services at CME Group, operator of energy exchange Nymex and of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, told a conference this week in London that commodity traders were back “putting on positions” as they had done before the financial crisis of 2008. Grain contracts had been “on a tear” because of supply and demand issues.“In many cases the fundamentals haven’t changed. In commodities and metals you’re seeing a re-establishment of positions,” he told the FOW Derivatives World conference.IntercontinentalExchange, the US exchange operator, saw record futures volume of more than 300m contracts, beating last November’s record of 262m.Average daily volume across its futures exchanges rose 26 per cent to 1.4m. Growth was driven by agriculture and energy futures, while its European futures business stablished an open interest record of 3.7m contracts on November 9, it said.CME Group, operator of the largest futures exchange in the US, saw average daily volume rise 31 per cent in November, up 31 per cent from November last year and 24 per cent higher than October this year, as it benefited from investor concern about the Federal Reserve’s latest quantitative easing cycle.The group said November represented the highest monthly average daily volume since September 2008, outside of the 16.8m contracts averaged in May when the “flash crash” took place. Volumes at its commodity futures rose 47 per cent compared to November last year while interest rate futures rose 46 per cent and metals rose 34 per cent.Deutsche Börse said a combined 221m contracts traded on Eurex and the International Securities Exchange, the US options exchange it bought in a $2.8bn deal in 2007.In Asia, derivatives volume at the SGX Singapore exchange increased 22 per cent year-on-year to 5.4m contracts, with average daily volume of 264,929, up 18 per cent year-on-year.Trading volumes for the main cash equities trading venues of the US and Europe, like NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, are set to be announced next week. The results are expected to be far more downbeat, as typified by NYSE Euronext. Its average daily volume of cash products has risen only 5 per cent year-to-date on 2009 levels while its US business has dropped 22 per cent.The securities market on SGX saw a 46 per cent rise in market turnover to $40bn for November, up 46 per cent year-on-year.The global strength of the derivatives business has made it all the more urgent that the London Stock Exchange pursue its planned foray into equity derivatives, which it announced in June.
537;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-12-03T15:53:04Z;Eurex plans launch of interest rate swaps clearing;;Eurex Clearing has not abandoned plans for over the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearing and is preparing to roll out a service for interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for “buyside” market participants, a senior executive said.The disclosure comes as doubts have persisted over the commitment of Eurex to building an OTC derivatives clearing business at a time when its key rivals – CME Group, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and LCH.Clearnet – are pushing ahead.Eurex all but abandoned an attempt to get into credit default swaps clearing for dealer-to-dealer business earlier this year after it became clear that ICE had a head start by forging a revenue-sharing arrangement with key dealer banks.Matthias Graulich, executive director at Eurex Clearing, owned by Deutsche Börse, said the group was now looking at interest rate swaps and equity swaps as well as offering credit default swaps clearing for buyside customers. ICE is also preparing a buyside CDS clearing service, likely to be launched in the first half of next year.“We said the dealer-to-dealer business is with ICE but we believe a broad product offering, in particular with the buyside, is a good value proposition for us. So we said we’d keep that offering alive,” Mr Graulich told FT Trading Room at the FOW Derivatives World conference in London this week.“We have this offering and if there’s interest we are ready to immediately start,” he said, referring to CDS clearing for the buyside.Like other clearers Eurex Clearing is hoping to be able to offer OTC clearing in the context of being able to offer portfolio margining with other on-exchange derivatives such as futures and options.Portfolio margining allows traders to avoid having to post collateral to a clearing house for each type of asset traded in full, instead calculating the risk offsets between the various asset classes and coming up with a single margin payment that is smaller than the total amount that would have to be posted if each asset class were treated individually. “We have a decent value proposition with the capital efficiencies that we can offer,” Mr Graulich said.A Eurex spokesman later said that the group was in “talks with plenty of other [buyside] firms regarding the extension of our OTC CCP [central counterparty] services”. He declined to name any.Mr Graulich said that the key issue to be sorted before the rollout of any offering was the treatment of buyside margin collateral. Asset managers that use OTC derivatives are keen to ensure their collateral is held separately – “segregated” - from that of other market participants, including the proprietary trading business of the clearing member the buyside client may be using to access a clearing house. That is so that their positions and collateral can be easily identified, separated and transferred to another clearing member in the event of a default by the clearing member.This issue is central to “client asset protection” (CAP) in clearing generally and is top of the agenda for regulators and the buyside in the US.Mr Graulich said: “The piece that is missing is the CAP regime, which we plan to roll out in the first half. This is the key area of interest at this point in time and is the missing piece to make it attractive to the buyside.”While clearers are jostling for a slice of the OTC business, it is not yet clear how lucrative the business will be. While more clearing is mandated in the Dodd-Frank legislation in the US, and will be once European Commission proposals on OTC derivatives are enshrined in law by the European Parliament, few in the industry are able to predict with confidence what revenues will be generated from it.Mr Graulich said it was “absolutely necessary” to offer OTC derivatives clearing “if you already offer futures and options. It’s [OTC clearing] an add-on. You have to look at this as part of a complete product portfolio”.
538;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-12-01T09:29:37Z;Super-fast traders pose risk to clearers;;Back in the 1960s in the City of London, when share trading was polite and clubby, it could take up to three weeks for share certificates and cash to change hands.That was because traders trusted each other’s ability to pay up after cumbersome processes like credit checking were over. “You would extend your counterparties two weeks of credit just because you probably went to school with them,” says Bruce Weber, professor of information management at the London Business School.But now, in the world of “high-frequency trading” (HFT), where much dealing is done faster than the blink of a human eye, everyone involved needs to know as quickly as possible whether traders can stand by their their bets.Exchanges where the trades are done need, in particular, to know whether their customers have brakes in place to stop computer trading getting out of control. Sensitivity surrounding super-fast trading has heightened since May’s “flash crash” in US stock markets, when the Dow Jones average plunged hundreds of points and rebounded in minutes.US regulators are now piloting a system of circuit breakers at exchanges to help with this. Brokers who allow high-frequency traders to use their systems to access exchanges have been told to improve how they monitor the risks their customers take.Industry experts say that high-frequency trading poses new risks for clearing houses, the central counterparties that stand between two parties to a trade and rely on funds contributed by members to pay out in the event of a default.Clearers need to know whether those funds, which are known as margin, will cover the worst scenarios, such as a trader default or a trade going wild. They need to know this as far as possible in “real time” since high-frequency traders put on and take off positions in microseconds in the course of a single day.Nils-Robert Persson, executive chairman at Cinnober, a Swedish trading technology company, says high-frequency traders need to have “a second opinion on their risk” since they pose new types of risks in markets. “Much of the clearing house technology that you are seeing now is based on old systems and is out of date.”Industry experts say intraday positions can be large. In the trading world many systems take snapshots of traders’ positions every so often, say, every five minutes or longer. Yet five minutes in HFT can be a long time. “You can have within that five minutes a massive spike and you wouldn’t know it,” says an executive at a technology company.Efforts to tackle the risks for clearers have led this week to the launch of a service by Eurex Clearing, the clearing arm of Deutsche Börse, which allows market participants to pre-set limits on the amount of risk they are prepared to take when trading. Thomas Book, member of the Eurex executive board responsible for clearing, says: “A reactive risk management approach is not sufficient to cope with the increasing speed in the trading environment.”In the US, CME Group, operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and clearing houses, has already acted. It introduced a system last year that calculates margin requirements throughout the day. Amy McCormick, director of market risk management, says not all clearers are up to speed on updating their technology. “Certainly I think all clearing houses are still working on this issue,” she says.IntercontinentalExchange, a CME rival, sends customers reports on important financial information such as margin “in near real time”. Paul Swann, chief executive of its London-based clearing house, says other clearers report this information only “a couple of times a day.”Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange points out an added problem. He says the fragmentation of trading across multiple venues – exchanges, “multilateral trading facilities” and “dark pools” – means national securities regulators often do not have access to a consolidated picture of trading and clearing activity.“The next stage in the regulation and management of equities clearing risk is likely to involve intraday exposure management. “Given that it is estimated that intraday HFT-type flow contributes in the region of 50 per cent of pan-European equity flows, real-time monitoring of intra-day flows and exposure in a fragmented environment is a logical and necessary next stage in market evolution,” Mr Rolet added.Alexander Justham, director of markets at the UK’s Financial Services Authority, says that it is working to ensure international regulation and laws provide for “the appropriate mitigation of intraday risk to central counterparties and their participants.” With such disparities in the information available, it is little wonder that regulators are only now starting to catch up.www.ft.com/tradingroom
539;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-11-30T19:51:49Z;Lessons from a serial outsider;;Jeff Sprecher, the 55-year-old chief executive of Intercontinental Ex­change, the US’s second biggest fut­ures exchange group, says he learnt one of his most important business lessons 26 years ago, when he was trying to buy an apartment and start a business at the same time.Not long out of business school, Mr Sprecher was looking to raise capital to start a power plant. It was a risky venture, which meant his personal fin­ancial situation was far from guaranteed. “I was trying to get a $95,000 mortgage to buy a condominium and I was struggling to qualify,” he recalls. “As an entrepreneur, it was very hard to get a mortgage when you didn’t have a consistent income.”Wall Street, however, was much more accommodating. Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment bank, helped him undertake a $50m junk-bond of­fering. “I learnt in my 20s that it was easier to borrow money for a good idea than it was to borrow money for something traditional like a home,” says Mr Sprecher. “It’s much harder to raise a small amount of money for a small idea, oddly.”As a speaker at entrepreneurship conferences and as CEO of ICE, he is approached by entrepreneurs for advice on raising funds. He always asks if their proposal could become a big business. “If so, I can show you how to raise the money quite easily. If you just are trying to raise $50,000 …it’s very difficult.”The successful junk-bond offering turned Mr Sprecher into a fan of the banking titans of global finance, a position he maintains even though it has become decidedly unfashionable. “It’s popular to bash Wall Street, but there are a lot of people on Wall Street who helped me raise capital and backed my vision,” he says.Such steadfast support is no great surprise. Not only were big banks among ICE’s original backers, but Mr Sprecher also tapped those contacts in a high-profile recent venture that involves offering trading and clearing of credit default swaps, the privately negotiated transactions widely perceived as having exacerbated the financial crisis, just as they were targeted by regulators as in need of reform. The success of that business has been largely down to Mr Sprecher’s ability to persuade the biggest CDS dealers – such as JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, Citi and UBS – to enter into a consortium with him.Speaking in a hotel in downtown Chicago, where ICE is meeting with executives who are in town for the Futures Industry Association Expo, the industry’s annual jamboree, the ICE chief is dressed formally but his manner is much less so. His conversation is peppered with analogies to the “real” world beyond high fin­ance, rather than the acronym-laden discourse common in the industry.Normally based at ICE’s headquarters in Atlanta, visiting the Midwest is like a homecoming for Mr Sprecher. He grew up in Wisconsin, the son of a life-assurance salesman whose work ethic he cites as one of his inspirations. Mr Sprecher visits Chicago regularly and owns an apartment there.His career has been marked throughout by both big ideas and a capacity for adaptation. After 17 years in the power in­dustry, he founded ICE as an electronic platform for trading energy futures in 2000. Since then, he has expanded it into clearing non-listed derivatives and trading carbon emissions credits.While ICE has a market capitalisation of more than $8bn, Mr Sprecher stresses that he still operates like an entrepreneur and takes every opportunity to impart that knowledge to people trying to start a business. Certainly, he retains an in­stinct for spotting opportunities amid upheaval and uncertainty. His power-plant-building career followed deregulation in 1978, which enabled private companies to own power stations. A move into energy futures came as Enron, a big energy derivatives trader, was collapsing. Similarly, Mr Sprecher’s expansion into offering trading and clearing of credit default swaps, in which ICE reduces counterparty risk by standing between buyers and sellers and guaranteeing trades, is exactly the res­ponse to the crisis that US lawmakers wanted.Within the finance sector, Mr Sprecher is viewed as someone who has shaken up a rather clubby world. “He has made a significant mark on the industry in a fairly short amount of time,” says Bill Brodsky, chairman and CEO of the Chicago Board Options Exchange. “He doesn’t shy away from new challenges or from taking a new and creative approach to things.”Indeed, Mr Sprecher’s competitors have been increasingly forced to take him seriously, especially since he has shown himself able to beat established companies at their own game.When it comes to his management style, however, Mr Sprecher says he knows his limits. “I’m a terrible manager and I’m not a corporate guy, yet I’m the lead manager of a corporation, so we’ve organised the company to promote entrepreneurship,” he says. “That means I don’t make every decision. You have to give decision-making to people and trust them. You also have to allow them to fail. Part of being an entrepreneur and a risk-taker is having failure. I don’t have to be a good manager. I just have to be a good hirer of other entrepreneurs.”Coming from outside the finance industry, Mr Sprecher feels he was able do things that an insider could not. He took over exchanges such as the International Petroleum Exchange in London and the New York Board of Trade and made them all-electronic, which meant closing legendary trading floors – such as the Nybot floor which featured in the film Trading Places – in spite of protests of local traders.He also caused a stir in 2007 with an audacious bid for the Chicago Board of Trade, nearly derailing the CME’s attempt to acquire it to bec­ome the world’s biggest futures exchange. Even though he ultimately fail­ed, Mr Sprecher regards the move as a success. First, he forced his biggest rival to raise its bid by $3bn and, second, by being seen as a serious bidder he enhanced ICE’s credibility.Mr Sprecher is also happy to take an unconventional approach to hiring. ICE’s head of operations, for example, is a former head of his condominium association: “We had problems with dogs de­fecating in the elevators and all the ridiculous things that go on in a condo building, and he rolled up his sleeves and took control.”This thinking is driven by a belief that while great ideas are important, good employees are critical to im­plementing them. That, he says, is something entrepreneurs often forget when they approach ICE to invest in or buy them. They demand he sign confidentiality or non-compete agreements before revealing their ideas without realising that he wants to fund companies that have the right people, too. “Businesses are not just ideas, they’re people who can execute those ideas,” he says.A similar mistake that he sees small entrepreneurs make repeatedly is to cling on to 51 per cent of their companies. “To be in control, you don’t need 51 per cent. You need to be a person who has vision and provides leadership,” he says.When ICE started, for example, Mr Sprecher handed over 80 per cent of its equity – to banks such as Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, and to energy companies including BP Amoco and Royal Dutch Shell – for nothing more than a commitment to use the exchange. “That has turned out to be a fabulously good deal for those companies and also for me,” he says.He is not sitting back, however. “Only the paranoid survive . . .We still feel like we’re on the mountain [but] at higher altitudes, and the environment is much harsher,” he says.“There’s probably more fear and panic in the company now than in earlier days. Back then, our expectations were low. Now we realise we’re an important part of the financial industry.”
540;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-11-19T17:21:43Z;NYSE Euronext push into OTC derivatives clearing;;NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenues, unveiled a plans to push into over-the-counter derivatives (OTC) clearing, putting it head-to-head with CME Group, owner of the world’s biggest futures exchange.The group told an investor conference in London that it would offer interest rate futures clearing early next year once its US clearing house venture has been approved by regulators.It also said it was considering clearing OTC equity derivatives, aiming to profit from new regulations for the market designed to reduce market instability.NYSE Euronext has been building a clearing house called New York Portfolio Clearing in conjunction with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the New York-based post-trade group. It was set up as part of the group’s attempt to win market share from the CME in a range of US futures contracts.“Our NYPC venture with DTCC is out for comment. That should be approved in early 2011 and related to that, we expect to launch interest rate futures in direct competition with the CME, probably in February of next year and and those assets will be cleared with NYPC,” Duncan Niederauer, chief executive told an investor conference in London.The group also told investors it was looking at clearing OTC equity derivatives as, like rival exchanges, it looks to carve carve out business beyond its traditional business of cash equities.There are ongoing consultations with market participants to validate assumptions,” Garry Jones, the group’s head of global derivatives, said. “The solutions will link up to existing widely used OTC infrastructure and will leverage our planned purpose-built clearing-house.”Mr Jones said NYSE Euronext aimed at the G14 group of major derivatives dealers and their counterparties by building out BClear, NYSE Liffe’s cleared service for equity derivatives.NYSE Euronext’s interest in clearing for the equity derivatives market, which Mr Jones estimated had a notional outstanding value of $6,6000bn, comes as regulators in Washington and Brussels push more clearing of OTC products to improve transparency in market structures.For exchanges, getting paid a fee every time a derivative contract is cleared is an attractive source of revenues. Exchanges such as CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange and Deutsche Börse have joined LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house, in pushing into the emerging market.Clearing puts a third party in the middle of every trade, which means the risks and costs of defaults are absorbed by the clearing-house members.Regulators in the US are writing the detailed rules for clearing in the wake of the Dodd-Frank Act, which promises the most radical overhaul of privately traded OTC derivatives in their 20-year history.The US group announced in May this year that it would start clearing its own equity and derivatives trades in Europe, following Deutsche Börse in operating its own execution and post-trade services. It will use two new clearing houses, in London and Paris and built at a cost of $60m, and NYSE Euronext said it expected to earn annual revenues of about $100m from 2013.Dominique Cerutti, president and deputy chief executive, also told investors that it would probably make acquisitions to meet its target of reaching $1bn in technology revenues by 2015. In the year to date, it has made $330m of revenues, NYSE added.
541;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;ICE Clear Europe to accept gold as margin collateral;;Intercontinental Exchange, the US futures exchange group, has followed rival CME Group by allowing its European clearing house to accept gold bullion as collateral for transactions.The precious metal will be permitted for initial margin only for all energy and credit default swaps (CDS) transactions from November 22 and will be accepted by ICE Clear Europe by electronic transfer in increments of 1 troy ounce. It will be priced daily using the London gold fixing price in US dollars.The use of gold to satisfy margin requirements has traditionally been relegated to extremely liquid securities and some currencies but futures exchanges are increasingly looking at accepting the metal.CME Group, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, last year allowed up to $200m of gold to be used to cover margin requirements for trades on all its markets as an alternative to debt or equities. The metal was physically stored at the JPMorgan Chase bank in London.Demand for gold has pushed the metal to an all-time high, leading Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, to argue that the world should to consider readopting a modified global gold standard to guide currency movements.The International Monetary Fund has accelerated the rate at which it is selling its gold but most analyst expect central banks to be net buyers of gold next year.“We are pleased to offer these enhancements as the first clearing house in Europe to permit gold bullion as collateral,” said Paul Swann, president of ICE Clear Europe. “Particularly in times of economic change or uncertainty, the addition of gold and Euroclear Bank’s triparty collateral management services bring additional flexibility and security to the markets we serve globally.”ICE Clear has more than 330 energy contracts for clearing and has cleared more than €3.7 trillion in gross notional value to date across 130 credit derivative products. Collateral for ICE Clear Europe currently includes cash and government securities.It comes a few weeks after ICE Clear Europe also agreed a deal with Euroclear Bank, the international central securities depository, through which European government bonds could be used as collateral to fulfil initial margin requirements.
542;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-11-03T18:14:26Z;CFTC commissioner ‘disappointed’ with CME Group;;A top Washington regulator has launched a scathing attack on the CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, for refusing to co-operate in the introduction of position limits in futures markets.Bart Chilton, one of the five commissioners of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the US futures watchdog, told the FT he had been left “frustrated and disappointed” by a meeting with the CME in Chicago on Tuesday ahead of the Futures Industry Association Expo, the industry’s annual jamboree.Under the Dodd-Frank bill l on financial regulatory reform, mandatory position limits are due to be introduced in energy and metals markets by mid-January and on agricultural commodities by mid-April.However, Mr Chilton said the CME was apparently hiding behind wording in the legislation that said such limits should be introduced “as necessary”. The CFTC commissioner said he suspected the exchange group was hoping to use the language to avoid implementing mandatory position limits.He complained that the CME had “refused to engage in a dialogue” with him over the issue.“I had hoped to gain some sense of how we should thoughtfully implement the mandatory position. Their position, however, is that there isn’t a need for additional limits and that the law doesn’t require that they even be implemented,” Mr Chilton said.“I think that would be news to the folks who wrote the law,” the CFTC commissioner said. “For me, it is very clear what we are required to do. Taking a pass on implementing position limits is a major non-starter. Congress passed the new law, it was signed by the President and we have to implement limits - full stop.”Mr Chilton said that by contrast, Intercontinental Exchange, the US’s second-biggest futures exchange, had been “very helpful and thoughtful” about the issue.The CME filed a comment with the CFTC last week in which it argued urged for a delay in the imposition of position limits until the CFTC collected more data to enable it to determine and police limits.Noting that the Dodd-Frank Act allows the CFTC to make broad exemptions to the new rules, the CME also urged the regulator “to accommodate all non-speculative positions”.A CME spokesman said the language of the legislation “might be up for interpretation”.Mr Chilton has proposed extending position limits to financial futures and to high-frequency traders, but he admitted that he had not worked out the details of how such a proposal might function in practice.
543;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-11-03T15:46:00Z;TMX Group opens London office;;The TMX Group, Canada’s largest exchange company, has opened an office in London, a potential prelude to deepening its ties with the London Stock Exchange.TMX Group, whose subsidiaries include the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Montreal derivatives exchange, jointly with the LSE owns EDX London, a derivatives exchange.The LSE sold TMX a minority share in the exchange in 2009 in order to license Sola, the platform developed by TMX that has helped the EDX expand beyond its original markets, Nordic and Russian equity and fixed income options.TMX is also interested in accessing international investors to grow its TSX Ventures exchange, a market for small-cap listings has seen strong growth among tech and mining companies in North America.“We’ve built a strong and diversified portfolio …and have begun to expand our business to international markets over the last few years,” said Thomas Kloet, chief executive.Shares in the independent TMX have jumped 9 per cent in the past month, as speculation of exchange mergers have picked up following the Singapore Exchange's bid for its Australian counterpart.Mr Kloet last week said that he was open to exploring merger or partnership opportunities for the TMX.Its Natural Gas Exchange, which trades physical gas, recently partnered with the IntercontinentalExchange, an electronic futures market based in Atlanta.
544;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-11-01T22:34:19Z;End of US carbon trading looms;;The owner of the US’s only nationwide cap-and-trade market has signalled the death of the seven-year-old industry, saying companies were no longer interested in trading carbon emissions credits in the absence of government legislation.IntercontinentalExchange, the US futures exchange group, in July bought UK-listed Climate Exchange, operator of the European Climate Exchange – which trades CO2 allowances as part of the mandatory European Union Emissions Trading Scheme – as well as the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Chicago Climate Futures Exchange.Although CCX’s market is voluntary, since launching in 2003 it attracted large US companies such as Ford, Bank of America, Cargill, IBM and Intel. Members made a voluntary but legally binding commitment to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction targets either by cutting emissions or by buying emissions permits sold by members.The business depended on the notion that the US would impose carbon emissions caps on companies and give its blessing to a market for trading credits, turning CCX’s voluntary trading into a mandatory market.However, Senate Democrats over the summer abandoned a push for cap-and-trade legislation. With Republicans expected to register big gains in Tuesday’s midterm elections, prospects for legislation look more remote than they have for several years.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said he remained bullish on emissions trading in Europe, where ECX is profitable. However, he signalled the death of the industry in the US, where cap-and-trade is a lossmaking business.“The voluntary market that was created has an expiration date of the end of this year in it,” Mr Sprecher said. “The bulk of the users have said to us that they really don’t want to continue to trade voluntarily in the absence of any credit for their work by the current administration.”He made the remarks as ICE reported third-quarter profits ahead of Wall Street’s expectations, although its projections for revenues from clearing credit default swaps came in below analysts’ forecasts.The company earned a net profit of $96m or $1.29 per share in the quarter, up from $87m or $1.18 per share in the same period a year ago.
545;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-11-01T16:46:21Z;Commodities trading lifts ICE results;;A strong upswing in futures trading drove better-than-expected sales and income at Intercontinental Exchange, the electronic marketplace, but slowing in credit and commodities trading tempered enthusiasm for the results.Revenues rose 12 per cent to $287m, compared to the third quarter of 2009, with boosts to both its on-exchange and over-the-counter trading of energy contracts.“Despite what continues to be challenging time from a global economic perspective, the strong demand for commodities has resulted in consistency in our results,” said Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive, during a conference call.“With exposure to emerging market economies and the eventual economic recovery in Western countries, we see attractive secular growth opportunities over the long term.”Exchange-traded futures clearing and transaction revenues were especially strong, up 20 per cent over the past year, driven by demand for oil, gas and other commodities as a weak dollar and rebounding China drives demand. Over-the-counter revenue rose just 5 per cent.Both, however, were lower than their record levels reached in the second quarter of 2010, as the same summer trading volume slump that hit equities and bonds also weighed on commodities, though to a far lesser extent.Revenues from the trading and clearing of credit derivatives were also lower, at $42m for the quarter, compared to $43m in the same period a year ago.The group’s shares were down 0.8 per cent in midday trading, at $114.00. The shares are still up 2 per cent since the beginning of the year.ICE said it forecast fourth-quarter profit on credit-default swap clearing revenues at ICE Trust – a new line of business driven by changes in US regulation that will require standardised CDS to be centrally cleared – at $14m to $16m.“What you are seeing in the fourth quarter is simply a typical market slowdown in the fourth quarter in CDS,” said Mr Sprecher.That would be a drop from the third quarter’s $18m, representing a “disappointing …first sequential decline in what is seen as an early-stage growth story”, said Ed Ditmire, financial services analyst at Macquarie in New York.Mr Sprecher said that 422 brokerage firms have cleared $13,000bn in notional contracts with ICE and that its clearinghouse’s guarantee fund was now large enough to withstand the simultaneous default of its two largest customers, which he said highlighted the fact that competition may not be the best model for clearing.“We have seen comments by regulators that they expect potentially a flurry of [clearinghouses],” he said. “I think people are underestimating the magnitude of the investment that it has taken to put systems in place.”Overall, net income at the group was up 10 per cent, thanks in part to a sharp decrease in its tax rate, at $96m for the third quarter versus $87m in the same quarter last year.Earnings-per-diluted share were $1.39 after excluding 13 cents of non-recurring costs from ICE’s April acquisition of the Climate Exchange. The adjusted figure topped consensus estimates of $1.36.However, savings were achieved as more trading at Creditex, the credit derivatives brokerage acquired in 2008, went from voice to electronic. Mr Sprecher said that about 57 per cent of third-quarter volume on Creditex was electronic.“Under Dodd-Frank [US financial reform bill], it’s going to push it to further electronic,” he said.ICE also announced on Monday that it had acquired TradeCapture OTC, which provides web commodities trading software that will assist in ICE’s development of an Apple app to be launched later this year. Terms were not disclosed.
546;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-10-27T17:28:47Z;Canada’s TMX has appetite for buying;;TMX Group, operator of the Toronto stock exchange, has indicated that it wants to be part of the accelerating merger and acquisition activity among the world’s exchanges.Unveiling record third-quarter earnings, Tom Kloet, TMX’s chief executive, said that “we clearly remain committed to exploring opportunities for growth whether they’re organic, or in other ways such as acquisitions, investments, partnerships or business combinations”.TMX shares have surged 9 per cent since the Singapore Exchange announced a A$8.4bn ($8.1bn) bid this week for its Australian counterpart. The deal is widely seen as a harbinger of accelerating consolidation among markets around the world.Besides the Toronto exchange, TMX owns the Montreal derivatives exchange and has a majority stake in the Boston options exchange and a North American market for natural gas and electricity contracts. The group, listed in Toronto, has a market value of C$2.6bn ($2.5bn).Mr Kloet, who was formerly chief executive of the Singapore exchange, noted that TMX has formed numerous partnerships outside Canada as part of a drive to diversify revenues in response to intensifying competition in its core equities trading business.Its natural-gas exchange has formed a technology and physical clearing alliance with the Chicago-based Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).The Canadian group also bought a 20 per cent stake last year in the London stock exchange’s equity derivatives business, known as EDX London.After falling steadily in the past 2-3 years, the Toronto exchange’s share of equities trading in Canada has recently stabilised at about 75 per cent. “We will continue with our aggressive efforts to maintain and even expand our market share”, Mr Kloet said.TMX is awaiting regulatory approval for an alternative domestic trading system known as TMX Select which will offer a simplified market structure, expanded trading hours and different pricing models.The commodities boom has benefited the TSX Venture Exchange, a TMX subsidiary which specialises in small-cap listings, especially in the mining and energy sectors.Mr Kloet said that new partnerships would be judged on whether they “fit our strategic plan, provide benefits to the Canadian capital markets and provide shareholder value”.TMX’s third-quarter net income grew by 22 per cent to C$50.8m, on an 8 per cent rise in revenues to $141.6. The quarterly dividend was raised by 5 per cent to 40 cents.

548;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
549;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-10-21T10:37:55Z;LSE hires former head of LCH.Clearnet;;The London Stock Exchange has hired Patrick Birley, the former head of the UK arm of LCH.Clearnet, in one of the clearest signals to date that the stock exchange is planning to build its own clearing house.An LSE spokesman confirmed that Mr Birley had been hired but declined to comment on what his role would be. People familiar with the situation said Mr Birley would become the head of its new clearing house.The issue of direct exchange control of a clearing house has intensified as clearing becomes more important amid regulatory reforms in the wake of the financial crisis.It comes as Europe is poised for a shake-up of the clearing house market. Fragmentation of the market has led to fierce competition among rival clearing houses. Talks are underway between The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade services group, its European subsidiary Euro CCP and EMCF, a Dutch clearing house, about rolling up their clearing house operations into one house.A clearing house sits between buyers and sellers, guaranteeing that trades are completed between the two parties even if one party defaults.The LSE has made no formal announcement to build its own house but Xavier Rolet, chief executive, has been exploring the idea in recent months. The LSE has been in talks with a group of Wall Street and European banks about jointly building and funding a clearing house in London while Mr Rolet also stepped down from the board of LCH.Clearnet, the LSE’s long-standing clearing house in August.Faced with a declining market share in its traditional equities business, the LSE has targeted competing against the dominant derivatives exchanges in Europe: Eurex, owned by Germany’s Deutsche Börse, and NYSE Liffe, the former London International Financial Futures Exchange.However the LSE lags behind global peers in not having a clearing house big enough to match its ambition to grow in derivatives, a second weak spot for the LSE.Mr Birley was chief executive of the UK arm of LCH.Clearnet for eighteen months under July 2007. He also headed the European Climate Exchange, which was subsequently bought by Intercontinental Exchange.
550;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-10-11T12:14:40Z;ICE to offer world’s first ERU futures contracts;;IntercontinentalExchange, the US operator of futures exchanges, is to offer the world’s first futures contracts in Emissions Reductions Units.The contracts are part of 30 new cleared over-the-counter (OTC) energy contracts for North American power, natural gas liquids and global oil products.ERUs are trading units or credits developed under the Kyoto Protocol which can be sold by project developers to organisations in industrialised countries to help them meet greenhouse gases reduction targets.They represent an emission reduction equivalent to one metric ton of carbon dioxide and are originated more by emerging markets. A large pipeline of ERUs is expected in coming years as countries such as Ukraine sell units to maturer economies.Trading in ERUs makes for a small but logical step for Atlanta-based ICE, which has built itself into one of the world’s largest energy and commodity trading businesses through a string of acquisitions.In April it snapped up Climate Exchange, the UK-listed operator of US and European carbon emissions trading platforms, in a deal valuing the group at £395m ($604m).ICE expects the market to attract the same sorts of market participants that use the trading scheme to meet emissions allowances targets, such as power companies, industrial and manufacturing firms.All of the new contracts will be available to trade from November 8.
551;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Concerns mount over clearing reforms;US futures regulators to decide on landmark reforms;When US futures regulators gather in a brown brick building in Washington, DC, on Friday, they will kick off a series of decisions they must make on how to implement landmark financial reforms passed by Congress in June.On the agenda is the crucial issue of ownership and control of clearing houses. While they have been around since the 19th century, they are set to become arguably as important to the safety of the financial system as banks.That is because they are set to handle vast swaths of over-the-counter derivatives, as mandated by the so-called Dodd-Frank act that sets the stage for sweeping reform of the way such markets function.The prospect of clearing houses having to handle far more business – and thus risks – than before turns them from being mundane parts of the market structure into systemically critical institutions.A clearing house guarantees trades are completed even if one party defaults.Yet many clearing houses are also for-profit businesses and are jostling for a piece of the action as chunks of the privately-traded OTC market start to be cleared.Many observers question whether it is right to have rampant competition in clearing. Some see clearing as so important to the integrity of the financial system that it should be viewed a quasi-public utility – not a business for the unfettered pursuit of profit.Yet at the same time regulators are keen to see market participants have choice as to where to put their trades for clearing, to keep fees as low as possible and encourage innovation.Striking a balance has been made hard by the fact a handful of clearers have moved quickly to start clearing key parts of the OTC derivatives business.IntercontinentalExchange, which operates clearing houses in the US and Europe, already dominates clearing of credit default swaps, the second-largest part of the OTC derivatives markets after interest rate swaps. LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearer, has been clearing dealer-to-dealer interest rate swaps for 10 years.Susan Milligan, senior counsel at the Options Clearing Corporation, says: “There is a tension between regulators’ desire to see competition in clearing for OTC derivatives and the fact that natural monopolies tend to arise in on-exchange clearing.”Market participants say they want to avoid having to rely on a single clearer for one type of OTC derivative. That could create a monopoly with the clearer being able to dictate fees and other financial issues like the level of collateral that participants have to post to the clearing house as default insurance.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, says: “The market doesn’t want to give any one entity a monopoly on any one product, yet capital efficiencies tell you you don’t want 20 CCPs [central counterparties, or clearing houses].”Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the University of Houston, adds that regulations mandating more clearing “put the market on the horns of a dilemma”.“Risk-reducing and netting possibilities are maximised with a small number of CCPs, but this creates the potential for these entities to exercise market power and poses a systemic risk, as the failure of a big CCP could jeopardise the entire market,” he says.LCH.Clearnet says the economics of clearing “encourage consolidation” towards “a couple of clearing houses per asset class for global markets, in addition to regional clearing houses for locally traded contracts”. This should still ensure competition and customer choice, it says.Yet there are concerns competition will tempt clearing houses to lower standards as a way to attract business, for example by allowing participants to post less collateral than rivals. Charles Rauch, analyst at Standard & Poor’s, says: “This is our biggest concern, that to get market share there would be changes to tariffs on the fringes of risk management policy.”Regulators are trying to address these dilemmas by tackling conflicts of interest in the ownership of CCPs. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, will vote on Friday on whether to proceed with a proposal that would limit the voting rights of certain groups of financial player in any CCP.But Ms Milligan says: “How this all plays out nobody yet knows.”
552;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-09-12T21:10:22Z;New ICE Link service to streamline CDS;;IntercontinentalExchange, the US operator of futures exchanges, clearing houses and over-the-counter (OTC) markets, has launched a service which makes it easier for counterparties trading credit default swaps to confirm their trades legally.The move is another step in simplifying and automating processes in OTC derivatives markets, many of which have long been manual, leading to errors.Regulators have been pushing for over a year the introduction of systems and processes that automate OTC derivatives processes to make these markets more transparent.Last year T-zero – a business owned by ICE through its acquisition in 2008 of inter-dealer credit derivatives broker Creditex – rolled out a new platform to convert old credit default swap trades into new streamlined positions for dealers and their clients, readying them for clearing.CDS are contracts which offer insurance against the default of banks, companies and other entities.The new service launched by ICE Link – as T-zero was recently renamed – involves occasions where a counterparty involved in a CDS wants to close out their position or assign it to another counterparty – known as assigning, or novating a trade.At the moment assigning the process is vulnerable to error, leading to difficulties in getting legal confirmation that novation has occurred.Clive de Ruig, global head of ICE Link, said: “No matter how careful you are it is often a manual process in the middle office of a bank and you can end up failing to be able to legally confirm trades because there will be errors in the trade data.”The new system, known as “novation consent=confirmation”, telescopes the two current processes of consent and confirmation of a trade in to one single step, a version of a process often known as “straight through processing” (STP).ICE Link said that its STP eliminated “re-keying of details and manual compares and reconciliations, allowing easy tracking and auditing by the novation counterparties”.Mr de Ruig, said this ensured that all three parties to a trade agree the trade data “up front and in a timely and accurate manner”. The moment they all agree it is legally confirmed.He added: “We believe that true efficiency and risk reduction in trade processing comes from an automated process to which all major market participants have programmatically connected their trade capture systems.”Simon Morris, managing director at Goldman Sachs, said this automation of the consent and confirmation process “reduces operational risk and cost for our clients and the industry as a whole”.
553;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-08-23T09:48:06Z;LSE’s Rolet quits board of LCH.Clearnet;;Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, has stepped down from the board of LCH.Clearnet in the latest sign that the exchange is distancing itself from its long-standing clearing house and is closer to building its own clearing business.It is also further evidence that key customers of the London clearer are peeling away from LCH.Clearnet, raising pressure on the clearer to grow its over-the-counter derivatives business further to compensate.The London clearer issued a notification to Companies House on July 22 saying Mr Rolet had resigned. The former Lehman Brothers banker told the clearing house verbally that he was “too busy” to attend board meetings, LCH.Clearnet said.Mr Rolet inherited the seat from his predecessor, Clara Furse, who was handed one of two seats then owned by what was then Euronext, which at the time held 41.5 per cent in LCH.Clearnet.The LSE did not at the time and still does not have any shares in LCH.Clearnet.Mr Rolet was known already to be frustrated with the way the 16-member LCH.Clearnet board functioned given its diverse make-up, consisting of exchanges that use the clearer, banks that are clearing members of it and others, many with competing agendas.Critics of LCH.Clearnet – which include some of its board members – have long argued that the way the board is composed is one of the clearer’s key weaknesses, leading to slow decision making.In May, Mr Rolet sent a shot across LCH.Clearnet’s bow by signalling for the first time that the LSE might be looking for an alternative provider of clearing services.He said the lack of “in-house capabilities” in the post-trade business at the LSE and “dependency on certain not-always-ideal external suppliers” had prevented the London bourse from “innovating successfully”.The comments were taken as a sign that the LSE will build its own clearing house in London. The 210-year old bourse is one of the last big exchanges to fall into line with a global trend towards exchange ownership of post-trade businesses, especially in derivatives.Since then speculation has been rife that the LSE would build it own clearing capability for its London cash equities market but also to underpin ambitious plans to build a pan-European derivatives presence.The LSE is an exception among its global peers in not having a fully-integrated clearing house for equities and derivatives. Without one, it can not build a derivatives business with any hope of rivalling that of Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, and NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext.Both have their own clearers. Also in May, NYSE Euronext unveiled an ambitious plan to push into equities and derivatives clearing in London and Paris, severing remaining ties with LCH.Clearnet.LCH.Clearnet suffered its first big client loss in 2008 when Intercontinental Exchange set up its own London-based clearer, severing ties with LCH.Clearnet.Direct exchange control of a clearing houses – in a so-called “vertical silo” model – is intensifying as the lucrative business of clearing becomes an increasingly important part of market reforms in the wake of the financial crisis.A clearing house acts as buyer to every seller, and seller to every buyer in a transaction, stepping in to complete a trade if one party defaults.
554;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-08-19T09:07:05Z;JPMorgan veteran hired as SwapClear CEO;;LCH.Clearnet has hired Michael Davie, a 20-year veteran of JPMorgan, as its first chief executive of SwapClear since the interest rate swaps clearing services was launched in 1999.The move is part of the London-based clearing house’s efforts to win so-called buy-side, or “client”, clearing of over-the-counter derivatives in the US.Legislation passed in June, known as the Dodd-Frank bill, mandates greater use of clearing of OTC derivatives, among them interest rate swaps – by far the largest part of that market.Large non-bank users of rates swaps – such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing lenders – are expected to start using cleared OTC derivatives, promising a wave of business for clearers.However, LCH.Clearnet faces stiff competition from International Derivatives Clearing Group, a rates swaps clearer set up by Nasdaq OMX, from CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange.LCH.Clearnet said that with Mr Davie’s appointment, SwapClear would “focus on ensuring the best possible products and services are delivered to the buy-side”.Roger Liddell, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet, said: “Clients represent a large proportion of the global interest rate swap market. Michael’s appointment reflects our commitment to delivering OTC derivative clearing services to the buy-side and of ensuring that SwapClear’s market leading offering evolves in line with their needs.”Joe Reilly, director of SwapClear, will remain in that post and report to Mr Davie.Mr Davie’s last job at JPMorgan was chief financial officer of its global fixed-income sales.
555;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-08-11T21:51:13Z;Financial markets: Derivative dilemmas;Reform seeks balance of rules and rewards;Ari Bergmann is putting the finishing touches to a course he will begin teaching at New York University in a few weeks. Yet, in spite of his best efforts, much of the curriculum cannot yet be written. That is because of a big battle that is about to explode, on Wall Street and in the deepest bowels of Washington.Mr Bergmann will teach people ranging from investors to corporate treasurers how to spot financial risks and how to manage them. The tools used to do this are derivatives, which he first traded in the 1980s – contracts whose value is linked to a financial instrument, from the rate of interest paid on US government bonds to the price of oil.The derivatives market is one of the biggest in the world. At the end of last year, contracts with a face value of $636,431bn were swirling around the world’s financial system, according to the Bank of International Settlements. Just 3.4 per cent of the total were traded on exchanges. The rest – $614,674bn worth, equivalent to nearly 10 years of global economic output – were agreed and traded in private markets, under terms struck directly between the buyers and sellers.Over the next year, an entirely new rulebook is to be drawn up for this privately traded part of the financial markets, also called over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. President Barack Obama’s signature on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on July 21 started the countdown. The legislation covers many parts of the financial system. Title seven – the part that deals with derivatives – is “among the most far-reaching and controversial sets of statutory changes” included in the new laws, according to lawyers at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.But whereas in theory the business is about to be revolutionised, in reality any changes will be preceded by bitter haggling over precisely what the rules prescribe– and proscribe. Crucially for banks, investors and the future health of world economies, just how far-reaching the outcome will be depends in large part on the decisions made by the two Washington regulators who will police a market that grew dramatically in recent decades without direct oversight.The two – the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – have increased their staff numbers in anticipation of the rule-writing and their huge extra enforcement duties. For the most part, the rules have to be written by July 2011. These are regulators that usually write just a handful of new rules every year but, thanks to the new legislation, there will be more than 100 definitions and rules to get through. “Many of the key terms in the derivatives legislation are either undefined or are left for the regulators to fill in,” says Cadwalader.The root cause of the financial crisis involved losses on risky US mortgages. The entire global financial system was exposed to these mortgages after hundreds of billions of dollars of complex securities linked to them were sold to investors from Illinois to Iceland. Derivatives were the building blocks for those securities.The degree to which derivatives had created a dangerously interconnected financial system became clear amid the collapse of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG in 2008. A default by one bank at the centre of a tangled web of derivatives contracts could paralyse the entire financial system, because the derivatives could become worthless if the bank writing the contract went under.“In the wake of the recent financial crisis, over-the-counter derivatives have been blamed for increasing systemic risk,” said Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff in a paper earlier this year. “OTC derivatives serve a vital role in financial markets but deficiencies in the market design and infrastructure allowed for misuse of these instruments, exacerbating the recent financial meltdown.”Regulators have swept in to restore confidence in markets before. After the crash of 1929, the SEC was set up to police the equity markets and create structures that would reassure investors the cards were not stacked against them. The CFTC, with its roots in commodity markets, has done the same for exchange-traded futures. Now, the regulators will try to do the same for derivatives markets.“The Wall Street reform bill will for the first time bring comprehensive regulation to the over-the-counter derivatives marketplace,” says Gary Gensler, chairman of the CFTC. The new rules will “lower risk, promote transparency and protect the American public”, he adds.Under the new regulations, the derivatives world will be divided in two. On one side will be those products that are widely used, simple in structure and actively traded: standardised derivatives. Those will be pushed on to clearing houses to make the financial system less vulnerable to the default of a big derivatives dealer.Clearing houses can reduce counterparty and systemic risks by standing in the middle of trades – though there of course remains a risk the clearing house itself may fail. The clearing house has a pool of capital and collects collateral and margin – up-front payments against possible losses. If these resources are not enough to cover a default by a member, the others are supposed to cough up.Cleared derivatives will also have to be traded on electronic systems – although exactly how those systems will be defined, and how quickly and frequently price information has to be made public remains to be resolved. Mr Bergmann, who advises investors on derivatives strategies, says public pricing would reduce the chances that buyers – such as municipalities or small pension funds – would overpay. Customers who pay banks too much would soon know if the value is lower than they thought. If the contracts are centrally cleared, they would have to come up with an extra margin to pay the clearing house as soon as the price falls. “Mispricing of derivatives has often not been discovered until it is a disaster,” says Mr Bergmann. “In theory, with widespread clearing people will know about it before it becomes a disaster.”Once regulators determine what part of the OTC derivatives or swaps markets has to be cleared, the remaining part will also be policed. No one knows what proportion will be uncleared, or what the targets are, although for all derivatives the more heavily regulated exchange-traded futures market provides the likely standard. “Look at the way futures have traded on exchanges,” says Viral Acharya, professor of finance at NYU’s Stern business school. “Similar practices, in one way or another, will be applied to OTC derivatives under new regulations. There will be more capital required, less leverage and less opacity.”How regulators decide the clearing houses should hold the collateral against trades, and the extent to which derivatives users can offset positions against each other, will also be key. Banks have built huge internal clearing systems in recent decades, divisions usually called “prime brokerage”. Through these, big institutional investors or hedge funds can buy and sell all kinds of financial instruments – from bonds to credit derivatives to currency swaps to commodity investments – and offset them against one other. If an investor has to pay for each part of the trade – usually called a “leg” – having to hand over cash for each piece could add up. If the positions are offset, the trade can be done much more cheaply.“We still don’t know what kinds of trades will be profitable or which of our customers will have to change their investment strategies,” says the head of prime brokerage at one big bank.These questions about the costs also mean that the risks of the clearing houses and the business model behind them cannot be properly worked out – leaving investors in limbo. “When we use a clearing house, we have to be able to make a case as to why we think they are financially sound,” says the head of trading at one of the biggest institutional investors. “We cannot determine this until we know what the new rules will be.”There is a lot to play for. According to Tabb Group, the biggest derivatives dealers generate revenues of $40bn a year from the OTC business.As the rules are rewritten there will be much behind-the-scenes jostling as current derivatives big-shots – which include all the Wall Street banks – try to hang on to market share and newcomers try to muscle in. “This is a big business opportunity,” says Larry Tabb, chief executive of Tabb Group.The cast of characters embraces not only big banks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank but exchanges such as CME Group, Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext and Intercontinental Exchange, which want clearing business. It also includes smaller banks and brokers that are trying to expand their derivatives business, for instance Nomura and Jefferies, as well as inter-dealer brokers including Icap, and other financial groups that want to get into clearing or trading, from Tradeweb to State Street to tiny start-up brokerage firms.The outcomes will affect investors, banks and companies that use derivatives extensively for hedging. The end result will also depend on what happens in Europe. “A lot of these things won’t work well if one centre applies rules that are not as strict,” says Mr Arachya.With the answers to the questions about the future shape of the derivatives markets now in the hands of staff and commissioners at the regulators, the CFTC’s Mr Gensler says CFTC and SEC teams have already met five or six times since the legislation was passed. A series of public hearings is expected to be held from September onwards.The potential for turf wars is of concern, as is the possibility of disruption to investment and trading activities. “The enormity of the proposed changes could result in both short-term pain for users of swaps and participants in the derivatives markets generally, and long-term unintended and undesirable changes in the marketplace,” say lawyers at Jones Day. “The extent to which the rulemaking process will provide the necessary clarity will depend in part on how well the CFTC and SEC are able to work together in areas of potentially overlapping jurisdictions.”Whatever the case, the coming months will determine what is ultimately discussed in Mr Bergmann’s course about risks and markets. Not for nothing is the biggest section in his course outline entitled: “Derivatives: weapons of mass destruction or weapons of mass protection?”
556;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-08-04T16:59:42Z;US carbon emissions trading in doubt;;The future of carbon emissions trading in the US is in doubt because of the lack of cap-and-trade legislation, Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange, said on Wednesday.The US has a voluntary nationwide cap-and-trade market organised by the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). Its parent, UK-listed Climate Exchange (CLE), was bought by ICE last month for £395m ($627m). CLE also operates Europe’s main carbon emissions trading platformsAlthough CCX’s market is voluntary, since launching in 2003 it has attracted large US companies such as Ford, DuPont, Bank of America, Cargill, Monsanto, Honeywell, IBM, Motorola and Intel. Members make a voluntary but legally binding commitment to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction targets either by cutting emissions or by buying emissions permits sold by members who have reduced emissions below target.In spite of luring big companies and possessing significant political clout, the receding prospect of the US passing cap-and-trade legislation has drawn into question the whole idea of carbon trading as a viable business.Mr Sprecher, whose move for CLE was a big bet on the future of carbon trading, questioned the future of the business on Wednesday. “These companies have voluntarily agreed to cap and walk-down their carbon footprint,” he said of CCX’s members.“It remains to be seen now in an uncertain US regulatory environment whether companies are going to want to continue to walk-down their carbon footprints, whether or not they’re going to get credit for it . . . and how the Environmental Protection Agency oversees carbon and whether the EPA will give them credit for the work they’re voluntarily doing. That’s one question we have to ask the marketplace.”In the absence of new legislation, the EPA could implement a carbon regime based on the Clean Air Act that would set emissions limits but may not allow for carbon trading – raising the prospect of “cap, but not trade”, he said.Mr Sprecher made his comments as ICE reported second-quarter earnings and revenues above Wall Street’s expectations as trading surged in energy and commodities, economic uncertainty drove up financial hedging and the company benefited from cost-cutting.The company earned $102m, or $1.51 per share, excluding extraordinary items, up from $72m, or $1.13 per share, in the same period a year earlier and ahead of analysts’ consensus forecasts of $1.41. Revenues were $296m, above expectations of $293m.ICE shares were up 2.25 per cent at $109.83 at mid-day in New York.

The company’s first commercial customer was the Russian central bank. Mr Aitken, who has been chairman of the company, will stay on in an advisory role.Last month, Smarts signed up US-based IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) to install a market surveillance platform, making ICE the Australian company’s largest derivatives customer.Other companies providing similar services include MillenniumIT, the Sri Lankan technology company recently acquired by Nasdaq rival the London Stock Exchange, and Redkite, a UK-based company.
559;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-07-07T13:58:25Z;BNY Mellon to become clearing member of IDCG;;Bank of New York Mellon said on Wednesday that it will become a clearing member of the International Derivatives Clearing Group (IDCG), which is focused on interest rate swaps, the largest sector of the over-the-counter derivatives market.The move comes at a time when the battleground for clearing derivatives is heating up as the pending US financial reform bill mandates that standardised swaps, such as those for interest rates, be cleared by a central counterparty, or CCP, which is designed to lower systemic risk.“With the rapid changes occurring in the clearing and settlement process for derivatives, our clients want a capable, stable partner that has membership in clearing organizations like IDCG to support their growing and evolving trading needs,” said Sanjay Kannambadi, chief executive officer of BNY Mellon Clearing.To date, IDCG has only shadow cleared swaps, and traders say it needs to attract support from established dealers in order to gain critical mass.Garry O’Connor, chief executive officer of IDCG, said: “The ascension of clearing members from the banking community is an important step forward for IDCG, and demonstrates the market’s broader movement towards our clearing solution.”IDCG is seeking to clear and settle swaps by converting them into economically equivalent futures contracts and has attracted the support of NewEdge and MF Global, two leading non-bank futures commission merchants or FCMs.IDCG is majority-owned by Nasdaq OMX and BNY Mellon holds a minority stake in the clearer.The main CCPs of interest rate derivatives are LCH.Clearnet, the CME, IDCG, Eurex in Germany and Brazil’s Bovespa.Seperately, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said on Wednesday that the cumulative gross notional value cleared by its credit default swap clearing houses surpassed $10,000bn during the week ending July 2.In the US, ICE said it had cleared $6,000bn of CDS indices (CDX) and $272bn in single-name CDS, resulting in open interest of $435 bn. ICE Clear Europe cleared €2,400bn in iTraxx indices and €379bn in single-name CDS, resulting in €371bn of open interest.

562;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-06-28T02:49:56Z;Singapore aims to become derivatives clearing hub;;Singapore is pushing to become an Asian hub for derivatives clearing to poach business from Europe and the US as sweeping regulation reshapes global markets.The Monetary Authority of Singapore is discussing ways of expanding the city state’s clearing capacity, possibly by allowing international derivatives clearing houses to compete with the two existing exchange clearers, according to financial sector executives.“MAS has been talking to clearing organisations, the exchanges and the banks about what more can be done on the clearing side in Singapore,” said one executive.The Group of 20 major economies has committed to regulating the vast over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets by forcing as many OTC trades as possible onto regulated exchanges and other electronic trading platforms and ensuring they are processed through clearing houses.The MAS discussions are at an early stage. It remains unclear how ambitious the bank’s ambitions for OTC clearing are. Some executives said it appeared to be concentrating on commodity trades, while others said it was also looking at financial derivatives.However, several executives said MAS had approached a number of international clearing houses, including the US-based group IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), which has Asia ambitions.Other big international clearers such as LCH.Clearnet of the UK, the world’s largest clearer of OTC interest rate swaps, and Chicago-based CME Group may be approached as the plan progresses.Any new clearing operation would compete with two existing exchange and clearing operations run by SGX, the Singapore exchange, and Singapore Mercantile Exchange (SMX), owned by India’s Financial Technologies group, which has been licensed and is due to launch shortly.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, ensuring that deals are completed even of one party defaults. They have become central to the G20 financial reforms, versions of which the US and European Union are implementing separately.Industry experts say that any sign that the US and Europe may be unable to harmonise their approach to such reforms is likely to give Asian countries an opportunity to attract business unhappy with rules that emerge in the west. London and New York, which are home to the bulk of OTC derivatives trading and clearing, could lose out as a result.US and European concerns about potential clearing problems with OTC trades have been endorsed by most countries in Asia with significant financial sectors. Japan, India, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea and Taiwan have all created task forces to study setting up clearing operations for the opaque OTC markets.While Asia constitutes a small part of the global OTC markets – in which notional outstanding volumes total $600,000bn, according to the Bank for International Settlements – trading volumes are rising fast and most dealers have established footholds across in the region.None of the parties said to be involved in the talks would comment.

564;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-06-21T17:20:34Z;CME in move on iron ore swaps;;CME Group , the world’s largest derivatives exchange, has announced the launch of trading and clearing services for iron ore swaps, in a further sign of the rapid shift from traditional annual negotiations to spot pricing.The CME on Monday joined the Singapore Exchange, LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearing house, and Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange in the race to develop the iron ore derivatives market, which analysts expect will top $200bn by 2020. Today, the value of iron ore swaps hovers at $300m.The London Metal Exchange, the world’s largest base metals marketplace, has so far not launched any initiative on iron ore, although it has listed steel derivatives.The CME’s new trading and clearing service will be based on the benchmark Australian iron ore – with a 62 per cent ore content – delivered into China, as reported by The Steel Index. The contract will be 500 tonnes in size.“The ferrous industry is the second-largest commodity market by volume after crude oil,” said Joe Raia, CME managing director of energy and metals.This year, the global mining and steel industry ditched the 40-year-old benchmark system of annual contracts and lengthy price negotiations, replacing it with quarterly contracts linked to the spot market.The new pricing system could encourage companies to hedge. In particular, small iron ore miners are likely to use derivatives to lock in sale prices, while some steelmakers could hedge their input costs.As the importance of the spot physical market has grown, derivatives emerged, with Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse launching the first iron ore swaps in 2008.Since then, other banks have joined in, including Morgan Stanley, the commodities heavyweight, and brokers such as London Dry Bulk, Freight Investor Services and Icap.
565;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;CBOE raises $339m in market debut;;Shares in the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options trading venue, soared on its market debut on Tuesday after being priced at the top end of the range.The CBOE raised $339m selling 11.7m shares at $29 each – compared to its previous guidance of a range of $27-$29 – valuing the exchange at $2.97bn. By the close the stock was up 12 per cent at $32.49.The initial public offering has been widely watched as a gauge of the appetite for flotations and a guide to current exchange valuations.Chris Brendler, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said other US exchange groups with equity options divisions – such as NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq – could benefit from the CBOE’s implied valuation, which represents a multiple of about 28 times its 2009 earnings per share.Jon Najarian, a CBOE member who runs Option-Monster, the trading consultancy, said: “The pricing coming in at the high end of the range was a good sign.” Mr Najarian said that in the longer term “the real catalyst for upside is financial reform, which could easily boost revenue if they get the multi-trillion dollar over-the-counter products on to exchanges”.He added: “Given the CBOE’s intellectual property as well as technological edge I think they could win a majority of that business, which would make them a takeover target.”The CME Group, NYSE Euronext and Intercontinental Exchange have been mentioned as possible acquirers.Bringing the CBOE to market is a personal triumph for Bill Brodsky, chief executive.The IPO was held up for several years due to a legal wrangle with members of the former Chicago Board of Trade, the futures exchange from which the CBOE was originally spun off in 1973 and which was bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2008.Some CBOT members retained trading rights in the CBOE that they claimed entitled them to a share of the CBOE upon demutualisation. The issue was finally settled in a $4.2m deal last year.
566;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-06-16T00:06:48Z;Derivatives dealers clash over clearing access;;Small banks and brokers have told regulators that big derivatives dealers are blocking their access to clearing of over-the-counter derivatives, limiting the scope for new entrants into the derivatives market.In a letter sent to the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a group of 20 brokers that includes Jefferies and Newedge said the rules at clearing houses like Intercontinental Exchange and CME Group meant big dealers were able to determine who got access.“Rules and workflows at the clearing houses currently are working to restrict access to only the incumbent dealers,” the letter from the Swaps and Derivatives Market Association said.The brokers’ concerns add to the debate about derivatives clearing as new laws are close to being passed in the US, laws which will require that many of the over $600,000bn of over-the-counter derivatives contracts traded on a one-on-one basis with big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs be cleared and traded on electronic platforms.Already, regulators including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have pushed dealers and clearing houses to make more efforts to allow investors such as Pimco or BlackRock as well as large hedge funds direct access to clearing and remove the dominance of dealers as counterparties in the derivatives markets.Now, the calls for more access from brokers who do not yet trade derivatives due to their private nature, but will once these contracts are cleared, are likely to add further pressure on the current dealers that dominate the market. Regulators could be given powers to mandate that some widely used derivatives like interest rate swaps must be cleared.Derivatives dealers have agreed to give regulators more information about over-the-counter derivatives trades in the credit, interest rate and equity markets and have agreed to shift more trades towards central clearing.Extending clearing to large dealers as well as big investors is widely regarded as an important step toward reducing derivatives risks, but in practice it is complex to implement.“Remaining impediments to the expansion of buy-side access to clearing include legal and regulatory, risk management and operational issues,” said a group of large derivatives dealers and investors in a recent letter to the Fed. They said “a meaningful amount of open interest in buy-side transactions will be cleared”.
567;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;ICE set to clear sovereign CDS trades;Move fulfills central demand by regulators seeking transparency;Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the Atlanta-based electronic exchange group, said on Wednesday it expected to begin clearing sovereign credit default swaps within the next few months, fulfilling a central demand by regulators, who are keen to bring more transparency to the market.Its comments came as new data indicated the sovereign CDS market was relatively liquid, suggesting that clearing may be easier than some had feared.Figures compiled by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which runs a data “warehouse” where CDS trades are recorded, show sovereign CDS are more actively traded than most individual bespoke over-the-counter credit derivatives insuring against a default by a single company.Some European politicians have accused speculators of exacerbating the Greek debt crisis by manipulating sovereign CDS contracts, a form of insurance against default, and have demanded the market be overhauled and more closely regulated.On Wednesday, the German government banned the naked short selling of eurozone sovereign bonds, either directly or using CDS. The European Commission plans to bring in legislation in the autumn that will include “appropriate” measures for sovereign CDS, which are expected to include more disclosure and possibly a ban on some naked activity.CDS dealers have pledged that they will help establish criteria for which trades should be cleared.“Providing greater transparency for CDS is a critical part of the ongoing commitments the industry is making to global regulators,” said Conrad Voldstad, chief executive of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. “Increasing central clearing of CDS will be another step to further mitigate risk in OTC derivatives trading.”Under centralised clearing, the clearing house absorbs the counterparty risk from financial contracts – a risk that came into focus after the default of Lehman Brothers in 2008. If the bank backing the derivative defaults, the clearing house will ensure the contract is honoured. Clearing houses charge margins to put aside to cover any potential defaults and also often have pools of emergency funds.Although sovereign CDS are in strong demand as investors seek to hedge credit risk, liquidity and trading activity can sometimes be extremely low. Clearing houses need to be able to sell positions whenever they require, and illiquid markets could make this difficult.
568;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-05-20T15:51:39Z;Agri swaps face prospect of central clearing;;Agricultural swaps, largely ignored in the over-the-counter derivatives debate, could be sent to clearing houses in greater numbers under a plan floated by the US commodity regulator.The push by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission comes as Congress finalises legislation that would require most standard derivatives to be cleared in hopes of preventing the kinds of derivatives risks that forced the taxpayer bail-out of insurer AIG.The proposed legislation will not alter the rules for agricultural swaps, so Gary Gensler, chairman of the CFTC, is looking to conduct his own independent review of clearing rules for agri swaps and pave the way for greater clearing of these derivatives.In a speech last week, Mr Gensler proposed to “generally allow” agricultural swaps to be cleared, or processed and guaranteed by an exchange clearing house. At the moment, the commission authorises each new swap individually in a process that can take a year or even longer. CME Group started clearing corn, wheat and soyabeans swaps in April 2009, but is still awaiting CFTC approval on swaps tracking live cattle, lean hogs and other types of risks in grain markets. Fewer than 20,000 contracts have been cleared since this date.IntercontinentalExchange is approved to clear swaps based on sugar, coffee and cocoa, but volume has likewise been light.Clearing OTC commodity contracts gained momentum after the 2001 failure of Enron, which left energy traders exposed to a bankrupt counterparty. The 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy accelerated the clearing of private oil swap deals.At $2,944bn in notional value, OTC commodities are a fraction of broader derivatives markets and were not central to the global financial crisis. But worries about the risk of a counterparty default has stirred some interest in clearing. This year CME cleared commodity index swaps at the request of UBS, the investment bank.
569;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;SEC eyes trading circuit breakers;Quick-fire trades blamed for fall;"The Securities and Exchange Commission and leading US equity exchanges on Monday laid the ground for the creation of an industry-wide safety valve designed to temporarily halt trading in stocks, in response to last week’s trading turmoil.The SEC issued a statement after it met with chief executives from six equity exchanges that said: “As a first step, the parties agreed on a structural framework, to be refined over the next day, for strengthening circuit breakers and handling erroneous trades.”The House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets will on Tuesday hold a hearing about the turmoil last week.The chiefs of the four main exchanges, NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX Group, Bats Global Markets and Direct Edge – the public venues for US share trading – together with International Securities Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, the CME Group, and the IntercontinentalExchange later met with Tim Geithner, US Treasury Secretary, and Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.The meetings were held as Senator Charles Schumer called for coordinated circuit breakers across the country’s equities, options and futures exchanges.Last week, the four main exchanges agreed to cancel a number of “erroneous trades” that saw some leading stocks trade at a cent or less in price as support prices vanished from electronic markets during a 20-minute period on Thursday afternoon.A specific trigger for the sell-off is still unknown – the S&P 500 was pushed down a further 4.6 per cent in a matter of minutes after it had fallen by about 4 per cent.Blame for the sudden eruption in selling and the subsequent rebound has been cast on rapid-fire computer programs, while rival exchanges and traders criticised the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for slowing down trading in its listed stocks.During times of stress the NYSE trading floor implements circuit breakers, which other trading venues can ignore to continue trading. Market participants say the implementation of an industry-wide circuit breaker designed to temporarily halt trading in a stock should its price deviate sharply from its last trading level, may be difficult across the fragmented US market.There are also questions about how private trading networks at banks and dark pools will operate under such curbs.Those participants say the SEC might also elect to allow an exchange where the company is specifically listed – for example, the NYSE or Nasdaq – to implement circuit breakers that the rest of the market will have to abide by.The SEC has been conducting a broad review of the equity market structure since January and said that last week’s turmoil “is inconsistent with the effective functioning of our capital markets and we will make whatever structural or other changes are needed.”Under the SEC’s directives for boosting competition and lowering commissions in recent years, equity trading in the US has fragmented across different venues and become highly automated raising concerns about the kind of plunge witnessed last week.An official at one exchange says the challenge will be for the industry to reach consensus on such matters as competition between them, other private networks and dark pools is intense.Among those testifying at Tuesday’s House hearing are: Mary Schapiro, chairman of the SEC accompanied by Robert Cook, director, division of trading and markets; Gary Gensler, chairman of CFTC; Lawrence Leibowitz, chief operating officer of NYSE Euronext; Eric Noll, executive vice president at Nasdaq; and Terrence Duffy, executive chairman, CME Group.Congressman Paul Kanjorski, chairman of the committe said on Monday that the hearing will “thoroughly examine this situation in a public forum to maintain the integrity of the markets and promote investor confidence”."
570;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-05-05T18:30:52Z;ICE chief backs financial reform;;Financial regulatory reform around the world would spur trading in over-the-counter derivatives by bringing certainty to the markets, the head of the US’s second-biggest futures market said on Wednesday.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), said that the push for market transparency and more use of centralised clearing – which regulators have promoted in response to the perceived role of OTC derivatives in exacerbating the financial crisis – would help his business.However, he added that the market itself was likely to be ahead of Congress in anticipating structural changes. The US Senate is currently debating financial regulatory reform.“Most of the technical issues that we had concerns about got fixed in the House bill and translated into the Senate bill,” Mr Sprecher said.“The drafts that are floating around today are a net positive for us.”ICE has emerged as the leading global clearing organisation for credit default swaps – the OTC contracts most often cited as having aggravated Wall Street’s financial problems – having cleared CDS contracts on both sides of the Atlantic with a face value of some $8,000bn. Centralised clearing removes the counter-party risk associated with privately negotiated contracts.Even so, the exchange group said on Wednesday that it was still in an “investment phase” with CDS clearing, betting that trading volumes will grow once Washington decides on rules for the market.Regulatory uncertainty has been weighing on both ICE and the CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange. As well as the debate over the OTC market, proposals to limit speculative energy trading and to require banks to spin off their OTC trading desks have added to the unclear outlook for exchange groups.Mr Sprecher said that the OTC credit derivatives market was in transition to a futures-style clearing model, where customers post margin payments with their brokers, from a traditional model, in which brokers lend against other customer assets, converting them into cash. “We’re going to end up with a hybrid,” he predicted.He made his remarks as the exchange group reported quarterly results ahead of Wall Street’s expectations as the company benefited from strong energy trading activity.The company made a net profit of $101m or $1.36 per share, up from $72m or 98 cents per share in the same period a year earlier, on revenue of $282m. Analysts had on average forecast earnings of about $1.31 per share and revenues of $279m.The results confirm a trend of renewed growth in the US futures market, coming a week after CME reported a 21 per cent rise in net income and its best quarterly results since 2008.ICE shares were trading up 5 per cent at $119.17 by mid-morning in New York on Wednesday.
571;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-05-03T00:31:56Z;Clearing Corp funds derivatives research;;"The Institute for Financial Markets, an affiliate of the main US futures industry lobby group, on Monday said it would fund six academic studies on trading, clearing and over-the counter derivatives.The move comes as legislation is being hammered out in Washington, DC that promises sweeping change to the way the futures and over-the-counter derivatives markets function.The IFM said the studies covered areas “whose understanding and potential resolutions are of critical importance to the trading and clearing of listed derivatives worldwide”.The research will be released in the third quarter of this year.The IFM describes itself as an “industry-sponsored educational foundation” and “independent affiliate of the Futures Industry Association”, the Washington-based lobby group for banks, brokers and exchanges in the futures markets.Funding for the research comes from a $2m grant to the IFM given by The Clearing Corporation Charitable Foundation. The Clearing Corporation, based in Chicago, was acquired in March last year by IntercontinentalExchange, the operator of futures exchanges, OTC platforms and clearing houses.Research would be done by academics from Yale, the University of Illinois, Singapore Management University, University of Delaware, HEC Paris, and Hong Kong Baptist University.The IFM said the research would be used “to educate market users, policy makers, regulators, academics, and other interested parties”.“Individual research studies will be subjected to a rigorous peer-review process and published in a special edition of the Review of Futures Markets,” the IFM said, referring to a quarterly journal published by Kent State University and the IFM.The six studies are:• “Clearinghouse, margin requirements and systemic risk” – to be researched by Jeffrey H. Harris, of University of Delaware and Christophe Perignon, HEC Paris;• “Policy implications of position limits” – to be researched by Bernard Lee, Shih-Fen Cheng and Annie Koh of Singapore Management University;• “Direct Market Access in exchange-traded and cleared derivatives” – to be researched by Ahmet K. Karagozoglu, of Hofstra University;• A “Survey and critical evaluation of studies and international practices on how futures clearinghouses can accommodate OTC cleared products and traditional futures” – to be done by Joseph Fung, of Hong Kong Baptist University Kowloon Tong;• An “Assessment of pending legislation on clearinghouse risk” – to be researched by Eugene L. Kunda and Robert Hauser, of University of Illinois; and• “Direct Market Access and high-frequency data” – to be researched by Frank J. Fabozzi, of Yale UniversityThe IFM said the academics were picked by IFM and an advisory committee the Clearing Corporation Foundation Endowed Fund, whose members include: Michael Dawley, a managing director at Goldman Sachs; Ronald Filler, professor of law and director of the Center on Financial Services Law, at New York’s Law School; John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association; Peter Borish, chief executive of Computer Trading Corporation; and Walter Lukken, chief executive of New York Portfolio Clearing and former acting chairman and commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
572;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-05-01T02:38:11Z;ICE snaps up Climate Exchange for £395m;;"Climate Exchange (CLE), the UK-listed operator of US and European carbon emissions trading platforms, was on Friday set to be snapped up by IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) after its board recommended a cash offer from the US exchange operator valuing the group at £395m ($604m).The deal marks a bold move by Atlanta-based ICE, into emissions trading after a string of acquisitions that have built the business into one of the world’s largest energy and commodity trading business.ICE’s last strike on a London business was in 2001, when it bought the International Petroleum Exchange, home to world trading in Brent crude oil.The deal makes sense for both the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) – the US unit of Climate Exchange – and ICE, which have become increasingly close in recent years. ICE last year took a 4.8 per cent stake in CLE, whose chairman, Richard Sandor, sits on ICE’s board. ICE has also been providing clearing and execution services for CCX.Chris Allen, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities, said: “Given that the future of emissions trading is dependent on new laws to reduce emissions trading, which look a few years away, this is clearly a long-term bet for ICE.“Although it is hard to define the potential size of the emissions market longer term, we believe that it clearly represents a long-term growth opportunity and is a market that should provide long-term synergies with ICE’s core energy platform,” he said.The purchase by ICE of its 4.8 per cent stake in CLE was at 644p a share. Friday’s offer for the remaining shares was at 750p a share.Climate Exchange has three main businesses: European Climate Ex-change, which trades certificates for mandatory European Emissions Trading Scheme; Chicago Climate Exchange, which operates the world’s first voluntary cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions reductions; and the Chicago Climate Futures Exchange, a regulated exchange in the US for environmental futures contracts.CCX was founded in 2001 by Richard Sandor, a former economist at the Chicago Board of Trade credited with pioneering the cap-and-trade business in the US and later abroad.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive and founder, said: “The combination of Climate Exchange’s emissions markets and ICE’s futures and OTC energy markets is an important and logical strategic combination.”"
573;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

ExxonMobil was 2.1 per cent lower over the week at $67.77 as the energy producer posted weaker than expected results for the first quarter on Thursday, hit by losses at its US oil refineries.Shares in Palm surged 15.5 per cent over the week to $5.81 as the smartphone maker announced on Wednesday it had sold itself to Hewlett-Packard for $5.70 per share, or $1.2bn, representing a 23 per cent premium over Palm’s closing price on Wednesday.Over the week, Hewlett-Packard was down 3.6 per cent to $51.97.Nasdaq OMX Group yesterday lost 3.9 per cent to $21 as the transatlantic exchange trading group posted first-quarter results that missed analyst estimates.Operating profit fell 10 per cent to $92m, or 43 cents per share, in the first quarter compared with a year earlier – lower than the average analyst estimate of 46 cents per share.Futures exchange IntercontinentalExchange lost 1.8 per cent to $116.63 yesterday on news that it is to buy Climate Exchange, a London-listed carbon exchange, for about $604m.The price is a 57 per cent premium over the target’s closing price on Thursday.McAfee, the maker of computer security software, yesterday declined 12.1 per cent to $34.75 after reporting weaker than expected first-quarter results, as earnings were hurt by a glitch in some of its software products."
575;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-04-27T19:00:38Z;CME opposes plan over limits;;CME Group is opposing a plan by the US commodity regulator to limit speculative energy trading by hedge funds, investment firms, banks and oil companies.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission in January proposed to limit traders’ holdings in US crude oil, natural gas, heating oil and gasoline futures and options.The proposed rule would make it very difficult for Wall Street swap dealers and energy companies both to hedge their commodity risks and to bet on price swings.CME, whose New York Mercantile Exchange hosts the most widely traded energy futures contracts, urged the CFTC not to approve the plan.“If implemented, the proposal would exacerbate further the shift away from transparent CFTC-regulated markets to less restrictive venues,” the Chicago-based company said in a letter to the regulator.“Moreover, market participants would necessarily remain uncertain of what further changes might quickly follow based on the results of legislative processes.”CME rival IntercontinentalExchange said in earlier comments that position limits were not necessary to prevent concentrated positions but might help to apply regulations fairly among competing exchanges.
576;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-04-16T10:39:00Z;Quick View: LCH.Clearnet versus IDCG;;It is the oldest trick in the book: accuse your competitors of price dumping.That was what LCH.Clearnet seemed to be doing this week when Roger Liddell, chief executive of Europe’s largest independent clearing house, criticised the risk management policies of his US rival, International Derivatives Clearing Group (IDCG), for being “much more lenient” with its margin policy than the London-based clearer.LCH.Clearnet was effectively accusing IDCG of using margin collateral as a competitive weapon in the battle to win as much clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps as possible.Tracy Alloway on FT Alphaville sums up the issue neatly.The big prize for these clearers – and CME Group and ICE in the US – is the huge amount of uncleared OTC interest rate swaps that are expected to be up for grabs when big users of such swaps start to move these contracts into clearing houses.That is distinct from the dealer-to-dealer interest rate swaps business, more than 60 per cent of which is already cleared by LCH at its SwapClear unit in London.All eyes are on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which like the idea of being able to clear their swaps portfolios. They say being able to use a clearing house – or central counterparty (CCP), to use the jargon – removes the tedium of monitoring the credit risk of each counterparty that they have bought their swaps from.Together they manage a $2,500bn-$3,000bn mortgage portfolio, and they use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate differential between that and their cost of borrowing.So it is not surprising that clearing houses are doing all they can to woo entities such as Fannie and Freddie.Except for one thing: clearing houses were never really supposed to behave as profit-seeking businesses, with all that implies in terms of aggressive price cutting and out-manoeuvring your rivals.Some would suggest clearing houses were supposed to remain quasi-utilities. They are still rather dull places, staffed by eggheads versed in the arcane but crucial tasks of calculating margin and worrying about the mathematics of default scenarios.There is a reason for that: managing the huge risks associated with billions of dollars worth of trades is a serious business. Clearing houses like LCH.Clearnet have long maintained capital buffers way above statutory requirements.Yet as regulators push for more clearing of OTC derivatives, it has become clear that clearers will compete with each other for business – and already are.ICE, the CME and Eurex spent much of last year racing to build the first credit default swap clearing facility, with ICE winning in the end. CME is trying to get a London-based CDS operation off the ground to compete with ICE’s London-based CDS offering. Meanwhile LCH.Clearnet SA, the Paris-based arm of LCH.Clearnet group, this month stole a march on CME by launching a new CDS clearing service out of France.LCH.Clearnet has an agenda of course when it comes to IDCG. Fannie and Freddie’s regulator recently cast doubt on whether it would channel any business to SwapClear, questioning UK bankruptcy laws in cases of a default. No such issue with IDCG, which is US-based and stands a good chance of mopping up quite a bit of Fannie and Freddie business.Amid all of this, regulators are nervous. The European Commission has said that the increasing use of CCPs “will inevitably increase their systemic . . . importance”. That is why Brussels and US authorities insist that there be robust regulatory requirements for CCPs to avoid a race to the bottom on risk management standards.The nightmare scenario is of course that in its zeal to attract customers – some all too happy to accept lower margin requirements – a clearer might take on too much risk and itself default, sparking a fresh financial crisis.IDCG is at pains to say it has perfectly robust risk management standards in place. But it cannot be forgotten that IDCG represents a huge bet by Nasdaq OMX to get into the OTC clearing business and a lot rides on its success or failure: Nasdaq OMX’s share price was the worst performing of any large exchange last year, and chief executive Bob Greifeld will not want a repeat of that this year.After the Lehman brothers collapse, there was an opportunity to insist that clearing houses readying themselves to clear the new wave of OTC derivatives be as far as possible built and maintained as quasi-utilities, perhaps with certain wiggle room allowed for competition.But it was an opportunity that regulators missed.Some are now calling for central banks to make clear that they be lenders of last resort for clearing houses, that they backstop such structures if they get into trouble.But that would merely compound the problem as it now stands: it would remove the incentive for clearers to beef up their risk margining, strengthen the robustness of their systems and prepare themselves for the new world of OTC clearing that is upon us.The trouble is, can we really trust clearing houses to do this when they are fighting each other for business?
577;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-04-15T18:45:59Z;LCH.Clearnet warns on loose standards;;LCH.Clearnet has accused some of its global rivals of using loose standards to assess the amount of insurance traders must take out against a catastrophic default, in an apparent attempt by Europe’s largest independent clearing house to win business.The development is a sign some clearing houses are trying to highlight the dangers of “competing on margin” – that is, lowering the minimum funds that must be posted by market participants to a clearing house to guard against failures.Regulators fear that clearing houses might start to use margin as a competitive weapon to attract business as they battle for a slice of the vast over-the-counter derivatives markets.They say this could lead to a “race to the bottom” on the financial strength of a clearing house, increasing the risk that a clearer could collapse, potentially triggering a financial crisis.Regulators have insisted clearers adopt the highest possible risk management and margin standards in the wake of the crisis to ensure the safety of clearing houses and the wider financial system. A clearing house acts as a buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer in transactions, using margin to ensure transactions are completed in case of default.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, said: “There seems to be a divergence from a risk management standpoint as to how CCPs [central counterparties or clearing houses] are operating.”He said IntercontinentalExchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange – two US exchanges with OTC derivatives clearing operations – “margin differently” from each other. Mr Liddell singled out International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearing house set up last year to clear OTC interest rate swaps, and controlled by Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator.“The most extreme case is between us and IDCG. Their approach to risk is much more lenient than ours,” Mr Liddell said.Michael Dundon, IDCG chief risk officer, said: “We do not have more lenient standards in that we recalculate our margins on a daily basis. We are very responsive to volatility on a daily basis.”CME said: “The group regards risk margining as essential to proper counterparty risk controls and does not calculate margins according to commercial considerations.”ICE said: “We’ve warned that competing on margin could create a race to the bottom.”
578;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-04-13T21:40:16Z;Former CFTC chief Lukken to head NYPC;;Walter Lukken, former acting-chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, was on Tuesday appointed as chief executive of New York Portfolio Clearing (NYPC).NYPC is a clearing house recently set up by NYSE Euronext and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the New York-based post-trade group. It has been set up to offer “cross-margining” between cash bonds and derivatives and will be a key part of NYSE Liffe’s attempt to win market share from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a range of US futures contracts.Mr Lukken joined NYSE Euronext as senior vice-president in the group’s office of the general counsel in July last year, not long after he left the CFTC when the US administration changed. he was the top regulator responsible for overseeing futures exchanges – mostly CME, which dominates US futures trading.His move to NYPC is the second high-profile appointment of a former government employee involved in regulation of the futures and clearing business in recent months. IntercontinentalExchange last month hired Peter Roberson, a key figure in drafting over-the-counter derivatives reform legislation in the House of Representatives financial services committee.Mr Lukken said: “I look forward to using my extensive knowledge and relationships within the derivatives industry to help NYPC bring new competition, efficiency and innovation to the marketplace.”At NYPC Mr Lukken would “lead NYPC’s drive to be the first clearing organisation to margin cash fixed income positions and their natural derivatives hedges together, in a way designed to substantially improve both operational and capital efficiency”, the company said.Donald Donahue, chief executive of DTCC, said NYPC would be “a catalyst for change in the US futures market by delivering capital efficiency to its members and by introducing a unique, horizontal clearing model”.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, said: “Walt is a respected voice in this industry with a unique and diverse set of experiences that will lend themselves well to this project.”NYPC is undergoing “regulatory review” and expected to be operational in the third quarter.
579;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-04-05T16:42:46Z;Quick View: Barney Frank’s revolving door problem;;Newsflash: congressional staffer quits to join a company affected by legislation he was working on.So far, so normal in the revolving door between Congress and business in Washington, DC.But that was not the reaction to news last week that Peter Roberson, a former top member of congressman Barney Frank’s staff on the House financial services committee had left to become a lobbyist for ICE, the US operator of futures exchanges over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets and clearing houses.Critics howled that it just didn’t look good that Mr Roberson, who was responsible for drafting Mr Frank’s OTC derivatives reform bill, was now on the payroll of an exchange that stands to benefit from such legislation. Worse, he is now free to lobby Senate staff on that chamber’s version of the bill.The aim of Mr Frank’s bill – and a draft working its way through the Senate – is to shift more OTC derivatives onto exchanges and clearing houses.A furious Mr Frank went so far as to issue a press release banning his staff from having any contact with Mr Roberson, as long as Mr Frank remained chairman. He said that when Mr Roberson was hired, “it never occurred to me that he would jump so quickly from the committee staff to an industry that was being affected by the committee’s legislation”.Hmm. This stuff happens in Washington. But it is relatively rare for a staffer to jump ship in the midst of a major piece of legislation like this. Congressional rules ban Mr Roberson from having any contact with House committee staff for a year, but he is free to contact Senate staff.Mr Frank’s reaction was needlessly petulant. He also may not have encouraged future recruitment to his committee by being quite so publicly heavy-handed in his response.But he was fundamentally right: it just doesn’t look good, especially as seen from Europe, where the revolving door is not quite as well-lubricated in Brussels.Europe has a big stake in how OTC derivatives reform plays out and is more than an interested bystander in how a US operator of clearing house is playing the field in Washington. Especially as ICE has a nascent OTC derivatives clearing operation in London. (ICE rival LCH.Clearnet, whose future business prospects may well be decided by the outcome of OTC derivatives legislation in Washington, will also have taken note.)The revolving door also doesn’t engender much public confidence in the integrity of a process whose outcome – we can only hope – is a balanced set of reforms designed to clean up after the biggest financial crisis in decades. Perhaps the rules need to be tightened on the timing of congressional staff defections to industry, or vice-versa.Yet there is another issue worth bearing in mind: the talent pool in the world of trading, exchanges and clearing is simply too small, a fact exposed by the Roberson episode.There just aren’t enough people around who know the business well. That explains why the moment a top executive leaves an exchange or clearing house he, or she, is never unemployed for long – witness the nanoseconds it took for ICE to snap up Chris Edmonds when he left International Derivatives Clearing Corporation, the Nasdaq-controlled OTC interest rate swaps clearer, last month.Indeed, where are businesses like ICE supposed to find people who are both versed in the arcane world of OTC derivatives and know which buttons to push on Capitol Hill?And from ICE’s perspective, there is an opportunity cost in failing to hire people like Mr Roberson. Its biggest US rival, CME Group, has reaped huge political rewards from having well-versed lobbyists on the Hill over the years. And having firepower in DC is becoming increasingly crucial for ICE, as the introduction of an amendment by senator Sherrod Brown limiting dealer ownership of clearing houses only re-inforces.So until the talent pool gets bigger, don’t be surprised if there are more Mr Robersons.
580;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-03-29T15:32:36Z;Dollar index: New records set as interest grows;;"Market lore has it that a young cotton trader on the New York Board of Trade asked the exchange’s bosses why he could not trade a product that gave him a view on the dollar involving more than one other currency.That trader was Paul Tudor Jones and the result was the US Dollar Index future (USDX), now traded on the InterContinental Exchange (ICE), which took over Nybot in 2007.“He called me one day and said: ‘I want to sell the dollar, but which proxy do you pick?’” recalls Joseph O’Neill, former senior vice-president of Nybot, now retired, explaining what led Mr Tudor Jones to suggest the creation of a dollar index instead.Launched in 1985, the contract was based on the Federal Reserve’s dollar index, which at the time tracked the greenback against 10 currencies. Today, it still does the same job but versus six currencies, because of the euro’s adoption in 1999.“We don’t ever change the weightings,” says Ray McKenzie, vice-president of ICE futures. “It echoes the US government. If the government changed the index, then we would probably use [another] US trade-weighted index instead.”Twenty-five years on, it seems to have been a wise move by Mr Tudor Jones. Open interest in the contract exploded in September 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, while the past three months alone have seen a steady string of record volume days.ICE reported its most recent record on March 12, when 77,811 dollar index contracts exchanged hands.The volume surge really took off in the fourth quarter of last year, says Mr McKenzie. This was a period that coincided with the dollar’s own market revival but Mr McKenzie prefers to attribute the momentum shift to a rise in market awareness about his product.“People follow the index but didn’t know they could trade it. They usually talk about the cash DXY, which is an index distributed by Reuters,” he says. “So we’ve been reaching out, and this has informed a lot of people.” The type of investor who trades the contract, meanwhile, is constantly changing. “Some people are outright trading the dollar index to make a dollar. Some use it as a hedge. Some do it against the cash and equity indexes,” he says.Exchange traded funds (ETFs) may also be playing a growing part. Client demand for single-currency products has been soaring. These allow investors to take a more complete view on the direction of a currency, unlike currency-pair based alternatives.One of the more established names in the field is the Powershares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund, which invests directly in the USDX’s own front-month futures.It, too, saw volumes spike from the fourth quarter onwards, although Mr McKenzie is sceptical about a clear-cut connection between products like it and USDX volumes.“They are hedging on the USDX and we’ve seen growth from that” he says. “But the ETF market itself as a proportion is still tiny.”ICE Futures’ sights remain firmly focused on institutional flows anyway.Mr McKenzie says it has already had some success in attracting new business, thanks in part to the growing trend towards cross-asset trading, as well as general advances in trading technology and the rise of algorithmic trading.“Most platforms today have very sophisticated trading tools, where you can put in multiple combinations and trade one product against the other,” explains Mr McKenzie. ”ICE crude against the dollar index is very easy to use.”All this helps to attract flow. Mr McKenzie’s view on liquidity, meanwhile, is that it has something of a snowball effect. “Liquidity breeds liquidity,” he says. “When you get to critical mass of 25,000 contracts a day, it’s hard for people to ignore it.”It was not always so. When the contract first launched in the 1980s, it failed to capture the hearts of the investment community as a tradable product.Kevin Kerr, president of Kerr International, the commodities advisory firm, cut his teeth trading the USDX on the Nybor floor alongside the likes of Mr Tudor Jones. He remembers the early days when the contract struggled to make an impact.“That market only really existed because of Paul Tudor Jones,” he says. “He supported it.“He would come in and provide the liquidity, sometimes trading a month’s volume in just one day, just to keep it going.”Mr Kerr doesnot know why Mr Tudor Jones did what he did. All he knows is that while other financial Nybot products launched, withered and died, the USDX kept going.“It became a sort of a benchmark,” he says.Not that institutional investors ever traded it. The only way to make money from the contract in those days, he says, was via a process known as “scalping”. This involved arbitraging the USDX versus currency pairs traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.“My job was to be on the phone between the two,” remembers Mr Kerr. For institutional investors, however, the product lacked liquidity and was seen as too heavily weighted towards Europe.“There are far more effective ways to hedge and that’s the problem with the contract, it’s too weighted in many ways, and it can’t be tailored,” says Mr Kerr.This leads him to conclude that the recent volume rush might be connected towhat he describes as the modern-day scalpers; high frequency and algorithmic traders."
581;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-03-28T22:05:17Z;LCH.Clearnet launches Paris clearing house;;The French arm of LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearing house, will on Monday launch clearing of credit default swaps – a victory for French efforts to ensure the processing of such off-exchange derivatives instruments is done in Paris.The development will be seen by some as a blow to London, which has long dominated the markets for over-the-counter derivatives such as CDS.Paris has long harboured ambitions to win a bigger slice of the financial services market in Europe. The credit crisis has given Christine Lagarde, French finance minister, new impetus to gain market share from London, especially in euro-denominated bonds, given France’s membership of the euro.The launch comes as German efforts to develop CDS clearing in Frankfurt, led by Eurex Clearing, part of Deutsche Börse, have failed to gain traction after months of effort. Eurex has two members: UniCredit and Nomura.The new LCH.Clearnet business will start clearing euro-denominated CDS on corporate indices, with four French banks: BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Natixis and Crédit Agricole.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, said the latest effort “was the outcome of a lot of work that is being done in Paris with French banks and LCH.Clearnet SA”.Asked if the French authorities’ lobbying for Paris had played a part, he said: “I’m sure there is an element of that”.But he said the initiative was “linked to a much broader effort working with a whole range of banks that are not based in Paris to start planning the next phase of the offering”.IntercontinentalExchange, a US operator of futures exchanges and clearing houses, is the only currently operating European CDS clearing business, and is London-based. CME Group is also working on a London-based offering.OTC derivatives have become central to the clean-up of the financial system. Regulators insist that as many as possible of such instruments should be traded on exchanges to boost the transparency of pricing information, and that they should be processed through clearing houses.In January 2009, a leaked Banque de France report revealed that French authorities were determined to ensure that any eurozone OTC derivatives clearer be based in Paris.
582;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-03-15T20:44:24Z;Lehman report raises derivatives clearing fears;;Details which have emerged about the scramble at CME, the world’s biggest futures exchange, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, have raised questions over how effectively clearing houses can process the growing volume of derivatives.A court-appointed examiner’s report into Lehman’s final hours released last week says CME convened an emergency committee that conducted a forced transfer of the bank’s positions, the only time this has been done by the exchange operator.Lehman, a clearing house member, had $4bn in margin accounts to back-stop commitments for customers as well as big proprietary bets on energy, interest rate and stock-index futures.CME’s clearing house withstood Lehman’s collapse, but observers say the events of September 2008, detailed in the 2,200-page report by Anton Valukas, show the risks of clearing less liquid contracts.“They handled it in the end, but it does demonstrate that somebody is on the hook for the implosion of a clearing member,” said Craig Pirrong, finance professor at Houston University. The blow-by-blow details of the challenges CME faced to ensure all Lehman’s cleared contracts were honoured comes amid growing pressure from regulators for more derivatives contracts to be shifted to centralised clearing as a way of spreading the risk of counterparties defaulting.Clearing houses serve as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer in a derivatives transaction, shifting the risk of default from individual counterparties to a broad and closely monitored pool of backers.CME and rival IntercontinentalExchange are competing to clear credit default swaps, which played a central role in the financial crisis.Lehman’s positions on CME’s four exchanges were in highly regulated futures and options contracts. As Lehman filed for bankruptcy, CME ordered the bank to liquidate bets made with its own money. But rather than sell off these positions, Lehman actually added to them for two days.“This continued trading activity was attributed to confusion and chaos” at Lehman, the report said.CME officials also worried that JPMorgan might stop acting as Lehman’s settlement bank. “Although it was technically possible to conduct transactions with the CME without a settlement bank, no CME clearing member had ever done so,” the report said. An exchange risk manager warned this “presented an unprecedented situation and additional risk to the CME”, says the report.CME twice sought to find bidders for Lehman’s positions, leading to a forced sale of a clearing member’s positions for “the first and only time”, and leading to substantial losses for the bank.CME has dealt with the failure of clearing members before, including the 2005 unravelling of broker Refco.CME had no comment to make on the report.Lehman’s collapse was not caused by its positions in exchange-traded futures and options, but rather by its overall debt load.However, the risks Lehman presented to CME prompted analysts to question how well clearing houses would withstand a major disruption in derivatives markets.“Just because something is centrally cleared, it does not mean that the work is done,” said John Jay, senior analyst at Aite Group.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently highlighted the risks of the growing push towards central counterparties (CCP) to clear derivatives.“If a CCP is successful in clearing a large quantity of derivatives trades, the CCP is itself a systemically important financial institution,” the Fed said in a January report. “The failure of a CCP could suddenly expose many major market participants to losses.”
583;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2010-03-11T17:35:10Z;Push for clearing houses fails to move oil traders;;Big oil traders are choosing to keep more derivatives deals private, in spite of a global regulatory campaign to steer such contracts to clearing houses.Their willingness to take on risks viewed as intolerable just a year ago reflects renewed faith in the strength of their trading counterparties, but also highlights a preference for opaque markets without a nudge from regulators. Regulators in the US and Europe want most derivatives trades to be settled and guaranteed by clearing houses.For years, energy companies, banks and hedge funds preferred to keep most over-the-counter oil trades amongst themselves, locking in bilateral deals to hedge or speculate on prices. This posture crumbled with the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, a big derivatives dealer. Traders flocked to clearing services run by exchange operators CME and Intercontinental­Exchange.While the clearing trend continues, brokers say clients are once again comfortable with leaving the risks of more specialised oil trades on the books of each counterparty. They say normalising credit markets and fears of a government crackdown on bank and corporate trading activities have convinced some traders to revisit one-to-one derivatives.A 90 per cent rise in crude prices to more than $80 a barrel in the past year has also unleashed furious hedging among oil producers, driving bilateral volume, a banker said.Michael Anderson, global head of oil at Tradition, the brokers, said the share of cleared oil trades surged from 10 to 80 per cent after the Lehman bankruptcy. “We’ve seen that percentage now fall back from the 80 per cent level to around 50 per cent of our business,” he said.“Because of potential regulation, we have seen an increase in bilateral business” between large oil companies, added Javier Loya, chairman of commodity brokers OTC Global Holdings.Another OTC broker said: “There is not the kind of risk there was two years ago. So we do direct deals.”Most market participants believe the majority of oil trades will remain cleared. CME and ICE have each introduced dozens of new oil contracts compatible with their clearing houses. Last year the volume of OTC energy contracts cleared by CME grew 16 per cent “due to market participants seeking to mitigate counterparty risk”, its annual report said. ICE saw OTC oil volumes triple.Brokers say more sophisticated derivatives, such as swaptions and swaps denominated in euros or Canadian dollars, are staying out of clearing houses.Michael Cosgrove, managing director at brokers GFI Group, said: “Time has elapsed since it looked like the world was going to fall apart. As we’ve gotten away from that, some of the more esoteric products have begun to trade again.”
584;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Open outcry as traders mourn loss of culture;;When the New York Board of Trade voted last month to close most of its trading floor, it not only lost a 137-year-old financial institution with the drama of loud, open-outcry trading and its mysterious hand-signals.The decision, which followed the Nybot’s purchase last year by the all-electronic InterContinental Exchange, also spelt the end for a piece of Americana that provided the backdrop for the 1983 Eddie Murphy film Trading Places.The development shows how as trading in equities and derivatives moves increasingly to electronic platforms, exchanges in the US and around the world are moving to close down trading floors rich with history and culture.Should the CME Group’s takeover talks with Nymex come to fruition, it seems likely that the New York energy exchange’s floor will eventually go the same way as the Nybot.“They’re definitely going to want to reduce costs,” says Rich Repetto of Sandler O’Neill, the investment bank.“They’ll close the floor. In every major consolidation between exchanges, a key driver is cost removal. They may need a floor for a little bit of time for the options, but over time, the desire would be to take out costs.”The CME insists it intends to keep open a floor trading facility in the New York area. “Open outcry is actually a very profitable business for us,” says Craig Donohue, CME Group’s chief executive.“Unlike electronic trading, we don’t have to invest in new servers and new technology constantly, so it’s a fixed-cost asset. We’ve not been ideological about it, we’ve been practical about it.”However, many suspect that pragmatic approach could prompt the CME to close down Nymex’s futures trading pits sooner rather than later. “They’ve said they’re going to leave the trading floor open, but that’s an attempt to mollify anyone at the Nymex who might want to argue against this deal,” says a former CME board member. “It’s just part of the negotiation.”Michael Manning, president and chief executive of Rand Financial Services, a clearing member of both exchanges, says: “For those involved in open-outcry futures, this deal doesn’t mean anything good. You could see it start to happen within 90 to 180 days of the deal closing.”Many in the industry also speculate that the CME’s search for cost savings will also lead them to cull administrative jobs.“My guess is that they will gut the Nymex management and staff,” says a former CME official.Unlike the CME’s takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade last year, very few Nymex directors are thought likely to be appointed to the board of the merged exchange. “The CME board is bloated with people who are not considered under corporate governance to be independent directors,” says the former CME official.“They’re basically a bunch of floor traders. They already have an oversized board with too many non-independents. If you have a board of 35, what are you going to have – a board of 40? That would be absurd.”For those Nymex floor traders who still expect that the CME will keep open outcry going, last week brought a glimmer of hope. The CME relented on plans to close its pork-belly pit as part of its merger with the CBOT.A CME official said the exchange had now found a place to accommodate the half-a-dozen traders who still trade the commodity in the traditional way.
585;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Consolidation ratchets up competition;;In the month since the “consortium of 12” unveiled a plan to challenge the CME Group’s dominance of US futures trading, much cold water has been poured on the idea.It is not hard to see why. There have been three such attempts in the past decade to loosen the grip of Chicago derivatives exchanges over the sector. None has succeeded.In addition to that poor record, the project lost its head just two weeks after the idea was first proposed when Paul Saltzman, chief operating officer of eSpeed, the brokerage, who was also acting as the new exchange’s chief executive, stepped down from both roles. It has hardly been a propitious birth.But the possibility that the fledgling consortium backed by some of the largest dealers might link up with the Intercontinental Exchange, a dynamic and fast-growing exchange with established liquidity and infrastructure, sets up the prospect of an intriguing industry battle.On one side would be a combined CME and Nymex, the world’s largest exchange group controlling 98 per cent of US listed futures, on the other a young, aggressive group with a point to prove.The ICE has already demonstrated it is not afraid of a fight with a bigger foe.Last year, the exchange launched an audacious bid for the Chicago Board of Trade, attempting to steal it from under the nose of the CME.Although the CME won that battle, it created bad blood between the two institutions.Many observers have commented this week that the CME’s bid for Nymex allows it to confront ICE in a more direct way, since Nymex and ICE compete for energy derivatives.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of the ICE, said on Thursday that the rapid evolution of electronic trading meant his exchange remained in a strong position despite the prospect of the CME taking over Nymex.He suggested that the trading structure at the Nymex was actually converging on that of the ICE, in that floor-based trading was increasing moving to electronic platforms.“We have always been at a competitive disadvantage to a floor-based exchange because we don’t have a floor,” he said. “We don’t have the brokers that are on the floor, we don’t have the information that disseminates from a floor …that is becoming less important.”Mr Sprecher said the CME’s proposed purchase of the Nymex “does not seemingly change the landscape in terms of the way we go to market in energy and the way that Nymex is increasingly going to market as an electronic participant”.He said the increasing importance of electronic trading strengthened the ICE, which has been all-electronic since its creation in 2000.The ICE chief appeared to dismiss speculation that his exchange might be interested in purchasing the Nymex.“Nymex has been available for sale for quite a long time and had presented quite an opportunity for people interested in the business,” he said. “The fact that it finally traded to somebody …was not a particular surprise.”“We’ve had opportunity – as has anyone in the market – for quite some time. There’s nothing in my mind compelling about the timing of this merger announcement for ICE.”With its announcement on Thursday that it will purchase YellowJacket – an electronic platform for over-the-counter trading that is dominant in weather contracts and also hosts natural power, gas and crude trades – ICE is looking to solidify its position in the lucrative and growing OTC market.One of CME’s main motivations in purchasing the Nymex is thought to be the New York exchange’s presence in clearing OTC trades.
586;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2008-01-31T19:40:21Z;ICE begins move to rival CME and Nymex;;"The Intercontinental Exchange has held talks with a fledgling futures exchange backed by a posse of banks and trading firms with a view to forming a competitor to a combined CME Group and Nymex.Talks are at an early and informal stage, involving meetings between members of the new consortium and ICE management, according to people close to both sides.The new exchange, the working name for which is Four Seasons, remains in its early stages of development, with internal talks about the company’s management structure and interviews for the role of chief executive taking place.Both parties declined to comment.CME and Nymex said this week they were in merger talks.Larry Tabb, founder of US consultant the Tabb Group, said that in spite of the prospects of a CME/Nymex deal, ICE was in a good position, particularly if it could reach an agreement with the new exchange.“If the dealers backing the new exchange want a place to go, they could do worse than buying an existing exchange. If they come in for the ICE, they would immediately form a competitive platform.”The powerful group of companies backing the new futures exchange are Citigroup, Citadel, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse, eSpeed, Getco, JPMorgan, Peak6, and Royal Bank of Scotland.Consolidation has swept the exchange business in recent years, and talks between almost all exchanges and their competitors and peers are a regular occurrence as participants jockey for position.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of the ICE, said on Thursday that the proposed CME-Nymex deal “does not seemingly change the landscape” in trading, noting that the New York exchange had been moving towards electronic trading, bringing it closer to ICE’s all-electronic model.His comments came as ICE moved on Thursday to shore up its position in the over-the-counter sector with the purchase of YellowJacket, an electronic platform for OTC trades in energy and weather.Sang Lee, founder of US consultancy the Aite Group, said he would not be
surprised to see ICE become a target, but also did not rule out a bid for Nymex by ICE itself.But Mr Sprecher on Thursday appeared to dismiss the suggestion that his exchange might bid for its competitor, indicating that there had been plenty of chances for ICE to try to purchase the exchange, but it had chosen not to make an offer. “Nymex has been available for sale for quite a long time,” he said. “We’ve had opportunity – as has anyone in the market.”"
587;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;CME’s ambitions rile many;;"Some in the derivatives industry jokingly refer to CME Group as the Microsoft of the exchange world – a dominant, ever more-powerful company that many love to hate but is nearly impossible to resist.If CME is Microsoft, by extension Craig Donohue, the exchange’s CEO, is the Bill Gates of derivatives. Like Mr Gates, he is pursuing a strategy to make his company the biggest and most powerful in its sector. And like Mr Gates, he inspires emotions in the rest of the industry ranging from admiration and envy to fear and loathing.The CME’s every move seems to upset someone. Its $11.3bn bid for the Nymex, though long anticipated, is no different. While the exchanges themselves seem pleased with the proposed deal – a $11.3bn cash-and-shares offer – others are grumbling. Brokers and other futures commission merchants are complaining about the power of a “super exchange”; some energy traders worry about price increases and some brokers who trade on the Nymex could even move to another exchange to avoid the CME.A more serious immediate potential problem for the CME is a possible revolt from some of the 816 Nymex members who hold “Class B” shares, entitling them to 10 per cent of trading revenues if more than 90 per cent of volumes trade electronically. The CME wants to buy them out for $500m, but at least some members are thought likely to argue this does not compensate them adequately for the loss of long-term revenues.“If the CME were to be able to buy that out for $500m, that would be pretty cheap,” says the head of one firm that trades at both the CME and Nymex. “There’s going to be some resistance or litigation. The outcome will depend on how many shareholders object. If they’re in a minority, the CME might be able to force it through.”Another hiccup could be regulatory approval, but most observers say that will be no great problem given the approval of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s takeover of the Chicago Board of Trade last year. Indeed, regulatory concerns could explain the timing of this deal ahead of US presidential elections in November.“This may have been the last opportunity for the CME and Nymex to get this done before a change of administration,” says John Lothian, editor of The John Lothian Newsletter, a derivatives markets daily briefing. “They’ve got a known quantity with the Department of Justice under the Bush administration …a Democratic or even a different Republican administration could take a different view.”The CME’s fractious relationships with brokers could bolster the development of a competitor and drive some liquidity away. Sources close to a new futures exchange being set up by a group of investment banks and trading firms said yesterday that an even larger CME was good for them, since it would stiffen the resolve of users to form a viable alternative.The head of a company in the over-the-counter energy market said antagonism between the CME and brokers could alienate some business from the exchange.“Nymex gets most of its volume through brokers and CME doesn’t have a good reputation of working with the brokers, so the over-the-counter volume might not all convey over to the CME,” he says. “They might go to ICE [Intercontinental Exchange, a rival to the Nymex] instead. These exchanges can do things that upset a lot of participants and move volume elsewhere. The customers haven’t pushed for this combination.”John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, representing the largest brokers, suggests opponents are keeping their powder dry during the 30-day exclusive negotiating period between the CME and Nymex. “This is going to be a quiet time, full of rumour and innuendo,” he says.Meanwhile, some critics hope another exchange will scupper the CME’s plans. “Just as when the CME went for the CBOT, I think we will see other players try to do something,” said Javier Loya, president and chief executive of Choice Energy in Houston, the largest liquidity provider on Nymex Clearport, the exchange’s electronic trading and clearing system. “This is just the beginning."
588;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2008-01-29T23:44:11Z;ICE in spotlight amid merger talks;;Merger talks between the CME Group and Nymex have raised the prospects that the Intercontinental Exchange, the main competitor to the Nymex in the energy trading business, will become an acquisition target.Potential bidders for the ICE include NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq, although overseas exchanges keen to gain a foothold in the rapidly expanding energy markets could also be interested, according to analysts.The ICE has been taking market share from Nymex and last year launched a counterbid for the Chicago Board of Trade. This move effectively raised the price the CME was forced to pay for CBOT before it eventually secured the all-Chicago deal to form the world’s largest futures exchange.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of the ICE, is seen as an aggressive operator. Sang Lee, founder of US consultancy the Aite Group, said he would not be surprised to see the exchange become a target, but also did not rule out a bid for the Nymex by the ICE itself. The ICE declined to comment.Several market insiders said Nymex and NYSE had been talking seriously about a combination until recently when talks appear to have broken down, opening the door for the CME. The departure of John Thain as NYSE chief executive, now head of Merrill Lynch, is not thought to have been a deal-breaker. NYSE Euronext declined to comment. Nymex did not return a call seeking comment.The fact that Nymex is already an active user of Globex, the CME’s electronic platform, is seen as the key advantage held by the CME over NYSE Euronext. However, the fact that the CME is based in Chicago might yet prove problematic for some Nymex members who worry about losing the Nymex trading floor.Javier Loya, president and chief executive of Choice Energy in Houston, the largest liquidity provider on Nymex’s Clearport electronic trading and clearing system, said the breadth of products that would be available on a combined CME-Nymex exchange would present a stiff challenge to the ICE.“The market’s always looking for liquidity and if you’re offering more services – like cross-margining between commodities, being a one-stop shop for clearing services – that’s a strong advantage,” he said. “If the CME can migrate some of the Nymex’s over-the-counter business to Globex, it will be a very healthy competitor to the ICE.”Exclusive 30-day talks between the CME and the Nymex do not ensure a deal, though people close to the talks said both sides were confident of reaching an agreement. The US Department of Justice is likely to examine the deal, although the relative lack of overlap between products traded on the CME and Nymex mean the deal is unlikely to face regulatory hurdles.Other stock exchange groups such as Deutsche Börse, which controls Eurex, have previously been linked with potential interest in Nymex.The German group refused to comment on Tuesday, although in a speech in Frankfurt late on Monday, Reto Francioni, the Börse’s chief executive, made it clear that his focus was mainly on organic growth.Michael Henry, capital markets analyst for Accenture, the consulting firm, said he would be very surprised if CME was the only bidder for the Nymex, despite the 30-day exclusivity agreement.If a CME/Nymex deal eventually happens, the only two remaining US independent pure commodities exchanges will be the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, both only trading wheat futures.Additional reporting by Hal Weitzman in Chicago, Ralph Atkins in Frankfurt and Javier Blas in London
589;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2008-01-29T09:31:17Z;CME and Nymex;;The “C” stands for “consolidator”. CME Group, which already runs the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, is in talks to buy Nymex Holdings.Nymex’s shares jumped by as much as 9 per cent on Monday, but the news ought not to have come as a surprise. Nymex has been touting its attractions for months. Back in August, its chairman publicly speculated on the cost savings any buyer might reap.For CME, acquiring the world’s biggest commodities exchange fills a large gap in its product portfolio. About half of Nymex’s contracts are already traded on CME’s Globex system, reducing integration risk and also raising one barrier against any interlopers.One potential rival, NYSE Euronext, has recently replaced its chief executive. The new incumbent is already occupied with taking over the American Stock Exchange. And after a sharp fall in Nymex’s stock in recent weeks, it now looks a little more affordable – by the inflated standards of exchanges, at least. On Friday, its 2008 price/earnings multiple was 29 times, down from more than 60 a year ago and, finally, less than the CME’s 33 times. Those heady multiples, in themselves, put pressure on the CME to keep buying market share – it bought CBOT only six months ago. Under the mooted terms, 70 per cent of the Nymex price would be funded with paper.On the regulatory front, adding to the CME’s growing empire may also be easier while the present White House administration still clings to power. A deal could also satisfy baser instincts. With Nymex under its roof, the CME would pit itself in direct competition with Intercontinental Exchange, whose intervention in the CBOT deal helped drive up the price CME had to pay. Indeed, if Nymex really is taken out of play, ICE may quickly find itself in the sights of other predators.Post and read comments on this Lex
590;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2008-01-29T01:14:33Z;CME in $11bn move for Nymex;;The CME Group on Monday confirmed that it is in preliminary talks to buy energy exchange Nymex for about $11bn in a deal that would solidify its position as the world’s most important futures market.Just six months after the CME acquired the Chicago Board of Trade for $12bn, the world’s largest futures exchange said it had agreed to a 30-day exclusive negotiating period with the New York Mercantile Exchange.The combined group would have a market value of about $60bn, making it the world’s largest exchange group by far. It would give the CME, which dominates the trading of agricultural and financial futures, a powerful position in fast-growing energy markets as well as in gold and silver through the Nymex’s Comex division.Market analysts have speculated for months that the deal would be a good fit because several Nymex benchmark contracts – for products including crude oil, natural gas and heating oil – already trade on the CME’s Globex electronic platform.Analysts cautioned that if the CME failed to strike a deal, a bidding war for Nymex would almost certainly result, with NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq among potential counterbidders.NYSE is currently integrating pan-European exchange Euronext and also agreed this month to buy the American Stock Exchange. Doug Atkin of consultancy Majestic Research said the NYSE had a lot on its plate, making it less likely to fight hard to buy the Nymex should the opportunity arise. NYSE and Nasdaq declined to comment.The US department of justice would likely examine a CME/Nymex deal on antitrust grounds. However, analysts said that it might face less resistance than the CME-CBOT deal because there is less overlap between products traded on the CME and Nymex. The CME and CBOT often traded the same commodities.Because of their existing relationship, a combination between the CME and Nymex is also likely to be easier from a technological perspective than if the exchanges had never worked together.For Nymex, the combination would help fend off competition from Atlanta’s Intercontinental Exchange, an electronic energy-trading market that has been growing its market share.Last month, Richard Schaeffer, Nymex chairman, said his company was not in merger talks with NYSE Euronext but that it was open to a merger, acquisition or being bought itself.Shares in CME fell 0.6 per cent on Monday to $625.78, while Nymex shares rose 8.7 per cent to $116.50. Under the terms being discussed, Nymex shareholders would receive $36 in cash and 0.1323 of a share of CME’s common stock in exchange for each Nymex share. That would value the deal at $10.9bn at Monday’s closing prices.The wave of consolidation sweeping the stock and derivatives trading business comes as smaller competitors struggle in an environment in which quality and speed of technology have become vital and expensive.At the same time, many investment banks worry that the smaller number of exchanges will give those that survive too much pricing power.Several efforts are under way by banks that are developing plans for their own exchanges on which they can trade with one another.
591;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;CME casts its eye in Nymex’s direction;;The world’s biggest futures exchange did not even pause for breath. About an hour after the CME announced on Monday morning that it was in preliminary talks to buy Nymex, the company put out another statement, saying it had completed its electronic integration with the Chicago Board of Trade, which it purchased last year. As one $11bn acquisition was being digested, a fresh $11bn purchase was put on the plate to be swallowed.The exchange sector has seen a spate of mergers in recent times as smaller competitors are swallowed up and the larger players, who can afford the best technology, prosper.The pace of consolidation continues to be furious and speculation is rife. Recent deals have been signed involving exchanges including NYSE and Euronext, Nasdaq and OMX and the CME itself.This month, the NYSE agreed to buy the American Stock Exchange in the latest example of consolidation.The CME had widely been expected to target the Nymex. The New York exchange revealed last August that it had held preliminary discussions with both the CME and the NYSE Euronext, although uncertainty over valuations had prevented any agreement at that time.By moving from informal talks to an exclusive negotiation period with the Nymex the CME has not only got the better of a potential competitor, for the time being, it has also moved closer to a deal that is widely thought to make good business sense for both exchanges.First, the two exchanges have established a collaborative relationship. Nymex uses the CME’s Globex system for its electronic trading in all futures and options, giving the two a pre-existing built-in integration that had led many observers to conclude that a takeover was likely.Second, the CME has always made clear it was on the hunt for purchases. As a mature exchange with a strong brand, NYMEX represents a good opportunity. “The CME’s best bet to continue to grow is to acquire entry into pools of liquidity that don’t take time and money to develop,” says John Lothian, editor of The John Lothian Newsletter, a derivatives markets daily briefing.Nymex gives the CME the opportunity to tap into energy trading, a fast-growing area of the derivatives market, and a share of over-the-counter derivatives trading, something it has long coveted.Getting into energy enables the CME to square up to the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which has built up a strong position in energy and OTC trading. The CME and ICE have a fractious relationship: as the CME was moving ahead with its friendly takeover of the CBOT, ICE upset the cosy cross-town arrangement by making a surprise bid. The CME eventually had to pay a lot more than it had hoped and a fair amount of bad blood was created.“This looks like a great deal for CME, in that the company would be acquiring one of the two major players in energy at a very reasonable price,” Christopher Allen of Bank of America said in a research note.The CME’s purchase of Nymex may in turn force ICE to seek the support of a tie-up with a “big brother” exchange if it is not itself to become a target as exchange consolidation proceeds.For Nymex, which has made it clear that it does not see any future for itself as an independent exchange by touting itself as an acquisition target, a possible purchase by the CME at a 11 per cent premium on the share price is like the arrival of the cavalry at the eleventh hour.“The Nymex rank-and-file were getting frustrated that nothing was happening,” says one person close to the exchange. “They were concerned the CME wouldn’t pay such a high valuation. But with this valuation, everyone is thrilled. This deal is stone-cold locked.”Perhaps the only thing that might unlock it is regulatory intervention. The Department of Justice scrutinised the CME’s takeover of the CBOT after many in the industry raised antitrust concerns, arguing that the purchase gave the CME a near-monopoly in US futures. However, the DoJ ultimately approved the deal, saying neither the deal nor an existing clearing joint venture was likely to “reduce competition substantially” or impact innovation or barriers to entry.
592;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2008-01-17T03:03:05Z;Civil engineers see risk to public works;;Lack of government co-ordination and a shortage of skills are likely to add £8bn ($15.7bn) a year to the costs of construction and civil engineering projects by 2015, according to the Institution of Civil Engineers.In a report published on Wednesday, the institution says the government should establish a new infrastructure planning commission – independent from Whitehall and with representatives from industry and the academic community – to smooth out the planning of big projects such as road and rail links and water treatment facilities. Failure to take action will see the UK run the risk of failing to develop as a modern society, the study suggests.“If the costs of delivering vital water, energy, waste and transport infrastructure rise, essential projects could be scrapped, leaving the public at a loss,” said Keith Miller, a civil engineering consultant and member of the ICE’s council.Poor performance by the government on co-ordinating big projects – often making cuts in spending to meet public borrowing targets, even when the new schemes are necessary on environmental or economic grounds – has a consequent negative influence on the whole of the civil engineering industry, according to Mr Miller.The impact of the “stop-start and fractured” approach by government “erodes the industry’s confidence to invest in developing capacity, innovation and civil engineering skills”, he said.The ICE’s estimate of £8bn a year in extra costs by 2015 comes from an assessment of the extra inflation in large construction projects likely to be triggered by poor planning and skills shortages.An example of poor planning, the institution says, is the decision to cut spending by the Environment Agency on flood defence schemes by about £80m in 2006/07 because of budgetary constraints. “The flood defence budget has been cut and then increased on three occasions in the last decade,” the report says.Similar lack of co-ordination means that other government or private sector schemes, including power stations, road improvements, energy pipelines and refuse disposal sites, are in danger of being completed behind schedule and with higher- than-expected costs.The ICE says the government would do well to emulate the approach in Northern Ireland of the Strategic Investment Board, an arms-length company that co-ordinates public sector infrastructure projects, linking up the work of companies and state-owned bodies.If a UK-wide body of this sort were established it would act as a “critical friend” to government by taking an independent stance on infrastructure planning and leaving this to good sense, rather than political considerations.According to the study, companies and the education sector should also do more to make civil engineering more attractive to young people, heading off the possibility of a “skills crisis”.The institution says people coming through academic institutions and company training schemes are likely to be fewer than needed.………………………………………..How N Ireland plans to catch upAfter years of under-investment in infrastructure, Northern Ireland is on a steep learning curve, and so is the agency entrusted to help it catch up with the rest of the UK, writes John Murray Brown.The Strategic Investment Board was set up in 2003 by the first devolved administration. It harnesses the help of leading Northern Irish business figures in the City of London, such as Tony Watson, a former head of the Hermes pension fund. David Gavaghan, the board’s chief executive, is a former director of project finance at Hambros bank in London.From this year the SIB will be overseeing a 10-year, £18.7bn public infrastructure programme covering new schools and hospitals, road, rail and water and sewerage investments. he board is also organising the sale of government properties and redevelopment of former security infrastructure, such as the Maze prison site.The SIB takes a 10-year view of the direction of infrastructure planning in the province, within the budgetary horizon of the Comprehensive Spending Review. And rather than starting from the separate demands of Northern Ireland’s 11 government departments, the board has identified six overarching areas: networks, skills, health, social, environment and productive.“We’ve tried to look at how that fits with the requirements of a modern economy,” says Mr Gavaghan. “What we’ve tried to do is set out our stall, what the ambitions are of the executive more broadly.”
593;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-11-16T10:11:13Z;Strategic view: Exchanges seek a new model;;"The exchange industry appears to be at an inflection point, where the next wave of consolidation is likely to shape its endgame. Over a longer time frame, the business model itself may be redefined.Strategic activity in the exchange sector has been infused with high drama. Almost every deal has been contested. Hedge funds, financial sponsors, sovereign wealth funds, politicians, and regulators all play active roles in shaping the outcome.This is perhaps not surprising because in the words of John Thain, until recently the CEO of NYSE Euronext and now the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, “every country has a flag, an army, and an exchange”.To date, efforts to accomplish non-consensual transactions have failed: for example Deutsche Börse and Euronext; InterContinental Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade; and Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange. But non-consensual activity is increasing, and such a transaction could happen.While the endgame is still hazy, it would not be surprising to see an emerging global market, dominated by a few mega-exchange groups. These exchanges are likely to be largely, if not fully, electronic, and to operate across multiple products and geographies.Indeed, the equity intermediation market may come to resemble the current foreign exchange market, with large-cap global names trading 24 hours across all three major time zones, while lesser names are traded in local markets connected as spokes to the regional hubs of the major exchange groups.There may also be one or two global cash clearing and settlement providers, providing multi-currency, straight-through processing technology to the global exchange groups. While these businesses tend to be natural monopolies, users have shown a strong preference for competition to foster market and technological innovation.Futures clearing, however, may evolve differently from clearing of cash equities.Clearing is an enormous competitive advantage in futures, and in contrast to cash exchanges, futures exchanges are currently re-assembling vertically-integrated models. Those without clearing houses are either acquiring them – for example, ICE buying New York Board of Trade – or merging with those that do.Cash equity exchanges are moving into derivatives products – for example NYSE and Euronext, Nasdaq and Sweden’s OMX, Deutsche Börse and Borsa Italiana – and are consolidating post-trade infrastructures: SWX Swiss Exchange and SIS for example.Existing OTC products, such as foreign exchange and credit derivatives, and new products, such as emissions trading and weather derivatives, represent attractive opportunities. A coming together of the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which is beginning to be discussed, would expedite the process.It may not end there. Looking farther out, it is possible to see exchanges evolve their business model beyond the intermediation of securities. When Michael Eisner took over as CEO of Disney, the company reframed its business from family theme parks to family entertainment, dramatically expanding its strategic scope.The core competency of exchanges, after all, may be less about securities intermediation than about transaction processing and technology solutions. They excel in processing huge volumes of transactions with accuracy and reliability, and in reporting those transactions in real time.There is no compelling reason why exchanges could not or should not reframe their business models and so extend their activities into the provision of broader financial information. This may bring them into competition with providers such as Bloomberg and Reuters, or with the big securities processors and fund accounting concerns.In terms of data provision, the debate in the US has been whether the data really belong to the exchanges or the users of the exchange.Whatever the merits of these arguments, it has been the resellers of such data rather than the exchanges who have captured the real value. But there is nothing to prevent the exchanges from capturing insight and pattern from the data and providing it as value-added service to their users.Looking ahead, exchanges face the challenge of how to develop their business model without damaging favourable valuations or upsetting clients.

594;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-11-12T08:46:32Z;Chris Burton: Preaching best practice;;Chris Burton is a strong believer that professional development does not stop when you qualify, and it is something that he preaches as well as practises.The 39-year-old civil engineer qualified in 1997, and says he does more continuous professional development than the guideline of five days a year that has been used in the past by his professional body, the UK’s Institution of Civil Engineers.The associate director for highways at Halcrow Group, the big UK engineering consultancy, keeps himself up to scratch with practices begun during his training to become a chartered civil engineer. This is a mixture of seminars, courses and self-learning.Mr Burton is also heavily involved in the same ICE training process that he went through – but on the other side of the table, participating in the review system for those hoping to qualify and mentoring younger engineers.One relatively new facet of CPD is a growing acceptance of the wide range of non-work activities that count towards an individual’s personal development. In the case of candidates Mr Burton mentors they may, for example, be captain of the local rugby or hockey team. “There is no reason why that shouldn’t count some way towards their CPD, as they have the management and leadership skills there,” he says.Along with other professional bodies, the ICE has been moving away from a time-serving approach. It says qualified members should do “enough to develop and maintain the professional knowledge, skills and competence that [they] need”.It recognises, however, that in a very broad institution of civil engineers working for a huge variety of organisations worldwide, the only person who can know what constitutes “enough” is the individual engineer.So it is down to the qualified individual to seek out the best training for their needs. Mr Burton says there is plenty to choose from – internally at Halcrow, at Thomas Telford Training, the ICE’s commercial arm, and from thousands of other organisations.The quality of the courses has improved in the past 10 years, he says. “The courses are far more interactive and people expect to have to prepare in advance,” he says. The institution also recognises that there may be peaks and troughs in an individual’s needs. Mr Burton’s troughs tend to last only a month or two, when there are no CPD events relevant to him. But there are plenty of peaks, too.
595;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-11-12T08:46:32Z;Online training: The future is already at a screen near you;;Some people just do not get on with traditional face-to-face continuing professional development courses. When it comes to keeping accountants in Australia updated on taxation issues, “younger guys are not always engaged in the learning process,” as Stephen O’Brien puts it.Mr O’Brien is head of CPD in Australia for Kaplan, the New York-based learning and development provider, which will next year launch an online tax update product targeted at newer Australian accountants. “They are comfortable in a web-based learning and assessment environment,” he says.It is an example of how learning companies are seeking new markets for online CPD products, which have made mixed progress worldwide, in line with corporate e-learning generally.“The use and scope of technology to replace or supplement the classroom approach has been growing steadily, but it’s not a runaway train by any means,” says Pat Galagan, executive editor at the American Society for Training & Development.Graham Guest, a UK-based CPD consultant, says: “People can dive in and get very excited about e-learning, but often they think about the ‘e’ bit, not the learning bit. You have to get the content right first and then look at how you can deliver it electronically.”Judy Randle, UK CPD product manager at Kaplan Financial, points out that the quality of e-learning content is variable. “A lot of it is, frankly, quite dull – it’s like a textbook on a computer screen,” she says.“E-learning is good when it’s more interactive and you can get people to do things. One of the problems with CPD e-learning currently is that you can’t ask questions. Until you can, and you can get answers, there is always going to be room for some classroom based learning. This type of interactive e-learning is already being introduced for the student market but it hasn’t yet filtered through to CPD.”The take-up of online CPD varies widely, even within the same profession and country, illustrating organisations’ differing development needs and priorities.A survey last month by UK-based training provider CCH Professional Development, reported in Accountancy magazine, found a big shift towards online CPD, as more accountants realise how much time they can save. Thirty per cent of accountants surveyed said they no longer undertake any of their compulsory CPD commitments through traditional face-to-face training.“E-learning, podcasting and virtual meetings have really taken off in other sectors, and the accountancy profession is now demanding the same kind of convenience,” says Douglas Broom, CCH’s head of professional development.In August CCH launched a new e-learning platform called e-CPD, in association with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). The new product replaces the popular CCH Seminars Online service and will provide a balance of desk-based training benefits with a high measure of innovation, says CCH.But not everyone in accountancy is convinced about the benefits of online CPD. “As a firm we are still very sceptical about e-learning, certainly as a substitute but even as a complement [to face-to-face learning],” says John Watkins, director of learning and development at PKF (UK) LLP, the mid-sized UK accountancy firm. “It is quite dangerous to assume that someone’s 30 minutes spent on the system is a true reflection of how much actual learning they have achieved.”In Australia, meanwhile, online learning has not had great success among accountants, says Mr O’Brien at Kaplan. But in the more decentralised banking and financial services sector, online learning management systems have proliferated, partly as a result of new legislation requiring mandatory training for advisers and others in the sector.Online CPD is about more than content delivery, however, and one promising area is the use of the internet by individuals to plan and log CPD activities and progress. “In the past people have kept hard-copy development records, but increasingly the trend is to plan and record online,” says Mr Guest.Software such as CPD-online, from Netherlands-based Xaurum, allows the professional to search for courses, record their CPD activities and produce digital certificates – it will even automatically calculate the CPD undertaken against the professional association’s requirements. The association can use the software to process and track all members’ CPD activities automatically, as a mechanism for course accreditation and to evaluate each member’s progress in real time.The UK’s Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) has been working hard to encourage members to plan their CPD. Two years ago it introduced a web-based system that has been reasonably successful, particularly among younger members, says Gareth Jones, senior manager for professional development.There is no obligation on members to use the system and at present the online planning records stay with the individual. But the system has been designed so that members submitting CPD records can avoid having to copy and post.The next big development could be centralised monitoring and assessment of online CPD progress and records. This has yet to achieve widespread popularity, which is due partly to institutions’ inbuilt conservatism, says Mr Guest, and to a lack of understanding of the advantages of systems that can automatically monitor thousands of people at once. The costs savings for institutions can be considerable, he says.Graham Gaddes, Kaplan’s managing director of UK regional operations, admits there is a certain Big Brother element to such remote monitoring, but says one advantage is that online course content can be automatically tailored for each individual, to reflect the results of their last online test. “There is a lot of potential for these systems two or three years down the line,” he says.Showing similar potential are the informal web-based networks that combine some of the social aspects of sites such as Facebook with the ability to swap information and advice with fellow professionals worldwide. An example is the ICE’s MyICE extranet, and there are several such networks in the IT sector where competitive concerns take second place to helping out a fellow professional with a technical problem.These computer-based networks, operating as self-identified support groups that function outside an employee’s organisation, have developed over the past few years, says Martyn Sloman, adviser for learning, training and development at the UK’s Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.Learning via such networks could make a growing contribution to an individual’s CPD, as younger professionals who have grown up with the internet move through their careers.Some professionals, of course, may find that they can get answers to their questions more quickly the traditional way, by talking to a colleague sitting next to them or in the next office or – especially in larger firms - going on to the company’s intranet and receiving and sharing information with a colleague on the other side of the world.An innovative solution to an engineering problem, for example, might best be kept in-house rather than published on an extranet that is available to all members of an institution, irrespective of which company they work for.While all these developments are in their early stages, there is widespread agreement that they will become more prevalent in years to come as today’s school and university students move into the workplace, bringing with them their generally greater awareness of, and comfort with, working online and using digital devices.The flexibility of online CPD – the individual can do it when he or she wants – is well established, says Mr Gaddes. “What is evolving is the way that you do it - it could just be a textbook in the form of a Word document, or a Flash presentation, or a talking head. This could be a lecturer working from home talking online to 200 delegates who can e-mail their questions during the lecture.”Kaplan is already using techniques like this in the professional exams market, as part of a blended programme involving classroom and remote elements. CPD is a post-qualification activity and thus by definition an older market, says Mr Gaddes, but when the 21/22-year-olds who are doing exam training online today enter the workforce, online CPD will really take off.Most observers believe that a mixed approach, or blended learning, will still hold sway, at least in the medium term. “There are estimates that e-learning [in the workplace generally] will level out at about 30 per cent [of an employee’s total training effort] over the next 10 years,” says Ms Galagan. “But beyond that it could change dramatically because of younger people entering the workforce, and they are much more comfortable with it.”
596;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-10-24T19:41:08Z;CFTC signals radical change to OTC markets;;US watchdogs on Wednesday signalled sweeping change to the way the vast over-the-counter commodity and energy derivatives markets are overseen when they unveiled proposals that would tighten regulation of trading on OTC electronic trading platforms.The move, by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, could fuel questions about the risk of driving OTC trading from the US to London.It affects so-called “exempt commercial markets”, such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and other venues, and is the culmination of months of pressure from some lawmakers to bring ECMs in line with the way traditional futures exchanges - such as the New York Mercantile Exchange - are regulated.It also came as the Government Accountability Office released a report on Wednesday raising questions about the CFTC’s oversight at a time when increasing amounts of energy derivatives trading occur on markets that are ”largely exempt from CFTC oversight”.ECMs were exempted from full CFTC surveillance under a 2000 law that presumed participants in OTC markets were largely able to self-police their activities. It came as OTC trading was taking off at Enron, the now-defunct energy group.But controversy over the way hedge fund Amaranth last year chalked up about $6bn in losses trading on Nymex and ICE prompted calls for a narrowing of the gap between CFTC-regulated exchanges and the ECMs.Senator Carl Levin has drafted legislation that would close the gap - which he calls the “Enron loophole”. He has said lack of sufficient oversight over ICE allowed Amaranth traders to build up huge positions in natural gas contracts at will, resulting in “excessive speculation” that hurt consumers.Walt Lukken, acting CFTC chairman, told a congressional hearing that the CFTC now recommended legislative changes for ECM contracts that would “serve a significant price discovery function”. The move marks a shift for the regulator, which had long said it had all the tools necessary to police the markets.The CFTC proposed that Congress give it the power to implement a system of “large trader reporting”, by which ECMs would be required to provide the CFTC with the same kind of reports of large trades that exchanges such as Nymex already are required to do.The system would “enable the [CFTC]’s market surveillance staff to monitor positions on a daily basis to detect and deter possible manipulative schemes”.An ECM would also be required to adopt “position limits” or “accountability levels” already in place at futures exchanges. They are designed to warn an exchange of over-concentration by a trader in one contract.An ECM should also be required to “monitor trading of a listed contract that serves a significant price discovery function”.Mr Lukken said the recommendations were designed to “strike a delicate balance between the appropriate level of market oversight and transparency while promoting market innovation and competition to ensure that these markets remain on US soil.”Paul Architzel, counsel specialising in futures regulation at law firm Alston & Bird, said that while there was always a risk that tighter regulation might drive business offshore, there was less likelihood of this happening since OTC energy and commodity derivatives were involved.“With an electronic [market] infrastructure it’s much easier to move business offshore but straight financial futures are more portable than commodity products. That’s because they can involve delivery of the underlying commodity, which makes it more of a localized trading vehicle,” he said.In its report, the GAO recommended that Congress ”further explore whether the current regulatory structure for energy derivatives, in particular for those traded in exempt commercial markets, adequately provides for fair trading and accurate pricing of energy commodities”.It suggested that this be done as part of the process of re-authorisation of the CFTC, which was the subject of Wednesday’s hearing. Re-authorisation is a process by which Congress re-examines a federal government agency’s statutes and budget, and can result in changes to an agency’s powers. Re-authorisation of the CFTC is about two years overdue.ICE welcomed the CFTC’s proposals. Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive, said it provided “regulatory certainty for the oversight of OTC markets”.”The spirit of their recommendations is largely consistent with the views we have expressed in several testimonies this year. Such a solution recognizes and addresses the complexities of OTC markets and preserves the significant economic and utility benefits of a properly functioning market.He pointed out that ICE a year adopted “daily position reporting” for its main OTC markets.“The concept of position accountability and ’self-regulatory-like’ authority would provide ICE with the ability to take action in its markets if necessary. We will continue to engage in a dialogue with regulators, the industry and Congress, and look forward to effectively resolving this long-standing matter,” Mr Sprecher said.Commenting on the proposals, Sen Levin said: “The CFTC report is a very positive development. The CFTC acknowledges the vulnerability of US energy markets to price manipulation and excessive speculation, calls for tougher market oversight, and recommends legislative changes to put a cop on the beat in all US energy markets. All four of the CFTC’s key recommendations - large trader reporting, position limits or accountability levels, self-regulatory oversight, and emergency authority to require traders to reduce positions - are already in the Close the Enron Loophole Act I’ve introduced. The CFTC’s support will advance the prospects for getting a bill passed this Congress to close the Enron loophole and stop trading abuses that distort U.S. energy prices.”
597;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-09-30T21:55:29Z;Citigroup and Merrill Lynch invest in MCX;;Merrill Lynch and Citigroup have each bought a 5 per cent stake in India’s largest commodities exchange, valuing the bourse, one of the world’s fastest-growing, at up to $1.1bn.Financial Technologies India, the company that controls Multi Commodity Exchange of India, is also selling a 3 per cent stake in MCX to Passport India Investment (Mauritius) and 2 per cent to the GLG Financials Fund.“These investments from strategic international partners will provide Indian commodity markets and MCX access to global know-how,” Financial Technologies said in a statement to the stock exchange.The investments come as Indian companies continue to attract investment in spite of the global credit crunch.ICICI Bank, India’s largest private sector bank, last week sold a $2bn five-year bond on international markets, 43 per cent of which was subscribed by investors in the US, it said.Reliance Power, a utility company controlled by businessman Anil Ambani, said Sunday it was planning to file for an initial public offering. Domestic media have estimated that the IPO could be worth more than $2bn.MCX’s turnover is between Rs100bn and Rs120bn ($2.5bn-$3bn) a day, up to six times that of its rival the National Commodities and Derivative Exchange.In just a few years the two exchanges have risen to dominate commodities futures trading in India.The investments follow stake sales by stock and commodity bourses in India. Fidelity International al­ready holds a stake in MCX. Goldman Sachs and Intercontinental Exchange of the US have shares in NCDEX.In February, Deutsche Börse bought 5 per cent of Bombay Stock Exchange and Singapore Exchange took a similar stake in March. The National Stock Ex­change, India’s largest, has sold stakes to Goldman Sachs, NYSE Euronext and others.Commodities trading has boomed in India since it was liberalised five years ago.
598;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-09-04T21:08:58Z;Mideast oil contracts in troubled waters;;Two rival attempts to create a benchmark futures contracts to trade Middle East crude oil are struggling after attracting only poor investor interest.Trading volumes in the two contracts, launched three months ago, evaporated in August and traders said they were now unlikely to recover significantly after the holiday period.The failure to draw interest, in particular from Asian refineries, is the latest setback to create a Middle East benchmark that could compete with Brent and West Texas Intermediate.The rival Middle East contracts were launched in June by the US-based InterContinental Exchange and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, a joint venture between the New York Mercantile Exchange and Dubai and Oman governments.“The contracts have failed to attract enough critical mass,” said a trader involved in both contracts. “There is not enough interest both from the sellers in the Gulf region and from the buyers among the Asian refineries side.”The ICE Middle East contract even failed to trade on three separate days last month and the DME’s Oman contract traded just 25 lots one day in August. Volumes in both Brent and WTI are usually well above 50,000 lots.However, Gary King, DME chief executive, said that trading volume would now recover. “Over time, this contract will be adopted by the industry,” he said.DME Oman crude oil volumes fell to an average of less than 160 trades a day in August, down from about 600 in July and almost 1,900 in June. ICE Middle East crude volumes shrank to fewer than 50 trades a day in August, down from about 2,000 in June.Mr King said Asian refineries would embrace the contracts in the long term. “It always has been the case that Asia [refineries] are price followers rather than settlers. This would take some time,” he said.DME Oman volumes on Tuesday jumped thanks to a programme with financial incentives for market makers to increase trading volumes, traders said.Volume surged to 3,000 lots but traders said it was unclear if the recovery would be sustained after the incentives ended. ICE Middle East Tuesday traded just 20 lots.
599;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-08-30T14:33:47Z;CME Group raises ante over rival’s ownership;;The CME Group on Thursday intensified the battle over the future ownership of the rival Chicago Board Options Exchange by lifting a cap on its legal expenses and buying disputed purchase rights.The CBOE is one of the few remaining mutually-owned exchanges, but its plans for an initial public offering that could value the group at more than $3bn have been effectively blocked by the simmering dispute with the CME.The CME argues that some members of the Chicago Board of Trade, which it purchased in July, are entitled to a payout from any sale or IPO of the options exchange through their control of so-called exercise rights in the CBOE.The CBOE argues that the exercise rights were voided by the merger of the two Chicago futures exchanges. The matter is currently before a court in Delaware.The CME said had lifted the $15m cap on its legal defences in the dispute, and announced it had spent almost $40m buying 159 of the 1,331 exercise rights from CBOT members in a tender offer which formed part of the merger agreement.The prospect of an IPO and a surge in trading volumes lifted the price of a CBOE seat to $2.7m earlier this month, though the CME is paying just $250,000 for each of the trading rights. The remaining holders of the exercise rights would be entitled to any sale proceeds if the CME’s legal action succeeds.The sales suggest the sellers expect either a protracted legal battle or a negative court ruling. Both sides have expressed confidence that the court will rule in their favour.The CME, which this week announced it would close some of its open-outcry pits in favour of electronic trading, also revealed the results of a tender offer used to sweeten its bid for the CBOT in the face of a competing offer from the Intercontinental Exchange.A recent rally in its share price – helped by the expectation of savings from the trading floor changes – helped trim demand for the buyback. It spent $922m repurchasing shares at $560 each – just below Wednesday’s close – having committed up to $3.5bn for the buyback.After peaking at $609.96 earlier this month, CME shares had fallen below the level of the tender offer as part of a broad sell-off in exchange stocks, despite the record volumes generated by the recent market turmoil.Analysts now expect synergies from the CME-CBOT deal to surpass expectations following the consolidation of their two trading floors next year in the Chicago Board of Trade building.The shift from open outcry to electronic trading in most contracts will see some pits closed altogether, including the frozen pork belly arena which was once one of its most hectic venues. Some currency-trading pits will be consolidated, though the venues for some equity options – complex products which are more difficult to trade on the screen – will be expanded.
600;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Nymex held talks with CME and NYSE;;A two-way tussle for control of the New York Mercantile Exchange is likely to be deferred until later this year after the energy and metals-trading specialist unexpectedly revealed it had held takeover talks, market experts said on Wednesday.The NYSE and the CME have both held preliminary discussions with the exchange in recent months, according to people close to the situation, but uncertainty over valuations had prevented any agreement.However, Nymex chairman Richard Schaeffer disclosed more details during an investor briefing hosted by Deutsche Bank on Tuesday, forcing the exchange to issue a statement after the market close.“They’ve been out there flogging themselves for the past few months,” said one banker familiar with the situation. “Obviously nothing is happening.”The Nymex is valued at around $11bn following last year’s flotation, and had retained JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch to explore a sale or other options during a period of intense consolidation within the futures exchange sector.The NYSE and the CME, fresh from their takeovers of Euronext and the Chicago Board of Trade, respectively, are viewed as frontrunners if a sale process emerges.John Thain, the NYSE’s chief executive, has stated his intention to expand in US futures, fuelling speculation of interest in the Nymex or the Intercontinental Exchange.However, any bid for Nymex would have to overcome potential opposition from the CME, which has based its energy strategy around a 10-year alliance with the energy exchange, which runs through 2016.Nymex, which competes with the ICE for leadership in the global energy trading market, now lists its oil, gas and metals contracts on the CME’s electronic trading platform.The move has sparked a surge in volumes and seen more than three-quarters of its trading migrate to the screen. The switch has opened the potential for huge cost savings from reduction in the size of its trading floor and the sale of its New York headquarters.Nymex had already signalled actions in the second half to take costs from the floor business, and said in its statement that a “business combination” could generate annual cost savings of $250m, with the sale of its headquarters fetching $500m.Shares in Nymex climbed almost 8 per cent to $126.35 by midday in New York.Mr Schaeffer said any deal would be at a “meaningful premium” to its share price, which analysts said already included a takeover premium.Exchange valuations have slumped in recent weeks, despite the market turmoil which has fuelled record volumes, and bankers said it was difficult to fix a price on the Nymex in the current climate, despite its attractive business and potential cost savings.The CME said it was focused on executing its alliance with the Nymex, and declined to comment on any talks, a position shared by the NYSE. Deutsche Börse, which had also been linked with potential interest in the Nymex, also declined to comment, though its shareholders have told management not to pursue further deals after its agreed purchase of the International Securities Exchange, the second-largest US options platform.
601;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-08-21T19:04:46Z;Exchanges/volatility;;Debating what the future holds for futures can result in some pretty confusing conversations. It can also mean some wild price swings. Since August 8, shares in futures exchanges including Nymex, Intercontinental Exchange, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have suffered double-digit percentage drops, compared with a 3 per cent fall in the S&P 500.That might seem odd. In the same period, the Vix index – a measure of volatility in US equities – has increased by 18 per cent, while commodities have also been choppy. Volatility ought to be good for derivatives exchanges, which traders use to try to hedge their exposure. And indeed, in July and August, exchanges hosted record volumes.But while the fallout from the problems in credit markets has pumped up demand for derivatives for now, there are unpleasant side effects. Sentinel Management Group’s meltdown was a wake-up call from one of the less prominent corners of the market. Sentinel was a provider of supposedly safe cash management services to futures brokers. The fear was that its problems could spread across the market and eventually leave the exchanges’ in-house clearing businesses dealing with hung trades.For now, that risk looks minimal – Deutsche Bank estimates that funds parked with Sentinel amount to 1 per cent of total futures market capital. The other, perhaps more serious, threat comes from the “de-risking” process underlying current volatility. If a swathe of investment funds unwinds and investors lose their taste for leverage-fuelled speculation, demand for contracts to hedge positions will fall accordingly.It is too early to tell how big a threat that is. But the exchange sector was trading on forward price/earnings multiples of 40 and upwards before the latest turbulence. Far from being odd, taking some money off the table – the stocks still trade at multiples in the high 30s – looks sensible.
602;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-08-21T01:17:27Z;ICE ups Winnipeg exchange offer;;"The Intercontinental Exchange has raised its bid for the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange in the face of a competing offer from a partner of the CME Group.The electronic futures exchange on Monday raised its offer for the Canadian group from C$40m ($37.7m) to C$50m in a move that would see key commodities contracts switched from the CME to the ICE this year.The Winnipeg exchange hosts the benchmark contract for canola, a rapeseed variant, and would add to the expansion of the ICE in Canadian energy products. It would also give the Atlanta-based exchange access to the carbon-trading market via the Winnipeg-controlled Canadian Climate Exchange.The ICE raised its offer to C$77.59 a share to secure board backing from the privately-held Winnipeg exchange, whose shareholders will vote on August 22.The unsolicited competing bid – which traders said came from the Nymex – is the latest sparring between the ICE and the CME, parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which won the hotly contested takeover battle for the Chicago Board of Trade this year.The Nymex has a long-term deal to list its products on the CME’s electronic platform, although it is expected to take part in the consolidation that has transformed the derivatives industry.The ICE is viewed as a potential takeover target following its failure to acquire the CBOT; the NYSE Group’s ambitions to expand in US futures make it a possible acquirer.The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the third-largest US option trading venue, last week said it was examining a sale or flotation. It has held talks with the Nasdaq, which wants to establish a US options business.The ICE has expanded from its roots as an energy exchange and clearer of over-the-counter trades with a series of acquisitions and joint ventures over the past year, including with the New York Board of Trade, which gave it access to soft commodities for the first time.Shares in the ICE on Monday continued their recovery from a five-session slide that had wiped almost a fifth from its market value, in spite of the surge in volumes from market volatility."
603;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-07-24T21:01:16Z;CME on lookout for more deals;;"Craig Donohue, chief executive of the newly formed CME Group, is looking to pursue further mergers and joint ventures immediately as he seeks to shore up the group’s position as the world’s largest derivatives exchange.Mr Donohue told the Financial Times on Tuesday that he remained committed to expanding in Europe, Asia and South America. His comments come just weeks after the creation of the CME Group, formed earlier this month by the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.He said it was important for the group to continueplaying a part in the consolidation that has swept the global equity and derivatives exchange business in recent times. He said the group would also continue to expand and compete with investment banks in the massive over-the-counter derivatives market, which dwarfs the exchange-traded business. In this area, he said CME would focus on opportunities in foreign exchange derivatives and interest rate swaps market.The CME declared victory in its pursuit of the CBOT this month after members and shareholders voted to combine and create the world’s largest derivatives platform. The deal was eventually reached after CME raised its offer three times to fend off a competing bid from Intercontinental Exchange.The company said it was ahead of schedule on integrating the two exchanges as it reported second-quarter results for both on Tuesday. Mr Donohue said the transition of CME and CBOT products on to a single electronic platform should be completed in January next year and the two trading floors would follow in March.The CME’s $11.8bn deal for the CBOT comes against the backdrop of frantic M&A activity among the exchanges, with recent deals including the New York Stock Exchange’s merger with Euronext, Nasdaq’s deal with the OMX, Deutsche Börse’s agreed bid for the International Securities Exchange, and the purchase by the Intercontinental Exchange of the New York Board of Trade.The exchanges are jockeying for position in the lucrative derivatives market which most see as the key battleground for expansion as investors increasingly look to such products to hedge risk in volatile markets.The CME reported strong earnings growth for both exchanges in their last full quarter as separate entities.The CME Group posted a 15 per cent rise in second-quarter profit in its last quarter before completing its acquisition of the CBOT, narrowly missing analyst expectations. For the same period, the CBOT posted a 34 per cent jump in net income as a result of higher trading volume and derivative
contract fees."
604;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;CME and CBOT profits rise;;CME Group, the recently formed parent company of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, on Tuesday reported strong earnings growth for both exchanges in their final full quarter as separate companies.The CME Group posted a 15 per cent rise in second-quarter profit in its last quarter before completing its acquisition of the CBOT, narrowly missing analyst expectations. For the same period, the CBOT posted a 34 per cent jump in net income as a result of higher trading volume and derivative contract fees.CME on Tuesday reported net income of $126m, or $3.57 a share, compared with $110m, or $3.12 a share, for the same period a year ago. Excluding merger costs, earnings would have been $3.69 a share. Revenue increased 17 per cent to $329m.CME reported average daily volume of 6.4m contracts in the second quarter, a 4.5 per cent rise, and said it handled 4m CBOT contracts a day, while New York Mercantile Exchange volume on CME’s Globex electronic platform averaged a record 710,000 contracts a day.CBOT posted net income of $58m compared with $43m for the second quarter last year. Excluding merger costs, earnings would have risen 65 per cent to $72m , or $1.35 a share. Revenue climbed 33 per cent to $2004.The CME declared victory in its pursuit of the CBOT earlier this month after members and shareholders voted to combine and create the world’s largest derivatives platform.The deal was eventually reached after CME raised its offer three times to fend off a competing bid from Atlanta’s IntercontinentalExchange. It comes amid the rapid consolidation of the equity and derivatives landscape in recent times.
605;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-07-18T18:53:02Z;Observer: Merkel’s summertime glow;;German chancellor Angela Merkel is going into her summer holiday next week in a very good mood. Fielding questions from hundreds of journalists in Berlin yesterday in her pre-vacation press conference, the “Queen of Europe”, as she was labelled this year, was all smiles as she rattled off her economic and foreign policy successes.Dressed in a fetching pink jacket, she even focused for a moment on the feminine touch she occasionally brings to politics – a topic she rarely addresses. Asked why it had been so long since a minister resigned from her cabinet, she replied in a flash that her softly-softly style was the key.“Look at my caring way of doing things,” she exclaimed.Next week she is off – as every year – to the Wagner opera festival in Bayreuth, southern Germany, followed by a few days’ relaxation away from the Berlin crowds.If her good fortune continues into the autumn, Observer wonders how the Social Democrats, her coalition partner – let alone the opposition parties – are going to make any political headway.Rotating logicAl Hubbard, one of US president George W. Bush’s top economic tsars, has been spending a little more time in Europe than usual.But that doesn’t mean the Harvard-educated Bushie understands how it works any better as a result.“I wonder if I’ll ever figure out how the EU works,” he told an audience at the US Chamber of Commerce, recounting a recent trip to visit Merkel.Hubbard was picked by Bush in April to chair jointly a new effort to iron out regulatory kinks between the US and EU, a pet project of Merkel’s while her country chaired the rotating EU presidency.But it’s the rotation part that seems to have stumped Hubbard. “It’s bizarre,” he said. “Merkel was president of the EU, then Barosso – he’s president of something as well. I don’t understand how the EU government works. It’s been explained to me five times and I still can’t get it into my head.”Help is at hand, however, in the form of his co-chair: Günter Verheugen, the EU’s (non-rotating) vice-president.Fashion statementThere has been speculation that Conrad Black may have to suffer the indignity of being required to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet after he goes before a judge today at a bail hearing in Chicago.The device would be used to track his movement, which could possibly be limited to the city limits of Chicago if the judge decides to prevent him from returning to Toronto. If this happens, then Black at least can draw comfort from the fact that these devices have become somewhat fashionable in the US. Martha Stewart, the US home-making mogul, wore one a few years ago when she faced legal problems. More recently, some young celebrities have been sporting monitoring devices of one sort or another.Lindsay Lohan, the bad-girl actress, began sporting a chunky bracelet that monitors her alcohol intake following a stint in rehab. As The Washington Post pointed out this week, other actors and actresses have been appearing on stage wearing monitoring bracelets. The US television actress Michelle Rodriguez wore one at New York’s Fashion Week in February.Black may remain on the A-list after all.Chicago meets NYTwo veterans of the bustling, shouting Chicago trading pits are to be feted tonight by members of a rival tribe – Wall Streeters.Charlie Carey, the chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, is the keynote speaker tonight at the Wall Street 50, which honours Irishmen (and Irish women) working in finance. Also honoured will be Terence Duffy, the chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange – which this year won a fierce battle to buy Carey’s CBOT.Carey and Duffy have been friends for decades. They met in the 1980s, when they both dealt hog futures at the Chicago Merc. That friendship helped them pull off the merger, which was the largest ever involving a financial exchange. The Merc’s winning bid finally saw off rival offers for the CBOT by the IntercontinentalExchange, an electronic market from Atlanta.The next challenge for the Chicago traders may come from the New York Stock Exchange, which may want to expand into their market. Perhaps they will make some valuable connections tonight.Not-so-merry SenUS politicians are worked up about the vast incomes and low taxes enjoyed by hedge fund managers. Now they have been handed some fresh fodder for outrage.Charles Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate finance committee, has a few sharp words for the Robin Hood Foundation, the hedge fund managers’ favourite charity which was set up by industry veteran Paul Tudor Jones.The charity’s legendary fundraisers have featured performances by The Who, The Rolling Stones and Beyoncé. Now, it turns out that much of Robin Hood’s $140m rainy-day fund is invested in hedge funds run by either Robin Hood board members, or by its donors. Grassley does not approve. “I don’t remember Robin Hood keeping ‘two and 20’ as his cut,” he said, referring to the hedge fee formula.The 31-member board includes business people such as Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein, Lehman’s Richard Fuld and GE’s Jeff Immelt – as well as Gwyneth Paltrow.Send your comments to observer@ft.com
606;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-07-10T23:09:53Z;NYSE races to build derivatives trade;;John Thain, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, has made no secret of his ambition to bolster the transatlantic exchange’s presence significantly in the US derivatives market.At a recent analyst meeting, he admitted that competing head-to-head in the trading of existing derivatives contracts in the US would be difficult.But the task has been made still more tricky now that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade have finally agreed to merge, creating a derivatives trading powerhouse in Chicago.“I think if we’re going to develop a bigger presence in the US in the areas that are currently in existence, I think it has to be by acquisition,” Mr Thain said.With the formation of the CME Group, Mr Thain is likely to want to act sooner rather than later to bolster his US derivatives business before the gap with Chicago becomes too big to bridge.Two acquisitions stand out as most likely for NYSE Euronext.The first is a quick move to buy the Intercontinental Exchange, which is now seen by analysts as a target after missing out on the CBOT to the CME.Almost right up until the shareholder vote this week, many expected the ICE to raise its offer for the CBOT still further in a last-ditch attempt to buy it.When it became clear late last week that it would not raise its bid, the ICE itself became a target.A second potential move for NYSE Euronext is a deal to buy the New York Mercantile Exchange. For months, the market has buzzed with talk of a potential bid for the Nymex, with NYSE Euronext being mentioned as one possible bidder for the energy exchange along with the CME and the Deutsche Börse.The Nymex is seen by many as being too limited in its product and geographic reach to remain an island as consolidation of the ex-change business continues. Some analysts said the ICE might itself be interested in merging with the Nymex.Adam Sussman, of the Tabb Group, the financial markets’ research and advisory firm, said: “I think this puts the ICE on the defensive and it is likely to seek either a merger of equals or be acquired by a larger exchange. A deal with the Nymex would be a good deal for both in terms of diversification.”The Nymex and its energy products, in particular, could also be an attractive acquisition target for either CME or Deutsche Börse.Securing Euronext from under the nose of main rival Deutsche Börse this year represented the NYSE’s first concerted push into exchange-traded derivatives, through the acquisition of Euronext Liffe, the London derivatives exchange.Derivatives account for 22 per cent of the revenue of the combined NYSE Euronext. Mr Thain will be keen to see that number rise steeply and quickly in the coming months and years.
607;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-07-10T19:47:20Z;Speculation raises heat for energy derivatives;;What is excessive speculation? To some in the markets, the answer may well be: “there is no such thing”.Others may follow the line taken by the American judge struggling to define hard core pornography in the 1960s, when he famously declared: “I know it when I see it.”Either way, the question has become the centrepiece of a debate in the US over the role of hedge funds in energy derivatives markets – and what the right regulatory response should be.Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has long campaigned on the issue, this week held the second of two hearings into the collapse last year of Amaranth, after the hedge fund lost billions of dollars in natural gas swap trades on the Intercontinental Exchange.Mr Levin chairs the senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which last month produced a report into “excessive speculation in natural gas prices”.The report concluded that Amaranth built up positions in Nymex natural gas futures that were unprecedented in size for a single trader. When Amaranth repeatedly bumped up against pre-set “accountability levels” at Nymex, it shifted its positions to ICE.There, its trades – and that of rival fund Centaurus, which was a counterparty in many of Amaranth’s natural gas plays – are alleged to have been so large that they led to abnormal spikes in the price of ICE swaps and this, in turn, affected the settlement of Nymex natural gas futures.The shift to ICE was, the report says, designed to take advantage of a regulatory loophole that allows electronic platforms such as ICE to operate without requiring participants to adhere to such trading limits.That is because ICE was exempted from full jurisdiction by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – including the monitoring of large trader positions – under a law passed by congress in what Mr Levin and others call “the Enron loophole”.By contrast, Nymex is fully regulated by the futures watchdog and is required to enforce such limits under the CFTC’s statute.This loophole is what many utilities believe is the mechanism that allows hedge funds and other speculators to engage in “excessive speculation” that, in the case of Amaranth, had a direct effect on the prices that they paid for natural gas.Some industry experts say the size of trades carried out by hedge funds have altered the dynamics of such markets and that some sort of excessive speculation is possible.Sean Cota, north-east chairman of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, said there had been “significant changes” in the behaviour of the energy derivatives markets since his Vermont heating fuel company, Cota & Cota, started using Nymex futures to hedge. “Speculators are important in our market. Without them we would not be able to hedge future demand for our consumers. But with huge hedge funds and other speculators entering the market, sometimes it seems to have the effect of an elephant jumping into the bathtub,” he said.Vince Kaminski is a former head of research at Enron’s trading division who now teaches at Rice University in Texas. He says the energy and commodity markets, given their “complexity and rapid transformation”, are often vulnerable to “patterns of market manipulation”.He cites as one example “very aggressive, rapid fire and large volume trading” close to specific contract expiration time in certain markets that are used as benchmarks for settlement of derivative contracts, especially where there is limited regulatory scrutiny – such as in OTC markets.He says a market based exclusively on speculation is “not viable in the long run”, and suggests that the outcome will be that excessive speculation crowds out the natural hedgers from the market.“I worry more about the effect of excessive speculation on the future of markets, rather than the effect on consumers,” he says.Yet some hedge fund traders privately counter that they perform an essential function in energy and commodity markets, taking the kind of risks that natural hedgers will not or cannot afford to take.The CFTC’s statute defines excessive speculation as activity that causes “sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the price of [commodities]”.Exchanges, perhaps loath to discourage business, are shy about defining it.If the debate has produced no clear answer on this, it has started to create some consensus on what the regulatory response should be to the OTC energy markets in which hedge funds are such large participants.James Newsome, Nymex president, said such markets should be subject to the same large trader reporting requirements as fully CFTC-regulated exchanges because both were “functionally equivalent”.Moreover, this meant there was now an “exchange-like aggregation of risk” that had potentially systemic implications, Mr Newsome said.“Given the complexity of derivatives markets it can be difficult to state with real precision when speculation may be deemed to be ‘excessive’. Moreover speculators do provide liquidity and other positive effects to derivatives markets.”In a development that has encouraged Mr Levin, the CFTC this week shifted its long-held position on whether it should be given added tools to oversee the OTC markets.Walter Lukken, acting chairman, said: “We have to adapt as these markets evolve.”
608;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-07-09T23:01:50Z;OTC energy derivatives face tighter regulation;;Years of US congressional efforts to bring the vast over-the-counter energy derivatives markets under tighter regulation started to pay off yesterday when the country’s futures watchdog warned it was “nearing the outer limits” of its authority to oversee energy futures markets.Walter Lukken, acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told a senate hearing into alleged “excessive speculation” in energy derivatives last year by hedge fund Amaranth that it was “appropriate to have this open dialogue…about what other tools are needed to adequately oversee” the markets.At the same hearing, Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of the Intercontinental Exchange, surprised senators by agreeing to some form of extra CFTC oversight that would result in it being able to warn traders that they were taking excessive risks. This would bring it closer in line with practice at the New York Mercantile Exchange, which – unlike ICE – is subject to full CFTC jurisdiction.Taken together, the developments mark a victory for Senator Carl Levin, who has campaigned to close what he calls the “Enron loophole”. This refers to an exemption inserted into a 2000 law that ensured that certain energy platforms, including ICE, were not subject to the full market surveillance powers of the CFTC.The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations last month issued a report into the collapse of Amaranth arguing that the hedge fund moved huge positions from Nymex to ICE to avoid trading position limits in place at Nymex to help avoid “excessive speculation” under CFTC rules.It claimed that such speculation led to gas utilities, and ultimately consumers, paying more for gas last winter than factors of supply and demand would normally have indicated.Mr Lukken said the regulated futures markets and exempt commercial markets, such as ICE, had become “increasingly linked, and as a result the public risks associated with these markets have changed”.“We have to adapt as these markets evolve,” he said.Mr Sprecher said he favoured submitting ICE to a system similar to one that Nymex must operate under CFTC rules, involving enforcing pre-set “accountability levels” designed to stop the build-up of positions. But he added that it should not be limited to ICE.Scott Parsons, president of consultancy Parsons Strategies and adviser to Nymex, said: “I think there was a shift in thinking from ICE. But I think there will be a lot more discussion before legislation is written.”
609;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-07-09T20:21:52Z;CME declares victory in battle for CBOT;;The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Monday declared victory after a nine-month pursuit of the Chicago Board of Trade as members and shareholders voted to combine and create the world’s largest derivatives platform.The vote followed a four-month bid battle for CBOT with the smaller Intercontinental Exchange, which elected not to sweeten its bid for a third time after a contest which pushed the indicative value of the Board of Trade close to $12bn.The Merc finally ended its quest for an acquisition after boosting its own offer for a third time on July 6, quelling opposition from a core of CBOT members who had pushed for better terms while supporting the principle of an all-Chicago combination.The enlarged group will narrowly top the derivatives business of Deutsche Bôrse in volume terms following the German group’s planned purchase of the US-based International Securities Exchange.However, the renamed CME Group also faces a number of challenges as it seeks to integrate the two Chicago exchanges and handle some of the fallout from the bid battle.The Merc still needs to find a long-term solution to the long-running spat over CBOT’s potential ownership in the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which is currently the subject of litigation in the US courts.Relations with Wall Street banks have also been strained by the opposition of some institutions to a Chicago deal which they claimed could stifle competition. The Merc argued that banks were attempting to defend their own pricing power in the over-the-counter derivatives market, a key expansion target for the large global exchanges.The CME was forced to boost the merger terms first outlined last October by almost 25 per cent in order to win control of the 159-year old Board of Trade and its valuable franchise in financial and commodity-based futures and options.The ICE proposal, which was rejected three times by the CBOT board, had led the indicative value of the Merc proposal for most of the past four months before last week’s final moves eliminated almost all of the difference between the all-stock offers.The Chicago exchanges were forced to postpone a planned April 4 vote on the merger, and CBOT members remained deeply split over its merits until the latest raise provided the Merc with the momentum to win backing in Monday’s polls.The renamed CME Group will have a market value of almost $32bn, based on yesterday’s closing prices, and the deal already has antitrust approval following a justice department ruling expected to trigger further consolidation in the US derivatives sector.NYSE Euronext has said its plans to bolster its Liffe platform with a US acquisition, triggering speculation it could seek a combination with either the ICE or the New York Mercantile Exchange, breaking up the latter’s strategic alliance with the CME.CBOT shareholders took less than five minutes to vote in favour of the CME deal. Charles Carey chairman said preliminary results showed an earlier poll of CBOT members had also voted overwhelmingly in favour.
610;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-07-08T21:01:39Z;Nymex seeks full OTC regulation;;The New York Mercantile Exchange on Monday will call for its main rival in energy derivatives trading, the Intercontinental Exchange, to be brought under the full jurisdiction of federal regulators amid growing concern over light regulation in the rapidly growing over-the-counter markets.The move provides support from the world’s largest energy exchange for critics of the way OTC markets have been overseen since 2000 when Congress passed a law that exempted them from routine oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog.OTC markets are where prices are negotiated privately between counterparties, not matched on an exchange.Experts say OTC deals account for 75 per cent of US energy trading.Carl Levin, chairman of the senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, last month said current laws were “riddled with exemptions” that made it “virtually impossible for regulators to police US energy markets”.At a hearing into collapsed hedge fund Amaranth, he sought to draw a link between “excessive speculation” by the fund in natural gas derivatives and high consumer gas prices, arguing that a shift in such trading to OTC platforms such as ICE undermined the CFTC’s ability to prevent such speculation and stop manipulation.The committee holds a second hearing today. In testimony, James Newsome, Nymex president, will say that markets such as ICE “should be subject to the full regulation of the CFTC”.He will argue that the exemption granted to markets such as ICE – known as “the Enron loophole” – is no longer appropriate because traders now make virtually no distinction between natural gas futures on Nymex and swaps on ICE.“The two competing trading venues are now tightly linked and highly interactive and, in essence, are simply two components of a broader derivatives market.“No-one could have predicted in 2000, when the exemption was crafted for energy swaps, how this market would have evolved.“The current statutory structure no longer works,” Mr Newsome’s testimony, obtained by the Financial Times, says.Walter Lukken, acting CFTC chairman, is expected to point out that the agency has taken recent steps to obtain trader reports and data from ICE under its current authority. ICE will also testify.
611;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-07-06T19:25:55Z;CME raises offer for CBOT;;The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Friday raised its bid for the Chicago Board of Trade for a third time and secured the backing of its target’s largest shareholder in an effort to fend off the hostile counteroffer from the Intercontinental Exchange.However, investors signalled that the four-month battle for the second-largest US futures exchange was not over as they pushed the CBOT share price to record levels above the CME’s “best and final offer”, which also continued to trail the indicative value of the ICE proposal.“It’s become a game of chicken,” said one exchange executive.The CME’s move appears to have done enough to sway some wavering CBOT members to back a bid first launched last October.Members and shareholders will vote on the proposal on July 9 but the share price movements on Friday raised expectations of a response from the ICE or a third party.The CME, which has on two occasions said there was no need to boost its bid, increased the exchange ratio of its all-stock bid from 0.35 to 0.375, valuing the CBOT at $11.4bn, including a special dividend.The gap between the all-stock bids had climbed to as high as $1.5bn as both exchanges repeatedly sweetened their offers in an effort to win the CBOT’s fast-growing franchise in financial and commodity derivatives.The CME’s original terms valued the CBOT at just $8bn when the merger was announced in October.Terry Duffy, CME chairman, told the Financial Times that the value of both franchises had increased since then but conceded that the latest move was required to sway what he described as “naysayers” among the Board of Trade membership, who control three-quarters of its stock.“The vote was definitely trending in our direction,” he said, adding that former opponents had already offered support for the new terms.The Merc also won backing from Caledonia Investments, the Australian investor that holds 7 per cent of Board of Trade shares and which said it would vote against the CME offer.Craig Donohue, chief executive, said the Merc had not identified additional synergies but insisted that the new terms were “justified”.● BNP Paribas is to become a shareholder in Project Turquoise, the pan-European share trading platform set up by a group of the region’s largest investment banks to provide a low-cost competitor to local stock exchanges, Norma Cohen reports.The bank, which has a big cash equities business through its BNP Exane joint venture, becomes the first bank allowed to become a shareholder in the venture since it was first announced last November by founding members Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS.
612;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;ICE snaps up Winnipeg exchange;;The Intercontinental Exchange on Friday agreed to acquire the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange, boosting its energy complex and providing a psychological lift in its battle to buy the Chicago Board of Trade.The proposed deal marks the second time in five days that the ICE has snatched a partner from one of the Chicago exchanges following its agreement to license Russell index equity products currently hosted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.The ICE and the CME are entering the final stages of the battle for the CBOT, whose members are due to vote on the Merc’s agreed bid on July 9. The ICE has appealed directly to CBOT members and shareholders, calling on them to reject the Merc plan – which continues to trail the value of its own proposal by about $1bn.The Board of Trade and the Merc insist their deal is superior because of its long-term growth opportunities and the execution risks of an ICE-CBOT combination.The Winnipeg exchange currently hosts its key canola, a rapeseed variant, contract on the CBOT’s electronic exchange, but will switch it to the ICE platform by the end of the year. Atlanta-based ICE has expanded from its roots as an energy exchange with a series of acquisitions and joint ventures over the past year, including the New York Board of Trade, which gave it access to soft commodities for the first time.While it is paying just C$40m ($37.35m) for the Canadian business, the expansion into a new asset class and ability to break alliances involving the Chicago exchanges could help sway CBOT members, according to market observers.The CME and the ICE have both sweetened their offers for the second-largest US futures exchange on two occasions, and the fierce battle for the franchise has led many analysts to predict further moves over the next two weeks.The CBOT members hold more than three-quarters of the voting stock, and have been wooed by executives from both exchanges with improved deal terms and other benefits in a contest which most observers regard as too close to call.The outcome is also expected to define future consolidation across the derivatives industry, with whoever loses out in the CBOT battle expected to pursue another combination.The CME maintains that while its all-stock offer trails the face value of the ICE proposal, its rival faces more execution risks and fewer growth opportunities. “Over the past week we’ve received many positive noises [from CBOT members],” said Merc chairman Terry Duffy at an investor presentation this week. “They are looking at it holistically,” added Craig Donohue, chief executive.However, Jeff Sprecher, the founder and chief executive of the ICE, has made much of the running with CBOT members since launching his surprise bid in March, five months after the Chicago exchanges agreed to merge in an all-share deal valuing the Board of Trade at just $8bn.Mr Sprecher brokered a deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange to end a long running spat over CBOT members’ potential share in a flotation of the options business, a move subsequently matched by the CME. Both exchanges have also improved trading rights offered to CBOT members.The ICE this week sent a letter to CBOT members, calling on them to ignore the board recommendation and vote against the Merc proposal. CME executives responded on Friday with their own letter, supporting the proposed deal.
613;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-20T22:58:53Z;ICE bid for CBOT passes $12bn mark;;The value of the hostile offer for the Chicago Board of Trade from the Intercontinental Exchange passed $12bn for the first time on Wednesday as the rival suitors continued to tweak elements of their proposals.The gap between the ICE proposal and an agreed bid from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also widened to more than $1bn, though CME executives remained optimistic about winning support from Board of Trade members and shareholders at a crucial vote on July 9.The CME and the ICE have both sweetened their offers for the second-largest US futures exchange on two occasions, and the fierce battle for the franchise has led many analysts to predict further moves over the next two weeks.The CBOT members hold more than three-quarters of the voting stock, and have been wooed by executives from both exchanges with improved deal terms and other benefits in a contest that most observers regard as too close to call.The outcome is also expected to define future consolidation across the derivatives industry, with whoever loses out in the CBOT battle expected to pursue another combination.The CME maintains that while its all-stock offer trails the face value of the ICE proposal, its rival faces more execution risks and fewer growth opportunities. “Over the past week we’ve received many positive noises [from CBOT members],” said CME chairman Terry Duffy at an investor presentation. “They are looking at it holistically,” added Craig Donohue, chief executive.However, Jeff Sprecher, the founder and chief executive of the ICE, has made much of the running with CBOT members since launching his surprise bid in March, five months after the Chicago exchanges agreed to merge in an all-share deal valuing the Board of Trade at just $8bn.Mr Sprecher brokered a deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange to end a long running spat over CBOT members’ potential share in a flotation of the options business, a move subsequently matched by the CME. Both exchanges have also improved trading rights offered to CBOT members.The ICE also snatched the licence for a key equity index product from the CME this week, forcing the CME to replace it with an alternative.
614;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-19T22:16:43Z;Wall St edges higher as bond yields fall;;Wall Street edged higher on Tuesday, while bond yields fell sharply and investors sifted disappointing earnings news from the retail and semiconductor sectors, a massive stock buy-back at Expedia and a management shuffle at Yahoo.Housing starts data for May declined 2.1 per cent against an expected fall of 3.5 per cent. The report briefly pressure home builder stocks, but the S&P homebuilders index ultimately rose 0.1 per cent, trimming its loss for the year to 21.4 per cent.“Housing starts confirm that homebuilders have become more pessimistic over the last two months,’’ said economists at Lehman Brothers. “Next week’s sales data will tell us if that was warranted.’’The S&P 500 index closed 0.2 per cent firmer at 1,533.70. Stocks had spent much of on Tuesday flirting with a negative close, only to stave off that outcome when yields fell to their lows of the day in late trade. The yield on the 10-year bond fell seven basis points to 5.07 per cent. At this juncture, analysts say yields are not high enough to spark a large move out of equities.“Fixed income does not represent a major value opportunity relative to equities, in our view,” said Vinay Pande, chief investment advisor at Deutsche Bank. But he said the recent rise in bond yields means “that the large tailwind equities had from very attractive funding has now dissipated materially”.Among the 10 main industry groups in the S&P, industrials and telecoms closed higher. Consumer staples and technology stocks led declines.The Nasdaq Composite closed a fraction higher at 2,626.76.Within the technology sector, semiconductor stocks were in the spotlight. Microchip Technology slid 9 per cent to $37.91, after the semiconductor maker cut its sales outlook for the first quarter ending June 30.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 13,635.42. A bright spot for blue chips was General Electric, which hit a five-year high of $39.60 and closed up 3.2 per cent at $39.29.Among stocks in the news on Tuesday was Yahoo, down 1.7 per cent at $27.63 as investors reacted to the news that Jerry Yang, co-founder of the company, had been appointed chief executive. He will replace Terry Semel.“Over the past six months Yahoo has now seen two major restructurings and experienced sizable management turnover. Without a single wholly new principal announced, we don’t necessarily see major changes,” said Scott Kessler, internet software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Shares in Best Buy slumped 5.9 per cent to $45.18 as its first-quarter earnings fell 18 per cent and the retailer lowered guidance for 2008. Shares in other electronic retailers fell on Tuesday. RadioShack lost 3.3 per cent to $33.71, while Circuit City fell 2.8 per cent to $16.07.Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 4.2 per cent to $31.58, after a judge ruled that the patent for its Plavix drug, used in preventing blood clots, was valid. The stock set a 52-week high of $32.07 earlier in the day.In the latest buy-back, Expedia said it would purchase up to 116.7m shares for $3.5bn, worth 42 per cent of its outstanding common stock.Shares in the online travel company jumped 14.3 per cent to $29.14. “Based on this newly announced buy-back programme, which could notably aid 2007 earnings-per-share, we are raising our 12-month target price to $30 from $25,” Mr Kessler said.On Tuesday, India’s Sterlite Industries raised $1.75bn in American depositary shares, that valued the metals concern at $9.25bn. The stock was placed at a price of $13.44 in an initial public offering and will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.Home Depot rose 0.8 per cent to $38.27 after it agreed to sell its supply division to three private equity firms for $10bn. The home improvement chain then announced that the proceeds will help fund a $22.5bn buy-back programme. In after-hours trade, the stock shot up 6.1 per cent to $40.60.Deal speculation surrounding the mining sector continued on Tuesday. Investors await news on whether BHP Billiton will launch a bid for Alcan, the Canadian aluminium producer that is currently the subject of a $28.7bn hostile bid from Alcoa.Shares in Alcan rose 0.9 per cent to $84.31, while Alcoa dipped 0.7 per cent at $41.58.Shares in CBOT Holdings slipped 0.2 per cent to end at $208.90. Investors await whether rival bidders for the exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings and the IntercontinentalExchange will increase their bids for a third time.Last week, the US Department of Justice cleared a merger between CBOT and CME. Shareholders in both exchanges meet on July 9 to vote on approving the merger.
615;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-19T12:49:28Z;ICE wins Russell futures deal;;The share price of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange dipped on Tuesday after its rival for control of the Chicago Board of Trade snatched a key licensing agreement from under its nose.The Intercontinental Exchange continued the expansion of its product offerings with an exclusive deal to trade futures based on the popular Russell stock indices, forcing the CME to replace the product.The CME-Russell contract expires later this year, requiring the Merc to cease listing of futures based on the Russell 2000 index, which will be added to the suite of equity-based products traded on the New York Board of Trade platform acquired by the ICE last year.However, the Merc quickly fired back on Tuesday with plans to expand the range of products based on Standard & Poor’s equity indices, noting that trading in the Russell 2000 future had been thin. The exchange said it would launch a new contract based on an S&P small cap index which competes with the broad Russell 2000, and will use incentives to encourage traders to switch to its own new product.Analysts said the current Russell deal generated around 2 per cent of the Merc’s earnings, based on current volumes.The ICE-Russell deal and the CME’s swift response mark another twist in the continuing battle for control of the CBOT.The Merc and the ICE have both sweetened their offers twice, and the prospect of further enhancements has pushed Board of Trade shares to record levels over the past two sessions, closing on Monday at $209.40 to push its market value above $11bn.The ICE management has proved adept at what one observer called “pulling rabbits out of hats”, brokering a deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange to end a long-running spat over CBOT members’ potential share in a flotation of the options business.The CME subsequently matched some of the terms of the CBOE deal while the Board of Trade – which continues to recommend the Merc bid – pursues the options exchange through the courts.The value of the Merc offer still trails the hostile ICE proposal by around $850m, when special dividends and break fees are included. CBOT members and shareholders are due to vote the CME bid on July 9, and all three exchanges continue to jostile for position ahead of a vote still seen as too close to call.
616;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-18T20:59:42Z;Wall St lower as bond yields steady;;US stocks lost steam in range-bound trade on Monday, with deal activity, bond yields and oil prices remaining the main talking points for investors.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,531.06. Among the S&P’s major industry groups, energy stocks were higher as crude oil prices hit their highest level in nine months, and technology also rallied. The rate-sensitive utility sector lead declines among the major groups.Late on Monday, the yield on the 10-year bond loitered above its low set in early trade.The Nasdaq Composite was a fraction lower at 2,626.60, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 13,612.98.After a strong rebound late last week that propelled the S&P and blue chips back towards record territory, the outlook for equities remains contingent in part on yields and oil prices, say analysts.Recent economic data that have suggested the economy is entering summer on an upswing have boosted the outlook for stocks. But analysts caution that two areas of concern are higher oil prices – potentially sparking higher inflation in the coming months – and the state of the housing market, should yields continue to rise.“Oil could see an upside move towards $80,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading.The recent rise in bond yields has increased mortgage rates and $1,000bn floating rate home loans expire in the next 12 months and may refinance at higher rates.“Stronger growth could push the 10-year yield towards 5.50 per cent,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. For now, the recent strength in equities, led by cyclicals, small caps and commodity stocks, “tells you that interest rates are not high enough to slow down stocks”, he added.And the rise in bond yields could augur higher equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index. The Vix, which is looked to as a barometer of volatility in the S&P 500, fell 3.5 per cent on Monday, below its recent peak of 17.09.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said: “Several lead indicators, including equity risk premiums, bond yield curve steepness, and private sector credit growth, suggest that equity market volatility is likely to pick up further over the next 18-24 months.”In such an environment, Mr Levkovich said, “large-cap equity market leadership becomes more pronounced when volatility climbs”, while technology, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology sectors have experienced a stronger stock price performance when Vix has risen in the past two decades.One leader in the technology industry in recent years has been Apple, and it was up 3.8 per cent to $125.09. The new iPhone, due in the US on June 29, will contain a battery that has much stronger life than previously expected.Another tech stock on the rise was Yahoo. After a gain of 3 per cent to $28.12 in regular trade, the stock jumped 3.3 per cent to $29.05 in after-hours trade when the company announced that Jerry Yang, co-founder of the company had been appointed chief executive officer. He will replace Terry Semel in the position.Talk of a possible $40bn bid for Alcoa by BHP Billiton sparked a 0.7 per cent rise to $41.88 in the aluminium group. Alcoa’s stock set a 52-week high of $42.90 earlier on Monday and has risen 39.6 per cent this year. Alcan, facing a hostile bid from Alcoa, was 0.8 per cent higher at $83.55.The battle for Dow Jones, sought by News Corp in a $5bn bid, was in the spotlight as General Electric and Pearson, the publisher of the Financial Times, contemplated a competing proposal. Dow Jones was a fraction higher at $59.03, News Corp fell 1.4 per cent to $23.62, while GE lost 0.1 per cent to $38.07.Shares in CBOT Holdings rose 1.2 per cent to $209.40, and earlier set an all-time high of $209.50, on a report that rival bidders for the exchange, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings and the IntercontinentalExchange would both raise their price for derivatives exchange for a third time. Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice cleared a merger between CBOT and CME and shareholders in both exchanges meet on July 9 to vote on approving the merger. Shares in ICE were 1.6 per cent lower at $154.43, and CME lost 1.2 per cent to close at $545.99.In another corporate battle, Finish Line said it had agreed to acquire footwear and accessories retailer Genesco for $1.46bn, or $54.50 a share. Finish Line’s bid topped a bid of $51 recently made by Foot Locker. Genesco had urged shareholders to reject the Foot Locker bid. Genesco rose 8.4 per cent to $53.75, Finish Line slid 8.7 per cent to $11.53, and Foot Locker rose 1.1 per cent to $21.37.Shares in Cadence Design fell 3 per cent to $22.60, however amid talk that a bid by two private equity firms for the maker of chip design software had stalled over price terms.Gilead Sciences was down 0.4 per cent at $80.51, as its drug for lung disease won approval from US health officials on Friday.Bear Stearns was 1.4 per cent lower at $147.95. Merrill Lynch said it would delay selling $400m in assets seized from a hedge fund managed by Bear Stearns.Molex, the maker of electromechanical components lowered guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter - ending in June - and its share price declined 2.1 per cent to $30.86.Shares in Halliburton fell 1.2 per cent to $35.92. Goldman Sachs downgraded the engineering company to “neutral” from “buy” due to rising competition in the natural gas business.US Steel fell 1.8 per cent to $114.06. UBS downgraded the steelmaker and said a deal, that has helped drive the stock up 56.3 per cent this year, may not be imminent.Shares in Wendy’s fell 3.7 per cent to $38.26, after the hamburger chain lowered lowered its 2007 earnings forecast, and would consider a possible sale of the company.
617;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Nymex up after report of possible buy-out;;The Chicago Board of Trade will not disclose plans for its metals business before consummating a merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a move that could provide both groups with insurance against a potential takeover of the New York Mercantile Exchange.Nymex was on Friday reported to be holding informal takeover talks with three exchanges, including the CME, and the fate of the energy and metals specialist adds another twist to the complex consolidation being played out in the global derivatives sector.CBOT and Nymex compete in the metals business, while the New York group also has a 10-year deal with CME to list its energy and futures on gold, silver, copper and aluminium on the Merc’s electronic platform.The two Chicago exchanges have yet to reveal how they would resolve the potential conflicts as they press the case for their own merger in the face of a hostile counterbid for CBOT from the IntercontinentalExchange, the chief rival of Nymex in the energy futures market.“The metals complex is not going to change until we have certainty of closing [the CME deal],” said Bernie Dan, CBOT’s chief executive.Volumes on Nymex have soared since listing its products on CME, lifting its market value above $13bn, more than double the level of last November’s initial public offering.The exchange opted to float in spite of a number of approaches, which bankers said included the CME.Analysts said a takeover premium could value Nymex at $155 a share, or $14.3bn, 11 per cent above Thursday’s closing price of $139.80.The Nymex share price climbed as much as 8 per cent on Friday after Bloomberg reported it was in informal talks with CME, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse.CME later said it was not in any “current” discussions, while the three other exchanges declined to comment.However, the CBOT bid battle has fuelled speculation over a number of potential combinations.“Some sort of strategic move by Nymex is inevitable,” said Bill Cline at Acai Solutions, a US consultant.Analysts said CME’s long-standing ambitions to expand in energy futures could see it pursue Nymex if its bid for CBOT fails, despite the confidence of both exchanges that they will win member and shareholder support.Mr Dan said CBOT members had not expressed concern over the fate of the metals business.However, maintaining investment in the business will keep up its momentum in case it loses its preferred merger partner.
618;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-15T20:24:01Z;Nasdaq leads Wall Street gains;;Wall Street rebounded from an interest rate pothole this week and a strong weekly performance left the S&P 500 and blue chips testing record territory once more.After falling by about 1 per cent on Tuesday when long-term bond yields soared to their highest level since 2002, US stock benchmarks subsequently found their footing when rates stabilised. Benign core inflation readings for May reinforced the stabilisation in bonds and also boosted stocks.Tony Crescenzi, bond strategist at Miller Tabak & Co, said the inflation data would “help to restrain any increase in yields, which for the stock market is enough to put worries about the bond market a bit further into the background”.Attention has focused on whether the recent rise in bond yields will damp what has been a frenetic pace of merger and acquisition activity. On Friday, there were signs that deal activity was picking up and Home Depot, up 0.4 per cent at $37.95, received two separate bids for its wholesale supply unit. Among sectors in the vanguard of this week’s rebound was energy, as oil prices hit nine-month highs. Rate-sensitive utility stocks rallied, while higher commodity prices buoyed materials and industrial stocks.However, the rise in yields pushed mortgage rates sharply higher and the home builder and real estate investment trust sectors declined.The leading index this week was the Nasdaq Composite. The technology benchmark rose 1.05 per cent to 2,626.71 on Friday, a rise of 2.1 per cent over the week. Semiconductor stocks rallied 2.8 per cent this week, led by a 11 per cent rise to $24.24 for Intel. The chipmaker was upgraded to a “buy” on Friday by Goldman Sachs.The S&P 500 rose 0.65 per cent to 1,532.91 on Friday, a gain of 1.7 per cent this week. It was up from a low of 1,492.97 on Tuesday and was near its recent closing record of 1,539.18.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 13,639.48 on Friday, a rise of 1.6 per cent this week. The blue chip barometer was just shy of its recent record peak of 13,692. The Dow Transportation Average rose 1.1 per cent this week, taking its gain this year to 13.5 per cent as the sector rebounded from a sharp slide on Tuesday, when it hit its lowest level since mid April.Leading the blue chips this week was General Motors, up 11.8 per cent to $34.66 as investors cheered hopes for a union settlement over Delphi, the car maker’s former parts unit, that would help GM’s restructuring efforts.Ford rose 8.2 per cent to $8.92 this week, after it hired banks to advise on the sale of its Jaguar and Land Rover divisions.Deal talk this week focused on the exchange sector. Shares in Nymex rose 1.7 per cent to $142.12 on Friday, for a gain of 13.5 per cent this week, amid reports that it was seeking to merge with another exchange.The tug of war over CBOT Holdings, between the InterContinental Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange took a couple of twists.The CME and CBOT revised the terms of their merger agreement and will provide a special dividend to all CBOT shareholders. This followed a move by ICE on Tuesday to include a cash component in its bid for the CBOT. Shares in CBOT rose 4.3 per cent to $206.98, CME was up 0.6 per cent at $552.70, while ICE gained 7.8 per cent to $156.98.The S&P steel index fell 4.9 per cent, trimming its gain in 2007 to 27.9 per cent as consolidation talk cooled. Nucor slid 5.4 per cent to $63.02 after the steelmaker warned that its second quarter earnings would be well below analysts’ expectations.A number of stocks either hit record or 52-week highs.Eastman Kodak set a 52-week high of $30.20, and rose 10.3 per cent to $29.31. It said it had created image-sensor technology to allow photography in poor light.Freeport-McMoRan rose to a record high of $84.90 amid higher copper prices and news that the miner will sell some assets. Shares in the company gained 10.8 per cent to $84.42 this week.Apple hit a record high of $127.61 before investors cashed in after the company’s annual Developers Conference in San Francisco passed with no major new product news. The stock fell 3.2 per cent to $120.50.In earnings news, subprime mortgage woes clipped fixed income results at Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs. For the week, Bear was up 1.5 per cent at $150.09, and had pared its 2007 loss to 7.8 per cent. Goldman rose 0.5 per cent to $226.19, taking its gain in 2007 to 13.5 per cent.Lehman posted a 27 per cent rise in second quarter earnings to a record $1.3bn and its stock rose 6.6 per cent to $79.07. Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $88.48 on Friday.Fortress Investment Group slumped 6.5 per cent to $23.47 on Friday, as proposed legislation could raise taxes for the private-equity and hedge fund.Dean Foodsfell 3.5 per cent to $31.23 after it cut earnings estimates for the second quarter.Smith & Wesson reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and sales. The gun maker also raised its full-year profit and sales forecasts.

619;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-15T18:14:22Z;M&A cycles;;"If the rumours are true, Nymex is making eyes at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (currently fighting the Intercontinental Exchange for the Chicago Board of Trade); the New York Stock Exchange (which won Euronext last year); and Deutsche Börse (which bought the International Securities Exchange after being spurned by both Euronext and the London Stock Exchange, which itself rejected Nasdaq, which then opted for OMX).Most sectors face consolidation. But sometimes this process becomes indiscriminate, with managements pursuing almost any combination, on almost any terms, rather than be left out in the cold. Telecommunications in the late 1990s is one example. For exchanges, the original, and logical, objective of cost cutting has been superseded by the pursuit of woolly concepts. Nasdaq’s recent pledge to “grow and accelerate the global flow of equity capital” is a case in point.Rising prices add fuel to the fire. The market capitalisation of the top eight US and European exchanges has doubled in 18 months to $98bn, giving a weighted earnings multiple of 42 times, almost triple the level in 2004. Healthy deals are often driven by realism rather than exuberance: for example the consolidation led by Exxon, BP and Total after the oil price slump in 1997-98.Earnings may crack first. For the “big eight”, consensus forecasts project, on a weighted basis, 70 per cent growth over the next two years. Not all trends are positive: price pressures are building in US equities. Compounding this may be more geared balance sheets: Nasdaq’s purchase of OMX was partly in cash, while ICE and CME have recently added cash to their offers for CBOT.In the medium term, no amount of dealmaking can disguise an uneasy fact about exchanges – just as telecoms and pharmaceutical companies did during their consolidation binges, exchanges make excessive profits. The net fixed assets owned by the big eight, with their $98bn market cap? Just $2.5bn."
620;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-15T00:59:37Z;Much huff and puff across the Windy City;;"The task of nailing down a winning bid for the Chicago Board of Trade has become a game of herding cats, and the claws are out.While the Chicago Mercantile Exchange remains the front-runner to seal a cross-town deal almost 25 years in the making, its handling of the bid battle – in the face of a hostile counter-proposal from the Intercontinental Exchange – has left some members of the Chicago trading community bemused and others antagonised.CBOT’s leadership has succeeded in reshaping a business overtaken since the start of the decade by the nimbler CME, which was first to institute electronic trading and the governance reforms that led to its 2003 flotation.The Board of Trade, with its dominance in longer-dated interest-rate futures and agricultural commodities appealing to a global-ising user base, is generating record volumes and profit-ability.Its value has soared from just over $3bn when it floated in 2005, through the $8bn barrier suggested by the Merc’s original terms last October to almost $11bn, based on Thursday’s closing prices.Both the CME and the NYSE, before its merger with Euronext, made offers of about $3bn for the CBOT in mid-2005, before the Board of Trade elected to go public and generate a “metric” for any future deals.The franchise remains there for the CME to lose, say many influential members of the Board of Trade, who have successfully campaigned for the CME to raise its offer twice, despite management’s insistence that the previous terms were
fair, and superior to the ICE.The ICE, which continues its pursuit of the CBOT, has seen its own value increase as a potential takeover target if it loses the current battle.The potential outcomes – which could still leave the CBOT independent – have generated a complex game theory among exchange executives. The justice department’s approval of an all-Chicago merger this week has opened the door for any potential US combinationIf the CME successfully acquires the Board of Trade, then NYSE Euronext is expected to make a move on either the ICE or the New York Mercantile Exchange, despite the latter’s strategic alliance with the Merc.The NYSE has made it clear that expansion in US futures will be through acquisitions.If the ICE triumphs, then the CME would have little option but to pursue an alternative, despite its confidence about organic growth opportunities. The Nymex is viewed as the most likely target.However, some observers note that the hand-wringing over the competitiveness of the US capital markets could yet give rise to a true global exchange champion, combining the NYSE and the Merc."
621;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-14T21:48:15Z;CME sweetens proposed deal for CBOT;;The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Thursday improved its bid for the Chicago Board of Trade for a second time, though members and shareholders suggested it remains short of the “knock-out blow” required to secure the world’s third largest derivatives platform.The new proposal pushed CBOT shares to record levels and retained its recommendation from Board of Trade directors, though CME shares dropped and left it trailing the hostile proposal by the smaller Intercontinental Exchange by about $800m.The three-way bid battle also turned personal for the first time, with Terry Duffy, CME chairman, questioning the “credibility” of claims by Jeff Sprecher, his opposite number at the ICE.Mr Sprecher has won plaudits from some of the CBOT’s influential membership, who had questioned the value of the original CME offer agreed last October following further gains in the Board of Trade share price.John Lothian, head of electronic trading at The Price Group in Chicago, and a leading commentator on the sector, said members wanted more than just money on the table. “They want people that will listen to them. Sprecher’s done a good job on that and the CME hasn’t.”The ICE sweetened its own offer this week after consulting members, adding a cash alternative and a revised deal to end a dispute over their potential claim in the flotation of the Chicago Board Options Exchange.The CME on Thursday said its talks with shareholders led to the addition of a special dividend and its own deal to compensate for the so-called CBOE “exercise right” held by some Board of Trade members.However, it left the share exchange ratio unchanged at 0.35-to-one, with observers suggesting it will have to offer in the region of 0.4-to-one to win backing at a CBoT member and shareholders’ meeting on July 9.The CME and the Board of Trade insisted on a joint analysts’ call that the new terms were based on member feedback. However, it emerged shortly afterwards that they also reflected a settlement with the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees’ Retirement System, an activist investor that had sued the CBOT for failing to maximise shareholder value.CBOT shares reached a peak of $205.25 on Thursday, valuing the group at $10.9bn. CME shares dipped to leave its offer worth $10.64bn, including the special dividend. The ICE proposal, being made direct to shareholders, valued the CBOT at $11.42bn, excluding the CBOE agreement.
622;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-14T20:26:19Z;Wall St rises after benign PPI data;;Wall Street rose on Thursday, with sentiment buoyed by a benign core producer inflation reading for May and relatively steady bond yields.After a sharp rally on Wednesday, stocks opened stronger on Thursday and closed below their highs of the day.The S&P 500 index rose 0.5 per cent to close at 1,522.97. Energy, up 1.9 per cent, was the best performing large industry group in the S&P, followed by telecommunication and technology stocks. Transport stocks also rallied, rebounding from sharp losses earlier in the week.The yield on the 10-year bond was 1 basis point higher at 5.21 per cent, down from a high of 5.24 per cent earlier in the day.Sectors that have been hurt by the recent rise in yields, such as real estate investment trusts and homebuilders, were on the defensive on Thursday. In contrast, the S&P utilities sector rose 0.4 per cent.In the spotlight on Thursday were financials. The sector was weighed down by evidence that subprime mortgages clipped earnings at Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs.Goldman lost 3.4 per cent to $225.75 and it was one of the worst performing stocks in the S&P.Goldman’s second- quarter profits rose 1 per cent year-on-year, beating estimates. The bank’s fixed-income, currencies and commodities division experienced a 24 per cent decline in revenue, due in part to a weaker subprime market.The recent sharp rise in bond yields has not sparked a dramatic change in the corporate credit environment. The still historically low credit risk premia on corporate debt mean that the appetite for buy-outs is unlikely to dim, analysts say. “Private equity can continue to keep making deals and that should put a floor under stocks,” said Mark Kiesal, portfolio manager at Pimco. “You need to see much wider credit spreads before deal activity really slows down.”Technology and blue-chip stocks continued to rally on Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7 per cent to close at 2,599.41, while the Nasdaq 100 rose 0.6 per cent. Semiconductor stocks gained 1 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.5 per cent firmer at 13,553.73, led by General Motors, up 4.7 per cent at $33.60, Exxon Mobil, up 1.7 per cent at $84.77, and Intel, up 2.5 per cent at $23.23. A drag on the Dow was Dupont, off 0.8 per cent at $50.50 and Merck, down 0.9 per cent at $50.23.The broad market was cheered in early trade by news that producer prices, excluding food and energy prices, rose an expected 0.2 per cent last month. For the 12 months ending in May, the core rate was up 1.6 per cent.In spite of that good news, economists said the report on consumer prices due on Friday was a much more important measure. Attention will mainly focus on the core consumer price increase for the past year. Economists at Lehman Brothers expect a reading of 2.3 per cent, down from last year’s peak of 3 per cent.“Concerns about trend inflation have faded a little,” said John Shin, economist at Lehman. “But tight labour and commodity markets, slowing productivity and rising import prices should keep the Federal Reserve on inflation alert.”Other stocks in the news included Colgate-Palmolive, whose shares fell 0.9 per cent to $66.85. The company said fake toothpaste that could have been poisoned had been found in discount stores in four US states.Meanwhile, Eastman Kodak hit a 52-week high of $29.54, and rose 8 per cent to $29.19. The film and camera maker said it had created image-sensor technology to allow photography in poor light.Freeport-McMoRan rose to a record high of $84.86 amid higher copper prices and news that the miner will sell some assets. Shares in the company gained 2.3 per cent at $83.65.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange upped the ante in its battle withIntercontinental Exchange to win control of the Chicago Board of Trade. CME and CBOT Holdings revised the terms of their merger agreement and will provide a special dividend to all CBOT shareholders. It follows a move by ICE on Tuesday to include a cash component in its bid for the CBOT.CBOT rose 1.6 per cent to $204.81, CME fell 0.7 per cent to $547.49, while ICE gained 4.8 per cent to $154.89.
623;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-13T20:43:56Z;Wall Street rallies as bond yields steady;;Wall Street rallied sharply on Wednesday, boosted by a surge in retail sales during May and a respite from the relentless rise in government bond yields seen in recent days.The S&P 500 index surged 1.5 per cent higher to close at 1,515.68. Among the big industry groups, materials and utilities both rose more than 2 per cent.Stocks received an additional boost when the Federal Reserve released its latest Beige Book at mid-afternoon, which revealed “economic activity continued to expand from mid-April through May.”Other rate-sensitive stocks that have been buffeted by higher yields in recent days, such as real estate investment trusts, homebuilders and financials, rebounded on Wednesday.Technology and blue-chip equities also rose sharply after incurring sharp losses on Tuesday.The Nasdaq Composite closed 1.3 per cent higher at 2,582.31 while semiconductor stocks rallied 1.4 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.4 per cent at 13,482.35.Stocks opened firmer and rose further when bond yields pulled back sharply from highs set in early trade.The yield on the 10-year bond rose back above 5.3 per cent after a stronger–than- forecast retail sales number for May. But at that level, bonds attracted buyers and the subsequent decline in yields soothed concerns among stock investors. Late on Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was six basis points lower at 5.20 per cent.Bond traders said pension and insurance funds entered the market attracted by the level of yields, which have risen from about 4.60 per cent since March.“There is some confidence that bond yields have made a top,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The retail sales report shows the economy is growing better than ex-pected, and equities can handle higher bond yields.”With consumer price inflation figures for May due on Friday, however, equity prices could come under renewed pressure before that, Mr Pado said. “The market wants growth, not inflation to be the driver of higher yields.”Although the retail sales report sparked interest rate futures to price in a small chance of a rate rise by the Federal Reserve later this year, analysts said the recent rise in bond yields already represented a tightening in policy as many sectors of the economy were sensitive to long-term rates.Kevin Flanagan, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said 30-year mortgage rates had risen by nearly 50 basis points in the past four weeks. “This will only serve to make any stabilisation in the housing market that much harder,” he said.Meanwhile, analysts expect higher rates are likely to clip the pace of deal activity, an explosion of which has boosted stocks this year.Among stocks in the news was Boeing, up 2.1 per cent at $98.47 as the aircraft maker confirmed a forecast of a $2,800bn market for new commercial aircraft over the next 20 years.Other leading blue-chip stocks included Caterpillar, up 2.4 per cent at $79.93, after boosting its dividend by 20 per cent. Shares in 3M rose 2.5 per cent to $87.19, after the Beige Book release. Alcoa, gained 2.9 per cent to $40.48.Shares in Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs rose on Wednesday ahead of their second quarter results on Thursday. Bear gained 2.4 per cent to $149.49, while Goldman rose 2.5 per cent to $233.63. Lehman was up 2.4 per cent at $77.87, after posting record results on Tuesday.Merger and acquisition activity on Wednesday was led by the latest twist in the battle for CBOT Holdings, the parent of the Chicago Board of Trade, the derivatives ex-change. IntercontinentalExchange sweetened its hostile $11bn bid for CBOT with an offer to shareholders of cash in lieu of shares, up to a maximum of $2.5bn. ICE’s previous offer was all stock. ICE fell 0.8 per cent to $147.78, CBOT rose 0.2 per cent to $201.50, while CME was 0.5 per cent higher at $551.25.Earlier this week, regulators agreed that Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings could buy CBOT. ICE intends to wage a proxy fight in order to try to prevent the CME purchase of CBOT.A drag on blue chips was Verizon, down 0.4 per cent at $42.90.Meanwhile, the initial public offering of Blackstone Group would occur during the last week of June, underwriter Morgan Stanley said.
624;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-13T18:06:47Z;CBOT bid battle;;The Intercontinental Exchange’s revised bid for the Chicago Board of Trade deserves 10 out of 10 for creativity. Will that be enough?ICE is offering tweaks rather than a price increase. There is now a cash element, partly offsetting concerns that ICE’s stock price reflects a bid premium of its own. ICE is also targeting CBOT members holding disputed rights to equity in the Chicago Board Options Exchange. These “full members” of CBOT are estimated to control about two-thirds of CBOT’s equity. Again, ICE is not adjusting the price overall but is offering alternative structures that would allow full members to retain exposure to any flotation of CBOE.Using ICE’s own calculations, its new offer is worth about $228 per share for full members – a 16 per cent premium to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s implied offer, adjusted for break fees. Then again, the value of the CBOE rights is not quantified in CME’s rival offer, and should be worth something.ICE may have done enough to force CME to up its bid once more. Increasing CME’s exchange ratio from 0.35 shares per CBOT share to, say, 0.37 would cut ICE’s implied premium for full members to 10 per cent (the premium for ordinary shareholders would drop to 3 per cent). And CME would still enjoy the operational advantages of its own merger plan, which received a favourable antitrust ruling on Monday.Two things are clear. The stock price of all three participants fell on the news of this latest round in the bid battle on Tuesday. That, together with ICE’s focus on tweaks rather than price, suggests CBOT’s stock is near a peak. The other is that the antitrust ruling leaves the door wide open for further consolidation in the sector. No wonder Nymex Holdings’ shares have jumped by 6.5 per cent since Monday.
625;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-12T22:05:49Z;ICE raises its offer for CBOT;;The Intercontinental Exchange on Tuesday sweetened its offer for the Chicago Board of Trade and appealed directly to members and shareholders with terms it claimed are 20 per cent above the rival bid from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.The move, which comes a day after antitrust regulators approved an all-Chicago combination, added pressure on the CME to raise its own bid for a second time or risk losing another target in the rapidly-consolidating global derivatives sector.The Atlanta-based ICE decided to make a revised hotsile bid after CBOT directors reaffirmed their recommendation for the offer from the Merc, which has continued to trail the value of the ICE offer and the Board of Trade share price.The ICE offer remains valed at a $1bn more than the all-stock CME offer, excluding the benefit of an exclusive deal to give CBOT members a slice in a planned flotation with the Chicago Board Options Exchange.The exchange ratio between the ICE and the CBOT was left unchanged at 1.42:1, but the offer was improved in a number of areas where Board of Trade members had expressed concern. The ICE has added a $2.5bn cash alternative toi its own all-stock offer, improved the discounts available to CBOT members and amanded the deal with the CBOE.However, it has not changed the governance element which would see ICE appoint all but five of the 16 board members in the combined company, which would be based in Chicago and retain the Board of Trade name.The CME and the Board of Trade have argued their deal remains superior because of the greater intergation risks posed by a combination involving the ICE, as well as long-term growth potential.CBOT’s influential membership – who still control around 80 per cent of its stock – remain split over the merits of a CME deal because of the lower valuation, and many have said they would vote it down at a meeting planned for July 9 unless the Merc raises its own offer.Merc executives have also been left embarrassed after the widely-flagged approval from the US justice department failed to lift its share price, contrary to claims made ahead of the announcement. CME shares closed down 1.5 per cent at $548.50, valuing its offer at $10.17bn, compared with the $11.2bn proposed by the ICE.The value of the ICE offer has been buoyed by speculation that a failure to secure a deal with the Board of Trade would make it a target, with NYSE Euronext viewed as the most likely acquirer. The decision by the justice department to approve a CME-CBOT combination with no conditions led analysts to forecast that any combination in the US derivatives industry would be cleared by antitrust officials.
626;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-12T20:57:32Z;Opponents of all-Chicago deal find case has backfired;;"Thomas Barnett, head of antitrust enforcement at the US Justice department, raised eyebrows in the futures industry with his decision to clear a planned merger between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.The features of Jeff Sprecher and John Thain would have been worth watching as two of the principal opponents to the proposed deal were both cited by the DoJ in providing a rationale for its decision to end a probe into the competitive impact of an all-
Chicago combination.Mr Sprecher’s Intercontinental Exchange is vying with the Merc to acquire the CBOT and had used the antitrust issue to help build support for his rival offer, which is 10 per cent richer than the terms agreed by the Merc.The recently-formed NYSE Euronext, led by Mr Thain, which could still be drawn into the bid battle, has been more direct in criticising a combination that has angered many Wall Street investment banks.“It is extremely difficult to compete head-to-head if the Department of Justice allows the current [CME-CBOT] clearing and margining agreements to stay in place,” said Mr Thain at an investor conference last week. “If we are going to develop a bigger presence in the US, it has to be through an acquisition.”But the DoJ used the NYSE’s determination to expand in US futures as evidence that an all-Chicago deal would not raise barriers to entry in the industry. It also cited plans by the ICE, which specialises in commodity-based products, to enter the market for interest-rate futures dominated by the Chicago exchanges.“It is certainly convenient that some of the other would-be suitors had announced their intention to enter because at least it provides a rationale for the DoJ to rely on the argument that more parties will come into the market,” says John Taladay, a partner at Howrey, the law firm.But the ICE had made clear its focus in interest-rate products was on the over-the-counter market, rather than the exchange-traded space dominated by the liquidity of the two Chicago exchanges..The DoJ even aligned itself with the ICE argument by stating that the Chicago exchanges were unlikely to compete with each other’s “entrenched” products, “in part due to the difficulty of overcoming the incumbent exchange’s liquidity advantage in an established futures contract”.The two Chicago exchanges had lobbied hard since announcing their proposed deal last October, and used their powerful presence in Washington as an array of banks and futures brokers tried to frustrate a deal that would create the world’s largest derivatives exchange.Opponents recognised that there were few if any carve-outs open to the DoJ. Any effort to break up the three-year-old common clearing link which sees CBOT products cleared by the Merc was seen as a “deal-breaker”; analysts calculated that the loss of revenue would have wiped $50 a share from the CME’s market value. “To remove the uncertainty is obviously very significant,” said Bernie Dan, president of the CBOT.Additional reporting by Stephanie Kirchgaessner"
627;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-12T02:28:15Z;CME-CBOT deal gets antitrust approval;;US antitrust regulators on Monday cleared the path for a final three-week price battle over the Chicago Board of Trade by approving its proposed merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.The Intercontinental Exchange, which is vying with the CME to acquire the second-largest US derivatives exchange, had raised antitrust concerns in touting its rival offer, amid broader industry disquiet about the pricing power of an all-Chicago combination.The two Chicago exchanges had been confident the creation of the world’s largest futures and options exchange would clear regulatory hurdles since announcing the proposed combination last October.However, lingering concerns that the justice department would force some concessions continued to weigh on the CME’s share price and left its all-stock offer – which it sweetened last month – trailing the $11.3bn ICE proposal by almost $900m, based on Monday’s closing prices.The DoJ cleared the proposed CME-CBOT deal without any conditions, saying neither the deal nor an existing clearing joint venture was likely to “reduce competition substantially”, or impact innovation or barriers to entry in the fast-growing derivatives sector.The DoJ’s antitrust division cited the willingness of the ICE to enter the interest-rate futures market without a CBOT deal as evidence of market opportunities.A similar intent was attributed to NYSE Euronext, although the recently formed group – which had also criticised a CME-CBOT deal – said last week that it would enter the futures market through acquisitions.While the two Chicago groups dominate exchange-based trading and clearing of futures and options on futures in the US, the DoJ accepted their argument that the relevant market for competition purposes was the global derivatives sector, including the larger over-the-counter segment of bilateral deals between banks and other participants.The all-Chicago combination had attracted criticism from the futures industry, notably from intermediaries who fear it would provide an enlarged CME with greater pricing power, particularly in clearing services for the most commonly traded products. Major investment banks had also criticised the proposed merger during a seven-month advanced review by the DoJ.However, the CME and the CBOT argued that this reflected concern among banks that the combination would challenge their dominance in the OTC market.The planned merger next goes to votes by CME shareholders and CBOT members and shareholders on July 9.
628;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-11T20:02:33Z;Race to establish benchmark for Middle East crude;;The race to establish a benchmark for Middle East crude oil has started with the launch of rival contracts by the US-based InterContinental Exchange (ICE) and Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME).The DME launch in May was hailed as a “historic moment in Middle East crude oil pricing” by Garry King, its chief executive.“The success of this contract would likely have a profound market impact, moving crude oil pricing away from New York and London and into the heart of the Middle East,” says Ed Morse, of Lehman Brothers.Since Saudi Arabia terminated the role of its main crude as the benchmark for Middle East prices in the 1980s, West Texas Intermediate has been regarded as the main global oil price.But Brent crude has been trading at a premium to WTI since March, reflecting an oversupply of crude at Cushing in Oklahoma, the main US delivery point.“Partly due to the local supply/demand issues affecting WTI and causing it to disconnect from the global crude markets, the timing of the launch for the Middle East sour contracts could not be better,” says Mike Wittner, global head of energy market research at Calyon. “Another key reason for investor interest is the longer-term trend with demand growth for crude coming mainly from Asia while incremental supply will come from the Middle East.”There is mounting concern that WTI is a poor benchmark for valuations and for mitigating risk through hedging. Brent is also seen as imperfect.“Global oil pricing has reflected the wrong crude streams trading in the wrong places,” says Mr Morse. “Brent and West Texas Intermediate are light, sweet (low sulphur) crudes which exhibit different seasonal patterns from Middle East which has most of the world’s reserves.” Most Middle East crude oil is sour (high sulphur) and heavy, generating a price discount against Brent and WTI.Although the volumes of crude produced by Dubai (90,000 barrels a day) and Oman (800,000 b/d) are relatively small, they provide a direct benchmark for more than 12m b/d of Middle East crude sold in Asia which is 30 per cent of globally traded crude oil.The DME contract has won the backing of Dubai and Oman but questions remain over which contract Saudi Arabia will support.The main difference between the two contracts is that DME allows physical delivery and ICE contracts are settled in cash. Some refiners prefer the physical settlement option while financial players such as hedge funds, support the cash option.Kevin Norrish, at Barclays Capital, said: “The main issue remains liquidity and where that is going to come from. However, there’s certainly been greater interest in the launch of the Middle East sour contracts than there would have been otherwise if WTI was not trading at such a large discount to Brent.”Liquidity is expected to be boosted by interest from Asian buyers as the new contract will provide a transparent mechanism for hedging crude supplies and refinery margins.National oil companies of the Middle East should be able to see crude sales priced off a clear benchmark, which should encourage their participation in the market.The DME says there has been significant interest in plans for a jet fuel futures contract. Other initiatives, which Mr King declined to divulge, are also planned.
629;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
630;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-06T14:01:30Z;CBOT steps up effort to seal CME deal;;The Chicago Board of Trade on Wednesday intensified its efforts to win backing for its proposed merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange by warning that a rival bid from the Intercontinental Exchange would put its “entire franchise at risk”.The CBOT also pledged to explore its own deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange after the ICE last week reached an agreement that promised to end a long-running spat between Board of Trade members over potential equity ownership in the largest US options exchange.The Financial Times revealed on Monday that the CBOT planned a fresh offensive to win backing for the CME merger ahead of key votes by members and shareholders on July 9.The value of the all-stock ICE offer – which could be amended to include a cash element – remains around $1.5bn more than the CME agreement, despite the Merc’s decision to sweeten its own terms last month, winning another recommendation from the CBOT board. The gap excludes the potential payout from a deal with the CBOE.ICE shares climbed almost 4 per cent on Wednesday, helped by suggestions from NYSE Euronext chief executive John Thain that the exchange would look to acquisitions to build its US futures business. The ICE is seen as a potential target for the NYSE if its bid for the Board of Trade fails.The Merc bid is expected to receive its own lift if, as expected, justice department officials clear the creation of the world’s largest derivatives exchange. Both the CME and the CBOT insist a DoJ decision will be made by July 9.The ICE, which last week addressed CBOT members for the first time, has stopped short of launching a hostile move on the Board of Trade. However, it has called on members to intensify their pressure on CBOT directors and retained a proxy firm.The CBOT, in a letter to members, rebutted some of the comments made by ICE founder and chief executive Jeff Sprecher last week. It focused on the risks of migrating clearing and settlement services from the hosting arrangement with the CME to the expanding ICE platform. ICE insists the process will take 18 months, while the CBOT believes it will take two years or more.Members were warned by CBOT directors that the shift could erode the position of the second-largest futures exchange. “We’re not just talking about a dip in sales here, but the potential permanent loss of our liquidity pools,” it argued. “Put another way, our entire franchise would be at risk.”Mr Sprecher’s deal to pay members cash for their so-called exercise rights at the CBOE met with a mixed response at last week’s meeting, though he was praised for seeking a settlement at a time when the Board of Trade is pursuing a deal through the courts.The CBOT echoed criticism by members of the value of the ICE-CBOE proposal, but said “the idea may be a good one to build upon, and we intend to pursue that opportunity”
631;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-06-03T21:00:29Z;CBOT in fresh drive to seal CME merger;;The Chicago Board of Trade plans a fresh offensive to win support for its merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange once antitrust officials have ruled on the proposed deal.The Chicago exchanges remain confident that their agreed deal will clear a review by the US justice department, though they acknowledge that the uncertainty of the eight-month probe has limited their ability to sell the deal to wavering CBOT members and shareholders.The DoJ is expected to report its findings as early as this week, and a positive response from officials would boost the CME’s share price, narrowing the $1bn gap with the rival all-stock offer for the CBOT from the Intercontinental Exchange.“We expect to have that [DoJ] review completed in time to communicate the result for the July 9 vote,” said Bernard Dan, president and chief executive of the Board of Trade. “That dynamic has yet to play out.”The former Cargill executive has assumed a more public role in the merger battle in recent weeks. While he is due to leave an enlarged CME after a year as a consultant, observers said his diplomacy was crucial in persuading CBOT members to accept side-by-side trading of agricultural futures last year.Mr Dan told the Financial Times that the Chicago exchanges would “evaluate” the views of members and shareholders – many of whom continue to press for the CME to raise their bid for a second time – when their proxy statement is approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the DoJ gives its final verdict.An all-Chicago combination would create the world’s largest derivatives exchange, and regulators are examining its impact on transaction clearing services in the US, as well as competition in the politically sensitive market for futures based on US Treasury products. A unit of Eurex, the current world leader, failed in an effort to compete with the CBOT’s key interest-rate product two years ago.The ICE has also used the uncertainty of the DoJ review to support its own proposal, and last week increased its own efforts to win backing from uncertain CBOT members, who are due to vote alongside shareholders next month and who remain split over the competing bids and the option of remaining independent.The Atlanta-based exchange, which has already seen one takeover proposal rejected by CBOT directors, last week pledged to send a fresh proposal after brokering a deal to give members a share in the potential flotation of the neighbouring Chicago Board Options Exchange.“If some situation like that presented itself, we’ll see what happens,” said Mr Dan, who also noted that directors had to prepare “for the possibility that we could be going it alone” if the CME bid was rejected and no “superior” offer emerged.
632;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-05-31T14:13:09Z;CBOT urges backing for CME deal;;The Chicago Board of Trade on Thursday appealed to members to back its agreed merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, ahead of a key address to CBOT members by a rival bidder.Jeff Sprecher, founder and chief executive of the Intercontinental Exchange, will brief the CBOT’s influential membership on the merits of his unsolicited proposal at a Chicago hotel on Thursday afternoon.The CBOT continues to back a deal with the CME, which would create the world’s largest derivatives exchange. The value of the all-stock agreement remains $1bn below the terms proposed by ICE, based on midday prices on Thursday, though the 10 per cent gap is the narrowest since May 11.Board of Trade directors have emphasised that price is not the only factor, despite the pressure from its members which forced the larger CME to sweeten its own bid earlier this month. It had insisted for weeks that such a move was unnecessary.The FInancial Times revealed this week that the ICE had been asked by the CBOT to improve the financial and governance terms of its own proposal, but declined.The leadership of the two Chicago exchanges has been accused of arrogance by some market observers, not least in limiting questions from CBOT members at an address by Merc executives in March.Mr Sprecher is expected to exploit these views with an extended question and answer session on Friday, with Board of Trade members still unsure about the ability of the smaller ICE to swallow its larger target.CBOT advisers said it could take more than two years to integrate the companies’ back-office systems, while ICE insists it will take 18 months.The CBOT on Thursday highlighted these concerns in a letter distributed on its trading floor: “In combining CME and CBOT, a huge plus is that we expect to be able to integrate our companies quickly and efficiently.”Board of Trade directors also questioned the pact announced on Wednesday between ICE and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which sought to end a long-running spat over CBOT members’ potential equity interest in a flotation of the options exchange.The CBOT had sought a merger with the options exchange last year as a way to solve the dispute, before breaking oiff talks to pursue a deal with the CME. The issue is now before a Delaware court.CBOT members control over 80 per cent of the stock following the company’s 2005 flotation, and remain split over the merits of the competing offers and the option of remaining independent.Some analysts said Friday’s meeting would raise further concerns among Merc executives that it might fail to win backing for its agreed bid. Some members note that the CME – which has not closed a takeover despite the flurry of consolidation in the exchanges sector – has had nine months to broker a settlement with the CBOE, but has opted to pursue a settlement through the courts.CBOT directors have intensified their own talks with members and shareholders in recent days ahead of a July 9 vote on the proposed CME deal, with registration for applicable shares closing on Tuesday.While CME offer continues to lag both the ICE proposal and the CBOT share price, its value is expected to rise if it secures clearance for the deal from the justice department. A decision is expected as early as next week.The regulator has been examining the all-Chicago deal since last December amid a furious lobbying effort by some investment banks and intermediaries, which claim the enlarged exchange would damage competition.
633;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-05-30T20:50:28Z;S&P 500 hits record high after Fed minutes;;The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Wednesday, as investors looked on the bright side of the Federal Reserve’s recent meeting minutes.While stocks are set to record their third straight positive monthly gain on Thursday, investors face a cocktail of potentially potent economic data due on Friday.On Wednesday, fears that a sharp slide in Chinese stocks overnight would spark a similar reaction on Wall Street faded early. Stocks opened lower but losses were quickly contained. “Any link between Shanghai and the S&P 500 is tenuous at best,” said Jack Ablin, portfolio manager at Harris Private Bank.For some investors, the lack of a major pullback in US stocks was disappointing.“We were ready for some opportunities in equities if there was a large sell-off,” said Michael Kastner, port-folio manager at Sterling-Stamos.After the Fed minutes were released, the leading benchmarks made fresh highs and the S&P 500 index finished up 0.8 per cent at 1,530.23, above its March 2000 close of 1,527.46. The June S&P futures contract rebounded from a low of 1,512.60 earlier in the day and closed at a new contract high of 1,532.50. Within the S&P, the energy and telecoms sectors led gains, while health care lingered in negative territory.The Nasdaq Composite shrugged off early losses and closed up 0.8 per cent at 2,592.59, a fresh six year high. A decline of 0.4 per cent in semiconductor stocks dented the technology sector, led by Intel, down 1 per cent at $22.08 and Applied Materials, off 1.5 per cent at $18.93.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 13,633.08, its 25th record close this year. Caterpillar, up 3.6 per cent at $78.48, led gainers in the Dow.Healthcare stocks Merck, down 1.3 per cent at $52.71, and Pfizer, off 0.5 per cent at $27.41, both weighed on the blue-chip benchmark.A bright spot in the healthcare sector was Biogen Idec, up 5.9 per cent at $52.13 after it approved a $3bn buy-back of its stocks.With attention focused on employment, inflation and manufacturing reports due on Friday, stocks generally traded in a narrow range.“All eyes are on the employment report,” said Mr Ablin. “The labour market has been sustaining the consumer in the face of higher gas prices and weak housing.”On Wednesday, ADP said it expects 97,000 new private sector jobs were created in May. The ADP report which excludes government workers suggests payrolls will be around 117,000 this month, below the current consensus call of 135,000.Traders believe a payroll gain of at least 100,000 jobs will be enough to soothe concerns that the labour market is faltering.Mr Kastner said investors were hoping that capital investment spending would take over from consumer spending in pulling up economic growth and take over from consumer spending in the months ahead. He also believed corporate earnings were likely to fall this year, pressuring stock valuations.Merger and acquisition activity on Wednesday was led by the news that CDW the technology retailer had agreed to a $7.3bn private equity buy-out.InterContinental Exchange struck a $665m deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the hope of boosting the chances of its hostile bid for CBOT Holdings.At this juncture, the CBOT has agreed to be bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ICE hopes its deal with CBOE will resolve a legal dispute between the options exchange and CBOT, which argues that some of its members are entitled to an equity stake in CBOE.Shares in ICE rose 0.65 per cent to $148.71, CBOT shares gained 2.4 per cent to $197.62, while CME was up 0.4 per cent at $527.85.In other deal news, eSpeed, an electronic bond trading platform controlled by Cantor Fitzgerald, said it would buy BGC Partners, Cantor’s privately held brokerage unit, in a $1.3bn deal. Shares in eSpeed rose 0.4 per cent to $9.23.In earnings news, Coldwater Creek reported a stronger than forecast first quarter profit and the retailer rose 16.6 per cent to $24.37.Pulte Homes said it would cut 16 per cent of its workforce, and shares fell 0.1 per cent to $27.41.Shares in Coca-Cola were up 1.6 per cent at $53.05. Citigroup upgraded the beverage maker to a “buy” with a $59 price target.NiSource fell 7.8 per cent to $22.07 after the utility said it had concluded talks without selling its Indiana electricity assets, but would still consider spinning off that unit. Utility stocks have recently pared solid gains this year – the S&P utility sector is up 12.8 per cent in 2007 – as investors have become concerned at the sector’s low dividend yield as compared with rising bond yields.“Utilities have run a little further beyond reasonable valuations,” said Mr Ablin.Verisign was 5.3 per cent higher at $29.43 after chief executive Stratton Sclavos resigned. The internet infrastructure company’s stock is up 22.1 per cent this year on the back of expansion and diversification of its operations.
634;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-05-30T04:36:26Z;ICE signs exclusive deal with CBOE;;The Intercontinental Exchange has signed an exclusive deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange in a move which could boost the appeal of its unsolicited bid for the Chicago Board of Trade.The ICE-CBOE pact, announced on Wednesday, aims to end the long-running legal battle between the Board of Trade and the city’s options exchange, which has coloured the two rival bids for the CBOT.The Atlanta-based ICE is seeking to break up the agreed merger between the CBOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange with its own all-stock offer, and the deal with the CBOE is the latest part in a complex puzzle of interlocking relationships in the fast-growing global derivatives sector.The CBOE is the largest US options exchange by volume, and its rapid growth and product innovation has made it a target as the 34-year old group prepares for its own initial public offering next year.The CBOT argues that some of its members are entitled to an equity stake in the options group, which was spun out of the Board of Trade in 1973 and is valued at $2.3bn based on current prices for its 931 seats.The options exchange maintains a CME-CBOT deal invalidates any such claims – though this is refuted by the two Chicago futures exchanges – and the issue is due to come before a Delaware court on Wednesday.The ICE has leveraged the Chicago conflict in its pursuit of the Board of Trade, a deal that would marry its own energy and commodities businesses with the CBOT’s positions in financial and agricultural futures and options.While CBOT directors continue to recommend the CME deal – which was sweetened earlier this month – its terms put it below both the ICE offer and the CBOT share price.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of the ICE, opened discussions with his opposite number at the CBOE when he launched the unsolicited offer for the CBOT in March.The deal expected on Wednesday would see CBOT members receive $500,000 in cash or convertible stock for each so-called “exercise right” held at the CBOE, if the CBOT is eventually acquired by the ICE, though the deal could be overturned in court. The ICE and the CBOE would share the $665.5m cost equally between them.The ICE and the CBOE also agreed a commercial partnership to develop and distribute products on their respective electronic and floor-based trading platforms.The agreement comes ahead of the first open meeting between Mr Sprecher and CBOT members, scheduled for Thursday.CBOT’s influential membership remains split over the merits of the competing offers and the option of remaining independent, but analysts said the meeting would raise further concerns among Merc executives that it might fail to win backing for its agreed bid.Some members note that the CME – which has not closed a takeover despite the flurry of consolidation in the exchanges sector – has had nine months to broker a settlement with the CBOE, but has opted to pursue a settlement through the courts.Pressure from CBOT members has already forced CME to boost the terms agreed last October after the value of its all-stock offer fell 30 per cent below that of ICE’s proposal.CBOT directors have intensified talks with members and shareholders in recent days ahead of a July 9 vote on the proposed CME deal, with registration for applicable shares closing on Tuesday.While CME offer continues to lag both the ICE proposal and the CBOT share price, its value is expected to rise if it secures clearance for the deal from the justice department. A decision is expected as early as next week.The regulator has been examining the all-Chicago deal since last December amid a furious lobbying effort by some investment banks and intermediaries, which claim the enlarged exchange would damage competition.
635;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-05-24T17:06:14Z;ICE gears up to resume battle for CBOT;;The Intercontinental Exchange will meet members of the Chicago Board of Trade next week in an effort to win backing for its $11bn takeover bid and break up the rival deal with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.CBOT’s influential membership remains split over the merits of the competing offers and the option of remaining independent, but analysts said the meeting would raise further concerns among Merc executives that it might fail to win backing for its agreed bid.Pressure from Board of Trade members forced CME to sweeten the terms agreed last October after the value of its all-stock offer fell 30 per cent below that of ICE’s proposal.Jeff Sprecher, founder and chief executive of ICE, has held meetings with individual CBOT members and users, seeking to assuage concerns that the smaller exchange lacked the technology and infrastructure to handle volumes at the Board of Trade.CBOT directors continue to recommend a deal with CME, which would create the world’s largest futures exchange and regain a position challenged by recent deals involving Deutsche Börse and the recently-formed NYSE Euronext.ICE cancelled a meeting with CBOT members in March at the request of its target’s directors. CME executives subsequently met Board of Trade members.”For an exchange that has championed transparency, integrity and fairness of its markets, it is about time those values were applied to the ICE’s interest in acquiring it as well,” said John Lothian, head of electronic trading at The Price Group and publisher of a respected industry newsletter.CBOT directors have intensified talks with members and shareholders in recent days ahead of a July 9 vote on the proposed CME deal, with registration for applicable shares due to close on May 29.While CME offer continues to lag both the ICE proposal and the CBOT share price, its value is expected to rise if it secures clearance for the deal from the justice department. A decision is expected as early as next week.The regulator has been examining the all-Chicago deal since last December amid a furious lobbying effort by some investment banks and intermediaries, which claim the enlarged exchange would damage competition. The Chicago exchanges said they expected regulatory approval for their proposed deal before the July 9 meeting, though are also contesting a lawsuit from one shareholder calling for the vote to be delayed because CBOT accepted an offer lower than both the ICE proposal and its market value.The Chicago exchanges also need to find a solution to the long-running spat with the Chicago Board Options Exchange over CBOT members’ so-called exercise rights, which could provide Board of Trade investors with a stake in the CBOE’s upcoming initial public offering. A court hearing on that issue is also scheduled for next week.
636;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-05-23T22:43:02Z;ICE steps up CBOT takeover bid;;The Intercontinental Exchange has hired a high-profile proxy firm to press the merits of its takeover bid for the Chicago Board of Trade in a sign that it is prepared to appeal directly to shareholders with a deal now valued at $11.3bn.The move comes as CBOT directors launch focus groups to back their continued recommendation of a takeover by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, whose all-stock offer still lags behind the ICE proposal by $1.6bn in spite of being raised this month.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of the ICE, has retained Innisfree M&A, a proxy group whose clients include AirTran, a US low-cost airline pursuing a takeover of rival Midwest, according to two people close to the situation.This comes ahead of any direct move to go over the heads of the CBOT board, which maintains the Merc offer is “superior” because of synergies and long-term growth prospects. The ICE and Innisfree declined to comment.The value of the ICE – and its offer for the CBOT – has been boosted in recent days amid speculation it could be targeted by NYSE Euronext.ICE stunned executives at both Chicago exchanges with its offer for CBOT on March 15, upsetting the CME’s plan to create the world’s largest futures exchange.While CBOT directors reaffirmed backing for the CME deal ahead of a shareholders’ meeting on July 9, the discount to the ICE offer and the CBOT share price has widened.The ICE and its advisers continue to hold meetings with individual CBOT shareholders and users, seeking to assuage concerns that the smaller exchange lacks the technology and infrastructure to handle volumes at the Board of Trade.Mr Sprecher remains keen to hold a briefing with CBOT shareholders and members after cancelling an address in March at the request of the Board of Trade.Charlie Carey, CBOT chairman, recently told the Financial Times it would not oppose such a meeting.While the ICE wants to avoid a hostile move on the CBOT, the widening gap between the competing offers and the hiring of a proxy firm intensifies pressure on the CME.The Merc continues to enjoy rapid organic growth, but has failed to close any acquisitions at a time when rivals have expanded.
637;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;CME tries sweetener to sway CBOT bid;;The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Friday sweetened its bid for the Chicago Board of Trade to about $9.95bn in an effort to head off a competing offer and avoid losing ground in the consolidation of the global derivatives sector.CME executives insisted the 16 per cent rise in its all-stock offer was driven mainly by increased synergies from a combination that would create the world’s largest futures exchange.The enhanced terms still leave the CME deal, which retained its recommendation from the CBOT board, trading below both the Board of Trade share price and the unsolicited offer from the smaller Intercontinental Exchange made in March, now valued at $10.58bn.On Friday, Charlie Carey, CBOT chairman, told the Financial Times that the new CME offer was superior to the ICE bid because of its long-term strategic fit and synergies. However, some CBOT members suggest the CME could have to revise the terms again to secure investor approval at a vote on July 9, amid growing calls for the Board of Trade to retain its independence and seek a better deal next year.The CME, which had previously resisted calls to raise its offer, is under pressure to join in industry consolidation. In the past it has failed to secure deals in both the US and Europe while rivals such as Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext expanded through acquisitions and targeted an increased share of the US and global market.CME shares gained 7.7 per cent on Friday, lifted by its suggestion that regulators would approve the all-Chicago tie-up before the July vote. Craig Donohue, chief executive, told the FT that the justice department probe was “substantially complete” amid furious lobbying against the proposed deal from some leading banks and brokers, who claimed it would reduce competition.Mr Donohue said recent efforts by NYSE Euronext and the ICE to establish their own futures clearing houses showed there was healthy competition in clearing and settlement, a key part of the antitrust probe.The ICE on Friday said its existing proposal offered “greater immediate and long-term value” than the CME bid and Mr Carey said the Atlanta-based exchange could follow the example of the Merc last month and address Board of Trade members on the merits of its offer.
638;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-05-11T20:52:38Z;Wall St rallies on inflation data;;Wall Street rebounded on Friday, and that enabled the S&P 500 index to narrowly maintain its weekly winning streak that began at the end of March.A sharp sell-off on Thursday saw the major benchmarks suffer their largest one-day decline in two months following weaker-than-expected chain store sales.Investors were also worried that inflation concerns at the Federal Reserve could impede a rate cut later this year.Analysts described the pullback as a healthy correction and, indeed, buyers emerged on Friday, buoyed by an unexpected cooling in core production inflation for April.Moreover, the continued run of inconclusive economic data appears to be putting a ceiling on long-term interest rates, allowing the continued availability of relatively cheap financing, fuelling the boom in mergers and private equity buy-outs.Doug Peta, equity strategist at J&W Seligman, said: “There is a powerful structural force between buyouts and robust stock buybacks by companies that is reducing the supply of outstanding shares in the market.”He said that until there was an event that forced corporate bond rates to rise from current historically low levels compared with Treasury yields, “the acquisition boom will swamp economic fundamentals”.As stocks rose on Friday, the S&P edged out of negative territory for the week.At late-afternoon, the S&P 500 index closed up 1 per cent at 1,505.85, for a gain of 0.015 per cent this week.Technolgy and materials stocks were a bright spot among the main industry groups in the S&P. In contrast, healthcare and consumer staples stocks were the worst-performing stocks during the week.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.1 per cent to close at 2,562.10, but lost 0.4 per cent this week.The Russell 2000 index of small companies was 0.4 per cent lower this week, after setting a record close on Wednesday.Blue chips maintained their recent streak, and on Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.8 per cent to 13,326.22, a rise of 0.5 per cent since Monday. The Dow set its 21st record close this year at 13,362.87 on Wednesday.Deal activity this week was led by Alcoa’s hostile $27bn bid for Alcan, its Canadian aluminium producer rival.Alcoa rose 6.6 per cent to $38.03, and is up 27 per cent in 2007, while Alcan had soared 31.2 per cent to $80.05 for the week.In other deals, Armor Holdings agreed to be bought by UK defence contractor BAE Systems for $4.1bn. Armor rose 3.7 per cent to $85.17 this week, and is up 55 per cent so far this year.Deal chatter in the steel industry pushed shares in AK Steel 14.9 per cent higher to $35.59, while US Steel posted a 6.4 per cent gain to $111.08.Countrywide Financial rose 8.1 per cent to $41.08 this week as the mortgage lender is seen as a likely buyout candidate in the wake of the recent deal for student lender SLM.Trading activity before the recent $25.2bn buyout of SLM, also known as Sallie Mae, was the latest target of regulators as they investigated suspicious option trades. SLM’s shares fell 1.2 per cent to $54.15 this week.On Friday, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange made a revised bid for CBOT Holdings, the rival derivatives exchange.CBOT’s board accepted the new bid valued at about $9.2bn, and rejected the competing unsolicited offer made by the Intercontinental Exchange of about $10.1bn launched in March. Shares in CME jumped 7.7 per cent to $536.30 on Friday, while CBOT rose 3.8 per cent to $201.35 and ICE rallied 4.2 per cent to $140.55.Hopes for News Corp’s recent $5bn bid for Dow Jones receded this week, as Dow’s share price slipped 4.8 per cent to $53.10, below the $60-a-share offer.News Corp was 1.2 per cent lower at $23.30 this week, and it reported a 6.2 per cent rise in profits for its fiscal third quarter, meeting estimates.Shares in Yahoo lost 3 per cent to $30.05 this week as hopes for a merger with Microsoft faded.Cisco weighed on the Nasdaq this week. Its fiscal third quarter profits rose 34 per cent from a year ago, but the company disappointed investors with its revenue guidance.The computer network operator fell 4.6 per cent to $26.63.In other earnings news, Whole Foods’ first quarter profits fell 11 per cent year on year, missing estimates amid slowing sales growth and rising costs. Shares in the organic food retailer slid 9.5 per cent to $40.97.This week, same-store sales figures for April arrived and 85 per cent of retailers missed their forecasts. The sector was hit hard, with shares in Jones Apparel down 5.7 per cent at $28.85.A notable laggard this week was Dendreon. The drugmaker plunged 68.5 per cent to $6.11, after the Food and Drug Administration sought more information about its prostate cancer vaccine.Shares in Johnson & Johnson and Amgen slid 3.4 per cent to $62.27 and 11.7 per cent to $56.30, respectively, after an FDA panel said their anti-anaemia drugs should face further restrictions.Barr Pharmaceuticals rallied 10.2 per cent this week to $54.83 as the company reiterating its earnings outlook on Wednesday.
639;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-05-11T18:27:43Z;Battle for CBOT;;"The Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s latest salvo in the fight for its crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, does not look like being a killer blow. But it raises the pressure on Intercontinental Exchange, which upset CME’s plans with a counterbid for CBOT in March. For all the bluster about strategic merits outweighing mere price considerations, CME could not ignore the 22 per cent discount that had opened up between its own offer and ICE’s prior to yesterday. Rumblings that anti-trust watchdogs were intensifying scrutiny of the proposed CME-CBOT tie-up raised doubts about execution.CME’s new bid does not close the gap entirely; it is still between 6 and 7 per cent below ICE’s implied offer and CBOT’s actual share price. Moreover, CME has in effect cut the cash element for CBOT’s shareholders. Under the old terms, they could elect to receive up to $3bn in aggregate, in place of CME stock. Now, they will potentially share in a $3.5bn share buy-back post-completion: worth $1.2bn based on pro-rata ownership of the combined company of 35 per cent.Still, when all the combatants are trading on 35 times 2007 earnings or more, using paper as ammo makes more sense. And the underlying message of CME’s bid is strong. Backed by CBOT’s reaffirmation of the merits of the deal, it signals confidence that the deal will not be blocked by regulators. Combining CBOT with CME, rather than ICE, makes more sense due to greater overlap and existing clearing links.ICE could always raise its bid further, but its own shareholders already face being diluted down to less than 50 per cent ownership of the combined entity under its existing offer terms. That, at least, should mean ICE would not be afraid to court suitors for itself if it does end up losing the battle for CBOT. That ICE’s own shares rose on the news of this apparent setback suggests some investors are already positioning for this eventuality."
640;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;CBOT investors cool on bids;;The fate of the Chicago Board of Trade was in the balance on Thursday night as shareholders increased pressure on the second-largest US futures exchange to walk away from two competing bids at current prices.People familiar with the situation said the CBOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, its larger cross-town rival, were trying to reach an agreement on a higher offer that would satisfy shareholders in the CBOT.Last week, the value of the agreed deal with the CME fell to 31 per cent below the more recent unsolicited offer from the IntercontinentalExchange, now worth $10.6bn.The value of both all-stock offers has see-sawed since the ICE sought to break up the all-Chicago combination, agreed last October – a deal that promised to create the world’s largest futures exchange.The slumping value of the CME deal – weighed by weak April volumes – has encouraged some CBOT members to push for it to retain its independence.They argue that the franchise has been strengthened by the launch of side-by-side electronic trading of agricultural futures last August. While trading of financial futures, mainly Treasury bonds, dominates volume at the CBOT, volatility in the corn and soyabean markets has helped push agricultural dealing up by more than 50 per cent in the past year. More than half of the deals are now made electronically and carry fatter margins than financial futures.The recent takeover of the International Securities Exchange by Deutsche Börse’s Eurex subsidiary has also encouraged some CBOT members – who retain 80 per cent of its shares – that frothiness will remain in the exchange sector.While they recognise the stock would fall if they rejected both offers at a July 9 shareholders meeting, some say the drop would be small and overtaken by future gains and the emergence of another offer.The CME would have to raise its offer by 40 per cent to reach what members view as a knock-out level of $2.10-$2.20 a share. It has the right to change its terms up to July 9, even if the CBOT withdraws its recommendation.The CBOT would avoid the $240m break-up fee if shareholders rejected the CME proposal at the meeting but the Board of Trade is barred from entertaining another takeover bid for a year after that.CBOT directors have so far retained their recommendation of the CME deal while they evaluate the rival ICE offer.All of the exchanges declined to comment.
641;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-05-08T11:07:51Z;Exchange clearing;;The back office is moving to front and centre. In the battle for leadership in exchanges, the hitherto Cinderella activity of clearing has emerged at the vanguard. Clearing – acting as a central counterparty to both sides of a trade – encourages total strangers to buy and sell with one another. That has become more important as the range and volume of contracts, particularly derivatives, traded over-the-counter have exploded.It is no accident that Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is leading the charge. The US energy trading platform plans to create a global clearing service for its users. That follows its acquisition of the New York Board of Trade – bringing with it in-house clearing expertise – completed in January. At a tactical level, ICE’s move can be interpreted as a means of strengthening its hand in its battle against the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to take over the Chicago Board of Trade.There is more for which to play, particularly in energy. In the 1990s, oil, gas and power were traded between a relatively small number of industrial companies, most with robust credit ratings of their own. Those that did not eventually came to rely on Enron as a de facto clearing house. Enron’s collapse left the market bereft, as well as prompting a lot of ex-traders to set up operations of their own, helping to fuel the current boom in trading volume.As the big commodities exchanges compete more aggressively – look at how ICE barged its way into the West Texas Intermediate oil contract – clearing helps to attract and hold liquidity. A unified clearing operation, enabling the netting of positions across products and geographies, reduces margin calls for traders. And until regulators force a more competitive market in OTC futures clearing, there is the simple attraction of economics: net profit margins are estimated at 50 per cent or more.
642;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-04-30T22:53:39Z;ICE’s CBOT offer raises stakes for CME;;The pressure on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to sweeten its agreed bid for the Chicago Board of Trade intensified on Monday as the premium in the rival offer from the Intercontinental Exchange touched $1.5bn for the first time.The Board of Trade last week said it was nearing the end of its review of the ICE proposal, with some directors continuing to push the CME to at least match the terms proposed by the smaller, Atlanta-based ICE.The CBOT continues to recommend a combination with its cross-town rival, but the board is expected to outline its stance as early as this week, in spite of emphasising that price will not be the sole driver.The CME hopes to create the world’s largest derivatives exchange by adding the Board of Trade’s strength in financial and commodity products to its interest-rate, equity and commodity futures and options.But the rival ICE proposal – which would add its energy and over-the-counter portfolio to the CBOT franchise – now commands a premium of 17.5 per cent over the CME bid, based on Monday’s movements in the all-share bids. The gap started at 10.5 per cent when the ICE offer was announced in March.CME executives have derided the premium as “illusory”, questioning the ability of the ICE to integrate its target and provide clearing and settlement services for the enlarged entity. They have continued integration work with the Board of Trade, and rescheduled shareholder meetings for July 9 to vote on the deal.But the agreed deal has yet to be approved by antitrust regulators, and the ICE has been able to exploit concern from some large banks about the pricing power of an enlarged Chicago exchange to win support for its own proposal. Exchange experts said this reflects concern among institutions about the CME’s expansion.ICE shares closed at $127, valuing its offer at $9.56bn, a 16 per cent premium to the CME’s $8.23bn bid.
643;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Deutsche Börse lands in US via ISE;;"Eurex has not sat idly by and watched US rivals steal its number one slot among global derivatives exchanges.With the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Intercontinental Exchange still vying for control of the Chicago Board of Trade, Eurex – a joint venture between Deutsche Börse and Switzerland’s SWX exchange – yesterday sneaked through an acquisition of its own.The deal to buy the International Securities Exchange moves the German-controlled group into the fast-growing realm of US options, after an unsuccessful foray into US futures.A 70 per cent stake in Eurex US was sold off to Man Financial, the UK futures broker, last year, after the unit had tried, and failed, to break the US futures market off its own bat.The ISE deal was a surprise to investors on Monday, who sent ISE stock up 45 per cent but a logical consummation of a long-standing relationship with Eurex – the two had come close to a deal five years ago.It marks the culmination of a US expansion effort for Eurex that goes back to the start of the decade.Among the biggest stumbling blocks for Eurex – and its rival, Euronext Liffe which made a similar foray into the US at the same time – was that futures products in the US are not “fungible”.That is, each exchange clears its own contracts; and a contract cannot be opened on one exchange and closed on another.In effect, neither European exchange could ever attract the liquidity it needed to launch a credible competitive threat.But the US options market is a different animal. Options are regulated, like equities, by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is committed to promoting competition in order to cut costs for consumers.In the US, options trading is fungible, with all exchanges clearing through the user-owned Options Clearing Corporation.The ISE itself is a creature designed to shake up what once was a cosy options market. It was the first to offer electronic dealing.Moreover, it was a trailblazer that burst the historic business model in which the various options exchanges agreed which contracts they would list, each agreeing not to offer competing products.Within a few years, its competitors moved to electronic trading as well. But in the meantime, spreads on options tightened, cutting costs and bringing increasing liquidity to the market overall.Options trading is the fastest growing securities segment in the US market. Overall, volumes are up 22 per cent for the first quarter of 2007.Indeed, both the NYSE and Nasdaq have announced plans to open their own options platforms, increasing the competition.However, analysts note that the recent acquisition by NYSE of Paris-based Euronext and its London-based futures subsidiary, Liffe, may be behind the Börse’s move.NYSE itself has been rumoured as a possible bidder for the ISE, although it has said it is not eager for any further acquisitions right now. However, with its acquisition, the Börse is entering what analysts believe is the most fiercely contested business operated by US exchanges today.That view has led several analysts to question the price being paid, a 47 per cent premium to where the ISE’s shares closed at the end of last week.“They appear to be paying a whacking great premium,” said Andrew Mitchell, analyst at Fox Pitt Kelton, who follows Deutsche Börse from London.“The more difficult thing to gauge is whether that is justified.”If the Börse can use the ISE platform, for instance, to launch products currently traded on its Eurex platform, it could see significant volume growth.Moreover, analysts are concerned that profit margins may be eroded by the roll-out of “penny pricing”, a move inspired by US regulators.Penny pricing means reducing the bid/offer spread on options contracts, which had been as wide as 5 cents or more, to a penny."
644;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-04-30T22:19:37Z;ICE plans to set up clearing unit;;The Intercontinental Exchange said on Monday it plans to launch a European clearing house to work with its US clearing operations.The move by the Atlanta-based energy and soft commodity market is a further sign of the global ambitions of securities and derivatives marketplaces and the potential they see in providing services to over-the-counter derivatives markets.It is a blow for LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest clearing house, which made an estimated $50m in fees from ICE customers last year.The US group entered the clearing business this year when it acquired the New York Clearing Corporation as part of its $1bn purchase of the New York Board of Trade.LCH.Clearnet announced fee cuts for ICE users in March, in a move thought to be aimed at encouraging customers to put pressure on the ICE to keep clearing its London trades through LCH.Clearnet.But the ICE responded by raising transaction fees, keeping the benefits of LCH.Clearnet’s tariff reductions to itself. Monday’s announcement suggests the ICE plans to phase out the European clearer’s role.The new unit, ICE Clear Europe, to be based in London, is preparing an application to the UK’s Financial Services Authority to become a recognised clearing house, and is scheduled to begin clearing energy futures and over-the-counter contracts in July 2008.The ICE estimates that it could make $25m to $30m in fees for clearing services in 2008, and clearing revenues in excess of $60m in 2009.ICE is also competing with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to buy the CBOT Group. ICE’s $10bn offer for the owner of the Chicago Board of Trade in March took the futures industry by surprise, raising the prospect of a bidding war.Jeff Sprecher, founder and chief executive of the ICE, has suggested that regulators could block the all-Chicago plan to create the world’s largest derivatives exchange.Analysts see any boost to the ICE’s clearing capability as raising the credibility of its bid for CBOT.
645;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-04-30T20:42:36Z;Deutsche Börse to buy NY-based ISE;;Deutsche Börse on Monday announced plans to buy the International Securities Exchange for $2.8bn in cash, extending the group’s US foothold with the addition of an options platform and a fledgling equities business.The agreement with the German group’s Eurex derivatives arm was expected to trigger another potential bidding war in the US derivatives sector, despite a price viewed as rich by analysts, with the recently-formed NYSE Euronext seen as a possible suitor.Deutsche Börse had appeared to be left without an obvious partner after losing out to the NYSE in the protracted battle for Paris-based Euronext at a time when Chicago’s two largest derivatives exchanges had agreed to merge, before the recent counterbid for the Chicago Board of Trade by the Intercontinental Exchange.The frenzy of consolidation in the global exchange sector is driven by the increasing appetite for risk management and speculation tools by global investors, with exchange operators looking to maximise the scale and breadth of products offered through their platforms to secure economies of scale..The New York-based ISE is the second-largest US options platform by volume after the Chicago Board Options Exchange - another potential NYSE target - with double-digit percentage growth rates exceeding even expansion in the futures business. New rules aimed at bringing spreads on options trading to a penny - currently being tested - are expected to help boost volumes even furtherThe arrival of Eurex - whose expansion in US derivatives foundered two years ago - comes amid growing interest by many exchanges in the options sector. The NYSE is already expanding its Arca business, while the Nasdaq has targetted a 20 per cent market share through a green-field launch or an acquisition, having recently held talks with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.The ISE transformed the US market with its launch as an all-electronic exchange, forcing its five existing rivals to follow suit and abandon all or part of their existing floor-based business models.Eurex and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange both held talks with the ISE three years ago, before it decided to become the first US options exchange to seek an initial public offering. The Board of Trade also sought a merger with the CBOE last year, with the options exchange now planning its own IPO as early as 2008. CBOE seats prices reached a new record on Monday amid expectations of renewed interest in the exchange or a higher potential flotation price.ISE shares rose 46 per cent during Monday trading, peaking just short of the $67.50 a share being offered by Eurex, which is jointly owned by Deutsche Börse and the SWX Swiss Exchange. The offer represents a 48 per cent premium to last Friday’s close.Deutsche Börse said the agreed combination would overtake NYSE Euronext as the largest transatlantic derivatives exchange, with 2.1bn contracts a day based on 2006 data. It would retain the ISE brand and regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.The market leadership of the ISE in US equity options would add to the strength of Eurex in interest-rate futures and, increasingly, equity-based futures.
646;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-04-20T18:24:49Z;Concern over Nigerian polls lifts oil prices;;London’s InterContinental Exchange is to launch a contract for Middle Eastern sour crude oil futures to compete with the contract that will trade on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange. The DME intends to start its contract in June, but ICE, which sponsors the Brent sweet crude contract, said it would launch on May 21, pending UK regulatory approval.Oil prices rose Friday as traders’ attention turned to Nigeria’s presidential elections this weekend and the possibility of disruptions to supplies from the world‘s eighth largest crude exporter.ICE June Brent rose 39 cents to $66.33 a barrel, down 3.4 per cent this week. Brent came under pressure on reports from Nigeria that Shell had resumed limited production from the 380,000 b/d Forcados field, although the company did not confirm this. However, dealers were concerned that if Nigeria’s presidential elections were tainted by allegations of vote rigging, further violence could affect supplies.Nymex May West Texas Intermediate contract, expiring Friday, gained $1.05 at $62.88 a barrel, down 1.2 per cent this week. June WTI added 44 cents at $63.76 Friday.US gasoline stocks have fallen for 10 consecutive weeks as supplies tighten ahead of the summer driving season. Nymex May RBOB gasoline rose just under 2 cents to $2.1079 a gallon Friday but fell 3.3 per cent over the week.Gold rose 1 per cent to $691.80 a troy ounce this week, supported by dollar weakness and news of progress in Iran’s nuclear programme.Platinum gained 3.2 per cent at $1,313 a troy ounce, helped by renewed fund interest following plans by Zurich Cantonal Bank and ETF Securities to launch platinum exchange traded funds. Two major platinum producers voiced concerns, fearing the ETFs could cause a price spike and damage jewellery demand.Base metals displayed resilience despite concerns that China might be forced to raise interest rates to cool rapid economic growth.Copper rose 3.3 per cent this week to $7,960 a tonne, supported by concerns over supply disruptions at the giant Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia, where workers have threatened to extend their protest for a month if welfare benefit demands are not met.After hitting a contract record of $15,200 on Wednesday, tin fell 4.3 per cent this week to $13,750 a tonne after the Indonesian government approved export permits for two smelters this year.Nickel added 5.2 per cent to $48,900 a tonne as available stocks remain critically low at around 2,900 tonnes.May wheat futures rose 4.9 per cent to $5.02 a bushel in Chicago this week on reports of frost damage to US planting. Global wheat stocks stand at near record lows and concerns are mounting about drought affecting the Australian harvest.Wet weather has slowed spring corn planting but conditions are expected to improve in the midwest in the next few days. May corn fell 1.5 per cent to $3.63½ a bushel this week.
647;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-04-20T18:24:04Z;USFE seeks new friends on MySpace;;The US Futures Exchange is 99 years old and male, at least according to its new MySpace page in what market experts view as the first move by the derivatives sector into the world of social networking.The details provided by the Chicago-based exchange which, like its peers, prides itself on the transparency of its markets, could just catch the eye of regulators. The USFE is in fact less than one year old, formed in late 2006 when Man Group took over the US exchange formed by Eurex, the derivatives platform controlled by Deutsche Börse. Its sex was previously undisclosed.The appearance of the USFE on a site beloved of teenagers and musicians comes as it launched its inaugural contract on Friday, based on the outcome of the two-way battle for control of the Chicago Board of Trade.The ”binary” contract is viewed as an opportunistic move ahead of the formal launch of the USFE, target retail investors with the exchange’s initial product offerings before widening to attract institutions and hedge funds.Binary futures offer an all-or-nothing pay-out on a range of defined outcomes, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Intercontinental Exchange winning the CBOT bid battle or the acquisition of CBOT by a third party.The USFE has been working on its Myspace page for a number of weeks and was first reported by John Lothian, a Chicago-based trader who publishes a widely-followed blog and newsletter. “For the longest time I had only one [MySpace] friend, said Mr Lothian who, like many in the sector, was previously unaware of the social networking site before signing up to view the USFE offering.Mr Lothian is now joined by 13 other friends on the USFE page.
648;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-04-19T01:02:25Z;DTCC to handle Turquoise settlement;;A group of leading investment banks intent on setting up a pan-European trading platform to rival the likes of the London Stock Exchange and NYSE-Euronext on Wednesday appointed a company to provide settlement services for the new venture.The initiative, which is known as “Turquoise” and is backed by seven banks, including Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, has selected EuroCCP, a European subsidiary of the US-based Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, to provide clearance and settlement services for the new venture.Consolidation has been sweeping the global exchanges sector in the face of competition from start-ups like BATS and Instinet in the US and Virt-X in Europe. Exchanges are also under pressure to provide cheaper dealing costs.The NYSE bought Euronext at the end of last year in the first transatlantic exchange deal and the Intercontinental Exchange is trying to break up a planned merger between the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.The LSE fought off Nasdaq to retain its independence but has been forced to cut costs for users in order to keep their business.The seven investment banks, which also include Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, UBS and Citigroup, currently account for about half of all equity trading volumes in Europe.Total trading costs on Turquoise are expected to be less than half the cost on traditional exchanges when the platform launches at the end of this year or the beginning of next year.The platform is designed to take advantage of a European Union directive which comes into force in November and will slash the cost of trading in Europe, traditionally higher than in the US.DTCC, the biggest provider of settlement and clearance services in the US, is setting up EuroCCP to provide clearance and settlement services for Turqoise. The venture will be based in London.A spokesman for Turquoise said the banks are expected to select a trading platform “in the near future” before naming key executives to launch the project.DTCC is owned by its users, which include banks and brokers in the US who trade equities, bonds and derivatives. It does not offer settlement or clearing for futures or options.
649;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-04-17T22:10:12Z;ICE starts due diligence on CBOT;;The Intercontinental Exchange has started formal due diligence on its proposed $9.3bn purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade, although it has yet to schedule a formal meeting with members of the second-largest US derivatives platform.The Atlanta-based ICE is seeking to break up an agreed merger between the CBOT and the larger Chicago Mercantile Exchange with its own higher offer. The bid premium hovered at about 10 per cent on Tuesday.The Chicago exchanges postponed a shareholder and member vote on their proposal, which is still backed by the CBOT board, from April 4 until July 9. The CBOT is continuing to hold talks with the ICE, but had previously engaged in only an “exchange of information” with its rival suitor.The launch of formal due diligence is not expected to lead to an amended ICE offer but would pave the way for the exchange to seek a meeting with CBOT members, who still control about 80 per cent of its shares according to people familiar with the talks.The ICE and the CBOT declined to comment, though the CBOT has insisted its definitive agreement with the CME allowed it to examine competing offers in a fair and balanced manner.Executives from the CME addressed CBOT members last month and in spite of savaging the rival offer and promoting the benefits of its own deal, which would create the world’s largest futures exchange, many members have pressed the CME to match the ICE offer.CME executives have dismissed the ICE premium as “illusory”, questioning the claimed synergies and raising doubts about its rival’s ability to integrate the CBOT. The all-Chicago proposal is still being probed by US antitrust officials.ICE executives could face more questions about plans for the CBOT’s remaining open-outcry business after complaints this week about the treatment of floor traders at the New York Board of Trade, which the ICE acquired this year.The ICE specialises in all-electronic trading of energy and over-the-counter products, and has been converting the Nybot, which focuses on soft commodities such as sugar, to more screen-based business.The exchange last week lifted a fee on electronic trading at the Nybot, which had helped preserve the smaller floor business.“We felt like we needed to warn the traders in Chicago not to trust ICE’s management when they claim they want to protect floor trading,” Dennis Lepre, a veteran Nybot trader who is organising the opposition, told the New York Post. The group plan to highlight their position in Chicago newspaper adverts this week.The ICE said it supported both screen and floor-based trading so long as there was demand from clients.CBOT shares closed at $192.90 on Tuesday, valuing it at $10.2bn, with the all-stock offers from the ICE and the CME valued at $9.8bn and $8.9bn respectively.
650;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-04-02T21:14:26Z;Volumes soar at CBOT and CME;;Chicago’s two dominant futures exchanges handled record trading volumes during March as rising volatility combined with more electronic trading by clients.The Chicago Board of Trade – the subject of a two-way bid battle between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange – Monday reported a 30 per cent rise in March volumes to an average of 11.7m contracts a day.That lifted the overall first-quarter total by 24 per cent and provided fresh clues for valuing the world’s third- largest futures exchange.The CME, which trails only Eurex by volumes, is likely to have overtaken its German-Swiss rival with a 30 per cent quarterly gain in trading volumes and a 45 per cent rise in March.The CME used its monthly report to stress its organic growth and ability to handle sharply higher trading volumes as it awaits a CBOT board review of the surprise counterbid from the ICE.A 0.6 per cent share price rise in CME helped narrow the gap with the richer ICE offer for the CBOT to $12.37 a share, or about 6.8 per cent. The ICE reports its March volumes Tuesday.The Atlanta-based ICE says the CME’s offer undervalues the CBOT and underplays its growth potential – claims denied by the CME – though Board of Trade members have indicated the larger Chicago exchange should raise its bid.The all-Chicago deal was agreed last October and the Board of Trade’s agricultural volumes have been a key driver of growth since, led in part by uncertainty in the corn market where prices have reached 10-year highs.Corn future volumes grew 67 per cent in the 12 months to March 31, helped by the introduction of electronic trading last August. Options volumes rose 153 per cent.While interest-rate products remain the dominant source of earnings for the Board of Trade, overall agricultural volumes outpaced financial products and also provided the highest margins – in terms of rate per contract – according to data for February, the latest month available.The Merc traded an average of 6.5m daily contracts while average volumes on its Globex electronic platform climbed 40 per cent to 4.8m.The CME provides clearing services for Board of Trade and lists contracts for the New York Mercantile Exchange on Globex, which also reached record levels.The Merc has questioned the ability of the ICE to handle the Board of Trade’s rising volumes as the Atlanta exchange expands its own in-house clearing system.
651;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Plenty of life left in exchanges battle;;"The gloves are off as the rival suitors for the Chicago Board of Trade exchange increasingly hard-hitting comments about the merits of their respective offers, whose differential has narrowed from as high as $1.3bn to $840m on Wednesday.The outcome of the unfolding battle for control of the CBOT is likely to determine the future shape of the fast-growing global derivatives business.The Intercontinental Exchange launched its unsolicited offer two weeks ago – on the CBOT’s 149th birthday – in a move which clearly stunned the Board of Trade’s arranged suitor, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.The Board of Trade, the second-largest US futures exchange, is certainly no corpse. Demand for its suite of interest-rate and agricultural futures has surged with the increasing sophistication of global risk-management strategies and the shift to more electronic trading, pushing its market value up threefold since
its flotation at the end of 2005.Jeff Sprecher, the founder and chief executive of the ICE, argued that the CME’s October 2006 merger proposal undervalued the Board of Trade franchise and restricted its growth potential.He argued that his business, offering energy and soft commodity futures and a platform for trades in the larger over-the-counter sector, could leverage undermanaged potential in the CBOT business.This message has been rejected by the CME, but has invigorated the CBOT membership, who still control about 80 per cent of the stock.They made it clear at last week’s CME presentation that they would have voted down the Chicago merger plan, a realisation which saw the April 4 ballot postponed.Craig Donohue, CME chief executive, has called the premium offered by the ICE “illusory”, though members also signalled they expected the Merc to at least match the terms offered by the Atlanta-based exchange. Mr Donohue and his board have so far declined to make such a move.The greatest pressure is on Charlie Carey, the CBOT chairman feted by members for taking the exchange public and breaking down other barriers such as electronic trading of agricultural products. The emergence of an offer at one point valued at some $1.3bn above the existing terms is viewed as an embarrassment among CBOT members. “Charlie has lost his sheen,” said one trader.The stand-off by members – reluctant to leave any money on the table – has forced Mr Carey and his board to open talks with the ICE and “exchange information” with the rival suitor.However, the ICE has not publicly said it is conducting “due diligence”, and advisers point to lock-ups in the merger agreement between the Chicago exchanges.Both the ICE and the Board of Trade have declined to comment on their negotiations. However, Terry Duffy, the CME chairman who brokered the merger, told the Financial Times that the Merc would not change the “criteria” in the agreement which determines what data the CBOT can share. The Merc maintains that the CBOT is not restricted in its ability to talk to third parties.Any reluctance to open the CBOT books in the same fashion afforded to the Merc will draw fire from members and shareholders, and risks devaluing the CME’s efforts to defend the merits of its own plan and its questioning of the rival ICE offer.Mr Donohue has already questioned the ICE proposal’s synergy targets, the robustness of its trading platform and the future value of its stock."
652;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-03-26T17:02:48Z;ICE steps up effort to break rivals’ merger;;The Intercontinental Exchange on Monday insisted it could handle trades for the Chicago Board of Trade “within six months” as the US-based futures exchange stepped up efforts to break up the agreed merger between its two larger Chicago rivals.The ICE is expanding the clearing platform acquired with its purchase of the New York Board of Trade, and dismissed comments from the CME that it would be unable to meet the demands of handling business from the CBOT if it wins an increasingly fractious bid battle.Jeff Sprecher, the founder and chief executive of ICE, on Monday moved to counter what he described as “extremely misleading and disingenuous” comments from CME executives about his rival offer, which is being examined by the Board of Trade.The ICE also strengtened the bid team led by Morgan Stanley. UBS, the world’s largest futures broker, and Société Générale, whose futures arm is merging with Credit Agricole’s derivatives unit, signed up in a move which highlights the importance of clearing and settlement in the futures industry. JP Morgan is the lead advisor to the CME.“We believe we could have the required scale in clearing within six months,” said Mr Sprecher on an investor call on Monday which offered a detailed rebuttal of the offensive against his bid launched by the CME last week.However, the premium in the ICE proposal on Monday fell to its lowest level since the bid was announced on March 15. CBOT stock continued a three-session decline after the CME indicated it would not raise its own bid, despite calls for improved terms from many CBOT members at a presentation last week.CBOT shares dipped 1.8 per cent to $186.90 by midday in New York, while the ICE fell 2 per cent to $121.03 and CME shares lost 0.5 per cent at $538.38.The proposed ICE premium has now halved to less than 6 per cent, which analysts said reflected the preference expressed by CBOT members for a sweetened offer from the Merc, as well as a shift by the stocks towards trading on their fundamentals.Both Chicago exchanges are expected to report higher first-quarter earnings after volumes spiked during last month’s turmoil in the equity markets.Craig Donohue, the CME’s chief executive, last week declined to be drawn about a higher offer, though dismissed the ICE premium as “illusory” in a wide-ranging attack which also questioned the proposed sysnergies and highlighted lingering tensions with the large banks which still dominate futures transactions.The banks continue to act as intermediaries between the exchanges and customers such as hedge funds, and Mr Donohue said end-users remained supportive of the all-Chicago combination.The ICE has recieved high-profile support from some of the large banks, which Mr Sprecher said reflected the competition which the smaller exchange would bring to the market, as well as enhanced opportunities in over-the-counter market.The Atlanta exchange, which operates Nybot and the former London-based International Petroleum Exchange – now known as ICE Futures - already generates half its revenue from handling OTC deals, a segment which the CME is targeting with an array of initiatives which it said have irked some of the banks which currently doiminate the sector.
653;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-03-22T03:34:34Z;Obama shelves CBOT/CME merger support;;Illinois senator Barack Obama has quietly shelved his support for an agreed merger of Chicago’s two biggest futures exchanges while directors of the Chicago Board of Trade evaluate a rival offer from the Intercontinental Exchange.The presidential hopeful was one of 10 signatories to a letter sent to Alberto Gonzales, the US attorney general, backing the all-Chicago deal as a way to protect the city’s financial community and the broader interests of the US in international markets.Senator Dick Durbin, the Senate majority whip, reiterated his support for the CME-CBOT agreement last week after a higher all-stock proposal from the Atlanta-based ICE.However, Mr Obama has opted not to repeat the backing he gave, with other members of the Illinois congressional delegation, in the letter, dated November 20.A person close to the presidential hopeful said: “Senator Obama supported the merger between CBOT and CME because of the boost it would provide for the Chicago financial community. We await the conclusions of the review by the CBOT Board on the unsolicited ICE proposal so that we can determine our position on that bid.”The Chicago exchanges still retain substantial political backing and influence in Congress, though the ICE on Wednesday played down its significance. “The politicians will defer to the [CBOT] members,” said Jeff Sprecher, the founder and chief executive of ICE, in an interview with the Financial Times.CBOT directors have yet to meet with the ICE or exchange information, after announcing on Monday that they would hold talks and permit limited due diligence.The board has retained its recommendation for the CME’s all-stock offer, though analysts believe the Merc will have to raise its bid to close a $1.3bn gap with the ICE proposal. The CBOT also postponed an April 4 vote of members and shareholders to approve the CME deal.The two Chicago exchanges are due to address members and investors on Thursday. The CME has described the ICE offer as “inferior”. Mr Sprecher defended his proposal and said the CME had undervalued the CBOT franchise.The ICE is split evenly between energy and commodities’ futures and over-the-counter products. Mr Sprecher said there were opportunities to leverage the CBOT’s interest-rate futures to provide OTC products.
654;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-03-21T02:20:38Z;CBOT delays key vote on CME merger;;The Chicago Board of Trade on Tuesday evening postponed an April 4 shareholder vote on its agreed merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The delay allows investors to review the $9.9bn unsolicited offer from the smaller Intercontinental Exchange.CBOT said in a statement on Tuesday the merger “remains in effect”.CME quickly reiterated CBOT’s confidence. ”We fully expect the CBOT’s board, after completing its review, will recognise that the CME/CBOT merger is superior to ICE’s unsolicited proposal - financially, strategically, and operationally,” CME said late on Tuesday.The Atlanta-based ICE maintains the “CME rhetoric will not fool CBOT shareholders” as the gap between the value of its richer all-sock offer and the Merc’s existing proposal continued to widen.Tuesday’s public spat between the rival suitors pushed the market value of CBOT to a record high of almost $10.5bn.The ICE is expected to take its case to the CBOT this week after the Board of Trade agreed to talks and limited due diligence, while retaining its recommendation in support of an all-Chicago combination.The CBOT board can also change its recommendation on Thursday under the terms of its CME agreement, which includes a $240m break-up fee.CME’s bid could yet be derailed by the US justice department amid concerns over its dominance in clearing and interest rate products, although officials do not expect it to be blocked.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of the ICE, is expected to arrive in Chicago on Wednesday to meet CBOT executives and explain the merits of his own exchange’s bid.CME executives, including executive chairman Terry Duffy and chief executive Craig Donohue, will address Thursday’s meeting.They will argue that ICE’s estimated synergies appear exaggerated and say that the ICE proposal could limit the CBOT’s comparative future growth potential. “In our view, the ICE proposal is significantly inferior to the CME CBOT merger – financially, strategically and operationally,” said Mr Donohue.He added that the CME/CBOT transaction provides “more value to our respective customers through reduced expenses and greater trading opportunities”.ICE plans this week to unveil a 10-fold increase in the capacity of its in-house clearing system.
655;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-03-19T23:06:03Z;ICE plans huge boost to clearing system;;The Intercontinental Exchange plans to unveil a 10-fold increase in the capacity of its in-house clearing system in a bid to persuade members of the Chicago Board of Trade that it can consummate its planned $10bn merger of the two US-based futures platforms.The impact on electronic clearing of contracts is among a number of concerns expressed by CBOT members after the ICE last week unveiled an unsolicited plan to merge with the Board of Trade.The surprise bid challenged the agreed combination of the CBOT with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced in October, stirring an industry which had just settled following the bruising takeover battles for Euronext and the London Stock Exchange.Directors at the CBOT on Monday agreed to hold talks with the Atlanta-based ICE, a specialist in energy futures and handling over-the-counter trades which has already acquired the International Petroleum Exchange and the New York Board of Trade during its seven-year existence.Jeff Sprecher, the ICE’s founder and chief executive, also secured backing to start due diligence on an offer which he maintained offered better value to shareholders than the CME merger plan.CBOT shares ended up 3.5 per cent at a record $196.71 amid speculation from analysts that the CME would be forced to sweeten its existing offer for control of the 159-year-old CBOT, which specialises in financial, metal and agricultural derivatives.The CME declined to comment, but the gap between its offer and the higher ICE proposal widened following Monday’s share-price movements. The all-Chicago combination carries a $240m break-up fee, but analysts said the CME could afford to pay up to $220 a share before losing the accretive value from buying the CBOT.The ICE postponed a briefing of the CBOT’s members – who still control around 80 per cent of its stock following its 2005 flotation – scheduled for March 21, when it is expected to meet CBOT executives. However, the improvements to the electronic ICE clearing system are intended to alleviate concerns that its smaller ICE platform would be unable to handle the larger volume of CBOT trades.The Board of Trade uses CME’s clearing system for its electronic trades – it retains an open-outcry floor – under a deal recently extended until 2009, providing the Merc with an estimated $80m in revenues this year. “We have a lot of time to grow the scale of these systems,” Mr Sprecher told the Financial Times.He has also raised the spectre of regulators blocking the all-Chicago deal, though CME executives express confidence that antitrust officials will not hinder its plan to create the world’s largest futures exchange, despite an ongoing probe by the justice department into its dominance in clearing and interest-rate products.
656;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-03-19T15:43:31Z;Wall Street rises modestly aided by M&A deals;;Wall Street rose modestly on Thursday as a flurry of deals helped offset concerns about inflation and economic growth ahead of quarterly derivative contracts on stocks expiring on Friday.Stocks briefly shed gains when Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, said woes in the subprime mortgage market were “not a small issue” and could spill over into other sectors.At the close of trade on Thursday, the S&P 500 was 0.4 per cent firmer at 1,392.28. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,378.70 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had rallied 0.2 per cent to 12,159.68.Fears that the subprime mortgage market would harm financial stocks were allayed when Bear Stearns reported rising first quarter earnings, boosting its shares by 2.2 per cent to $148.50. This week’s solid earnings from Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs had already eased concerns that subprime woes would spread. But analysts warned that the worst for financial stocks could still be ahead.Materials led, buoyed by news that Dow Chemical was seeking a joint venture with Reliance Industries, India’s leading petrochemical maker. Shares in Dow rose 5.6 per cent to $45.80.The Intercontinental Exchange launched an unsolicited $9.9bn bid for CBOT Holdings valued at $187.34 a share.CBOT is on course to complete an $8bn merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in May.Shares in CBOT rose 17.4 per cent at $194.95 – and set a high of $195 in early trade – as investors contemplated a bidding war.Brad Bailey, senior analyst at Aite Group, said “the bid puts pressure on CME to move its attention away from post-merger planning to try to get the deal done”.Shares in ICE fell 2.9 per cent to $128.10, reversing an earlier jump to $133.50. CME fell 5.5 per cent to $532.88, making it the worst performing stock in the S&P 500.The mood in stocks briefly soured when the producer price index for last month rose much more than expected. This kept inflation concerns on the radar.Peter Cardillo, chief investment economist at Avalon Partners, warned that investors would watch closely the consumer price index report due on Friday. A sharp rise in core CPI “would give the market a nasty case of indigestion”.In other deals, General Electric’s Capital Solutions and Blackstone Group reached agreement to acquire PHH Corp for $31.50 a share in an all-cash purchase valued at about $1.8bn. Shares in the mortgage and fleet management services company rose 11.8 per cent to $31.10. GE was up 0.6 per cent at $34.52.Cisco said it would acquire WebEx Communications in a $3.2bn cash deal for the online meeting company. Shares in WebEx jumped 22 per cent to $56.38. Cisco shares fell 0.15 per cent at $25.81.
657;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-03-19T15:42:29Z;Wall St falls for the week as subprime fears intensify;;"Wall Street plumbed new lows for the year this week but stocks recovered as investors regained composure after subprime mortgage scares.The talk on Wall Street yesterday after a week of severe volatility, was mostly about a report that Blackstone, the private equity group, was planning an initial public offering.A market debut by Blackstone is likely to be taken as a sign of confidence in the face of recent weakness in global equities. Details of the offer are unclear, but Blackstone is understood to be in advanced stages of preparation. The prospect of a flotation is likely to cause a big stir.Shares in Fortress Investment, the private equity group and hedge fund manager, almost doubled on its market debut in February amid intense demand from retail investors. By the close on Friday Fortress had fallen 30 per cent to $25.74 from its intra-day record high $37 reached on the day of its market debut.The Blackstone talk came at the end of a tumultuous week in which stocks were propped up by the seemingly relentless flow of deals, including a dramatic bid for CBOT Holdings.After the tentative gains made in the previous week, technical analysts had been anticipating a “test” that would indicate whether the recent turmoil would develop into a longer-lasting bear market.When the “test” came on Tuesday and Wednesday, it was once again related to subprime mortgage problems. But familiarity with the issue was little comfort to investors watching stocks plunge across the board.At one stage the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below the 12,000 mark; a plunge of 5.9 per cent from its record high in February.The Dow closed 0.4 per cent lower on Friday, to stand 1.3 per cent down for the week at 12,110.41. The S&P 500 Index was 1.1 per cent lower at 1,386.95. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.6 per cent to 2,372.66.Financial groups led the slide down, and the way back up, as three big investment banks reported results. In the event, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns all met or exceeded expectations. But with rumours of losses swirling round the market, the announcements were a source of anxiety and reassurance by turns.Persistent worries about Lehman’s exposure to subprime mortgages sent its shares at one point 10 per cent below Tuesday’s opening. But the stock rallied as executives said the group was well-hedged. Lehman was finished the week 6.1 per cent down at $71.19. Goldman Sachs was 1.3 per cent down at $199.Some analysts expected that volatility would continue. “Long-term investors should pull up a lawn chair and enjoy the fireworks,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “Until we get through some of the crazy action, the sidelines should be a safe and comfortable spot.”Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for JPMorgan Private Bank, said the market “will need much greater clarity about corporate earnings before a meaningful rally can ensue”.Carmakers skidded this week. General Motors reported better fourth quarter profits and revenues. But its stock plunged 5.9 per cent to $29.17 on concerns about its US sales amid a possible economic slowdown. Rival Ford fell 4.9 per cent to $7.55.In deal news, the future of CBOT was thrown into doubt after the Intercontinental Exchange launched an unsolicited $9.9bn bid. CBOT was set to merge with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Shares in CBOT rose 12.5 per cent to $190 as investors contemplated a bidding war.Speculation that Dow Chemical was seeking a joint venture with Reliance Industries, India’s leading petrochemical maker, lifted its shares 5.2 per cent to $45.25.Retailers remained under pressure as confidence in consumer spending flagged. Wal-Mart, which withdrew its application to open a specialty bank on Friday, fell 2.6 per cent to $46.21. Target slid 3.4 per cent to $59.77.Homebuilders were in the doldrums on fears of tighter lending affecting the spring home selling season. Pulte Homes fell 8.5 per cent to $26.31 while DR Horton was down 6.3 per cent to $22.83.Accredited Home Lenders said it had agreed to sell $2.7bn of its subprime mortgage loans at a discount to free up cash to pay its creditors. Accredited surged 15.7 per cent to $10.90 on Friday."
658;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;CBOT to discuss ICE bid on March 20;;Directors from the Chicago Board of Trade will meet on Tuesday to evaluate the surprise counterbid launched on Thursday by the Intercontinental Exchange, though officials have yet to decide whether to open the books to their Atlanta-based suitor.The unsolicited all-stock bid from the ICE came just three weeks before CBOT members were due to vote on an agreed merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which has so far declined to comment on whether it will sweeten its own bid with more cash.CBOT shares dipped 2.7 per cent to $189.79 in early trading, just above the value of the indicative offer from ICE based on Wednesday’s closing prices. Shares in both the ICE and the CME were narrowly down, reducing the value of their current offers.Sources close to the Board of Trade suggested directors were unlikely to let the ICE go hostile and appeal directly to its members, opting instead to evaluate the proposal and seek a higher offer from the CME. All three exchanges declined official comment.Analysts said the CME had the greater financial firepower to raise its bid – with some suggesting it could go as high as $220 a share before it failed to become accretive.However, Jeff Sprecher, the founder and chief executive of the ICE, has raised the spectre of regulators blocking or diluting the all-Chicago plan because of its impact on competition in interest-rate futures and clearing. Mr Sprecher said this week he had “intimate” knowledge of the probe being conducted by the justice department, and said CBOT shareholders should be “concerned” about the outcome.Executives from both Chicago exchanges this week reiterated their confidence that the deal would not be blocked, although they also said demands for any concessions could result in the collapse of the pact.The executives maintain that opposition to the deal is being driven by banks’ concern about the inroads that an enlarged CME Group could make into their profitable over-the-counter business, rather than competition issues.
659;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-03-16T01:48:28Z;ICE chief seeks to calm storm in Windy City;;Jeff Sprecher plans to exchange contracts on a new home in Chicago on April 2, but his welcome in the city is far from certain.The chief executive of the Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange on Thursday launched an audacious bid to break up one of the most celebrated deals in the city’s history – the agreed merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.Mr Sprecher’s surprise move could alienate many in the city, where exchange leaders and traders of the two Chicago exchanges – buoyed by high-level political support – buried decades of fierce rivalry to secure support for the merger plan announced last October.Dick Durbin, the Illinois senator and Senate whip, on Thursday reiterated his support for the existing Chicago deal, a position held by his junior partner, the presidential hopeful Barack Obama.The CME and the CBOT portrayed their deal as a bid to maintain Chicago as the self-styled “derivatives capital of the world”, but Mr Sprecher echoed this claim, and dissected the perceived weaknesses of the transaction.CBOT traders, who had cheered Terry Duffy, CME chairman, when the merger was announced in October, indicated they would take the new proposal seriously. Mr Sprecher offered the promise of ending a rancorous dispute with the Chicago Board Options Exchange, paving the way for Board of Trade members to claim a disputed share in its planned initial public offering.The prospect of additional business from combining the ICE business in soft commodities such as cocoa and sugar with the CBOT’s larger agricultural business also drew some applause, though some traders still argued the synergies from an all-Chicago combination remained more impressive.However, Mr Sprecher played on lingering fears that regulators could block or dilute the merits of the CME-CBOT plan because of its sheer scale in the US and near-monopoly on clearing exchange-traded futures, a claim which CME leaders have rejected.He also appealed to the ego of the Chicago trading community by promising a global growth platform, painting the Chicago combination as a defensive move.CBOT shareholders would retain control of the enlarged organisation, which would keep its name and Chicago trading floor, as well as the metals business which was threatened with closure because of the CME’s existing involvement in the segment through a joint venture with the New York Mercantile Exchange.While the management structure of an ICE-CBOT combination has yet to be revealed, only one senior Board of Trade executive was due to remain with the enlarged CME Group, encouraging managers faced with redundancy to give support for the ICE proposal. The olive branch to the CBOE could also help marshal broader support in the Chicago exchange community.Mr Sprecher’s move could double the size of the ICE, which expanded into the energy sector by acquiring the London-based International Petroleum Exchange in June 2001, launching a fierce rivalry over the trading of oil futures with the Nymex and providing a clearing relationship – through LCH.Clearnet – which afforded its move into an OTC business that now provides half its revenues.Mr Sprecher guided the ICE through the fallout from the collapse of many US energy traders in the wake of the Enron scandal, and has also maintained the independence of the exchange, deflecting past interest from both Nymex and the CME.The $1bn purchase of the New York Board of Trade last September moved the ICE into soft commodities such as cocoa and sugar, and also provided its own clearing house for the first time, which Mr Sprecher said had been expanded to deal with the volume of CBOT business from the proposed acquisition.He is committed to retaining both the existing Nybot and CBOT trading floors – despite the migration of the majority of their business to the screen. The key test will be whether the rapturous reception given to CME and CBOT executives last October on the Board of Trade floor is repeated if he gets to proceed with his own plan.
660;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-03-15T21:39:47Z;ICE makes $9.9bn offer for CBOT;;The consolidation of global exchanges was thrown into flux on Thursday as the Intercontinental Exchange of Atlanta shocked the financial world by launching an unsolicited $9.9bn offer for the Chicago Board of Trade that would break up the CBOT’s agreed merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.The proposed bid – which was 10.5 per cent higher than the CME’s indicative offer – was timed to coincide with a major futures industry conference in Boca Raton, Florida, and led to immediate predictions of a bidding war for the CBOT.Analysts said that if the combination of the two Chicago exchanges was derailed, Deutsche Börse might be tempted to seek a deal with the CME, and the NYSE Group could become more likely to bid for the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the biggest US options exchange.“People are walking around stunned,” said Gary DeWaal, general counsel at broker Fimat and Florida conference delegate. “This is a tremendous wild card and opens up the process dramatically. It may alter the whole chemistry of the landscape.”ICE officials made it clear they were seeking to take advantage of concerns on Wall Street that an enlarged CME would wield excessive power in the growing global derivatives market.The CME-CBOT deal is being vetted by the US justice department on antitrust grounds.Jeff Sprecher, ICE founder and chief executive, said: “We believe we are in the best position with the regulators.”Under the ICE proposal, CBOT shareholders would retain a narrow majority of shares in the combined company – which would retain the CBOT name and Chicago headquarters.Mr Sprecher said the ICE’s all-stock proposal could introduce a cash element to sweeten its deal. (Letter to CBOT)The business would combine the Board of Trade’s business in financial and agricultural commodity futures with the ICE focus on energy, soft commodities and OTC transactions.The CME insisted it would proceed with the CBOT purchase but has become concerned about the opposition marshalled by the banks ahead of shareholder and member votes on April 4.Executives of the Chicago exchanges have defended the near-monopoly it would have on exchange-traded futures in the US – a focus of the justice department probe – because of the globalising nature of the derivatives business.Executives maintain opponents are motivated by the potential loss of profits rather than any “public good”.CBOT shares rose as much as 15 per cent to a record $192.42, above the $187.34 proposal from the ICE. ICE, which floated in November 2005, fell 3.7 per cent to $127.13, and CME dropped 3.8 per cent to $542.63.Additional reporting by Daniel Pimlott in New York
661;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;ICE’s counterbid for CBOT;;Intercontinental Exchange hopes to break up Chicago’s marriage of the year in the nicest way possible. It has trumped the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s offer for girl-next-door the Chicago Board of Trade with an approach of its own. Can it succeed?Besides the higher price, ICE’s all-stock bid has two potential advantages. It panders to political sensitivities. CBOT’s shareholders would retain a slim majority in the combined entity and the headquarters would be in Chicago. In addition, regulators may be more comfortable with a pro forma market share in US futures trading of about one-third – compared with the almost 90 per cent estimated for the combined CME-CBOT.Still, ICE is unlikely to walk away the winner with this bid, which is probably why it set its implied premium to CME’s competing bid – based on Wednesday’s close – at a tantalising but not blockbusting 10.5 per cent. Investors were clearly surprised, as CBOT’s shares have traded in line with CME’s offer since it was made last October. They jumped by 17 per cent on Thursday.CME has powerful incentives to counter ICE’s offer. Apart from lost synergies, CME could lose out if money it now makes clearing trades on CBOT migrates to ICE. Citigroup estimates these at 7 per cent of CME’s revenues. Assume a net profit margin of 50 per cent and that equates to almost $70m in earnings, based on consensus forecasts for 2008. On a multiple of 30 times – at the bottom end of the sector – that is potentially worth more than $2bn in terms of market cap. CME is worth $19bn.ICE’s great hope, therefore, lies with regulators derailing CME’s plans. For now, the market is more hopeful of a bid battle developing – CBOT is trading at a 7 per cent premium to ICE’s higher offer. That in turn probably explains why ICE’s shares, which rose on the initial announcement, have fallen since.
662;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-03-06T20:01:10Z;Commodities exchanges;;Where can you buy exposure to a heady cocktail of energy, metals, market volatility and the bets made by hedge funds? The answer for many is listed commodities exchanges. The big four in the US – Nymex Holdings, CBOT Holdings, Intercontinental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings – trade on multiples of anywhere between 34 and 50 times 2007 earnings.There is a lot behind the buzz. Growth in traded volumes of futures and options has been phenomenal. Tight markets in the likes of oil and copper have fuelled a craze for commodities as an asset class and boosted volatility in those markets. Hedge funds’ speculative forays add to the mix. Pre-tax margins are 40 per cent or more. US regulations mean futures exchanges operate their own clearing houses, mitigating competitive pressure. Further consolidation is expected.Given all that, it may seem odd that Nymex, which floated in November, appears to be the target of heavy short-selling. Short interest in the stock in February was equivalent to more than half of the free float, according to data from Bloomberg. The free float is now just 8 per cent. But that could increase soon. Last month, Nymex said it would canvass shareholders’ interest in a secondary issue, possibly to occur before May, when the first lock-up period was originally expected to expire.If Nymex was a bargain when it floated – its stock more than doubled on day one – there are signs that now would be a good time to lock in some profits. That should not mean a general sell-off: shares in rivals have breezed through earlier lock-up expirations. But for the sector as a whole, current multiples discount frenzied commodities markets, rampant hedge funds, synergistic mergers and high barriers to entry continuing for a long time. Investors should be concerned when the long-term view sounds uncannily like the immediate past.
663;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-01-24T21:57:54Z;Nymex seeks to close UK subsidiary;;"The New York Mercantile Exchange is seeking to close its UK subsidiary Nymex Europe as an exchange with the UK regulatory authorities, closing out its option to list its futures contracts on its London exchange.Nymex launched an open outcry exchange in London in September 2005 to compete with the IntercontinentalExchange in the Brent crude futures market. But meaningful trading on the floor never took off and it abandoned the scheme after a few months.Since then, it has used Nymex Europe as an electronic exchange for trading Brent and NorthWest Europe gasoil futures, but these markets have also attracted small volumes.“The decision to close NEL [Nymex Energy Limited] follows careful review of the Nymex group’s European strategy and significant changes in the market place and manner of trading for exchange-traded products over the last few years,” Nymex Europe said in a letter to its members.The letter said that Nymex Europe had listed its products alongside those of
its parent on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Globex electronic trading platform.“Although the parallel electronic listing provides many commercial advantages, it has also highlighted the value of having one consistent set of rules to govern related products that are listed on the same platform, rather than by competing regulatory agencies whose rules pose significant cross-jurisdictional challenges,” said the letter, which was signed by John Mackeonis, Nymex Europe chief compliance officer.The letter said Nymex remained wholly committed to enhancing its European presence."
664;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2007-01-03T23:50:12Z;Nybot chief executive dies at 66;;Harry Falk, president and chief executive of the New York Board of Trade, died Wednesday, aged 66.Mr Falk was elected chairman of Nybot’s board of governors in October 2000, before being named interim president and chief executive in April 2002, a position confirmed in July 2003.Mr Falk guided Nybot through one of its most turbulent periods after the September 11 terrorist attacks which destroyed its trading floor in the World Trade Center.Nybot recently agreed to merge with the Intercontinental Exchange, and the company said his death would have no effect on this agreement.Falk had been instrumental in securing the merger and had been engaged in a public debate about actions of the rival New York Mercantile Exchange, that were, he said, designed to ‘interfere’ with the merger.Nymex, which specialises in energy and metals, plans to introduce six agricultural futures contracts.These would directly compete with the soft commodity products already trading on the Nybot, which leases space in Nymex’s building on the banks of the Hudson in downtown Manhattan.A member of the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange since 1970, Mr Falk joined the CSCE board of managers in 1989 and was appointed vice-chairman in 1990.His association with the CSCE began in 1958 as a clerk for Czarnikow-Rionda, a Cuban sugar company, where he rose to become a partner in the company.Mr Falk lived in Rockland County, New York, with his wife Joan. They had five children and 12 grandchildren.
665;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-12-04T04:26:44Z;Probe into ETP’s energy swaps trades;;Energy Transfer Partners, operator of the largest intra-state natural gas pipeline system in the US, is under investigation by federal regulators over physical gas purchases and gas swaps trades done on the Intercontinental Exchange, the energy derivatives market.Regulators have subpoenaed the New York Stock Exchange-listed company after a report that a subsidiary artificially lowered the price of natural gas at the main gas purchasing hub in Texas in an apparent attempt to influence the outcome of a series of swaps trades.The development comes as Democrats in Washington appear poised in January to press for legislation to tighten oversight of the over-the-counter (OTC) energy markets.Such calls, spearheaded by California Senator Dianne Feinstein, have been mounting since a report in June by a congressional committee claiming that speculation in OTC energy markets was contributing to record energy prices.They have been fuelled by trades at hedge fund Amaranth, whose bets in energy swaps on ICE this year went wrong, causing losses of around $6bn.OTC markets are where trades are negotiated privately between parties and are regulated more lightly than exchange-traded markets.Atlanta-based ICE is one of the most active markets for OTC trading, dominating trading in gas swaps, which are based on dozens of trading hubs across the US.Critics of the regulatory regime are concerned that regulators of physical and derivatives markets may be unable to spot manipulation given the lack of any regular reporting of such trades to regulators.Such reporting – known as “larger trader reporting” - is routine in exchange-traded markets.OTC energy markets were exempted from such oversight by passage of the Commodity Futures Modernisation Act (CFMA) in 2000. Participants in such markets were deemed able to self-regulate.John McReynolds, president of Energy Transfer Equity, a holding company that owns Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), said the company had received subpoenas from regulators as a follow-up to “several data requests”.He declined to name the regulators but they are understood to be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, (CFTC), which oversees futures markets, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.FERC regulates the inter-state transmission of oil, natural gas and electricity. Both agencies declined to comment.ETP operates 12,000 miles of natural gas pipelines in the US, mostly in Texas. The company generated revenues $8.1bn in fiscal 2006, which ended May. It posted earnings that year of $730m.A report in Platts, an energy publication, in September detailed allegations that an ETP unit, Energy Transfer Co, last year used its dominant market presence at the Houston Ship Channel gas hub in an apparent attempt to influence the outcome of its gas swap trades on ICE.It detailed a series of moves involving the purchase by ETP of large amounts of natural gas at the hub with the aim of driving prices lower.Such prices were then allegedly reported to a pricing index operated by Platts which is widely used by natural gas participants as a benchmark for gas pricing.The report alleged that ETP then used the index price as the basis for pricing certain swap transactions with other counterparties.ETP has not been charged with any offence. However regulators want to establish whether an artificial price was created in physical natural gas with the aim of benefiting the company’s OTC swap trades on ICE.Mr McReynolds told the Financial Times the Platts report was inaccurate.A reported “disconnect” between the normal physical gas prices at the Houston Ship Channel and the Henry Hub natural gas hub in Louisiana, off which New York Mercantile Exchange gas futures are priced, was due to supply disruptions caused by hurricane Katrina last year, he said.ETP has set aside around $30m to settle “regulatory inquiries” into trading activity at that time.The company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week that while it was “unable to predict the final outcome of these inquiries, management believes it is probable that the industry regulators will require a payment in order to conclude the enquiries”.Mr McReynolds said ETP had complied with “all laws and regulations”. The $30m provision was a “pure contingency on a hypothetical possibility”.To bring lawsuits against those suspected of price manipulation or false reporting of energy prices, regulators must not only show that manipulation took place but also that there was intent to do so.Mr McReynolds said: “There was no intentional wrongdoing and we have not found any wrongdoing of any kind. However companies will often make a payment of some kind just to settle a matter because under these vague statutes or regulations there is no clear right answer.“We have done a most thorough internal review of anything to do with this and there has been nothing untoward so that any money paid would have to do with a settlement of a dispute on interpretation,” he said.The funds set aside were intended for use in “a range of regulatory and legal matters, including ones in which we would be a plaintiff”, Mr McReynolds said.Last month, the American Public Gas Association (APGA), a non-profit association of publicly-owned US natural gas distribution systems, wrote to the Senate’s agriculture committee – which oversees the CFTC – warning that “the vast majority of natural gas derivatives are traded without government oversight”.“While the CFTC monitors trading of natural gas contracts cleared through the Nymex it receives very little information regarding trading of natural gas derivatives on the Intercontinental Exchange or on the over-the-counter market where tens of thousands of trades are placed each day,” it said.Calling for the need for “position reporting” in OTC markets, it said: “Trading activities or other actions intended to distort the price reporting process cannot be detected or deterred when the government is receiving no information concerning the trading in question.”An APGA source said the organisation would be “pushing for more transparency” when the next Congress meets in January.Defenders of the current regime, which include Wall Street banks and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, argue that requiring participants to send regulators trading reports would expose a trader’s private commercial decisions to market rivals.They lobbied strongly in favour of “lighter touch” regulation for OTC energy markets ahead of passage of the CFMA.The CFTC only has enforcement authority in OTC markets, allowing it to pursue traders in the event any wrongdoing is suspected.Asked if he believed if it was justified to have greater oversight over OTC energy markets, Mr McReynolds said: “I am not convinced that more regulation would fix the problems that [Ms] Feinstein is talking about. If you increase regulation the crooks and cowboys will still find ways to be crooks.”The ETP case also highlights increasing concern that there is insufficient oversight of physical energy markets – including inter- and intra-state pipelines.Physical markets have a close pricing relationship with OTC and on-exchange futures markets. Traders often speculate by arbitraging between physical, OTC markets and futures markets.In addition, there are concerns that reporting of prices to indices such as those run by Platts are voluntary, resulting in an incomplete picture of pricing and trading at the dozens of natural gas hubs across the US.APGA last month told the FERC that increased transparency in the natural gas markets could be achieved by making price reporting compulsory. It proposed that this be done at a central hub.“All would submit data to a single repository which would match, verify and scrub the data and then provide the resulting clean data for published indices,” APGA said.The CFTC’s inability to see trading activity on OTC markets in the same way as it can see such activity on exchanges - such as Nymex - is a source of frustration for some in the agency.That is because there is increasing interplay between energy contracts traded on markets like ICE and on Nymex – yet the regulator only receives large trader reports from Nymex and thus cannot see activity in the whole market.The CFTC has nonetheless in recent months stepped up its enforcement activities in the OTC markets.As of last month, the CFTC had filed 35 enforcement actions involving 31 companies since 2002. It obtained over $300m in civil monetary penalties in such cases.The latest case came last month, when the CFTC settled with two traders at Mirant, a US energy company, in a case alleging that they submitted false natural gas trading information to a natural gas price index.The traders were accused of submitting the false natural gas trade information to companies that calculated natural gas price indexes including Inside FERC Gas Market Report, Gas Daily, and Natural Gas Intelligence, in an attempt to skew that index at multiple natural gas delivery locations to “benefit their trading positions”, according to the CFTC.
666;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;ICE keen on keeping LCH partnership;;The IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the electronic commodities exchange, is interested in forming a clearing house partnership with LCH.Clearnet if its proposed acquisition of fellow commodities exchange the New York Board of Trade, which has its own clearing house, is completed.Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman of ICE, said his exchange was keen to maintain a relationship with LCH.Clearnet, which clears all of the trade that is conducted on ICE, including trading in its Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude futures contracts.“We have not talked in any detail about a specific structure, except to say that we think there are opportunities for both sides to explore,” Mr Sprecher told the Financial Times in an interview.One possibility is for LCH.Clearnet, the European clearing house, to clear all the ICE trades that are done by European-based customers and US investors will have their trades cleared through the New York Clearing Corp, which is owned by Nybot.Another structure could be an alliance between the two clearing houses, which would give ICE greater flexibility in launching new contracts and offering clearing services to the over-the-counter market.If ICE decided to switch all its clearing away from LCH.Clearnet, in which it is a minority shareholder, it would have to give the London-based clearing house a year’s notice.“So far there is no global clearing house structure. We have global financial markets, global commodity markets, but clearing houses have been confined to operating under one regulatory system,” said Mr Sprecher.“I think this is because regulators fear that if there is a default at a clearing house in one jurisdiction, there could a ripple effect on the other clearing houses that it is connected to.”Mr Sprecher said talks with LCH.Clearnet were still in the early stages as the Nybot take-over was not expected to be complete until next year. “LCH.Clearnet also has a number of its own issues to sort out as it looks like there is going to be a change of shareholding,” he said.Euronext, the Paris-based exchange, is in talks with LCH.Clearnet to reduce its stake to as low as 5 per cent from its existing 41.5 per cent. Mr Sprecher would not comment on whether ICE would increase its stake in LCH.Clearnet.The success of ICE’s $1bn offer for Nybot will depend on next month’s vote by member of the coffee, cocoa and sugar futures exchange, and US regulatory approval.
667;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-11-17T23:07:40Z;Blistering debut for Nymex as shares soar;;"Nymex Holdings, owner of the world’s largest energy exchange, on Friday recorded the best market debut by a US company in six years as its shares more than doubled on issue.The blistering debut by Nymex, which owns the New York Mercantile Exchange, has boosted the wealth of its shareholders, including many individual oil traders that trade in the exchange’s heaving pit and former traders who have retired to Florida and California.Nymex shares reached an intra-day peak of $150 a share, and its stock closed up 125 per cent at $132.99, which gave the company a market value of $11.6bn, within range of the New York Stock Exchange’s valuation of $14.8bn.The share price rise gave the 134-year-old exchange a greater market capitalisation than the $8.5bn for the Chicago Board of Trade, which is under offer from the $19bn Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Nymex’s market value is more than double that of its rival IntercontinentalExchange.Shares surged well beyond the company’s issue price of $59 and the original IPO pricing range of $48 to $52 a share.JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch were the book runners for the float.“I don’t believe it was mispriced; it was priced on industry comparables – it is just that demand was so high,” said Richard Schaeffer, chairman of Nymex.One of the biggest beneficiaries of the float is General Atlantic, the private equity group, which paid the equivalent of $20.83 a share, or $170m, for its 10 per cent stake, which is now worth $1.1bn.Michel Marks, who was chairman of Nymex when it first introduced energy contracts on to the exchange in 1978, is another big gainer from Friday’s float.Mr Marks and his family own almost 100,000 shares, making them the biggest shareholders among former traders.Nymex will have raised about $375m, pre-expenses, from the offering of about 7 per cent of its issued capital. “Wall Street is placing a lot of confidence in us,” said Mr Marks.Nymex’s appeal to investors is the potential for further exchange consolidation, as well as the exchange’s pick-up in trading volume growth following its recent link-up with the CME’s electronic trading platform Globex, which now handles most of its West Texas Intermediate benchmark oil contract."

669;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-11-08T18:29:30Z;The transformation of Nymex;;Executives from the New York Mercantile Exchange have been invited to the New York Stock Exchange next week, when the world’s largest energy futures exchange plans to list its shares on the big board in a $4.5bn initial public offering.Nymex’s transformation from a squabbling member-owned exchange to a potential growth stock has been dramatic and rapid.The key change has been its link-up with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s electronic trading system Globex, which has overtaken the heaving open-outcry pits at Nymex as the most popular place to trade the benchmark crude futures contract – West Texas Intermediate (WTI). This trend is a concern for the crude oil brokers on the Nymex floor, as well as its smaller rival the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), which launched its electronic-only WTI contract in February and found it a key source of growth.Last week, more than 1.4m Nymex energy futures contracts were trading through Globex, representing more than 56 per cent of the total 2.5m Nymex energy futures contracts traded. The addition of Globex has boosted Nymex average daily volumes to about 500,000 contracts from an average of less than 450,000 last year.The growth in electronic trade has come at the expense of trading in the pits, Nymex shareholders say. For example, last Friday 234,852 WTI contracts were traded on Globex, compared with about 152,000 on the floor. Before Nymex energy futures started trading on Globex in October, average daily volume on the floor this year fluctuated between 250,000 and 300,000 contracts.“There is no doubt that trading has migrated from the floor to the screen,” says one Nymex shareholder, who estimated that more than one-third of Nymex floor trading had switched to the screen since the beginning of September.This has meant that traders wanting to buy and sell crude oil futures on the Nymex floor – which has been the main global stage for setting the price of oil for a third of a century – are not prepared to pay as much for the trading rights as they were a few months ago.According to Nymex, the exchange’s trading right, or access to the floor, changed hands for $650,000 on Tuesday, less than half of the record $1.35m paid in May, just before Nymex decided to abandon its own electronic trading system and link up with Globex. Those Nymex shareholders that already own trading rights, but lease them out to other traders, have also seen their monthly lease rates fall.“Not too long ago, some leases were costing $20,000 a month, now the rate is closer to $12,000,” says the Nymex shareholder. But oil traders are still prepared to pay a larger sum for one of Nymex’s 816 seats, as seats give their owners shares as well as trading rights. Currently, a seat gives the owner 90,000 Nymex shares.On Tuesday, a Nymex ownership seat sold for $5.8m, beating the previous record of $5.5m set in April. This gives an implied value for Nymex shares of $64.44, well above the expected IPO price of $48-$52 a share.The 134-year-old exchange, which traces it origins back to the Butter and Cheese Exchange of New York, plans to raise about $245m of new capital in its listing, expected on November 17. Existing shareholders who decide to sell a portion of their holdings will share about $55m based on a share offer price of $50.The strong growth in Nymex energy trading volumes is worrying for ICE, which had exploited the initial reluctance by its bigger rival to embrace electronic trading. ICE grew to capture more than half of total trading in the world’s two benchmark crude futures WTI and Brent. This share has since slipped below the 50 per cent mark, following the surge in Globex WTI trade.Nymex’s move to Globex was prompted by ICE’s early success and the influence of its 10 per cent shareholder General Atlantic, the private equity group, which is very focused on technology.Traditionally, Nymex has been wedded to the floor, as many of its top executives are former floor traders. It advocated open out-cry trading until last autumn and had opened a trading floor in London, but this closed months after inauguration due to a lack of interest.Nymex said in its third quarter earnings on Tuesday that the closure of the London trading floor cost the exchange $6m. This was one of the few blemishes on Nymex earnings, which showed a 50 per cent in-crease in net revenues to $381.5m for the nine months to September 30, while net income rose 122.8 per cent to $112.5m.
670;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-11-02T16:17:46Z;ICE warns over derivatives scrutiny;;The IntercontinentalExchange on Thursday suggested that increased regulatory scrutiny of the over-the-counter derivatives market was likely to deter banks and other users from launching alternatives to its own highly-profitable trading system.The Atlanta-based group, which also operates a futures exchange, has become a focus of a growing clamour from some US lawmakers and industry groups for greater oversight of the OTC energy markets.This followed the meltdown of Amaranth, a hedge fund that lost $6bn on natural gas trades, many of which were conducted through the ICE.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chairman and chief executive, said it continued to “dialogue” with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the natural gas market, providing the regulator with information on large trading positions in the OTC market, where it clears trades from users in return for fees which account for half of its revenues.“We are one of the few venues in the US which provides the CFTC with this level of transparency in the OTC market,” he told analysts after ICE reported a 159.5 per cent rise in third-quarter profits to a record $43.6m.Mr Sprecher acknowledged that ICE’s high operating margins – 69 per cent in the third quarter – were likely to attract efforts by users to bypass it by developing alternative systems or products.However, he said the liquidity garnered by the ICE’s clearing system and the prospect of tighter regulation gave it “a very strong defensible position”.“We continue to work very closely with the CFTC as oversight of the OTC space is evolving,” he said. “I don’t know what appetite third-parties have to take on that challenge in the way we have.”Mr Sprecher also welcomed this week’s decision by the CFTC to rule out extending its supervision to the company’s London-based ICE Futures unit, which offers benchmark oil and gas futures under the oversight of the UK Financial Services Authority.The New York Mercantile Exchange, which offers a rival West Texas Intermediate crude oil contract regulated by the CFTC, complained earlier this year that ICE appeared to be taking advantage of a more lenient regulatory regime in the UK to gain an edge.The ICE has grown its share of benchmark crude futures – which includes the Brent contract alongside WTI – from 36 per cent at the start of the year to around 50 per cent in the third quarter.The market is evenly split with the Nymex, whose own volumes have soared after agreeing to list its floor-based contracts side-by-side on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Globex electronic platform.Mr Sprecher also said members of the New York Board of Trade were expected to vote “within 12 weeks” on its planned $1bn acquisition by the ICE, which it hopes to complete in the first quarter of next year.The proposed deal would add Nybot’s agricultural commodity and financial futures contracts to the ICE complex and, crucially, its own clearing platform. LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house, currently clears all of the ICE’s futures and OTC products.

672;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-09-19T12:40:21Z;Wall Street mixed as oil prices climb;;A morning rally on Wall Street fizzled out on Monday as oil prices climbed and investors became cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s meeting on interest rate policy on Wednesday.Energy stocks ticked higher after BP announced production at its Thunder Horse rig in the Gulf of Mexico would be delayed until 2008, and Iran warned against sanctions over its nuclear programme.

673;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-09-17T19:35:34Z;ICE and Nybot in $1bn deal;;The managements of Intercontinental Exchange and the New York Board of Trade – the latest exchanges to commit themselves to tying the knot – have been doing their best to sell the merits of their $1bn merger.The merger would combine a listed electronic energy exchange with a member-owned agricultural commodity and financial futures exchange.But the deal is far from concluded, as the exchanges navigate the regulatory and clearing house issues that the deal throws up, as well as warding off a rival bid.“We were two incomplete exchanges, but now we are a complete exchange just like the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange),” Charles Falk, president and chief executive officer of Nybot told reporters and analysts on Friday.“We have the clearing house, but not the electronic platform. ICE have the electronic platform, but not the clearing house, so combining the two makes a lot of sense,” said Mr Falk.Traders said the key attraction of ICE’s purchase of Nybot, through $400m in cash and the issue of equity that equates to 15 per cent of its stock, was Nybot’s own clearing house, the New York Clearing Corporation rather than Nybot’s soft commodities such as coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and orange juice and its financial futures business.This will give the Atlanta-based electronic commodities exchange the flexibility it wants to compete with its bigger rival the New York Mercantile Exchange, which is planning its initial public offering for the end of the year.But it puts into question ICE’s relationship with LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house, that clears all of ICE’s futures including Brent crude oil, and derivatives that are traded through ICE’s over-the-counter market.Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE chairman, said most of the $50m in synergy savings from the deal will come from the $40m a year it pays in clearing fees to third parties. ICE will also have to give 12 months notice to LCH-Clearnet if it wants to move its business.“LCH-Clearnet has been a good partner. They cleared our products when nobody else would, and we would like to continue the relationship with them, but we have to sit down and talk first,” said Mr Sprecher.With ICE potentially having its own clearing house, it is unclear who will ultimately regulate it. ICE Futures, a unit of the Atlantic-based group, is regulated by the Financial Services Authority, because the group’s futures arm in based in London.However, ICE’s grab of more than a third of futures trading in the key US crude oil futures benchmark West Texas Intermediate, has prompted a review of futures exchange regulation.Mr Sprecher said on Friday that ICE will be accountable to both Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the FSA.The deal includes a $37m break-up fee, which would be paid in the event that Nybot accepts a higher bid from a rival exchange.`Nymex, which is also Nybot’s landlord, is understood to be interested in acquiring its neighbour, and the Chicago Board of Trade has also courted the 136-year exchange.“When you are involved in a $1bn transaction, $37m is petty cash,” said one trader from a rival exchange.The deal also depends on obtaining a two-thirds majority from Nybot’s 967 seat-owners, many of whom earn their livelihood from the trading floor.Mr Falk said there was no plan to close the floor. Instead the combined exchange would follow the route of the CBOT and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and operate with the floor open at the same time as the electronic system is live.
674;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-09-15T04:38:13Z;ICE to buy Nybot for $1bn;;The IntercontinentalExchange on Thursday sealed a $1bn agreement to acquire the member-owned New York Board of Trade, heralding another industry push into hybrid electronic and floor-based derivative trading.The planned combination of the two US exchanges continues the flurry of consolidation, alliances and flotations which have transformed the landscape of global financial exchanges over the past two years.Nybot, whose members trade soft commodities such as coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and orange juice, had been courted by several parties including the Chicago Board of Trade and financial buyers.Its decision to pursue a trade sale rather than a public offering could also increase pressure on the industry leaders to intensify the merry-go-round of merger talks already taking place in the financial exchange sector.The Atlanta-based ICE, which listed last November, was courted by the far larger Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The CME baulked at the potential price and has since elected to focus on organic growth and revenue-generating alliances with Reuters and the New York Mercantile Exchange, itself a prospective candidate for an initial public offering.The ICE was an early pioneer in the shift to all-electronic trading, closing its trading floor in a move that highlights the manner in which screen-based execution has widened the global customer base for exchanges.However, the Nybot’s trading floor would be retained under the proposed deal - a hybrid structure adopted by the three main Chicago exchanges and the New York Stock Exchange aimed at targeting traders’ preference for face-to-face execution of more complex transactions.The ICE said it expected $50m in annualised synergies from the deal to be accretive within 12-18 months, providing crucial liquidity in its fierce battle with Nymex for supremacy in the energy derivatives market.The Nymex has allied with the CME, which is hosting the New York group’s core energy products on its electronic platform, side-by-side with floor-based platform.For the ICE, the acquisition would also diversify a product base of exchange-based energy futures and fees from executing deals in the far larger over-the-counter market. Nybot would also bring its control of the New York Clearing Corporation, lessening the ICE’s reliance on outsourcing services to the London-based LCH.Clearnet.The ICE said it expected “clearing synergies” from the deal, noting that its customers paid $36m in clearing fees to the third-party provider over the past 12 months.The success of the ICE in capturing market share from the Nymex in the energy market has fuelled a doubling in its stock price since the November listing, valuing the group at $3.66bn.However, the share price is a quarter below its peak, reflecting pressure on margins as well as the froth in the market created by the takeover battle for Euronext, the European stock and futures exchange being pursued by the NYSE and Deutsche Borse.The ICE is offering 10.297m of its own common shares and $400m in cash for the Nybot, which would become a wholly-owned subsidiary. About 700 people, either commodity traders or former traders on the exchange, own the Nybot’s 967 seats, which represent the equity of the exchange.
675;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-09-13T19:50:01Z;Nybot poised to take ICE’s $1bn takeover offer;;Directors of the New York Board of Trade were poised on Wednesday to accept a takeover offer of about $1bn from fellow commodity exchange, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), in the latest phase of consolidation among stock and futures exchanges.The proposed sale of Nybot – where coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and orange juice trading takes place – comes as commodity exchanges have seen their values soar in the past 18 months on the back of both record trading volumes and commodity prices. ICE shares have risen 150 per cent from their $26 issue price last November.However, it is thought Nybot favours a trade sale over an IPO because it is far smaller than its peers, which include Atlanta-based ICE – where oil, gas and their derivatives are traded – Chicago Board of Trade, Chicago Mercantile Exchange and neighbour the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), which itself is planning an IPO – worth about $4bn-$5bn – by the end of the year.The offer is understood to include a mixture of cash and ICE shares. This will create a tidy windfall for the 124-year exchange’s equity owners. About 700 people, either commodity traders or former traders on the exchange, own Nybot’s 967 seats, which represent the equity of the exchange.It is understood that the offer will also include some commitment to keeping the Nybot trading floor open for a certain length of time. ICE, which bought the London-based International Petroleum Exchange, now ICE Futures, in 2001, became fully electronic last year. Nybot is one of the few major commodity exchanges not to have an electronic trading strategy.The main attraction for ICE, which is the home of Brent crude trading, is the prospect of having its own clearing house, rather than the diversification into agricultural commodities. At present, ICE has to clear all its futures trading through the London-based LCH.Clearnet.Nybot owns New York Clearing Corporation. One person close to ICE said the exchange wants to participate more in clearing services. An exchange with its own clearing house has greater flexibility in launching new contracts, which are becoming more frequent as competition intensifies between exchanges.If Nybot management does opt to go with ICE, it may have to look for a new home.At present, Nybot operates from the same building, the World Financial Center, as Nymex, a rival to ICE and owner of the building. One person familiar with the issue said that there is a clause in the lease agreement that prohibits Nybot to trade competing products.
676;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-07-17T23:11:17Z;Nymex plans $250m IPO on NYSE;;The New York Mercantile Exchange, the largest US physical commodities exchange, on Monday filed with regulators to sell up to $250m in an initial public offering of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.It comes as competition in the US securities exchange arena continues to mount, with a host of exchanges, including the NYSE itself, commodities markets such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade and the Intercontinental Exchange, Nymex’s leading rival in the energy trading market, opting to go public in recent times.The also coincides with a period during which soaring trading volumes for oil and gas futures, such as those traded on the Nymex, on the back of rising geopolitical tension, have pushed energy prices to record highs.The Nymex, which had previously signalled its intention to float this year, said in a registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch would act as lead underwriters for the offering.The filing did not state exactly how many shares the company planned to offer, or their price. Those details can be expected in updates over the coming weeks.The $250m valuation for the IPO was estimated solely for calculating the registration fee, the filing said. Often, the eventual price terms of an IPO offer differ substantially from the valuation in the first registration.Nymex Holdings is the parent company of Nymex, on which customers trade primarily energy futures and options contracts. It also owns Comex, which trades metals futures and options contracts.Nymex said in the filing that it is the largest physical commodity-based futures exchange and clearing house in the world, and the third-largest futures exchange in the US, as measured by 2005 contract volume.“Increased market acceptance and awareness of derivatives, increased price volatility in key commodities, technology advances and reduced regulatory barriers offer significant opportunities for expanding derivative markets,” Nymex said in the filing.Nymex will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling holders.General Atlantic, which owns 10 per cent of the company’s common stock, is the largest single owner of the Nymex. General Atlantic is restricted to a so-called lock-up period and will not be allowed to sell all of its shares in the IPO.The company plans to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NMX.In May, Nymex cut its board by 25 members to 15 and elected a new chairman, clearing an important hurdle to the IPO.Nymex is locked in a battle for market share with its smaller rival the InterContinental exchange, which earlier this year launched an electronic version of Nymex’s flagship West Texas Intermediate crude contract.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat down 0.64 points to 11,014.55, a gain of 1.1 per cent for the week.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, attributed the large dip in the markets to an absence of news about the health of the economy.?The problem was there was no real fundamental data. The markets were trading on momentum,? he said.?Last week we were looking for a bottom; we did the same again this week, and it looks like we found one.

678;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-06-15T16:15:46Z;Gillian Tett: The battle over cyberspace regulation;;When the annals of the Great American and European Exchange Wars are written one day, the saga of ICE will deserve a chapter of its own.“ICE what?” you might ask. For unless you happen to be an energy trader, or live in the US state of Georgia, the workings of ICE – an Atlanta electronic platform also called the Intercontinental Exchange – are not well known.But in recent weeks, ICE has been quietly engaged in a fight that makes the European ambitions of the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq seem almost outdated. Indeed, this battle is so red hot that it has prompted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a US regulator, to hold a hearing starting on June 27 that traders around the world would do well to follow.For what the CFTC will be discussing is whether it is time to redefine the concept of a “US” exchange. Behind that abstract definitional issue lies a second, more explosive, question: should the US regulatory authorities start flexing their muscles over markets outside the US, such as an energy trading platform that ICE runs in London? Until recently, the business of trading oil futures in America was dominated by one main exchange: the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), a doughty 134-year old institution, which famously uses open outcry. But six years ago, a group of investment banks and energy companies created ICE as an electronic energy exchange. In 2001, ICE acquired in the UK the International Petroleum Exchange, which is best known for hosting trade in Brent crude oil futures, the European benchmark.In February, ICE took a stunningly cheeky step: it used its electronic platform to launch its own version of the West Texas Intermediate Crude contract, the US benchmark and a core Nymex product. Even cheekier is that ICE’s WTI prices are settled on Nymex WTI settlement prices, an issue that Nymex tried to protect through the courts, when it made a legal claim that its prices were a trademark and therefore could not be copied by a rival exchange. Nymex lost that battle.Technically, this platform was based in London, at the old IPE, which is now called ICE Futures. Consequently, it fell under the orbit of UK regulators, who have a famously lighter touch than their US counterparts. But because ICE is electronic in nature, its WTI contracts could be immediately accessed by any hedge fund sitting in New York – or Nevada. And these funds have flocked to ICE: these days about a quarter of all WTI futures trades take place in cyberspace via this London platform, rather than in the Nymex pits.Unsurprisingly, Nymex is furious. And in time honoured fashion, it has turned to the regulators for help, claiming that ICE is using “regulatory arbitrage” to win business. As ICE is servicing US customers with a US product – and its headquarters sit in an Atlanta business park – Nymex thinks it should be redefined as a “US” exchange. That could then bring it under US regulatory control, irrespective of the London address.So who will win the fight? Right now, it is unclear. The CFTC has a history of being a relatively level-headed organisation. Consequently, some observers in London hope the furore will quickly melt away. But others fear it might not. After all, there is a distinctly protectionist whiff in Washington these days. And Nymex has impressive lobbying power: by a happy coincidence, the chief executive officer of Nymex is the former chairman of none other than the CFTC.Moreover, even if Washington regulators decide against planting a flag in London, the implications of this debate will not disappear. What the ICE tale shows is just how hard it is to define where an exchange is really based in this age of electronic trading. And the current wave of exchange mergers will make this task even harder in the future.No wonder Sir Callum McCarthy, chairman of the UK’s Financial Services Authority, has been issuing dark warnings in recent days about the implications of a US exchange seeking to purchase the London Stock Exchange. And no wonder many investors and banks quietly admit they want to keep new areas of the financial world, such as credit derivatives, in the over-the-counter space, and thus away from regulated exchanges altogether. Given all the heat being generated by ICE, who can blame them?
679;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Wall Street slides ahead of key inflation data;;US markets ended sharply lower on Monday, extending the sell-off of last week that drove the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its lowest level in four months.Lehman Brothers was unable to inspire investors in spite of better-than-expected results, dragging exchange stocks lower, while stock options investigations depressed Comverse Technologies and Monster Worldwide.Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, fell 5.5 per cent to $62.01 in spite of reporting stronger-than-expected second quarter results. Analysts noted that earnings had dipped from the first quarter, sparking fears that brokerage earnings had run out of steam.The rout in brokerages fed through to the exchange sector. NYSE Group tumbled 7.9 per cent to $52.62 and Nasdaq fell 7.7 per cent to $25.29. Intercontinental Exchange was off 3.6 per cent to $49.00.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.3 per cent, or 15.90 points, at 1,236.40, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.1 per cent, or 43.74 points, at 2,091.32. The Nasdaq Composite is now down more than 5 per cent this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent, or 99.34 points, to 10,792.58.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 2.5 per cent, dipping below 700. Since its peak in May, it has shed 11.8 per cent, whereas the Russell Top 50 Index of the largest companies in the US has lost only 4.5 per cent as large-caps weather the sell-off better than small caps.Recruitment company and advertiser Monster Worldwide sank 8.1 per cent to $38.60, its worst day since April 2005. The company said a committee of independent directors was investigating its stock options grants.The fallout from an investigation into stock options grants also dragged Comverse Technologies down 13.1 per cent to $20.48 after it said it would miss a deadline for filing quarterly earnings.Markets were pre­occupied by crucial May inflation figures expected over the next two days. These could decide whether the Federal Reserve increases US interest rates later this month.“I think people are today positioning themselves with some nervousness,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market is bracing itself for a big week on the economic front. This week is probably going to convince people of what the Fed is going to do. In my opinion, it seems like everyone is bracing for a real negative shock on the inflation front.”Walt Disney was a big drag on the Dow, falling 1.5 per cent to $28.90 after Citigroup downgraded it from “buy” to “hold”.Adobe was the best performer in the S&P 500, gaining 3 per cent to $28.84 on an analyst upgrade.Qualcomm dropped 5.2 per cent to $41.19 after announcing it had filed a complaint for copyright infringement against Nokia.
680;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-06-11T19:16:13Z;Nymex relents and allows electronic trade;;For 23 years the price of oil has largely been determined on the trading floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world’s largest commodity exchange. But that may be about to change from Monday.Until four months ago, Nymex was refusing to join the trend of other commodity, equity and financial derivative exchanges, where trading floors have closed as exchanges realised that a global network of electronic trading screens was able to generate more volume.When Nymex launched the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures contract in 1983, it succeeded in replacing the oil price setting mechanism of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and in turn made consuming countries the oil price setters.Now that oil is a more important financial asset to the investment community, which prefers to trade electronically, Nymex has been forced to change tack.Nymex executives had said that its customers preferred open outcry. However, when its smaller but faster-growing rival IntercontinentalExchange launched an electronic WTI contract in February and grabbed about a third of WTI trade – Nymex’s biggest single market – the New York-based exchange announced plans for electronic trading during the opening hours of its heaving pits.The electronic launch, which started yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Globex system, is likely to cause casualties. About 150 of the 800 brokers and traders on the Nymex floor are execution-only brokers, whose functions can be transferred to screens most easily.The introduction of electronic trading is not the only thing that has upset traders. Nymex’s planned listing by the end of the year is likely to be a cash bonanza for the exchange’s 816 seat owners, who own 90 per cent of its equity, having collectively sold 10 per cent of their interest to General Atlantic, the private equity group, this year.Each seat is worth almost $5m, giving Nymex a pre-listing value of about $4bn. Two-thirds of the seats are owned by former traders who lease their seats to current traders, which means that most of the people working on the Nymex floor do not hold equity in the exchange.The launch is likely to result in electronic trade becoming the preferred way to trade oil, if the CME is any guide.In 2000, electronic trade accounted for 15 per cent of its volumes: last year it was 70 per cent.
681;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-06-06T20:56:14Z;Wall Street falls as downgrades hit confidence;;Wall Street continued to fall on Tuesday, extending losses for a second day. Analyst downgrades also pushed mortgage groups Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lower while a fall in metals prices put pressure on mining stocks.NYSE Group sank 4.7 per cent to $60.50 after Jacques Chirac, French president, said he favoured a merger between Euronext and Deutsche Börse. NYSE last week agreed to buy the Paris exchange for $10.2bn, but Deutsche Börse said it would continue its own attempts to tie up with Euronext.Intercontinental Exchange fell 2.4 per cent to $50.36 and Nasdaq dropped 3.4 per cent to $28.11.“This market has a general malaise about it,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, who believes investors are now watching technical trends in the market for danger signals – such as the S&P 500 slipping below 1,260. “Unfortunately, what happens on a day like today is there are folks who don’t look at the fundamentals, but at the technicals,” said Mr Hogan, who believes such trading feeds on itself.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent, or 1.44 points, at 1,263.85 while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent, or 6.84 points, at 2,162.78.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4 per cent, or 46.58 points, at 11,002.14, at one point dipping below 11,000.Mining stocks were hit as gold and copper both fell. Phelps Dodge shed 1.1 per cent to $82.25 and Alcoa dropped 2.2 per cent to $30.69.A downgrade from Credit Suisse sent Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lower. Fannie Mae lost 1.9 per cent to $49.08, while Freddie Mac lost 3.3 per cent to $58.11. Fannie Mae recently paid a $400m fine to regulators after an investigation into its accounting practices.Homebuilders were also bruised by analyst downgrades. Wachovia cut Pulte, DR Horton and Lennar from “outperform” to “market perform”. Pulte fell 5.5 per cent to $28.11, while DR Horton dropped 5.6 per cent to $23.41, and Lennar fell 3.2 per cent to $45.00.Google rose 4.2 per cent to $389.99 as the internet search company announced that it would introduce online spreadsheet software, potentially offering a free alternative to Microsoft’s Excel.Telecommunications groups were the best performers in the S&P 500.Sprint and Qwest moved higher as the American Civil Liberties Union asked regulators to block the proposed merger of rivals AT&T and BellSouth, pending an investigation into reports the companies inappropriately gave customer calling records to the National Security Agency.Sprint added 3.1 per cent to $21.72, while Qwest jumped 3.1 per cent to $7.63.General Motors dipped 3.1 per cent to $25.25 as Rick Wagoner, chief executive, warned that rising commodity prices would make cost cutting more difficult
682;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-05-31T21:43:30Z;ICE announces plans for first coal futures;;The IntercontinentalExchange on Wednesday announced plans to launch its first coal futures in a move that highlights rising global demand and the growing importance of banks and hedge funds in the energy market.The all-electronic exchange already lists utility-based contracts, including those based on UK natural gas and pan-European emissions, through its ICE Futures unit in London.It aims to tap into the appetite for risk-management and speculative trading tools from producers and end users such as utilities and steel companies, which rely primarily on an expanding array of over the counter products.“Coal is the next step to complete the offering to the utilities’ market,” said Fredrik Voss, head of market development at ICE Futures.The launch, which is subject to regulatory approval, comes weeks after the European Energy Exchange in Leipzig started the region’s first energy futures. The ICE offering is similar to that of its rival, with contracts based on the key coal route of exports from Richards Bay in South Africa to Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The coal market has evolved in recent years from one dominated by long-term bilateral trades, predominantly involving physical delivery, to a more fluid environment underpinned by a market growing at about 1bn tonnes a year.Clean-burning coal has captured a greater share of the power-generation market, spurred by technological advances and the rise of oil and natural-gas prices.“There are more and more short-term spot trades,” said Mr Voss.The global OTC market for coal has climbed from 100m tonnes in 2001 to 700m tones last year in Europe, by far the largest regional segment. Stephen Doyle, head of Doyle Trading Consultants in Denver, estimates this could top 1bn tonnes by 2007.The US OTC market is below the peak hit before the collapse of Enron drove many participants away, but could reach 300m tonnes this year as more financial players spur activity.Mr Voss did not rule out the launch of a US contract. The New York Mercantile Exchange – which is engaged in a fierce battle with the ICE in the oil-futures market – launched its first US coal futures in 2001, but is primarily used as a clearing house for “lookalike” products that have attracted increasing interest from financial traders.“We’ve seen at least five of the major banks enter the market,” said Stephen Nesis, head of the coal desk at Evolution Markets, one of the largest US coal brokers. “Now we are seeing the hedge funds come in.”Mr Nesis said the clearing function had made the market more attractive – about 30 per cent of its business is done through the Nymex – and both the ICE and the EEE hope to expand the existing European market by offering cleared products.“It becomes accessible to those who cannot, or will not, access the OTC space,” said Mr Voss. “We believe we will add new user groups.”Coal prices have historically lacked the volatility seen in other energy sectors, but the combination of tighter global supplies and deregulation of the power markets has seen this increase in recent years.Power generators, industrial users and coal producers still tend to use the expanding OTC market to hedge physical positions, while traders estimate that half of the dealing by financial institutions is for speculation and market-making.
683;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-05-26T20:59:08Z;Wall Street rallies as investors warm to data;;Wall Street finished the week higher as investors chose to read economic data in a largely positive light while crude prices picked up, buoying energy stocks.A steep sell-off in European bourses and in Asia rattled US investors on Monday, but the markets regained their composure later in the week. Investors also paid close attention to the continuing transatlantic flirtation between financial exchanges, and two stock market debuts.Economic data released during the week were mostly interpreted as positive in that they would ease the pressure on the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Sales of durable goods fell more than was expected in April, and gross domestic product growth was more sluggish than had been forecast. However, a rise in core inflation figures on Friday along with greater-than-expected new home sales served as a reminder that inflationary threats had not yet been quelled.“It was a pretty rough week,” said Peter Cardillo, chief equity analyst with SW Bach. “But we’re looking at a market that is beginning to stabilise. I think investor confidence is starting to return.”At the close, the S&P 500 had gained 0.6 per cent, or 7.28 points, up 1 per cent for the week at 1,280.16. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent, or 12.13 points, at 2,210.37, a gain of 0.8 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent, or 67.56 points, to 11,278.61, a gain of 1.2 per cent for the week.Commodities gave investors food for thought as oil and copper rose but gold dropped. Nymex crude gained more than 4 per cent during the week, supporting oil stocks. Oil-field services stocks benefited the most. BJ Services jumped 6.4 per cent to $35.33, and Baker Hughes added 7.1 per cent to $84.42. Copper producer Phelps Dodge jumped 6.3 per cent to $88.26.The acquisition battles in the exchange sector continued as NYSE Group made a $10.2bn offer for Euronext. A sell-off that hit exchange stocks across the world during the week brought NYSE down 4.8 per cent to $61.40, below the price at which it floated in March.Nasdaq, which has recently been building a stake in the London Stock Exchange, was especially volatile, falling 13 per cent by midweek, only to add 10 per cent over Thursday and Friday. It is now down 3.4 per cent to $31.91. Nasdaq has a lower market capitalisation than LSE and the 25 per cent stake it owns in the London exchange constitutes 38 per cent of its own market value.InterContinental Exchange, which includes London’s International Petroleum Exchange, fared the worst, plunging 18 per cent to $57.44.Carmakers were the best performers in the S&P, with the S&P Autos and Components index gaining 5.3 per cent during the week.The sector was led higher by General Motors. Both Merrill Lynch and Prudential upgraded the stock during the week, while the company said it was pleased with the uptake by its employees of buy-out offers designed to cut costs. GM was up 13.8 per cent at $28.08.GM is now trading at its highest level since October 2005.A tie-up between Yahoo and Ebay sent both stocks soaring. Under the terms of the multi-year deal, Yahoo will provide advertising for Ebay, while Yahoo will promote Ebay’s Pay-Pal payment system. Ebay jumped 15.2 per cent to $34.20 while Yahoo gained 11.8 per cent to $33.02.Two stocks made their debut during the week. Vonage, the internet telephony provider, started trading on Wednesday and fell 12.7 per cent in one day, the worst debut for any initial public offering this year. It is down 23.4 per cent at $13.02 for the week.MasterCard followed a day later but proved more popular, jumping 18 per cent in its first day, and was up 15.2 per cent for the week at $44.93.Semi-conductors fared the worst, with chipmakers’ shares the four largest fallers for the week.National Semiconductor was downgraded by Piper Jaffray, and American Technology Research, pushing shares down 7.3 per cent to $25.60.Wal-Mart finished the week up 4.9 per cent to $49.65. The retailer was boosted by the sale of its Korean holdings and a brokerage upgrade from Bank of America.
684;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-05-24T20:57:55Z;Wall St higher as investors try another rally;;Wall Street finished higher on Wednesday as investors attempted another rally after being foiled by Tuesday?s late sell-off.Traders were left with conflicting data to puzzle over. An unexpectedly big drop in durable goods orders for April provided some relief for the market?s fears of higher interest rates. Data on new home sales were stronger than expected.?Durables are too volatile for it to be much of an influence,? said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. ?I think the housing number is more important since even though there was a revision, that pace of new home sales is still very healthy, which is reassuring.?At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent, or 18.97 points, at 11,117.32. The broader-based S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent, or 1.99 points, at 1,258.57, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent, or 10.41 points, to 2,169.17.Nymex crude fell $1.90 to $69.86, dragging down ConocoPhillips 2.5 per cent to $61.15, and Chevron down 0.9 per cent to $57.60.?There was a lot of volatility, and all of a sudden, crude just tumbled,? said Mr Pado.Gold dropped 4.3 per cent, denting mining stocks with Barrick Gold losing 3.4 per cent to $30.06, and Newmont Mining down 3.2 per cent to $49.53.Trading was, however, dominated by the poor market debut for Vonage, the internet telephony provider, after its initial public offering was priced on Tuesday night. Volume in the stock was close to double that of any other on the New York Stock Exchange. By the close, it was down 12.7 per cent at $14.85.Mastercard was still scheduled to make its stock market debut on Thursday in what would be the biggest US initial public offering in two years.Technology stocks were led higher by Microsoft, which gained 3.1 per cent to $23.50. The company has suffered a sharp sell-off in recent weeks, after announcements that it would delay the launch of its new Vista operating system and would spend more on internal investment.General Motors, the stricken carmaker, also continued its recent recovery, surging 8.3 per cent to $26.51, the biggest gainer on the Dow. Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock from ?neutral? to ?buy?.The weak durable goods order might have eased interest rate fears, but it made investors uncomfortable over Boeing which lost 3.3 per cent to $82.38.Medtronic, the medical devices manufacturer, was up 4.6 per cent at $50.17, thanks to an earnings report.Selling of exchange stocks continued, with the worst fall suffered by the InterContinental Exchange, which dropped 7.9 per cent to $53.87. NYSE Group was down 5.4 per cent at $56.80.
685;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Nymex energy futures to trade on CME;;The board of the New York Mercantile Exchange has voted to launch trading of its energy futures contracts on the electronic trading platform of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on June 11.The move comes amid mounting competition in the US energy and commodities trading market from its smaller rival the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).Under the deal, the CME, the largest US futures exchange, will become the sole provider of electronic trading services for Nymex energy derivatives – Nymex is the largest US energy exchange.Electronic trading, on the CME’s Globex 24-hour electronic platform, will run alongside pit trading at the Nymex, a system known as side-by-side trading.Trading of the energy futures will be conducted on the CME’s Globex 24-hour electronic platform.In the initial phase of the launch, Nymex, which is preparing for an initial public offering, said it would offer cash-settled energy futures contracts for all listed months.Nymex miNY futures contracts will also start trading on CME Globex on June 11.For the second phase of the launch, Nymex said it would offer physically delivered energy futures contracts, no later than six months from the launch.The deal will give Nymex the technology to handle expanding electronic trading activity. The CME gains exposure to the increasingly important energy sector.The Nymex is battling for market share with the ICE, which went public last year.ICE this week reported a sharp rise in volumes and open interest on its futures contracts after the launch of a fully electronic benchmark crude oil contract.
686;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-05-10T18:41:16Z;Steep rise in ICE futures contracts;;The Intercontinental Exchange, the Atlanta-based energy and commodities derivatives market, has seen total open interest in its futures contracts rise almost 50 per cent since the start of this year, in a dramatic response to its recent launch of a fully electronic benchmark crude oil contract.The ICE, which went public last year, is engaged in a battle for market share with the New York Mercantile Exchange - Nymex, the largest US energy exchange, which is considering its own initial public offering.February’s launch of an electronic version of Nymex’s flagship West Texas Intermediate WTI crude contract took ICE’s rivalry with its larger competitor to a new level.On May 9, total open interest on ICE stood at 969,008 contracts, up 49.4 per cent compared with 648,585 contracts at December 31, 2005.Total volume in ICE futures markets reached 451,308 contracts, surpassing the May 4 record of 430,939 contracts by 4.7 per cent.The ICE WTI Crude futures contract set a new daily volume record at 157,009, exceeding the April 25 record of 143,455, with open interest standing at 206,300.In terms of overall volume, Nymex remains in front. Exchange - wide futures and options volume on Nymex recently reached a record 1,420,734 contracts.Earlier this month, Nymex said it would list its energy and metal futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s electronic exchange, in a move aimed at fending off competition from the ICE. Under the terms of the deal, the CME, the largest US futures exchange, will become the sole provider of electronic trading services for Nymex energy derivatives.The deal will give Nymex the technology to handle expanding electronic trading activity. The CME gains exposure to the increasingly vital energy sector.Analysts said the Nymex move guarded it against competition with the CME and could give it an advantage over the ICE.The chief executives of the CME and ICE politely exchanged their differing views at a panel discussion in New York earlier this weekCraig Donohue, CME chief executive, made clear the Chicago exchange would embrace a “winner take all” mentality, saying he expected energy traders eventually to move to a single marketplace.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive and chairman of the ICE, said there was room for two large markets.
687;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-05-02T19:33:43Z;Nymex board changes pave way for IPO;;The New York Mercantile Exchange has cut its board by 25 members to 15 and elected a new chairman, clearing an important hurdle before its proposed initial public offering this year.Richard Schaeffer replaces Mitchell Steinhause as chairnan. James Newsome, Nymex chief executive officer, and William Ford, president of General Atlantic, were elected to the board as part of a deal agreed this year with GA, which took a 10 per cent stake for $160m. The reduction in the size of the board was one of the conditions for the GA deal.Nymex received more than 50 board nominations. None of the candidates fielded by former chairman Michel Marks were elected. Another former Nymex chairman, Danny Rappaport was elected under the equity owners category.Meanwhile, Intercontinental Exchange, Nymex’s rival that floated last year, reported record trading volumes and said it might consider a secondary offering in the near future, although it did not elaborate on what the proceeds might be used for.ICE took the rivalry between the two to a new level in February, launching an electronic version of Nymex’s flagship West Texas Intermediate crude contract.ICE said on Tuesday that excluding the WTI contract, futures volume in the first quarter rose 64.1 per cent.Exchange-wide volume at ICE futures exceeded 400,000 contracts for the first time in a single day on April 25, when 407,303 contracts traded. That was also the busiest day ever for the WTI contract, when 143,455 contracts were traded.The burgeoning volumes pushed ICE’s first-quarter profit to $19.7m from $8.9m a year ago. Revenues were up 58 per cent at $50.3m.
688;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-04-18T14:29:33Z;Wall Street rallies on Fed minutes;;Wall Street rallied strongly on Tuesday as solid company earnings and a clear indication from the Federal Reserve that its rate-raising cycle might be near its end helped overcome worries over rising oil prices.The market jumped after the FOMC issued minutes of its latest meeting in which it said the end to rate rises was “likely to be near”.“The market was caught off guard by the dovish statement,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach. “However, if energy prices continue to go up, the Fed will probably continue with its cycle of monetary tightening.”Scott Wren, senior equity strategist, AG Edwards and Sons, was less concerned about spiralling crude prices.Although oil futures settled at a record high of $71.35, Mr Wren said the fact that the core producer price index only increased by 0.1 per cent in March was evidence that higher energy prices had not led to a more generalised inflation.“It’s wage-pushed inflation the Feds will be looking at,” he said. “Three-dollar gas might slow down consumer spending but that’s going be offset by strong economic growth.”The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 1.8 per cent, or 194.99 points, at 11,268.77, its biggest point gain in more than two years.The broader S&P 500 rose 1.7 per cent to 1,307.65, while the Nasdaq composite index jumped 2 per cent to 2,356.14.The Amex oil index gained 1.9 per cent, with bellwether ExxonMobil up 2.3 per cent at $63.49 and oil service provider Schlumberger up 2.9 per cent at $64.41.Rate-sensitive stocks such as financials and homebuilders advanced, while Texas Instruments led chipmakers higher with its 3.8 per cent advance to $33.93.The Philadelphia semiconductor index jumped 3.1 per cent after shedding 1.5 per cent in the previous session.Financials were boosted by Merrill Lynch, which rose 1.2 per cent to $79.38 after the group delivered a record $8bn in quarterly revenue.Wells Fargo also saw first quarter profits rise steeply. The stock gained 0.9 per cent to $65.06.IntercontinentalExchange surged 14.3 per cent to $66.16 after analysts at Bear Stearns initiated coverage on the stock with a favorable rating, citing potential for growth and the exchange’s appeal as a takeover target.Other movers included the internet travel services company Travelzoo. Its first-quarter profits topped analysts’ estimates. The shares soared 43 per cent to $28.59.Yahoo and IBM rose ahead of its first quarter earnings. Yahoo rose 1.1 per cent to $31.30 while IBM gained 2.1 per cent to $83.31.Johnson & Johnson, which topped analysts’ estimates with its first-quarter results, rose 0.8 per cent to $58.13 while Boston Scientific, which reported a small decline in first-quarter profit, rose 1.2 per cent to $21.74.
689;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-04-17T17:53:41Z;Nymex ‘disadvantaged’ by futures rules;;James Newsome, president of Nymex, believes the current rules governing the US futures industry could be giving his main rival, the IntercontinentalExchange, a competitive advantage.He also says that a clarification of the rules could lead Nymex to move some of its operations out of the US.The issue has arisen because the US regulator – the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – is reviewing ICE’s status as a foreign futures exchange in the US.ICE offers its futures contracts in the US under a so-called “no-action” letter from the US regulator, which allows it to offer both local and foreign energy contracts. The letter was originally given to the International Petroleum Exchange, the London commodities futures exchange, in 1999. ICE, which is based in Atlanta, bought the exchange in 2001 and renamed it ICE Futures.This means that in the US regulatory regime, ICE is based in the US but its futures contracts are regulated in the UK by the Financial Services Authority.Mr Newsome’s comments are not entirely free of irony, as he was the person responsible for drawing up much of today’s regulatory framework. The Nymex president joined the exchange in August 2004 after serving as chairman of the CFTC for three years. However, he said circumstances had changed since he chaired the regulatory body.ICE’s UK-based futures exchange has moved from trading the vast majority of volumes physically on the floor in London, to a fully electronic exchange where all trade is matched and executed on ICE’s computer systems in Atlanta. The trades are still cleared through LCH.Clearnet in London.“We have no issues with the FSA or LCH, the issue is for the CFTC to decide whether ICE is a US exchange or a foreign exchange. If it is classed as a US exchange, but is allowed to be regulated by the FSA that is fine. It then gives us some options on where we can list our products and contracts,” he said.These options could include listing its electronically traded futures products through Nymex Europe, its London-based futures exchange business, said Mr Newsome.The regulatory frameworks in the US and UK are similar in most areas, but one key difference is the limit on the volume of futures contracts one investor can hold, which is greater in the UK.The Nymex president also warned that the CFTC’s decision on ICE could pave the way for other futures exchanges operating in looser regulatory environments to launch derivative products in the US market.“Once we start on that slippery slope we could see all sorts of players emerging in the market,” Mr Newsome told the Financial Times during a visit to London.Nymex raised concerns about its Atlanta-based rival’s status in January, when ICE sought permission to launch an electronic version of the West Texas Intermediate crude oil contract, to put it in direct competition with Nymex’s premium product.Since its launch a little more than two months ago, ICE’s new contract has grabbed a 25 per cent market share of the total WTI volume. On Friday it plans to launch a heating oil and gasoline futures contract.The New York-based exchange has responded to the challenge from ICE with its own electronic strategy. It plans to extend electronic trading hours to match its trading hours on the floor, so contracts can be traded simultaneously, or side-by-side. It has also aligned itself with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange by agreeing to put all its electronic futures trade on the CME’s Globex system for a 10-year period.Mr Newsome said the side-by-side trading in its energy products would begin by June 1.Comex will move its out-of-hours electronic trading from the Nymex Access system to Globex in the third quarter, but Comex’s management has yet to decide on introducing side-by-side trading.Nymex and Comex merged in 1994, but Comex retains its own independent management, and is operated separately to the energy business. Mr Newsome said the company sought to change the way Comex’s business was structured. Comex’s 700 seat owners hold the rights to all electronic trade in Comex metal contracts, which include gold, silver and copper.“Now we have the Globex deal complete, our top priority is to change the term sheets of the Nymex-Comex relationship. Obviously under the current structure it is prohibitive to expanding electronic trade globally in Comex contracts if only 700 people have the right to trade,” he said.“We hope to have a resolution in the next 60 days.”Changes to the Comex rules would also affect Nymex’s international plans. Nymex owns half of the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, which plans to launch a gold futures contract, but is restricted from doing so until Comex rules are amended.
690;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-04-07T20:39:21Z;Wall St succumbs to profit-taking;;"The old market adage “buy the rumour, sell the news” was in evidence yesterday as investors took profits after Wall Street’s run up this week in anticipation that the March employment report would come in stronger than expected.Nervousness about a sharp rise in long-dated bond yields provided traders with a further reason to sell. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.9 per cent at 11.120.04, the S&P 500 lost 1 per cent to 1,295.50 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.9 per cent to 2,339.02.The broad-based sell-off capped a week of volatile trading that left the Dow and the S&P 0.1 per cent higher over the five sessions, and the Nasdaq almost unchanged.Christopher Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s investment research, said the
wild intraday swings were due to a tug of war between bulls betting on a strong move higher as the earnings season gets underway on Monday, and bears who believed high interest rates and crude prices and record commodity prices would hurt earnings growth later in the year.“At the moment, I think the bulls have a slight edge over the bears,” he said, citing the absence of negative earnings pre-announcements as a cause for optimism.Energy, material and information technology were the top performing S&P industry groups this week. Shares of mining companies surged as metal prices such as copper and gold hit new highs. Copper producer Phelps Dodge advanced 4.3 per cent to $83.96, gold producer Newmont Miningadded 1.6 per cent to $52.74 and aluminium maker Alcoa jumped 6.3 per cent to $32.50.Energy stocks climbed alongside crude prices. The Amex Oil index rose 2.5 per cent, led by ConocoPhillips, up 4.4 per cent at $65.96.General Motors, which agreed to sell a controlling stake in GMAC, its finance arm, for $7.4bn this week, led the decliners on the Dow.It fell 8.3 per cent to $19.51 as sentiment was undermined by its ongoing dispute with Delphi and news that first-quarter sales fell by 14 per cent. Ford Motor, which reported lower sales, lost 4.5 per cent to $7.60.Merck weighed on the blue-chip index. Shares in the pharmaceutical group lost 2.2 per cent to $34.47 after it was ordered to pay at least $4.5m in compensation to a man who blamed Merck, the maker of Vioxx, for his heart attack.Analysts said the decision could potentially open the door for a new wave of litigation that could result in Merck paying billions of dollars in compensation.Supporting the Dow was 3M, which surged 7.1 per cent to $81.03 after raising its profit outlook for the first quarter. The Post-it Note maker said first-quarter revenue growth was expected to be as much as twice previous estimates while earnings could grow by up to 5.5 per cent.Technology stocks continued to make headway, with Apple Computer leading the way with a 11.3 per cent advance to $69.79.Apple shares soared after it unveiled new software allowing users to run Microsoft’s Windows operating system on its Intel-based Macintosh computers.Analysts said the move was likely to open the door to new Mac converts, although some warned that the gains would not be as swift and dramatic as some expected.“We would not expect any meaningful impact on Mac sales or earnings in the near or intermediate term,” said Rick Sherlund at Goldman Sachs.Google, up 4.1 per cent on the week to $406.16, saw its shares climb back above $400 for the first time since early February as index funds
continued to buy the stock following its inclusion in the S&P 500 index last week.Shares in Intercontinental Exchange, the electronic energy exchange, slumped 23.2 per cent this week to $53 after New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) announced plans to list its benchmark energy products on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the stock, saying the CME-Nymex team-up
“creates a potentially formidable combination that could alter the competitive landscape for the ICE”.“While we continue to believe in the ICE’s solid position in the energy derivatives market, the CME/Nymex partnership may limit further upside in the stock price,” said analyst Camron Ghaffari."
691;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-04-03T23:34:44Z;Nymex to unveil CME energy pact;;The New York Mercantile Exchange is on Tuesday expected to announce plans to list its benchmark energy products on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, highlighting the role that its new private equity shareholder has assumed in shaping strategy.Nymex will outsource all of its electronic trading activities in crude oil and other futures to the CME’s Globex electronic distribution platform, according to shareholders at the New York exchange.Observers view the move as an admission that Nymex – facing intensifying competition from the all-electronic Intercontinental Exchange – cannot move fast enough by itself to introduce electronic trading side-by-side with its existing pits.The deal comes three months after the two exchanges failed to agree on a minority investment by the CME, with Nymex opting to press ahead with the agreed sale of a 10 per cent stake to General Atlantic, the private equity group.Bill Ford, GA’s president, secured a place on the Nymex board as part of the deal, and some market observers view the CME pact as evidence of the firm’s hand in grooming the exchange for an initial public offering this year.However, it is unlikely to entice members of the metals exchange unit at Nymex to move towards electronic trading as they have no equity stake in the business.The CME will secure fees for handling trades in Nymex crude oil and related products on Globex. It would also demonstrate the effectiveness of Globex in attracting and executing energy business ahead of the planned launch of energy products by the CME itself after an existing non-compete agreement with the New York exchange expires in June.“The key will be to show that they have the domain-handling capability,” said Tom Kloet, chief operating officer of Fimat USA, one of the largest futures brokers.The pact will be closely watched for any amendment to the non-compete clause as any CME energy strategy is almost certain to include crude oil. It could damp speculation of a future tie-up between the CME and ICE, which floated last year.ICE intensified the pressure on Nymex in February when it launched an electronic version of the West Texas Intermediate crude contract, the premier product at the New York exchange. However, observers believe ICE will need a more powerful distribution tool – such as Globex – to build on its success since abandoning pit-trading in favour of an all-electronic platform.Nymex declined to comment as did the CME, which on Monday extended the contract of chief executive Craig Donohue by three years until the end of 2009.
692;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-03-21T18:59:10Z;ICE turns up the heat with new futures;;Intercontinental Exchange, the online commodities exchange, said on Tuesday it would launch an electronic version of US heating oil futures and US gasoline futures next month.The new contracts, which will intensify competition with the New York Mercantile Exchange, its bigger rival, will be launched through ICE Futures, formerly the International Petroleum Exchange.Last month ICE launched a West Texas Intermediate contract, the world’s premier energy futures contract.It now has daily volumes of more than 60,000.ICE is launching New York Harbor unleaded gasoline blendstock (RBOB) futures and ICE New York Harbor heating oil futures, along with three spreads, or “cracks”, between new and existing contracts.Nymex is in the middle of phasing out its main gasoline futures contract, unleaded gasoline, which will be replaced by RBOB. Trading volume in the Nymex RBOB contract is about a fifth of that in the main gasoline contract.Nymex’s heating oil contract is threatened by ICE, which has doubled daily volumes in its gas oil contract – the European benchmark for winter fuel prices – in the past year and has surpassed Nymex’s heating oil volumes.“We are pleased to build on the recent success of our new ICE WTI crude futures contract with a variety of new products based on customer demand,” said David Peniket, ICE Futures president and CEO.Since ICE Futures moved fully electronic last April, it has increased its market share against Nymex from below 30 per cent to about 40 per cent by attracting more investors who prefer to trade electronically.
693;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-03-14T20:41:27Z;Nymex prepares to go public;;"The New York Mercantile Exchange looks set to become the next beneficiary of strong investor demand for financial exchanges after shareholders approved the
purchase by General Atlantic, the US private equity group, of 10 per cent of Nymex for up to $170m.Although the transaction values Nymex at $1.7bn, the market value is expected to be far higher by the time Nymex, the world’s largest energy futures exchange and owner of Comex, the metals futures exchange, comes to its initial public offering, scheduled for the end of the year.A better guide for the valuation of the exchange, which is 134 years old, is the sale price of its seats. Each of the 816 seats gives the owner equity in the exchange and exclusive rights to trade on the exchange floor, where the price of West Texas Intermediate, the world’s most closely watched oil benchmark, is set.On Monday – the day that 93 per cent of Nymex shareholders who voted approved the General Atlantic deal – a seat was sold for a record $3.9m, surpassing the previous record of $3.8m set last Friday. This would value Nymex at almost $3.2bn, closer to its probable IPO valuation if current share prices for futures and stock exchanges are a guide.Nymex’s seats represent the entire equity of the exchange. As of Tuesday, seat owners now view the value of their seats split between the equity and the trading component.Bill Ford, GA president, said the size of the vote gave a clear mandate for change. “We see a lot of potential for Nymex, with the introduction of side by side electronic trading and new product innovation,” he said. The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Nymex’s smaller but faster growing competitor, is valued at more than $4bn. Shares in ICE have risen more than 170 per cent since it listed in November, and is worth more than its older rival in spite of having about 40 per cent of the US and European energy futures market compared with Nymex’s 60 per cent.Before Nymex lists, it has work to do. It has to shrink the size of its board from 25 to 15 members, one of the conditions for the GA deal.The exchange’s membership subcommittee meets on Wednesday to accept recommendations for the new board ahead of a vote in May on the board changes.Nymex has received more than 50 board nominations, including applications from Michel Marks and Danny Rappaport, former chairmen. At present, the board is dominated by traders and has no independent directors, leading to accusations that it has been managed as a private members’ club.Mr Ford will join the Nymex board, while the private equity group’s say in the boardroom is expected to be aided by Richard Schaeffer, Nymex vice-chairman, who is expected to oust Mitchell Steinhause as the chairman in the May vote. Mr Schaeffer brought the GA deal to the Nymex board last year.Potential investors in Nymex will be looking for the exchange to provide more clarity on its plans to implement electronic trading side by side with pit trading. The average daily turnover of ICE energy futures has doubled since it switched to a fully electronic exchange last April.Mr Ford said Nymex was likely to copy the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where the floor and electronic trading co-exist.One Nymex shareholder said Nymex had the technology to handle more electronically generated trades but lacked the distribution of its terminals to customers. He said that left the prospect open for Nymex to partner another exchange such as Eurex or Euronext.Liffe where Nymex futures contracts could be traded on the systems of other exchanges."
694;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-03-07T18:01:08Z;Electronic trade lifts ICE volumes;;ICE Futures, formerly the International Petroleum Exchange, has increased its share of the global energy futures market to about 40 per cent since it moved to full electronic trading last April.That compares with less than 30 per cent in March 2005, the last full month before it went electronic, according to PVM, a London energy futures broker.PVM’s estimates show that ICE Futures, which is owned by the Atlanta online commodities exchange Intercontinental Exchange, is gaining market share on its bigger rival, the New York Mercantile Exchange.It has been helped by the launch last month of an electronic version of the West Texas Intermediate futures, the flagship contract of its bigger rival Nymex.Following its launch ICE’s WTI contract attracted average daily volumes of about 44,000 contracts.Figures for March show ICE’s new contract has achieved average daily volumes of more than 50,000 contracts, or about 15 per cent of Nymex’s WTI daily volumes.Nymex still controls about 60 per cent of the energy futures market and is experiencing higher volumes now than it did 12 months ago.Trading volumes on both ICE and Nymex are more closely watched: competition between the two exchanges has intensified over the past 18 months with Nymex relaunching its Brent contract in Europe against ICE’s contract of the same name.Volume growth is also important to the valuation of both exchanges.ICE listed its shares of the New York Stock Exchange in November, and Nymex plans an initial public share offering by the end of the year. Next Monday, Nymex shareholders will vote on a move by General Atlantic, the private equity group, to buy a 10 per cent stake of the exchange.PVM said in a note to clients that daily volumes on ICE’s crude futures contracts averaged more than 200,000 in February, more than double the average in March 2005.During the same period, Nymex’s crude futures volume has risen to more than 300,000 contracts a day from about 250,000.ICE’s gasoil contract, which is an indicator for European winter fuel, has seen its daily volumes almost double in the past year to more than 65,000 contracts, overtaking Nymex’s competing contract, heating oil, for the first time.Nymex heating oil futures was the first energy contract the exchange launched when it listed in 1978.
695;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-03-07T14:08:50Z;Profile: Richard Ward;;Despite his lack of experience in the insurance industry, Richard Ward has been named as the new chief executive of Lloyd’s, as the world’s oldest insurance market looks to overhaul its business practices in the face of competition from rival markets such as Bermuda.Previously, he worked as chief executive of the International Petroleum Exchange until it was taken over by the Intercontinental Exchange last year.It is understood that ICE did not want a second chief executive to Jeffrey Sprecher, so Mr Ward’s role was downgraded to the role of vice-chairman.During his six years as head of the IPE, Mr Ward oversaw a significant period of change during which the exchange was taken over and its open outcry trading system overhauled to become a fully electronic operation ahead of the move by the New York Mercantile Exchange to open a rival exchange in London six months ago.Despite some teething difficulties when human error halted trading for a few hours and fierce opposition from floor traders, volumes at the IPE have risen by more than a third since it went fully electronic in April. This modernisation in the face of international competition is what is likely to have impressed Lloyd’s.Mr Ward became IPE chief executive after setting up an innovative gas futures market while working in business development.Prior to moving into financial services, Mr Ward worked for BP, initially as manager of a large analytical research and development department within BP Group Research before being appointed head of business development at its oil trading business.His early career was spent as a scientist at the Science and Engineering Research Council.
696;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-03-06T22:06:02Z;Nymex abandons plan for London floor trading in oil;;An ambitious attempt to re-introduce floor trading in oil contracts in London by the New York Mercantile Exchange is to be abandoned.Nymex intends soon to close its pit-trading floor for energy futures in London and shift to electronic trade. The move comes six months after launching the floor in London.Nymex has failed to attract significant trading volumes in its European benchmark Brent crude contracts since opening the London floor. The operation had been seen as one of a string of open out-cry trading floors Nymex intended to open round the world to take advantage of the increased trading in energy. These plans have now been curtailed.Nymex spent millions of dollars opening the London floor with a capacity for about 100 traders using sophisticated telephone and computer systems. Most of the trade now handled by the handful of traders who remain in the Nymex London pit is via screens.However, Nymex, the world’s biggest energy futures exchange, has no plans to quit the European market and is looking to establish a market in Russian Urals crude and other energy products to take on its London rival ICE Futures, formerly the International Petroleum Ex-change, which is owned by IntercontinentalExchange.ICE Futures became fully electronic last April and its daily volumes in its premium contract, Brent, have risen by more than 60 per cent. “Brent will go electronic,” said Andy Gooch, chief executive of Nymex Europe. He added that the exchange had many options, including the possibility to be the home for all of the electronically traded energy futures contracts operated by its parent.

698;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-02-08T20:01:11Z;Futures in WTI go electronic at Nymex;;"The New York Mercantile Exchange has confirmed it plans to offer electronic trading in its flagship futures contract in West Texas Intermediate crude oil alongside its traditional floor trading from the second quarter of this year.The Nymex board also approved a revised offer from General Atlantic, the private equity group, which will pay $160m for a 10 per cent stake in the 134-year-old exchange.This compares with an original offer of $135m for the stake.The exchange said General Atlantic would pay an extra $10m under three conditions: Nymex’s 816 shareholders must vote to back the offer by March 15; hold an annual meeting to reduce the size of its board from 25 to 15 by May 1; and complete an initial public offering at a $2bn valuation or more by the year-end.The proceeds will be distributed to Nymex shareholders through a cash distribution of about $196,000 per share and the additional $10m investment will be
distributed in a special dividend of about $12,255 per share.Nymex said the revised definitive agreement contained provisions to support and protect open outcry trading, including a requirement for financial support for technology, marketing and research for open outcry.The provisions also state that core futures and options contracts may not be eliminated without a vote by trading rights holders, as long as specified liquidity requirements are met.“If the exchange ever terminates open outcry trading of a particular product, trading rights owners will receive a 10 per cent royalty payment based upon the electronic trading of that product,” Nymex said.The move to expand Nymex’s electronic trading in WTI follows the launch last Friday by rival commodities exchange IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) of
an electronic WTI contract.The new contract has attracted daily volumes that equates to almost 10 per
cent of Nymex’s daily WTI turnover.Separately, Dubai Mercantile Exchange, a joint venture between Nymex and Dubai Holding, a company owned by Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, said it plans to open the Middle East’s first energy futures exchange in the fourth quarter. Originally the partners had planned to open the DME early this year.Trading on the new exchange will be mostly electronic, along with its “trading hubs”, featuring four to six seats where traders can manage trades.The DME plans to launch with a sour-based crude oil contract to reflect the
type of oil produced in the region."
699;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-02-06T19:10:40Z;Nymex joins electronic revolution;;The New York Mercantile Exchange has always done business its own way. Over the past two years it has pursued a global strategy of opening up satellite energy futures trading floors as the world’s other futures markets were going increasingly electronic.Now, Nymex appears ready to accept that electronic trading is the future. Any day, it is expected to announce formally that it will introduce electronic trading alongside its pit trading this spring.Nymex shareholders say that the move mirrors that of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, which have both introduced electronic trading side by side with their pit trading. The CME introduced electronic trading in 1990 and the CBOT in 2000, and it now accounts for about 70 per cent of business on both exchanges.Although Nymex insiders claim that the issue has been debated for some time at boardroom meetings, the admission last week by Nymex shareholders that the exchange intended to introduce parallel trading follows a week in which competitors increasingly encroached on its turf. Its closest rival, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the Atlanta online commodities exchange, last Friday launched an electronic version of West Texas Intermediate, the world’s most prominent oil futures contract and the flagship contract for Nymex.“This was not prompted by ICE, but it has been under discussion for months,” said one Nymex shareholder. “In fact the pressure came from the floor, where many of the floor community thought that it was a good idea to have the two together as it may create more liquidity.”The launch has also stirred up a debate about regulation of the WTI contract, which is the world’s most popular reference price for oil. ICE launched its new contract through its UK arm, ICE Futures, formerly the International Petroleum Exchange, which is regulated by the UK’s Financial Services Authority.Nymex shareholders say that this gives ICE an unfair advantage because the FSA does not place an upper limits on investors’ holdings of energy contracts, whereas the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has imposed limits. Nymex has threatened to move its electronic trading business to London in order to compete with ICE under the same regulations.“Moving the [electronic trading] business offshore is a real issue and something the board is looking at very closely,” said the shareholder. “However, we don’t want to get into a row with the CFTC because that will not be good for business.” James Newsome, Nymex president, was formerly the CFTC chairman. Nymex has a trading floor in London, which was opened last year after ICE closed its London oil futures trading pits where its premier contract Brent crude was traded.However, Nymex’s Brent volumes have been poor because many former London-based floor traders have migrated their oil trading activities to the screen.On its first day, ICE’s new product traded more than 38,000 contracts, or about 10 per cent of Nymex’s daily volume for its WTI contract. The launch came three days after Craig Donohue, CME chief executive officer, said the exchange was finalising its energy markets strategy.“We believe there is a lot of growth opportunity in the energy market, particularly related to electronic trading,” said Mr Donohue.CME and Nymex fell out last month when talks about the CME buying a 10 per cent stake in its rival broke down.A non-compete clause between the two ends on June 6, leaving the CME free to pursue its energy strategy. “They [CME] are very serious. They see energy as the missing piece in their suite of products,” said one industry consultant.The increased competition for Nymex comes when shareholders of the exchange, which is 134 years old, are considering the sale of 10 per cent of the exchange to private equity group General Atlantic for $170m.Shareholders have yet to vote on the proposed partial sale to General Atlantic, which increased its original offer by $35m.“Nymex has a lot of issues up in the air – the threat of CME coming in, ICE launching WTI and the General Atlantic deal. It is sending them into panic mode,” the industry consultant said.Additional Reporting by Doug Cameron
700;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2006-02-03T23:51:59Z;Nymex poised for electronic trading push;;The New York Mercantile Exchange, one of the last bastions of face-to-face trading, could within a month offer electronic trading alongside its famous open outcry pits, seatholders said on Friday.The world’s largest energy exchange is also looking for international partners to broaden its electronic offering, seatholders said.The development is another sign of the speed at which electronic trading is sweeping aside decades of trading pit transactions. The news came as the InterContinental Exchange (ICE), Nymex’s all-electronic rival, on Friday launched its biggest attack on the New York exchange by offering its own electronic version of the Nymex’s flagship West Texas Intermediate crude futures.Nymex, with roots in a butter, cheese and egg exchange founded in 1872 by a group of Manhattan dairy merchants, is expected to go public this year.Seatholders said the board decided on Wednesday to go ahead with the side-by-side electronic trading following pressure from members. Its smaller, “mini” contracts are currently traded electronically, but its benchmark energy products trade in the famously crowded pits. Seatholders said Nymex was looking for international partners with strong electronic trading capabilities.A Nymex spokesperson on Friday declined to comment, saying only that the exchange “continued to evaluate ways to expand on the success that we have”.Nymex is believed to be close to selling a 10 per cent stake to General Atlantic, a private equity group. GA was instrumental in the merger of the floor-based New York Stock Exchange with the all-electronic Archipelago in a deal that should close soon and will lead to a hybrid trading model.Any move by Nymex’s flagship crude and natural gas contracts electronically would be considered a blow to the remaining advocates of floor-based trading. Nymex’s neighbour and fellow floor-based trading hold-out, the New York Board of Trade, last month announced it would partner with the Chicago Board of Trade to offer its financial futures electronically. Both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the CBOT are overwhelmingly electronic.A switch to electronic by Nymex would increase pressure on the NYSE to follow suit.Nymex is also discussing the possibility of moving its electronic platform to London. to put it under the regulatory scrutiny of the UK’s Financial Services Authority which would put it on an equal footing with its rival ICE. The FSA and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission have slightly different regulatory requirements.
701;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2005-11-16T15:48:42Z;ICE shares soar in Wall St debut;;Shares in the IntercontinentalExchange surged more than 60 per cent in their first morning of trading after the energy derivatives specialist was valued at $1.44bn in the pricing of the offering.By mid-morning on Wednesday, ICE shares had risen 63 per cent to $42.50. The rally follows a successful initial public offering from CBOT Holdings, owner of the Chicago Board of Trade and a leading futures exchange.The successful IPOs underscore investor appetite for a slice of the derivatives market, whose dramatic growth has outstripped the equities market. They also reflect the resilience of the futures industry after the debacle last month at Refco, the bankrupt financial services group.The world’s second-largest energy exchange this week raised the indicative range for the offering by a third and boosted the issue size by 60 per cent, reflecting investor demand for both fast-growing derivatives and the buoyant commodities sector.The net proceeds will also provide ammunition for the exchange’s battle with the New York Mercantile Exchange, its larger rival.Nymex, which has courted ICE for many years, on Tuesday finalised its sale of a 10 per cent stake to General Atlantic for $135m, pricing in line with the value of its smaller rival. It said it would pursue an IPO next year.ICE also owns ICE Futures, formerly known as the International Petroleum Exchange. It took the custodian of the Brent crude futures market all-electronic earlier this year, while Nymex opened an open-outcry pit in London last month. Investor interest in the derivatives sector has been buoyed by the performance of the Chicago Board of Trade, the third-largest futures exchange, whose shares have more than doubled since an IPO last month.The share price of the second-ranked Chicago Mercantile Exchange has tracked record highs in recent weeks and climbed more than 10-fold since its flotation in December 2003.The ICE raised its indicative pricing from $18-$20 a share to $24-$26 a share on Monday and lifted the offer size from 10m to 16m shares, of which 13.5m are being sold to existing shareholders. The underwriters have the option to purchase an additional 2.4m shares to cover overallotments.Nymex commands more than 60 per cent of global energy futures contracts but the ICE’s Brent business is a fast-growing operation.
702;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2005-10-17T18:47:56Z;ICE to make waves with flotation;;The Intercontinental Exchange, the world’s second largest energy futures exchange, has unveiled a planned initial public share offer that could raise up to $230m. If successful, the offer would value the exchange at more than $1.1bn, a price that would put it beyond the clutches of its bigger rival, the New York Mercantile Exchange, which has long sought to buy ICE.The proposed ICE flotation, announced late Friday, is expected in the next four weeks. ICE shares were given an indicated value of $18-$20 apiece. The float comes with futures and derivative exchanges in high demand among equity investors encouraged by the meteoric rise in the share price of Chicago Mercantile Exchange since it listed four years ago.ICE, less than a decade old, may not be as well known as its peers, some of which have been around for more than a century. Despite recent setbacks to some futures exchanges caused by the Refco scandal, ICE hopes to take advantage of the high multiples investors are willing to pay for a stake in futures exchanges.The valuation of ICE puts it not too far below the value placed on Nymex, the world’s largest commodity exchange, by a proposed offer for 10 per cent of the exchange from General Atlantic. The offer, valuing the stake at $135m, has been approved by the Nymex board but has yet to be voted on by shareholders.Nymex commands more than 60 per cent of global energy futures contracts, as well as boasting a subsidiary, Comex, that is the world’s largest precious metals futures exchange. But ICE is hoping its strategy of electronic-only trading provides it with greater growth opportunities than its rival, which has stubbornly stuck with the open outcry that has been abandoned by most exchanges.“ICE has had a phenomenal year. They are a lower cost operator than Nymex, and they have positioned themselves well in the OTC market, which has been growing faster than the futures market,” said one former futures exchange executive.Nymex has been trying to buy ICE and its International Petroleum Exchange subsidiary, the custodian of Brent trading, for five years. In a letter to shareholders last week, Michel Marks, a former Nymex chairman who continues to hold a significant Nymex stake, said Nymex should buy ICE before Nymex floats.ICE was behind the decision to close the IPE’s London trading floor in April after 25 years of pit trading, leaving the IPE as an electronic-only exchange. After an initial dip in trading volume following the floor closure, volumes for its key Brent futures contract have increased by a third to an average of 183,000 contracts a day during September.The increase in IPE’s Brent futures trading volume has made it difficult for Nymex, which opened a trading floor in London last month to great fanfare and with the mission to revive open outcry energy trading in London. Nymex Brent trading volumes have slowed dramatically from the 16,591 contracts on the first day.The IPE business now vies with ICE’s rapidly growing over-the-counter energy derivative trading business as the biggest single contributor to the Atlanta-based exchange’s operations. ICE claims it now clears – a function where an exchange settles trades as well as taking on the financial risk should one trading party default – about 78 per cent of all OTC natural gas trade in the US and 64 per cent of the power market for central and eastern US states.ICE had a small presence in the US power market three years ago, while OTC trades in the US natural gas have tripled in the first six months this year.The decision to go ahead with a flotation followed a US court decision on September 30, which rejected Nymex’s claims of copyright and trademark infringement by ICE for ICE’s use of Nymex’s settlement prices in electronic energy trading and clearing operations.ICE gave no indication of timing for its float, but its announcement comes just ahead of the Chicago Board of Trade listing tomorrow. The CBOT has raised $126.5m from selling a 6 per cent stake, valuing the CBOT at more than $2.1bn.The planned IPO would mark an attractive return for its shareholders, which include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BP Royal Dutch Shell, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale, which backed ICE five years ago.Goldman, Morgan Stanley and the investment banking arm of Société Générale are on the ICE float underwriting team.ICE plans to sell 2.5m new shares in the float to raise a maximum of $50m, which would be used to pay debts. ICE shareholders plan to sell 7.5m shares, raising $150m. Morgan Stanley and Goldman will have the option to buy another 1.5m shares to cover over-allotments.
703;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2005-07-13T21:45:50Z;Record volumes revealed by IPE;;The International Petroleum Exchange, the custodian of the Brent crude oil futures contract, said its benchmark contract struck record volumes this week, rising almost 90 per cent from the daily average before the London exchange moved to fully electronic trading in April.IPE, owned by the Intercontinental Exchange in Atlanta, said Brent volumes reached 185,144 contracts on Tuesday, exceeding the previous record of 181,182 contracts last September.IPE thinks electronic trading in commodities will attract more customers such as hedge funds, which are used to trading other assets, such as equities, bonds and currencies, via electronic systems.IPE’s increase in trading volume adds to the challenge rival New York Mercantile Exchange faces in its attempt to market grab share from the IPE in the Brent contract.Nymex has built a new trading floor for open-outcry trading in London in an effort to take the IPE head-on, but is yet to win regulatory approval from the UK’s Financial Services Authority. Nymex has a functioning open-outcry trading floor in Dublin where year-to-date volumes were 5,260 contracts a day, compared with Reuters estimates that IPE Brent volumes averaged more than 111,000 contracts a day.James Newsome, Nymex president, last week admitted the exchange’s task was becoming harder as more traders got used to trading Brent electronically.The rise in IPE Brent volumes has also narrowed the gap with Nymex’s benchmark crude futures contract, West Texas Intermediate, the world’s most actively traded crude contract. It recorded volumes of 302,999 contracts on Tuesday.
704;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2005-06-30T15:46:34Z;Nymex admits its London struggle;;The New York Mercantile Exchange conceded on Thursday that establishing a strong presence in the Brent crude futures market in London was becoming more difficult as it awaited regulatory approval, while volumes continued to rise at its electronic rival, the International Petroleum Exchange.Nymex plans to open an open-outcry exchange in London to try and wrest control of trade in Brent futures away from the IPE, which closed its trading floor in early April. In the interim, Nymex has established a Brent futures trading hub in Dublin with mixed success.James Newsome, president of Nymex, said the task was becoming harder as more traders got used to trading Brent electronically.“It gets more and more difficult (to take business) as time goes by,” Mr Newsome said at a derivatives conference in London on Thursday.The IPE, wholly-owned by Atlanta-based commodities exchange Intercontinental Exchange, has seen a rise in Brent futures daily trading volumes to about 130,000 contracts a day, compared with 100,000 a day before the IPE moved electronic.Brent volumes in May were almost 2.5m, compared with 2.2m in March, the last month of open-outcry trade. Mr Newsome said Nymex’s Brent volumes in Dublin have averaged between 5,000 and 20,000 contracts a day since opening in November. Nymex is the world’s largest energy futures exchange and is the custodian of the US benchmark, the West Texas Intermediate contract.Mr Newsome said Nymex was also considering offers from private equity companies for a minority interest in the exchange. “Any deal would be with a view to doing an IPO (initial public offering),” he said. Blackstone and Battery Ventures are said to be seeking to buy a 20 per cent stake in Nymex for about $185m.Nymex said in May it had spoken with other exchanges about a possible tie-up, but the only futures exchange to say it was interested in buying into Nymex was the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The CME has become the most likely partner for the Chicago Board of Trade, which said earlier this week that it had received a financial offer from a third party.“All futures exchanges are talking to everybody at the moment,” Mr Newsome said. Nymex has said it will decide over the summer its future financial options.Roy Leighton was made chairman of Nymex Europe, the subsidiary spearheading Nymex’s move into London. Mr Leighton is also chairman of the UK’s Futures and Options Association.
705;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2005-03-23T22:06:57Z;Nymex to discuss possible IPO;;"Members of the New York Mercantile Exchange have been called to a special meeting to discuss the exchange's possible plans for an initial public offering and increasing threats from competing exchanges, its largest participant said on Wednesday.Mark Fisher, an independent trader who runs MBF Clearing Corp, said he had issued a call for the exchange's members to meet on March 30.""The exchange is at a critical juncture,"" said Mr Fisher, whose firm is also the largest clearing member of the exchange.The development comes as Nymex, the largest energy futures exchange in the world, faces competition on multiple fronts and is considering joining other US exchanges in pursuing an IPO.On Tuesday, Atlanta-based rival the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) filed with regulators to raise up to $115m in an IPO.That could strengthen its hand against Nymex, which plans to launch an ""open outcry"" Brent crude trading pit in London soon, in competition with the International Petroleum Exchange. The London exchange, which has been owned by ICE since 2001, is moving rapidly to switch from ""open outcry"" to electronic trading.The issue of ""ICE vs. Nymex"" was one item the agenda issued by Mr Fisher.Mr Fisher told the FT: ""Hopefully as many members and lessees and equity owners will show up as possible. We are the largest volume participant [on Nymex] so I thought we'd do something about it. It's the right time.""He declined to say what he expected from the meeting.A Nymex spokeswoman said: ""It's not an exchange meeting, it's just a private business owner holding a meeting.""Other issues on the agenda were Nymex and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which has said it is interested in expanding into energy futures.Next week, it will launch an electronically-traded ethanol futures contract that will compete with a rival ethanol futures contract that started trading in open outcry on Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.Nymex has 816 seats, although members may own multiple seats. A seat on Nymex last sold for $1.9m, compared to $675,000 in 2000."
706;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2005-03-07T13:38:17Z;IPE to shut open outcry and go fully electronic;;The International Petroleum Exchange said on Monday it plans to shut its open outcry trading floor in London on April 7 in a move to full electronic trading of its energy futures contracts, including Brent crude futures.The closure comes ahead of a planned opening of an open-outcry trading floor in London by IPE’s larger rival, the New York Mercantile Exchange later this year. The all electronic exchange will open on April 8.“The board’s decision has been taken to maintain and enhance the competitive position of the IPE as well a to take advantage of the greater acceptance and adoption of electronic trading,” the IPE said.The IPE closed its morning open-outcry trading session last autumn in an effort to increase electronic trading volumes, which at the time had only amounted to 4 per cent of total daily volumes. IPE management have been encouraged by the transition with volumes in the morning session now at the level traded when the floor was open.The exchange hopes to repeat the same trend for the whole day.Another contributing factor to the closure was the decision last week by the IPE’s parent the Intercontinental Exchange, the Atlanta-based online commodities exchange, to make a initial public share offering.Traders said the IPE wanted to avoid a costly battle with Nymex by keeping its trading pits open.IPE’s main contract Brent futures is a key benchmark for oil exporters in the Middle East, but is less traded than Nymex’s West Texas Intermediate crude futures contract.
707;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2005-03-03T17:07:31Z;Oil exchange plans IPO as crude reaches record;;The battle for control of the global energy trading market intensified on Thursday as Intercontinental Exchange, owner of the International Petroleum Exchange in London, outlined plans to hold an initial public offering.The plan comes as the IPE, Europe?s largest oil futures market, faces the prospect of a new exchange launch in London from US rival Nymex.Interest in the commodity exchanges has intensified in recent years as oil and metal prices have risen to record levels, driven by demand from China and supply shortages.Oil reached its highest level since October 27 in trading on Thursday.Brent crude futures on IPE rose to a record $52.25 a barrel, surpassing its previous high of $51.94 a barrel.US light crude was trading at $53.65 a barrel having gained almost 17 per cent in three weeks as colder weather gripped Europe and the north-eastern US.Atlanta-based Interncontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the exchange that offers over-the-counter trading in oil, gas and power derivatives, as opposed to the traditional open-outcry system of trading, said it plans to file a registration document with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator, in the ?next several weeks.?Plans by rival Nymex for global domination of commodities trading was dealt a blow in 2001 when ICE acquired the US exchange?s London rival, IPE, which trades the benchmark Crude futures contract, for an undisclosed sum.But ICE?s plans to replace open-outcry trading with a more efficient electronic alternative within a year of the deal, stalled in the face of growing opposition from users of the London exchange.In November, ICE introduced a system which restricted open-outcry trading to the afternoon session in an attempt to boost volumes and win over clients to over-the-counter trading.The Nymex exchange, which offers the benchmark West Texas Intermediate futures contract as well as the Brent crude contract, processes an average of 250,000 contracts a day compared to 100,000 contracts on the IPE.The London exchange was thought to have planned a board meeting for later on Thursday to discuss the IPO plans of its parent and further moves towards the complete removal of open-outcry trading.Separately, ICE released results for 2004 which showed electronic trading grew as a share of the total number of contracts traded on the IPE to 27.2 per cent in January compared to 2.8 per cent the previous year.The parent group reported full-year revenues of $108.4m, up from $93.7m in 2003. Consolidated net income almost doubled to $22m from $13m the previous year.
708;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2005-02-16T20:56:40Z;Energy traders enter next battle phase;;"The focus of New York Mercantile Exchange's move to London is the battle to win control of the Brent crude oil futures market, the domain of the UK-based International Petroleum Exchange.But the rivals also face a skirmish over the business of clearing both over-the-counter and exchange-traded energy derivatives contracts.Both Nymex and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), IPE's parent, have benefited from a growing trend to the outsource the financial risk attached to trading in the unregulated OTC markets for power, gas and oil.This has facilitated strong growth in the clearing of energy trades in the OTC market, which is twice the size of the futures market.Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, said banks, utilities, energy trading houses, shippers and gas and oil producers - and increasingly hedge funds - no longer want to tie their balance sheet up to provide collateral for underwriting OTC trades. Instead, they pay a fee for a third party, such as an exchange, to take the risk in the event that the other side to the trade is unable to fulfil its financial obligation.By freeing up their balance sheets, market participants can conduct more trades, Mr Sprecher said. ""It's a good business for the exchanges right now, and it looks like it will continue to grow as more traders see it as a economical way to trade OTC,"" he said.Many OTC traders avoid bilateral clearing agreements as it takes time to separately negotiate the terms with all the counterparties they trade with, which number in the hundreds for some active traders.New technology has also made third-party clearing easier. ICE provides customers with a choice of electronic or bilateral clearing, whereas Nymex uses a network of voice brokers, including ICAP, which are active in OTC trading and increasingly use the Clearport electronic platform to clear the trades.The latest published figures from Nymex show OTC clearing volumes more than quadrupled over the 11 months to November 2004, while ICE's volumes tripled over the same period. Meanwhile, executives say the market is still in its early stages of development.Joseph Raia, vice-president marketing at Nymex, said the success of Clearport had prompted the exchange to extend its clearing business into shipping freight swaps, and European petroleum product swaps. The OTC market has largely recovered from the exit of energy merchants such as Enron, Mirant and Dynergy from business in 2001, when Enron, the market leader, collapsed.US traders are used to outsourcing their clearing business, a concept initially developed by Enron. However, European traders have so far been reluctant to embrace exchange clearing, instead continuing to trade OTC through bilateral risk agreements.""The need to remove any threat of balance sheet damage is another reason why US traders are happy to let someone else worry about the clearing,"" one exchange executive said.The growth in OTC clearing has also changed the way futures exchanges view the market. Instead of considering OTC trading as a threat, they now see it as a growth area.Unlike Nymex, ICE is not a clearing house. Instead, ICE funnels all its clearing traffic to LCH.Clearnet in which it, along with EuronextLiffe and the London Metal Exchange, has a minority stake.Executives from both exchanges say there is plenty of scope for growth for clearing OTC trades.However, LCH.Clearnet and Nymex are also poised to become rivals in the more competitive market of clearing energy futures when Nymex, which plans to open its London futures exchange later this year, starts clearing all its futures trades through its clearing house in New York. If Nymex succeeds in capturing a large slice of the London Brent futures market, it will threaten LCH.Clearnet's clearing volumes."
709;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2004-09-28T18:47:36Z;Total might sue ICE over B-share payments;;Total, the French oil group, has threatened to launch legal action against InterContinentalExchange, the online commodities exchange, over its plan to pay out $67.5m to its B shareholders.The move by Total, one of the original backers of ICE when the exchange was set up in May 2000, adds uncertainty to the payment to the B shareholders.ICE first mooted the payment in June in an effort to appease discontented shareholders. They have yet to receive any money for selling their interests three years ago in the London-based International Petroleum Exchange, the world's second-largest energy futures exchange.The original payment was conditional on the IPE moving to electronic trading.IPE members, many of whom are B shareholders, received a letter this week highlighting the latest twist to this long-running saga.The letter said that the payment had been held up because of the threat of legal action by one of the A shareholders on ICE and its directors, and that any decision had to wait until the issue was resolved.Although Total was not mentioned by name in the letter, sources close to the IPE said that the French company was behind the threat after voting against the proposal this month.Total, which owns about 4 per cent of ICE, would make no comment. A spokeswoman for ICE said that the exchange would not comment on any potential litigation issues, and was working hard to settle the dispute.Total's stance is in contrast to the overwhelming majority of shareholders - more than 90 per cent of both A and B classes - of the Atlanta-based commodities exchange who approved the payment. ICE's other shareholders include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and BP.Total has taken the view that ICE was under no obligation to make the payment to B shareholders because the original criterion for making the pay-out was not met. As part of the takeover, ICE promised to pay the B shareholders 12 months after the IPE had gone fully electronic.The lack of any cash payment since the takeover from ICE had created friction between IPE members and its owners, which led to ICE's decision to waive one of its original takeover conditions in order to allow early payment to B shareholders.Following this decision, IPE's management decided to shorten the opening hours of pit trading from November 1 in an effort to stimulate more screen trading, which only accounts for 4 per cent of total IPE turnover in Brent crude oil contracts.
710;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2004-08-08T20:33:48Z;Nymex turns down $1.6bn offer;;The New York Mercantile Exchange has turned down a takeover bid from a private equity firm valuing the world's largest energy futures exchange at about $1.6bn.The decision announced on Friday comes just days after James Newsome, the former head of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission and Nymex's regulator, took his post as the new president of the exchange.Mr Newsome was appointed Nymex president after the departure of Robert “Bo” Collins, who favoured the transaction with Parthenon Capital, a Boston private equity firm. People close to Nymex have said the Parthenon proposal caused a rift between Mr Collins and Mitchell Steinhause, the Nymex chairman.At a meeting with reporters last week, Mr Steinhause said he thought the members would not want to support the Parthenon deal, in which the private equity firm would have acquired 60 per cent of Nymex.The offer valued each of the Nymex's 816 seats at $2m. The eventual conclusion of the Parthenon deal was seen as the demise of the open-outcry, floor-based trading model at the Nymex and people close to the exchange said Mr Steinhause opposed it.Nymex has so far made little attempt to move towards full electronic trading, unlike its smaller rival the International Petroleum Exchange in London, which plans to reduce the opening hours of its trading floor in an effort to migrate more trading volume to its electronic system.Nymex has made a takeover bid for IPE's parent, the IntercontinentalExchange, valuing the Atlanta-based company at between $300m and $350m, according to industry sources. Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE chief executive, has acknowledged the bid and described it as an insult. The bid comes as the two companies have been engaged in a legal battle over the ICE's use of Nymex settlement prices to value some of its own products. Nymex is seeking damages for copyright infringement while the ICE retorted by alleging the Nymex broke anti-trust laws.Many analysts have said a merger between the Nymex and ICE would make sense strategically and would not necessarily trigger objections from regulators. Nymex has not acknowledged the ICE bid but has said it was open to merger talks.
711;ICE;Intercontinental Exchange;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
