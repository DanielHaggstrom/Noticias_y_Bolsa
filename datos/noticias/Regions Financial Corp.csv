0;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2018-05-23T04:01:21Z;US has more than 5,600 banks. Consolidation is coming;Regulatory rollback passed by Congress this week is one of several spurs to M&A;The US’s banks have largely sat out the mergers and acquisitions wave of recent years. While deal records have fallen in almost every other sector, big banks have done almost nothing, shrinking rather than expanding. And merger activity among small and mid-sized banks — some 5,607 of them, at last count — has been subdued.But when Fifth Third Bancorp of Cincinnati revealed its $4.7bn swoop for Chicago’s MB Financial on Monday morning, shares in other Chicago-area banks began to move, too. Wintrust, a similar-sized bank based in Rosemont, Illinois, ended the day up almost 4 per cent, while First Midwest of Itasca closed up 3 per cent.The implications were obvious: after years of thin activity in bank M&A, this deal could mark a turn. The conditions for dealmaking look better than at any time since the financial crisis. Higher interest rates and lower taxes have pumped up bank profits, giving management teams stronger platforms from which to contemplate doing something radical. Data released on Tuesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation showed that net income across the banking industry rose 27 per cent from a year earlier in the first quarter, to a record $56bn. Shareholder activists have also begun to flex their muscles, calling for fresh ways to boost returns at Ally Financial, Comerica, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Regions Financial, among others. And then — most importantly — there is the shifting regulatory landscape.For much of the post-crisis period, agencies generally frowned on any transaction that might make a bank bigger, more complex and tougher to police. Several proposed combinations were abandoned because regulators took too long to approve them, among them New York Community Bancorp’s bid for Astoria Financial and Investors Bancorp’s move on The Bank of Princeton. A $5.3bn tie-up between M&T Bank of New York and Hudson City Bancorp of New Jersey took more than three years to limp over the finish line.Now, under the administration of Donald Trump, there are clear signs that attitude is changing. Last year, the Federal Reserve made it easier for banks to merge by lifting the combined size threshold that would trigger a much deeper regulatory probe, from $25bn in assets to $100bn.On top of that, the Fed is considering a change to the way it grades banks’ management teams, moving from a five-point to a four-point scale. In practice, said Rodgin Cohen, senior chairman at Sullivan & Cromwell, that may mean many managers will be bumped up from a grade 3 (“less than satisfactory”) to a grade 2 (“satisfactory”). In the past, a three-rating has been an effective bar on doing deals, keeping many would-be acquirers on the sidelines. Another spur to consolidation comes with the new bank-relief bill passed on Tuesday by Congress, which is set to free small and mid-sized lenders from many of the restraints that apply to the trillion-dollar banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Financial stability regulation: Raises the size threshold at which the strictest supervision kicks in from $50bn in assets to $250bn.Volcker rule and bank capital requirements: Exempts small banks with assets of under $10bn from the Volcker rule ban on proprietary trading.Mortgage lending rules: Makes it easier for small banks to offer mortgages by increasing legal protection and reducing data requirements.The most obvious “winners” are regional banks in the $50bn-in-assets to $100bn bracket, said Quyen Truong, a Washington-based partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.She noted that such banks now find themselves freed from all of the Fed’s “enhanced prudential standards” — tougher capital and liquidity requirements, leverage and lending limits, mandatory risk committees and resolution plans, as well as the annual stress test. Banks between $100bn and $250bn in assets will still face periodic stress tests, but will be exempted from other tougher standards 18 months after the date of the bill’s enactment.All of which suggests that more bank acquisitions are likely. “I think we are at a potential real tipping point,” said Mr Cohen. “You’ve got positive incentives to do deals, and the removal of obstacles to do deals.” The one caveat, for now, is the valuations of bank stocks. Shares in Fifth Third slumped the most in almost two years on Monday, down 8 per cent, after investors turned their nose up at the MB deal. In particular, they criticised the meagre 2 per cent boost to earnings per share next year — even with some very aggressive assumptions on cost-cutting — and the projection it will take seven years to overcome the hit to tangible book value, which is much longer than the three to five years that is normal for bank acquisitions, according to M&A bankers.Chris Marinac, co-founder of FIG Partners, an Atlanta-based research and advisory boutique, said Fifth Third may have been bounced into a deal, following rumours of interest in MB from other potential acquirers last week. Two of the banks linked to MB, US Bancorp and Bank of Montreal, declined to comment.Fifth Third’s share price slide was “clearly a wake-up call” for other potential acquirers, said Mr Marinac. “You’ve got to have your transaction buttoned up and with a quicker payback period.”If dealmaking does begin to pick up, investors may ultimately look more kindly on banks that move early rather than miss out on potential partners. On Tuesday, Fifth Third’s stock recovered some of the lost ground, closing up 3 per cent.
1;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2015-05-12T17:16:42Z;Senate committee chair plans to wind back bank rules;Threshold to be designated ‘systemically important’ could be raised from $50bn to $500bn;The Senate banking committee chairman has proposed the biggest rolling back of financial regulatory reform since the 2008 crisis, potentially releasing about 30 institutions from tough Federal Reserve oversight and reigniting the market for bank deals.Under draft legislation released by Richard Shelby, the Republican senator from Alabama, the threshold for banks to be designated “systemically important” would be raised from $50bn to $500bn.There has been some bipartisan support to lift the threshold but raising it by 10 times is a bigger increase than many expected, allowing more banks to escape the Fed’s “enhanced supervision” with its onerous requirements including annual “stress tests”.Among the potential beneficiaries is SunTrust, the Atlanta-based bank, whose chief lobbyist, Mark Oesterle, used to be Mr Shelby’s chief counsel. SunTrust has $190bn in assets. Mr Oesterle and a spokesman for Mr Shelby declined to comment.Other banks to potentially escape the burdensome supervision include Regions Financial, the largest bank in Mr Shelby’s home state, Citizens Financial, in the process of spinning off from Royal Bank of Scotland, American Express and Capital One.However, the Fed would retain the right to apply its enhanced supervision to banks with between $50bn and $500bn in assets while banks larger than $500bn — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — would continue to be automatically designated, although the legislation also introduces flexibility into that threshold by having it rise with gross domestic product.Some foreign banks with worldwide assets of between $50bn and $500bn would benefit but the largest, such as Barclays and Deutsche Bank, would not.The legislation would still need to secure support among Democrats, some of whom, such as vocal bank critic Elizabeth Warren, have already expressed their opposition.The chief executives of Fifth Third, KeyBank and Huntington, all headquartered in Ohio, this week wrote to their home senator, Sherrod Brown, the leading Democrat on the banking committee, requesting his support in raising the “arbitrary” threshold of $50bn which is “out of balance with the straightforward nature of our traditional banking model”.In the letter, seen by the Financial Times, the chief executives warned that the “extensive new regulatory compliance [would] force further consolidation in the industry, limiting the availability of traditional banking services of the scale, and at the service levels our customers and your constituents deserve”.However, mergers and acquisitions bankers are watching the legislation closely in the hope that raising the threshold would breathe life into the largely moribund market for deals in the sector.Banks have been wary of buying competitors if a deal would take them over the $50bn threshold. With a much higher threshold, bankers believe there would be much more potential for consolidation.
2;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2015-03-12T17:27:06Z;US banks celebrate stress test pass;Financials on track to pay more than $56bn in dividends over next 12 months;Financials led a broad rally in New York a day after the Federal Reserve did not fail any of the big US banks’ capital plans, paving the way for a rise in dividends and share buybacks.Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Regions Financial and Capital One led the gains on the S&P 500 following the annual stress tests, which are one of the most closely scrutinised annual events by investors.The approved programmes, which included $6bn-plus buyback schemes by American Express, Citigroup and JPMorgan, as well as double-digit dividend increases at Morgan Stanley, Discover Financial and Capital One, sent the S&P 500 financial index 2.2 per cent higher to 329.31 and the KBW Bank Index up 2.5 per cent to 74.00.Financials, which include traditional banks, insurance and credit card companies, within the S&P 500 are now on track to pay more than $56.7bn in dividends over the next 12 months, up $2.1bn from the pace a week earlier and more than any other sector within the index, a first since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.Analysts with Deutsche Bank said there appeared to be “more flexibility on dividends, given increases in dividends at some banks already above 30 per cent”, and that capital deployment was “slightly better than expected”.Richard Ramsden, banking analyst with Goldman Sachs, said the tests marked an “important step forward for the banking industry as: 1) no US bank received a qualitative fail that would prevent them returning capital, 2) payouts reached 72 per cent for the industry and were modestly . . . above expectations, and 3) while some banks disappointed on capital returns, the positive surprises were more plentiful and of a larger magnitude.”Morgan Stanley shares climbed 6 per cent to $37.09, Citigroup advanced 3 per cent to $54.08, Wells Fargo rose 3.5 per cent to $55.59, Regions Financial increased 4 per cent to $9.89 and Capital One added 4 per cent to $81.45.Intel shares fell 5 per cent to $30.80, wiping $6.5bn from the chipmaker’s market valuation, after the company cut its revenue forecast for the first quarter amid renewed softness in PC demand and currency headwinds from the strengthening dollar.US banks tend to talk differently about the Federal Reserve’s stress test, depending on whom they’re addressing. In public, they say that the two-part exam — which became an annual event in 2011 — is proving to be a useful discipline, forcing them to get a much better grip on the particular risks they are facing. Privately, they grumble about overkill, denouncing an opaque and expensive process that takes up too much of management’s time.Continue readingThe Santa Clara, California-based company now expects first-quarter revenues to range between $12.5bn and $13.1bn, compared with earlier forecasts for $13.2bn to $14.2bn. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast the company would report sales of $13.7bn in the quarter to the end of March.“The company believes the changes to demand and inventory patterns are caused by lower than expected Windows XP refresh in small and medium business and increasingly challenging macroeconomic and currency conditions, particularly in Europe,” the company said in a statement, referring to the Microsoft software.Microsoft shares slid 2 per cent to $41.02.Overall, the gains by the financial sector, along with a larger than expected slide in initial jobless claims, buoyed the wider market.The S&P 500 climbed 1.3 per cent to 2,065.95, returning to the level at which it opened the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.5 per cent to 17,895.22. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 per cent to 4,893.29.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
3;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2015-03-11T23:06:46Z;US banks boost dividends;Fed stress tests pave way for larger payouts;US banks are poised to reclaim the top spot among S&P 500 sectors paying out the largest dividends to shareholders, after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday released its stress test health check of financial companies.Not since 2008 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers have US financials been the highest dividend payers within the S&P 500. Over the past six years banks have slashed their dividend programmes and focused on building their reserves to meet higher regulatory standards.However, the financial sector’s absence from the top could end, after numbers are crunched following the results of the Fed stress tests in the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review. Banks on and off Wall Street revealed increases to capital return programmes minutes after the Fed gave approval on Wednesday afternoon.Morgan Stanley said it would increase the quarterly dividend paid on its common stock by 50 per cent to 15 cents a share. Wells Fargo plans to increase its dividend by 7 per cent, American Express by 12 per cent, US Bancorp by 4.1 per cent and Goldman Sachs by 8.3 per cent. Bank of America announced it would maintain its 5 cent dividend.Citigroup, which notably failed the stress tests last year — the only large US bank not to pass — passed the review this year and increased its dividend to 5 cents from 1 cent. The company had been barred from completing that same increase a year earlier.Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices, said banks were in position to reclaim the top spot after Wednesday’s announcements, although it was too soon to calculate the annualised amount of dividends paid by the sector.Financial institutions in the blue-chip index were on pace to issue $54.5bn worth of dividends over the course of the year, $927m less than the technology sector, based on quarterly policies in place at the end of last week, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.At that level, the sector would account for about 14.6 per cent of all dividends issued by S&P 500 constituents, second only to the 14.9 per cent rate for information technology. Those figures were due to change following the flurry of dividend increases.“Don’t be surprised if financials take back their first place position as the largest paying sector, even if they are accounting for half the rate,’’ Mr Silverblatt said.While financials have been among the three worst performing sectors on the S&P 500 this year, rising dividend yields could provide a fillip.Jonathan Golub, strategist at RBC, said: “Beyond rising rates, banks should benefit from five additional trends.” Along with improving loan performance, favourable valuations, accelerating loan growth and lower legal payouts, the key reason he cited was “capital return potential”.Equity strategists have also warmed to the financial sector as the Fed readies to raise interest rates later this year. Lift-off is expected to widen net interest margins at banks and increase sales at life insurers, Barclays noted.Financials’ earnings per share are projected to climb 12.6 per cent in 2015 from 2014, faster than any other sector, according to consensus forecasts tracked by S&P Capital IQ.Full-year sales are expected to rise 1.7 per cent from a year earlier, ahead of the broader S&P 500’s 0.2 per cent gain.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
4;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2012-12-30T16:36:44Z;Financials add $430bn to US stocks;;Surging shares of banks and other financial companies have added $430bn to the value of the US stock market this year, even as they have been forced to lay off staff and curb lucrative trading practices.The financial sector has been the best performing segment of the S&P 500 in 2012, recording a gain of just under 25 per cent and beating a 19 per cent rise for the consumer disretionary sector, which includes retailers and other companies exposed to the revival in US consumer confidence.With just one more truncated trading session to go, and despite tortuous discussions over a fiscal cliff budget deal on Capitol Hill, US equities are poised to register an overall annual gain of 12 per cent, following a flat showing in 2011.The market value of the 81 financial companies in the S&P 500 has swollen to $1.98tn from $1.53tn, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Bank of America more than doubled in value, and there were 10 companies in all whose shares gained more than 40 per cent this year.“Part of this is about where you start from,” said Jason Goldberg, banks analyst at Barclays. “Banks have underperformed in seven of the past eight years. The five best performers this year were all in the bottom six in 2011. You could have bought all the worst stocks at the end of last year, closed your eyes and made a boatload of money.”Financial sector companies have had to confront a host of new regulations born out of the credit crisis, forcing them to hold more capital and liquid assets and to curb some of the riskier trading practices that led to the meltdown of 2007-09.But their repaired balance sheets have encouraged investors back into the sector, particularly since many institutions resumed dividend increases and share buybacks after passing their latest Federal Reserve “stress tests”.At the same time they have reported lower losses on crisis-era loans, cut costs and begun to enjoy a boom in new activity, such as originating mortgages, Mr Goldberg said.Alabama-based Regions Financial was the best performing financial stock after Bank of America, with a rise of 61 per cent. Citigroup was up 48 per cent, Goldman Sachs 39 per cent and JPMorgan Chase 30 per cent.After financials and consumer discretionary stocks, the third-best performing sector was healthcare, as President Barack Obama’s industry reforms began to come into force.About $230bn was added to the market by the information technology sector this year, the only sector larger by value than the financials. It contains industry giants such as Google, Microsoft and IBM, but is dominated by Apple, whose shares have risen 26 per cent this year.Apple shares showed a 73 per cent gain at their peak in September, when it was the world’s most valuable company at $660bn. However, fears of a slowdown in the growth of iPhone and iPad sales have contributed to profit-taking since then.The only sector of the S&P 500 recording a decline this year was utilities. Defensive stocks fell out of favour as investors sought alternatives more sensitive to the US economic recovery.
5;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2012-01-12T21:44:50Z;Oil majors weigh on Dow;Retail stocks lower on poor December sales data;Shares in Chevron Corp fell 2.6 per cent to $104.97 after the second-largest US energy company by market capitalisation said fourth-quarter earnings would be “significantly below” third-quarter results.Chevron said it would at best break even on its “downstream” – refining and marketing – operations where “lower margins and refinery input volumes” have hit earnings.Gross margin at Chevron’s Gulf Coast refineries fell more than 50 per cent to $11.84 per barrel in the fourth quarter while output from US refineries to the end of November fell 20 per cent to an average 717,000 barrels a day.If that trend continues through December, Chevron would see its lowest output in at least five quarters. Its shares slipped 2.5 per cent to $105.25.Tesorolast week attributed falling margins at Californian refineries to the narrowing spread between WTI and Brent crude but Chevron blamed a wider fall in demand for petrol and overstocked supplies.“The rise in the price of crude has been a result of fear about supply from Iran and Nigeria rather than increased demand,” said Fadel Gheit, oil and gas analyst at Oppenheimer. “That means petrol price rises have not kept up with crude price rises, and refiners are taking the hit.”ExxonMobil fell as much as 1.7 per cent but recovered to end the day down 0.4 per cent to $84.74. The two large energy stocks had weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, though the blue-chip index recovered to end the day up 0.2 per cent to 12,471.02.Elsewhere, US stocks inched up, with the S&P 500 closing 0.2 per cent higher at 1,295.5, now up 2.8 per cent for the year, and off to its best start since 2006. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.5 per cent to 2,724.7.December US retail sales disappointed, coming in just 0.1 per cent higher, or 0.2 per cent lower once car sales are stripped out. That halted a run of better than expected US economic data.“Although we’re bullish on equities for the year, we think the S&P 500 will have to take a leg down first as the realisation dawns that talk of the US decoupling from Europe and Asia is simply untrue,” said James Dailey, chief investment officer at Team Financial Managers.But energy stocks were the worst performers in the S&P 500 as the price of natural gas fell to a multiyear low of $2.72 per mbtu. That pushed explorers down with Cabot Oil & Gas off 3.6 per cent to $67.15, though the group said it was earning as much as $4 per mbtu of gas from production in the Marcellus Shale.Oil and gas field services companies were hurt, with Baker Hughes falling 3.8 per cent to $48.29.Dick’s Sporting Goods rose 11.1 per cent to $40.43 as the company said it would buy back $200m of its shares and maintained full-year guidance in an earnings update.David Strasser, a retail analyst at Janney, maintained his “buy” rating on Dick’s, telling clients the company had weathered its seasonally toughest quarter of the year.Bank of America topped $7 for the first time since October in the morning session, before slipping back to $6.79, a fall of 1.2 per cent. Citigroup was up 1 per cent to $31.60 and JPMorgan climbed 0.5 per cent to $36.85 ahead of earnings on Friday.Investment banks were subdued except for Jefferies, which broke above $15 for the first time since September, before closing 6 per cent up at $15.42. Questions about Jefferies’ exposure to eurozone sovereign debt had pushed its shares below $10 towards the end of 2011.Morgan Stanley climbed 0.4 per cent to $17.17 as Credit Suisse analysts estimated the market value of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney brokerage – which is 51 per cent owned by Morgan Stanley – at $15bn, a 30 per cent discount to the market value when the joint venture was launched.Morgan Stanley has the right to purchase another 14 per cent of the company in May, which Howard Chen at Credit Suisse said would “ultimately” make “strategic sense” despite Morgan Stanley Smith Barney’s valuation fall.Separately, Moshe Orenbuch at Credit Suisse tipped commercial banks to outperform investment banks when fourth-quarter earnings are unveiled. “While we expect a more revenue challenged quarter from the capital markets sensitive names, we think the large commercial banks will post respectable fourth-quarter results, particularly given improved loan growth trends in the quarter.”Regions Financial slipped 2.3 per cent to $4.69 as the bank confirmed the sale of its brokerage unit, Morgan Keegan, to Raymond James. Shares in Region had climbed more than 10 per cent this week on reports the sale could be worth more than $1bn.Raymond James eventually agreed to pay $930m, although Morgan Keegan will pay a one-off dividend of $250m to Regions before the sale completes.New Jersey lender Hudson City Bancorp fell 1.9 per cent to $7.12 as Brian Foran at Nomura said the bank’s lending margin could fall by another 60 basis points as existing loans are repaid and new funds are extended at lower prevailing interest rates.Wynn Resorts fell 1.9 per cent to $109.80 on reports that Kazuo Okada, the casino operator’s vice-chairman, had sued the company for access to financial records in a dispute over the use of funds.Shares in Sears Holdings climbed 3.3 per cent to $34.00 on a volatile day of trading. The stock had fallen five per cent at the opening on reports a financing company was no longer extending credit to suppliers for deliveries to Sears, but shares rallied after filings revealed Edward Lampert, the veteran investor and Sears chairman, had increased his personal stake in the company.
6;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2012-01-11T23:09:06Z;Raymond James to buy Morgan Keegan;;Regions Financial will sell Morgan Keegan, its brokerage business, to Raymond James for $930m, ending a protracted sale process that began last summer but faltered amid market turbulence caused by the European sovereign debt crisis.Alabama-based Regions said on Wednesday that Morgan Keegan would also pay its parent a dividend of $250m before the deal closed, lifting the total consideration to $1.18bn.It added the disposal would improve capital ratios, generate additional liquidity and strengthen focus on its core banking business. Regions and Raymond James, which will have more than 6,000 financial advisers following the deal’s close, will maintain a partnership and referral agreement after the sale.When Regions first said it would explore a sale of the business last June, people familiar with the matter said that Morgan Keegan could fetch about $1.5bn. The business, which makes about half its $1.1bn revenues in retail brokerage, has more than 1,000 financial advisers and offices in 20 states.The unit was expected to go to a private equity buyer, people familiar with the process had previously said, after strategic buyers were sidelined. Morgan Keegan’s management team was reluctant to be sold to another bank, they added.However, discussions with two groups of buy-out funds ran aground last autumn, as markets gyrated on concerns about the eurozone. On-off negotiations have since continued with Raymond James, and rival bidder Stifel Financial.Regions shares dropped about 1 per cent in after-market trading following the deal’s announcement, to $4.75. Goldman Sachs advised Regions on the sale, while JPMorgan worked with Raymond James.Analysts at Barclays Capital noted that the deal is expected to only increase Regions’ Tier 1 common capital ratio by 9 basis points. The bank remains among the lowest on that measure among its peers, Barclays added.Regions has yet to repay the US Treasury’s $3.5bn crisis-time investment in the bank through the Troubled Asset Relief Programme.Regions will record a charge of $575m to $745m in its results for the fourth quarter of last year on goodwill held in its investment banking, brokerage and trust segment. The bank now expects to record a net loss for the quarter of between $432m to $633m, or $0.34 to $0.50 per share.Analysts had previously thought that Regions would make a small profit in the quarter, which the bank confirmed it was on track to do before the impairment charge on Wednesday.John Carson, Morgan Keegan’s chief executive, will join Raymond James as president and will oversee fixed income and public finance.
7;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2012-01-10T22:12:55Z;Tiffany loses lustre amid sluggish sales;Luxury brands struggle in mature markets;Shares in Tiffany & Co fell 10.5 per cent to $59.94 as the luxury retailer it cut earnings guidance after reporting anaemic holiday same-store sales growth in the US and a decline in sales at its New York store.November and December sales in Tiffany’s Americas region, which includes Canada and Latin America, were up just 2 per cent compared with 2010, while sales at its flagship Fifth Avenue store falling 1 per cent, despite strong spending by tourists.Asia-Pacific same-store sales climbed 12 per cent but investors had been focused on developed markets since Tiffany forecast “weakness” in European and north-eastern US sales in December, an announcement which had also triggered a big share price fall.The sell-off suggests the rise of an emerging market middle class may not inoculate the likes of Tiffany, Coach and Ralph Lauren against developed market worries. “No matter how good the performance in Asia, mature markets still matter,” said David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re starting to see weakness in financial markets impacting on high-end consumer spending.”Coach fell 0.8 per cent to $62.33 while Ralph Lauren fell more than 3 per cent at the opening before recovering to close up 0.7 per cent to $147.32.Elsewhere, US markets were in bullish mood, with the S&P 500 climbing 0.9 per cent to 1,292.08, its highest level since the end of July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 12,462.47 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1 per cent to 2,702.5.“Everything is in place for a big rally,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. “If the market doesn’t break out now, I don’t think it’s going to at all this year.”Life Technologies rose 8.3 per cent to $46.17 after unveiling a DNA reader.But BorgWarner, which makes powertrains for engines, had the best performance in the S&P, climbing 12.3 per cent to $72.25 after forecasting record sales and earnings growth.Urban Outfitters, the clothing retailer, said Glen Senk, chief executive, had resigned on Monday. That sent its shares down as much as 11 per cent to $25.91 after hours.Elsewhere, the rally was broadly cyclical. Materials and industrial stocks were to the fore after Alcoa kicked off the quarterly earnings season on Monday. Alcoa reported a first loss from continuing operations in two years but was positive about demand in 2012. Its shares were up 0.2 per cent to $9.44.Alpha Natural Resources, which exports metallurgical coal to China, rose 2.8 per cent to $21.33. Cliffs Natural Resources climbed 4 per cent to $68.82.Bank investors continued to show signs of optimism, with Bank of America climbing 5.7 per cent to $6.63, while Citigroup climbed 3.2 per cent to $30 for its highest close in a month.“Absent new negatives equals a positive?” asked Goldman Sachs analysts, summing up the attitude of investors to large universal banks, which have emerged bruised but intact from big share price falls in 2011.Shares in Goldman climbed 3.8 per cent to $98.33 and Morgan Stanley was up 4.3 per cent to $16.89, although data showed trading levels in capital markets were down as much as 36 per cent compared with 2011 so far this year, which may bode ill for investment banks.Separately, Goldman Sachs warned against buying regional bank stocks, which have appreciated 20 per cent as a group since October lows, arguing price-earnings ratios were still high on a forty-year basis. Investors paid little heed, with Regions Financial up 3.8 per cent to $4.70 and Zions Bancorp up 1.6 per cent to $18.17.Shares in the New York Stock Exchangeclimbed 4.6 per cent to $27.79 on an Financial Times report that European regulators would block its merger with Deutsche Börse. The proposed tie up has weighed on NYSE shares, as Deutsche Börse’s price fell with European financials last year.A new year rally, which had seen shares in Juniper Networks appreciate as much as 10 per cent, came to an end as the wireless network provider said it would miss fourth-quarter earnings guidance. Shares fell 0.9 per cent to $21.50.Credit Suisse analysts said internet service providers would “continue to look to suppliers [such as Juniper] to deliver greater performance at lower cost,” as households consumed ever more bandwidth on unlimited packages, without corresponding revenue growth for ISPs. Shares in internet service provider WebMD fell 28.5 per cent to $26.25 as it pre-announced a fourth-quarter revenue miss and said its chief executive had resigned. Yahoo shares were little affected, up 0.3 per cent to $15.51.Most of the share price action appeared driven by WebMD’s decision to terminate “discussions with several potential acquirers of the company.” Speculation of a takeover by Yahoo had seen the company’s market capitalisation climb more than a third since October 6.
8;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2012-01-09T21:55:26Z;Google slips on fear of move into mobile;;Google shares slid as investors considered the internet group’s possible move into the manufacture of mobile phone handsets.Its shares fell 4.2 per cent to $622.94 after Motorola Mobility, the mobile phone company that Google has agreed to purchase for $12.5bn, said on Friday that fourth-quarter results would come in significantly below expectations because of increased competition.“We believe the Motorola Mobility pre-announcement could serve as a reminder of the operational challenges for Google to enter the hardware space,” said Doug Anmuth at Morgan Stanley, predicting a “slower growth, lower margin Google once the deal closes”.US stocks climbed ahead of the quarterly earnings season, which kicked off as aluminium producer Alcoa reported an estimated loss of 3 cents a share from continuing operations after the close.Alcoa shares had climbed 3 per cent to $9.42, recovering from weakness last week, while there had been strong call buying, in anticipation of a share price bounce off results. Many analysts had predicted a loss and shares held steady at $9.43 in after-hours trading.The S&P 500 index closed up 0.2 per cent at 1,277.83, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 12,392.69.Although Google’s woes weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, the tech-heavy index eked out a 0.1 per cent gain to close at 2,676.56. Its other heavily weighted stock, Apple, hit a high of $427.75 in the morning session, before closing at $421.73, off 0.2 per cent.The S&P 500 has recorded gains on all but one trading day in 2012 but much of the legwork has been done by a concentration of industrial, material and financial stocks, making some analysts wary.“While the S&P 500 closed up 1.6 per cent last week, the percentage of industry groups in up trends actually contracted [from 56 per cent to 52 per cent],” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird. “Absent of a significant broadening in rally participation, the ability of the major indexes to move significantly higher is likely to be limited.”Netflix climbed 13.8 per cent to $98.18 as it launched its UK and Ireland video web streaming service.The stock, which bombed last year as its US service lost subscribers, is enjoying a mini-renaissance, now up almost $30 since the start of 2012, when the company said customers had streamed more than 2bn hours of content in the quarter to the end of December.Shares in Inhibitex climbed 141.1 per cent to $23.70 after Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to buy the pharmaceutical group for its hepatitis C medicines. That drove up shares in other treatment developers as Idenix Pharmaceuticals surged 37 per cent to $9.66.Bristol-Myers Squibb was off 0.9 per cent to $33.91.CareFusion fell 8.6 per cent to $23.28 after the medical device manufacturer lowered the bottom end of its full-year earnings forecast to $1.75 from $1.80.Rival St Jude Medical rose 3.2 per cent to $35.70 after it said it still expected to meet fourth-quarter and full-year guidance.Regions Financial rose 2.7 per cent to $4.53 on reports that the regional bank, which is yet to repay all Tarp funds borrowed from the Treasury, may offload its Morgan Keegan brokerage unit, which could fetch up to $1bn.Financials were generally stronger with Bank of America climbing 1.5 per cent to $6.27, despite reports it would sack a fifth of its Asia managing directors.Health insurer AFLAC fell 2.3 per cent to $43.23 as UBS analysts warned “its outsized exposure to debt issued by European financials” makes it particularly vulnerable to a European slowdown.Exchanges continued to show weakness after JPMorgan analysts warned on Friday that earnings estimates may be over optimistic. The CME Group fell 2.5 per cent to $228.24 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 2.1 per cent to $112.58.Ralph Lauren climbed 4 per cent to $146.36 as Goldman Sachs analysts tipped the luxury brand to be one of the “secular winners with strong tailwinds of sales and margin expansion” in 2012.Video game retailer Gamestop fell 3.5 per cent to $23.99 as same store sales in the holiday period came in 0.3 per cent lower than in 2010.Tech stock Zynga fell 9.2 per cent to $8.00, $2 below its December IPO price. That might be bad news for investors in Morgan Stanley’s mutual funds as filings revealed that the investment bank owns 16 per cent of the group’s publicly available stock.
9;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2012-01-05T22:31:57Z;US oil refiners in sharp sell-off;;US oil refiners sold off sharply after Tesoro said it could post a fourth-quarter loss of up to 80 cents a share because of collapsing margins.Tesoro fell 5.9 per cent to $22.60 followed by rivals Marathon Petroleum, off 5.5 per cent to $31.92, and Valero Energy, down 3 per cent to $19.81.The rising price of California crude turned a third-quarter discount of $6 a barrel into a premium of 5 cents a barrel at Tesoro’s California refineries, which account for 40 per cent of its output.The group cited the narrowing of the Brent-WTI spread from $26 a barrel to $8 a barrel over the quarter, which cut margins at its mid-continent refineries, which are 17 per cent of capacity and have benefited from access to cheaper WTI.“The level of weakness at Tesoro was unexpected and investors have taken it as a signal to exit all refiners,” said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer.Elsewhere, US stocks reversed early losses to end the day in positive territory, with banks leading. Bank of America climbed 8.6 per cent to $6.31, topping $6 for the first time since November, on its best one day gain since October.Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed their profit estimates for BofA citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits.Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December, without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 7.7 per cent to $7.04.That may also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform. SunTrust was up 5.4 per cent to $19.66, and Regions Financial climbed 4.2 per cent to $4.52, while some investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, sat out the rally. Goldman Sachs slipped 0.2 per cent to $94.58.The S&P 500 remained above its 200-day moving average for a third day, a sign of bullish sentiment, while Goldman Sachs reported that one-month realised correlation between the S&P 500 and its sectors, excluding financials, has fallen to its lowest level since August. That is an indication that macro concerns, which tend to shift all stocks in the same direction and increase realised correlation, weighed less on US investors in December.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off a fraction at 12,415.70.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,669.86, as stocks along the hard disk drive supply chain rallied after Seagate Technology said fourth quarter shipments had been strong, a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected.Seagate climbed 6.4 per cent to $17.90 as it raised guidance, while rival hard disk drive manufacturer Western Digital climbed 4.7 per cent to $32.76.LSI Corp, which makes semiconductors used in hard drives, rose 7.7 per cent to $6.70 as Betsy Van Hees, analyst at Wedbush securities, recommended clients buy the stock on the Seagate results.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions. Gap fell 3.2 per cent to $18.27 after December sales came in 4 per cent lower than the previous year. Ross Stores, the discount clothing chain, climbed 5.9 per cent to $50.42 on a 9 per cent increase in same-store sales that easily beat the consensus analyst forecast of 4.2 per cent.JC Penney fell 2.7 per cent to $33.97 after the department store chain lowered fourth-quarter profit guidance to 70 cents a share from above $1 a share, while Constellation Brands, which sells imported wines and beers, fell 6 per cent after slightly missing earnings estimates.Barnes & Noble slumped 17.1 per cent to $11.24 after the company said it was considering a sale of its Nook e-reader business.Consumer discretionary stocks had led the S&P 500 on Wednesday as investors piled into the sector in anticipation of strong December sales, which overall were up 3.6 per cent year on year, according to data from Retail Metrics. “It’s not surprising to see investors buy the rumour and sell the news,” said Richard Jaffe, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.Shares in seed maker Monsanto rose 5.5 per cent to $76.68 as the company posted strong earnings, boosted by rising demand from South America.MetroPCS slumped 8.9 per cent to $8.01 as the mobile phone network’s pace of growth slowed. The company added 197,000 subscribers in the last three months of 2011, a third lower than the same period in 2010, and substantially beneath analysts’ expectations.Fertiliser manufacturer Mosaic climbed 1.9 per cent to $53.30 as the company posted solid results and said the prices for phosphate-based fertilisers had bottomed following output cuts and a rally in grain prices.
11;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-12-30T21:41:34Z;US stocks escape worst of eurozone crisis;;The S&P 500 ended the year exactly 0.04 points lower than it started, although analysts found cause for comfort.“Given all the negatives that the market has had thrown at it, even to end the year flat is a victory for the US market,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “It shows the attraction of US companies in turbulent times.”Despite a gut-wrenching August, when 4 per cent daily moves in the S&P 500 briefly became the norm, Wall Street escaped the worst of the eurozone crisis which wreaked havoc elsewhere, as the FTSE All World Index ended the year down 9.7 per cent.At 1,257.60, the S&P 500 had recovered 14 per cent from October lows, but was 8 per cent short of April highs.Once dividends are factored in, financials and materials aside, every broad sector of the S&P 500 has delivered gains this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the year up 5.5 per cent to 12,217.56, although a few big stocks skew the price-weighted index. Only the Nasdaq Composite index fell over the year, 1.8 per cent to 2,605.15.The worst performing stocks tell the macro stories that preoccupied investors this year.First Solar, down 74 per cent for the year to $33.76, has seen a lucrative market for solar panels disrupted first by a glut of supply from China and second by a threatened collapse in demand from the eurozone, as governments cut back on subsidies.Computer Sciences Corp, the IT services company that fell 52.2 per cent to $23.70, has been hit by reduced government spending on outsourcing, most recently the cancellation of a contract by the UK’s National Health Service.Alpha Natural Resources, down 66 per cent to to $20.43, and US Steel Corp, off 54.7 per cent to $26.46, have been two of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500, moving 2 per cent for every percentage point move in the benchmark index.Their share prices have waxed and waned with sentiment about Chinese growth and demand for steel, which US Steel Corp makes and Alpha’s metallurgical coal is needed to manufacture, from the country’s construction industry.Homebuilder stocks rallied on resilient US economic data. Lennar Corp and DR Horton, which had seen their market capitalisations more than halve by October, ended the year up 4.9 per cent to $19.66 and 5.7 per cent to $12.61 respectively, as US construction starts and pending home sales data turned positive in November.Among the big fallers only Netflix, down 60.5 per cent to $69.29 from a peak above $200, seemed little affected by macro events. The web-streaming company, the darling of internet investors in 2010, was undone by a decision to raise prices for users who wanted to continue using its physical DVD delivery service, and an aborted attempt to spin off the DVD business altogether.Moving from individual stocks to sectors, one theme dominated the year: the collapse of financials. Down 18.4 per cent for the year, 7 percentage points more than any other sector, their weighting in the S&P 500 has slipped to just 13 per cent, barely above consumer staples, energy or healthcare stocks.The four companies which have weighed most heavily on the index – Bank of America, down 58.3 per cent to $5.56, Citigroup, 44.4 per cent to $26.31, Goldman Sachs, 46.2 per cent to $90.43 and JPMorgan Chase, 21.6 per cent to $33.25 – were all banks. Between them they wiped more than 23 points off the S&P 500, equivalent to 2 per cent of the index at the start of the year.“Looking ahead banks are not necessarily key to a rally in US equities,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers investment research, “but they could certainly be the cause of a bear market, if they were to fall fast again.”At the other end of the spectrum investors cheered the boom in shale oil, and the prospects it offers for US energy independence.Cabot Oil & Gas saw its market capitalisation double as its share closed the year at $75.90, as the company increased revenues from oil by 50 per cent in the quarter ended September 30, compared with the same period in 2010.But it was solid performances by mega-caps which had the most market impact. Apple drove the S&P 500 significantly more than any other stock, giving the index an eight point boost, as its share price climbed 25.6 per cent over the year to $405.00. ExxonMobil’s 15.9 per cent move to $84.76 gave the S&P 500 another six points, while IBM boosted the index five points, as it rose 25.3 per cent to $183.88.
12;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-12-06T21:59:31Z;US stocks steady despite warning on EFSF;;Shares in Darden Restaurants tumbled 12.4 per cent to $41.82, as steep discounts failed to attract customers to its flagship Olive Garden chain in November.Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden, which brings in almost half of Darden’s total sales, fell 5.7 per cent in November, a third straight month of declines, triggering a reappraisal of the stock by analysts.“When concepts lose their resonance with customers it doesn’t come back quickly,” said Rachel Rothman, a retail analyst at Susquehanna Financial, who had a “buy” recommendation on the stock before Tuesday’s announcement.“Turnrounds generally take not just a few quarters, but over a year,” she added.Restaurant stocks have benefited from solid consumer spending so far this year, and analysts stressed Darden’s woes were company specific, as other consumer discretionary stocks escaped unharmed.Elsewhere, US indices were broadly flat, despite Standard & Poor’s warning that the eurozone’s bail-out mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, could face a rating downgrade, once a review of eurozone sovereigns is complete.The S&P 500 edged up 0.1 per cent to 1,258.47, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 12,150.13. The Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.2 per cent to 2,649.56.“The tape doesn’t lie,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “A knock to the EFSF rating had already been discounted by the market. If anything it’s a further catalyst for a positive conclusion to the eurozone summit at the end of the week.”MetroPCS was the standout performer in the S&P 500, gaining 7.8 per cent to $8.87, as Braxton Carter, the mobile phone network’s chief financial officer, told an investor conference that the company was considering bidding for new spectrum to meet the growing demand of a data-hungry customer base.“Store traffic has been very strong for MetroPCS so we expect good gross customer additions for the quarter,” said Kevin Smithen, telecom analyst at Macquarie. “The unknown is what the churn rate is going to be, its impossible to estimate how many customers are leaving.”Rival Sprint Nextel fell 1.5 per cent $2.61, as its wireless network provider Clearwire said it would issue new shares to raise $595m in new capital.Last week Sprint had committed to maintain its 54 per cent stake in Clearwire, meaning it must stump up around $300m of the capital raise.The dilution impact of the new share issuance sent Clearwire shares tumbling to as low as $2.09, but the stock closed up 11.1 per cent to $2.50.“Clearwire shares trade around the probability of bankruptcy, and that has been alleviated incrementally by the funding component,” said David Dixon, telecom analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Fertilisers were among the other big movers, after Norway-based Yara, the world’s largest nitrogen-based fertiliser producer, said demand would be strong next year, as high commodity prices provided farmers with an incentive to apply.CF Industries, the second largest nitrogen-based fertiliser company, climbed 4.3 per cent to $146.82. Potash producers Mosaic and PotashCorp were up 3.4 and 3.9 per cent to $53.19 and $43.54 respectively.Yara’s guidance comforted the industry, which has been rocked in recent weeks by fears that the weak rupee would lead Indian farmers to cut back on fertiliser imports or demand price discounts.Petrol refiner Tesoro lost 6.1 per cent to $23.31 after Credit Suisse analysts changed their guidance on the stock to “neutral”.Analyst Edward Westlake remained upbeat on the refining sector, but said other companies such as Marathon Petroleum offered more compelling value.“A lack of dividend support [at Tesoro] leaves the shares more vulnerable to short term movements in margins and compressing free cash flow in 2012,” he told clients.Marathon shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $34.64.Halliburton was rocked by BP’s allegations that the oilfield services company had intentionally destroyed evidence relating to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year.The stock slipped 3.9 per cent to $35.57.Regional banks took a hit after Deutsche Bank said they may need to cut costs by as much as ten per cent to meet efficiency targets if revenues do not meet targets. SunTrust Banks fell 6.4 per cent to $18.03, Regions Financial declined 3.5 per cent to $4.16 and First Horizon was off 4.4 per cent to $7.43.LinkedIn Corp climbed 4.7 per cent to $73.20 after Morgan Stanley recommended clients buy shares in the professional-networking website, arguing its valuation was compelling, after steep falls in the share price in recent weeks.Eli Lilly climbed 3.9 per cent to $38.86 after Sanford Bernstein analysts said the current valuation assumed “extraordinarily low” expectations for the success of the group’s Alzheimer’s treatments. Tim Anderson, an Sanford Bernstein analyst said Eli’s market capitalisation could double if its latest Alzheimer’s drug, Solanezumab, proved successful.3M climbed 1.5 per cent to $82.13 after the maker of Scotch Tape and Post-it Notes forecast 2012 earnings would be $6.25 to $6.50 a share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $6.27.
13;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-11-23T22:01:40Z;Banks under pressure on Fed stress test plans;;The Thanksgiving holiday got off to a bad start as US investors responded to a German bond auction considered a failure by traders by ditching financial, material and energy stocks.The S&P 500 fell 2.2 per cent to 1,161.79, giving back all gains since October 9, after an auction of €6bn of Bunds only sold €3.6bn.The benchmark US index is now down more than 7 per cent since last Wednesday when Fitch Ratings warned that US banks remain exposed to eurozone contagion.“This is a game-changer,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers, on the German bond auction.“Germany has been the one pillar of strength in the eurozone. Any sign of cracks must add to fear that the overall European situation is quickly deteriorating with a knock-on effect for US stocks.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 2.1 per cent to 11,257.63, with all 30 members in the red. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.4 per cent to 2,460.08.The financial sector of the S&P 500 declined 3 per cent after the Federal Reserve added to pressure on US banks by announcing that it would stress test their ability to withstand unemployment of 13 per cent and a 6.9 per cent fall in eurozone GDP.At one point Bank of America fell to $5.11, it lowest price since March 2009, before closing at $5.14, a loss of 4.3 per cent for the day.The cost of default protection on BofA debt rose 35 basis points to 472bp, an all-time record according to data from Markit. That equates to $472,000 a year to insure $10m of BofA debt for five years.Morgan Stanley fell 3.6 per cent to $13.03, Citigroup tumbled 3.9 per cent to $23.51 and JPMorgan was off 3.5 per cent to $28.38.Goldman Sachs held the steadiest among the big US banks, off 1.7 per cent to $87.89, but that still left the bank set for its worst close since March 2009.Even Goldman analyst Richard Ramsden conceded that the stress tests would leave big banks in the crosshairs.“We view the test as more onerous for large banks, as regulators appear focused on stressing capital markets (Europe and counterparty) exposures,” he wrote to clients.Smaller lenders were not immune, with the Fed also announcing that all banks with assets more than $50bn must submit a capital adequacy plan by January 2012. Regions Financial fell 5.6 per cent to $3.68.Oppenheimer waded into the debate over liquidity at Jefferies, the New York-based investment bank whose exposures to Europe and funding stability have been much scrutinised.Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said notes from bond research firm Egan-Jones, calling on Jefferies to reduce assets and raise capital, were “plain wrong”.Jefferies shares rose 4.5 per cent to $10.51.Materials and energy stocks suffered as eurozone sentiment translated into fears for global growth.Coal miner Alpha Natural Resources fell 6.7 per cent to $19.27 and US Steel Corp was down 7.6 per cent to $22.41.JPMorgan told clients to have an underweight position for the entire commodities sector after the failure of the US budget “supercommittee”.“Policy failures in the US and Europe have darkened the six-month outlook,” Colin Fenton wrote to clients. “We expect outright total return losses near-term and see greater value in bonds.”Highly cyclical semiconductor stocks also suffered with the Philadelphia Sox index falling 2.5 per cent, led down by Jabil Circuit, which was off 8.6 per cent to $18.36.Groupon fell below its IPO price of $20 for the first time since its debut two weeks ago. Its shares were down 15.6 per cent to $16.96. That meant a third consecutive daily fall of more than 10 per cent, even though investors have been unable to initiate new short positions since Monday.Boston Scientific was one of a handful of stocks in the S&P 500 to record gains. Its shares were up 0.2 per cent to $5.32 after the medical device maker received regulatory approval for a new version of its drug-coated heart stent.Shares in the pharmacy chain Walgreen shares were up 4.4 per cent to $32.09 on reports that it may be able to salvage a deal to fill prescriptions for pharmacy benefit management company Express Scripts.Strong earnings from John Deere also provided some cheer as the world’s biggest tractor maker easily exceeded analysts’ expectations with earnings per share of $1.62 in the quarter to the end of October. Its shares were up 3.9 per cent to $74.72.But any hopes that US fundamentals might detract from eurozone woes were dashed by a flurry of downbeat pre-Thanksgiving economic data. Unemployment claims ticked up while consumer spending grinding almost to a halt in October.
14;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-10-18T21:40:26Z;Pressures grow on US regional lenders;;Large US regional banks will need to cut expenses by up to 40 per cent to cope with slower economic growth, lower revenues and high regulatory costs, and that will increase pressure to cut staff or merge with rivals, a new study says.The report by Alvarez & Marsal turnround specialists said returns on equity at leading regional US lenders had fallen by about half from pre-crisis levels of about 15 per cent. Luring investors back to the sector would require more than routine cost-cutting, it said.Seamus McMahon, a senior adviser at the firm, said: “There is no way to take 30 to 40 per cent of costs out of an existing business system”.Mr McMahon said the resulting merger and acquisition activity would see the number of US banks shrink from 7,500 to 4,000-5,000 in the next 10 years. Only about half the top 50 banks by assets in the US, most of them big regional lenders, would survive, he said.Joseph Berardino, Alvarez & Marsal managing director, said: “There is simply too much capacity chasing too little demand.”Lenders face multiple challenges to increasing profits. Low interest rates are squeezing their net interest margins. A faltering economic recovery is reducing the demand for loans. Higher capital requirements and restrictions on products are eating into earnings.The latest news from the US banking sector’s earning seasonAs the cost of equity has risen and returns have plummeted, shareholders are taking an increasingly dim view of bank stocks. KBW’s indices that track large-cap banks and regional lenders are trading below book value, reflecting concerns.By 2013 just three of 25 large regional banks will deliver a return on equity higher than the cost of their equity, according to Alvarez & Marsal’s analysis. Only seven of the 25 are currently trading above book value.Companies such as Regions Financial – which is trading at about a third of its book value – and SunTrust Banks – trading at about half its book value – will be among those facing pressure either to pare back their operations significantly or merge with competitors. Many already have announced cost-cutting measures to placate investors.From 2002 to 2006, banks’ ROE was about twice as high as their cost of equity capital, according to Alvarez & Marsal. Since 2008, the cost has exceeded the return, a trend that is forecast to continue through 2013.Kevin Fitzsimmons, who covers regional banks for Sandler O’Neill, said: “Cost is a focus because it’s one of the few levers under management’s control.”
15;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-10-10T19:20:16Z;Buy-out firms compete for Morgan Keegan;;Blackstone and Carlyle have teamed up to look at Morgan Keegan and are competing with Thomas H Lee, the private equity group, to buy the brokerage unit put up for sale by Regions Financial in June.The two shortlisted bidders are carrying out due diligence on the unit, which had about $1.3bn in revenues last year. No date has yet been set for final bids but people familiar with the matter said they expected offers to come in the next two to three weeks.Blackstone, Thomas H Lee and Regions declined to comment. Carlyle did not respond to a request for comment.People familiar with the process said bids had come in at about the $1.5bn book value for the business. However, they warned that negotiations were continuing with both groups and any deal could yet fall apart.Regions in June said that it had hired Goldman Sachs to conduct a review of its options for Morgan Keegan, which had agreed to pay $210m to resolve civil US regulatory charges that it defrauded investors in five bond funds by inflating the value of mortgage securities during the financial crisis. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.As many as 10 possible buyers were put through to a second round in early August. But the process has moved slowly since, people familiar with the matter said.As the sale process has dragged on, that has exacerbated bidders’ worries about keeping hold of Morgan Keegan’s staff after a sale, those people added. Based in Memphis, Tennessee, Morgan Keegan employs about 1,200 financial advisers.Regions and its advisers chose to exclude possible bank buyers, such as Wells Fargo, from bidding for the business after the unit’s management raised concerns about being sold to another institution, they said.While strategic bidders, including Stifel Nicolaus and Raymond James, initially expressed an interest in Morgan Keegan, they have since left the process.With about $132bn in assets, Alabama-based Regions is the largest regional bank yet to repay the US government’s 2008 investment through the troubled asset relief programme, or Tarp.Analysts at Deutsche Bank in September noted market concerns that the US Treasury may put pressure on the bank to repay the $3.5bn, forcing Regions to sell equity at depressed levels.Shares in Regions have fallen almost 50 per cent so far this year and on Monday were trading at $3.50.“We think this is unlikely, given Regions has no desire to issue equity at these levels and a forced raise could pressure the board to consider a sale of the company, in our view,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.
16;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-09-29T14:18:46Z;Wall St surges on German vote and GDP figures;;A flight to the safety of big name stocks seemed to be the only clear trend on a volatile day which saw strong divergence between the different US indices.The benchmark S&P 500 swung more than 3 per cent during the session, before closing 0.8 per cent up at 1,160.38. It was sandwiched by the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 1.3 per cent to 11153.91, and the smaller cap Nasdaq Composite index, which fell 0.4 per cent to 2,480.76.“Investors are heading to the safety of names offering quality and yield,” said Andrew Wilkinson, Chief Economic Strategist at Miller Tabak.“Risks appear to be rising as the month ends: Not something that was on the cards first thing this morning,”In the first minutes of trading the S&P had surged 2 per cent on news that the latest eurozone bailout packaged had passed a key vote in the German parliament, and an upward revision to second quarter growth data.Financials led the way, eventually closing up 2.8 per cent with life insurers faring particularly well.Genworth Financial closed up 7.8 per cent to $6.00 and Lincoln National Corporation up 5.6 per cent to $16.46.Investment bank Morgan Stanley jumped 6.6 per cent to $15.09 and rival Goldman Sachs was up 3.7 per cent to $99.87, although Deutsche Bank predicted Goldman would delcare a loss this quarter.Discover Financial Services, the Illinois-based credit card company, fell 1.2 per cent to $23.60 after revealing regulators plan to bring an enforcement case over its marketing of fee-based products.But it was a strange rally, with defensive utility stocks the second best performing sector in the S&P 500, ending the day up 1.5 per cent, and cyclical consumer discretionary and tech stocks down, 0.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.Advanced Micro, a semiconductor manufacturer, which supplies personal computer companies, fell 13.7 per cent to $5.31 after the California-based company reduced its forecast for quarterly revenue and gross margins.“We believe AMD had a tremendous opportunity to gain revenue share in notebooks this year,” Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote to clients. “However, a lack of component supply has been a major impediment to growth and will probably not be resolved in the near term.”Fellow semiconductor stock Micron Technology, which was set to declare results after the bell Thursday, was also down 4.1 per cent to $5.87.Consumer discretionary stocks were led down by internet stocks Amazon, off 3.2 per cent to $222.44 and Netflix, down 10.9 per cent to $113.19.James Cordwell, tech analyst at Atlantic Equities, said Netflix was suffering a “slow bleed” because of investor uncertainty over the company’s strategy, in the wake of a decision to separate the physical DVD delivery and streaming businesses.Several traders speculated that mutual funds were dumping small cap and less well known stocks ahead of the quarter end, when they will have to reveal holidings to clients.But others said the move to more liquid, highly traded stocks, made strategic sense.“It’s much more difficult to get out [of small caps] in a really bad market. It’s telling you the market is by no means assured that Europe has a handle on things.” said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap.US-listed Chinese stocks had a rough day after the Securities and Exchange Commission said the Justice Department is looking into allegations of accounting fraud.Sina Corporation, the e-commerce and social networking site, fell 9.7 per cent to $73.23. Youku, the recently listed video-streaming website fell 18.3 per cent to $16.25.Edwards LifeSciences tumbled after the administrator of the government’s Medicare and Medicaid programmes dealt a blow to hopes of a rapid roll-out for its new cardiovascular device.The medical device manufacturer is banking on strong revenue from its transcatheter aortic-valve implant (TAVI) device, a treatment for aortic stenosis – a heart disorder – that does not involve an operation.On Thursday, the Centre for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS) began the process for considering covering TAVI under the government’s health programmes.CMS approval would normally lead to private insurers following suit.But CMS suggested that trials be limited to patients deemed inoperable rather than include patients seeking an alternative to operations.“We think TAVI will deliver very good growth for Edwards in the long-term,” said Jason Mills, medical devices analyst at Cannacord Genuity. “But we think the consensus expectations on Wall Street have been too agressive on rollout in the first few years and that’s what’s suggested by CMS today.”Edwards shares fell 6.6 per cent to $70.87.Mosaic, the phosphate and potash producer, fell 5.2 per cent to $54.20 after reporting earnings of $1.17 a share for the quarter ended August 31.
17;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-09-26T20:58:27Z;Casino stocks hit by fears of Asian slowdown;;Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands slid to their fifth consecutive sessions of losses, and Melco Crown Entertainment its fourth in five, as investors fretted that a potential slowdown in the Chinese economy might effect their casino operations in Macau.“There seems to be an awful lot of concern that a slowdown in the Asian economies will reduce the funding that’s available for the corporate junket business, which is really the engine of these businesses’ growth in Macau,” said David Katz, an analyst at Jefferies.Wynn depended on its Macau operation for about a third of revenue, LVS for more than 40 per cent, and Melco for almost its entire business, Mr Katz said. All three operators are now down more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday, significantly underperforming the broad S&P 500.On Monday Wynn was down 1.4 per cent to $136.78, off more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday. LVS fell 1.6 per cent to $43.69, down 11.2 per cent over the five days. Melco fell 3.3 per cent to $9.85 and is off almost 17 per cent since Tuesday.But most analysts said company data did not suggest a slowdown was imminent. Carlo Santarelli, gaming analyst at Deutsche Banks said, “I’m not seeing anything fundamental out of Macau to make me believe there is anything changing in the VIP. I think the share price moves are more reflective of general macro fears in the equity markets.”Elsewhere, the S&P 500 bounced a healthy 2.3 per cent to 1,162.95, to snap a five day slump, driven by a strong rally in bank stocks.Financials in the S&P 500 rose 4.4 per cent, significantly more than any other sector. Citigroup jumped 7 per cent to $26.72 and JPMorgan was also up 7 per cent to $31.65. Bank of America also outperformed the sector, up 4.6 per cent to $6.60, as crisis meetings involving European and American officials once again raised hopes of a solution to the eurozone crisis, which has battered bank stocks.Gains for big banks pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 2.5 per cent to 11,043.86, but the Nasdaq Composite index, which has a lower weighting of financials, and whose bank stocks tend to be small domestic lenders, lagged behind, up only 1.4 per cent to 2,516.69.Consol Energy was the best performer in the S&P 500, gaining 9 per cent to $37.17, after announcing the $193m sale of royalties on a Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to Antero Corporation.Berkshire Hathaway shares rose 8.1 per cent to $108,449, after Warren Buffett’s company announced it would use some of its $48bn cash hoard to repurchase shares. The buy-back programme allows for unlimited purchases as long as the stock is trading at a premium of less than 10 per cent of book value, and the company’s cash pile remains above $20bn.Netflix was up 2.2 per cent to $132.22, despite reports of a deal with DreamWorks Animation to stream the studio’s content. Netflix’s share price has fallen by more than 50 per cent in recent weeks after it broke off negotiations to renew a content contract with the Stars cable network, and a move to separate its streaming and DVD delivery business lost it up to 1m subscribers.Expedia, the online travel company, jumped 4.7 per cent to $28.44 after Piper Jaffray analysts upgraded the stock to “buy”, arguing international bookings could account for 50 per cent of revenue by 2013.Clorox Company, the cleaning products manufacturer, was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, down 4.3 per cent to $66.44, after investor Carl Icahn withdrew his nominees to the board of directors, citing shareholder resistance to his attempted buy-out of the company. Clorox had been up almost 10 per cent for the year before Monday on expectations of a takeover.With the S&P 500 down 17 per cent from its April 29 peak at the start of the day, most analysts notes on Monday were discussing the probability of a bear market and how to position for it.Adam Parker, Morgan Stanley’s US equity strategist, said the high correlation among sectors in the S&P 500 leaves few obvious defensive plays. Less than a quarter of healthcare stocks and only half of consumer staple stocks have a correlation to the index of less than 0.9. The 80 per cent of utility stocks, which are exhibiting low correlation to the S&P 500, may be the best bet for investors expecting the market to enter bear territory.But, Mr Parker warned “low beta stocks have seen a recent increase in trading volume relative to high beta stocks”, which has driven up prices, so investors would have to pay a price to buy into defensive stocks.Two less intuitive candidates for defensive plays are exchanges and brokers. Exchanges have seen trading volumes spike during recent market volatility, which has increased revenue. Several analysts have recommended buying into the sector, and Nasdaq OMX, CME Group and Intercontinental­Exchange have all outperformed the S&P 500 since July 25.On the day, Nasdaq OMX was 0.3 per cent higher at $24.47, CME Group had gained 0.7 per cent to $259.83 and Intercontinental­Exchange had risen 0.4 per cent to $122.58.But Alex Kramm at UBS, who has “buy” ratings on all three names, said: “We still think there’s value in exchanges as a defensive play within financials.”The New York Stock Exchange is down 29 per cent since July 25, almost twice the fall in the S&P 500, although it has largely moved in tandem with potential merger partner Deutsche Börse, so has suffered from falls in European markets.Despite NYSE’s underperformance, “I’d hesitate to pick it as a favourite given uncertainty around the merger”, said Mr Kramm.Brokers have also benefited from a sharp rise in trading volumes. In a note last week Brad Hintz at Bernstein Research said Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and LPL Investment Holding, all of which have significantly underperformed their indices, had “relative near-term opportunities” from elevated trading volume.But on Monday he revised down earnings per share estimates for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, arguing that the impact of depressed IPO and M&A activity on investment bank earnings would outbalance any sharp rise in revenue from their brokerage businesses. He predicted Goldman Sachs would deliver a 20 cent loss per share in the third quarter.
18;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-09-19T21:04:56Z;Defence stocks diverge on M&A talk;;Goodrich Corp jumped 15.8 per cent to $107.60 on reports that industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation is preparing a bid for the aircraft manufacturer.Indications last week that Connecticut-based UTC was raising an acquisitions war chest had sent several shares in potential targets in the defence industry soaring.On Monday shares in Rockwell Collins, down 4.2 per cent to $53.87, and Textron, off 5.7 per cent at $17.57, dropped back, as UTC appeared to focus on Goodrich.Some analysts warned that those stocks could continue to see large swings, until UTC confirms an acquisition of Goodrich, but there seemed little prospect of HTC bidding for more than one company at once.“Buying Goodrich would take UTC’s net debt from 20 per cent to almost 50 per cent of market capitalisation. If it happens I don’t see them buying anyone else for a while,” Cai von Rumohr at Cowen and Company.UTC shares were up 0.1 per cent at $75.55.While defence stocks diverged, the rest of Wall Street suffered an almost uniformly dreary day. Every sector of the S&P 500 fell, as the benchmark index ended a five-day rally, and dipped back beneath 1,200 for large parts of the day.The index eventually ended the day down only 1 per cent to 1,204.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 11,401.01 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 per cent to 2,612.83.“Bears have taken charge again for the moment,” said Colin Cieszynski, market strategist at CMC Markets, as investor concern about a possible Greek default mounted once again. Cieszynski said traders was now looking to a specially extended two-day Federal Reserve meeting to reverse sentiment.“The street may look to more creative responses when the decision and comments come out on Wednesday afternoon,” he said.Big banks again saw heavy selling, with Morgan Stanley, down 7.9 per cent to $15.15 and bellwether regional bank Regions Financial off 4.8 per cent to $3.81.Online job search company Monster Worldwide fell 7 per cent per cent to $8.35, as recession fears hurt recruiters.Life insurers fell after rallying strongly last week. MetLife Inc fell 4.6 per cent to $31.51 and Genworth Financial fell 4.4 per cent to $5.89, in the process giving up almost all of its gains from last week.Investors continue to fear that record low Treasury interest rates and soft equity markets will hamper life insurers’ attempts to generate returns on premiums.In another sign of faltering sentiment, Barclays Capital, an investment bank that has maintained a bullish stance on the S&P 500 throughout recent volatility, advised clients to take a more defensive approach towards the index.“Following the early August 2011 sell-off, we positioned our sector recommendations to take advantage of what worked in the August 2010 rally. [Then] early to mid-cycle cyclicals outperformed …defensives underperformed,” US equities strategist Barry Knapp wrote to clients.But Mr Knapp conceded that “the leadership in the latest rally has had a decidedly defensive tone with utilities and healthcare leading the charge”.He told clients to remain “tactically tilted to cyclicals to take advantage of our expectation for a continued rally off the lows”, but to buy defensive dividend-yielding telecom stocks, which may be less correlated to the market in a further sell-off.Netflix fell 7.4 per cent to $143.75, after announcing it will hive off its DVD mail delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster.The stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since announcing on Thursday that it expected 1m customers to cancel subscriptions because of a price rise for combined DVD and streaming services.Among the bright spots, shares in Tyco International advanced 2.4 per cent to $44.75, after the industrial conglomerate said that it would split into three separate companies to maximise value.Shares in homebuilder Lennar advanced 4.9 per cent to $14.47 after the company reported quarterly results, which showed a quarter-on-quarter increase in new orders and a growing backlog of contracts to be complete.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, saying the medical wholesalers were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, arguing saying the medical wholesalers are were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.
19;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-09-08T21:14:22Z;Wall St retreats ahead of Obama speech;;"Yahoo shares rose 6.1 per cent to $14.44, despite a verbal broadside from sacked former chief executive Carol Bartz.Ms Bartz branded her former executive colleagues “doofuses”, but Yahoo investors were cheered when Third Point, an activist hedge fund, revealed it had taken a 5.2 per cent stake in the company. Third Point will push for the resignation of the board of directors and a clearer strategy, the fund said in filings.But the broad S&P 500 closed down 1.1 per cent at 1185.88, despite breaking through the 1,200 barrier earlier in the day, a level it has only touched on three other days since early August.Traders appeared to take advantage of Wednesday’s strong bounce – when the S&P 500 rose almost 3 per cent – to book profits ahead of President Obama’s speech to Congress on jobs on Thursday evening.“Our metrics still suggest risk is elevated and with no end in sight to European problems, our position is to sell into the strength of the market,” said Channing Smith, fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Semiconductor stocks surged, with Micron Technology, maker of Dram memory chips for personal computers, up 3.1 per cent at $6.25, extending its
gains for the week to almost 15 per cent.SanDisk rose 2.4 per cent to $38.52, and even embattled sector heavyweight Cisco was among the top gainers in the S&P 500, up 2.6 per cent at $16.29.Semiconductor stocks tend to be highly cyclical since demand for the components, which feature in everything from smartphones to solar panels and industrial machinery, is closely linked to global growth.But on Thursday the surge seemed to be driven by a positive earnings forecast by Nvidia on Wednesday.Analysts continued to warn of a potential fall in demand. JPMorgan lowered earnings estimates across the industry, citing “the tougher macro-environment” and “signs of weakness appear across the board”.Elsewhere, gold miner Newmont Mining rose 2.9 per cent to $65.66. Trading in the stock has soared in the past month as equity investors seek exposure to rising gold prices as a hedge against global growth.Newmont is now up 18 per cent since the start of August, while the S&P 500 index is off 8 per cent over the same period.But gold analysts point out this breaks with recent trading patterns in the stock. Until August, gold stocks had closely tracked stock market indices this year.“If you look at the betas of gold mining stocks against the S&P, they had become much more correlated with the index over the past five or six years,” says Alex Hacking at Citigroup.Mr Hacking said safe haven-seeking investors had triggered the more recent divergence between the stock and the broad index, but noted that gold mining stocks have underperformed gold itself.“Central banks and risk averse investors want physical gold, not a paper entitlement to the dividends of a gold mining company. Also whenever you get a spike in a metal price, the price-earnings ratios of associated mining stocks naturally come down. The market is distrustful of spikes in commodity prices, and is not willing to pay a high share price for earnings that might be temporary.”Filtration company Pall Corp, which fell 9.8 per cent to $44.03, was by far the biggest mover in the index.At 76 cents a share, Pall’s preliminary fourth-quarter results missed expectations, and Eric Krasnoff, chief executive, conceded they pointed to a “disappointing finish to an otherwise good year”.Urban Outfitters fell 1.2 per cent to $24.96 as RBC Capital and Citigroup lowered earnings per share estimates for the current quarter.Urban shares are now off 3.9 per cent for the week after the company used a scheduled update late on Tuesday to report that same-store sales were down as much as 3 per cent in the third quarter to date.Macroeconomic news was mixed with jobless claims rising unexpectedly by 2,000 to 414,000 in the week ended September 3 but the US trade deficit eased slightly in July as imports fell.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were down 2.3 per cent, more than any other sector. Bank of America fell 3.7 per cent at $7.20 and Citigroup was off 3.5 per cent at $27.98.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1 per cent at 11,295.81 and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 0.8 per cent to 2,529.14."

The reports of an Anglo American bid for Walter follow a confirmed bid last week from US coal miner Peabody for MacArthur, the Australian coal producer.“Reports of M&A in the coke and coal space are driving up shares across the sector,” said Jeremy Sussman, at Brean Murray Carret. “Anglo American is one of the biggest mining companies in the world so the possibility of activity by them will move stocks.”Alpha Natural Resources and Cliff Natural Resources, both companies which have coal and coke in their mining mix, were among the biggest gainers in the S&P 500. Alpha rose 10.6 per cent to $33.44 and Cliff was up 8.3 per cent to $81.46. Peabody also rose 6.9 per cent to $48.72.The S&P 500 energy sector advanced 3.7 per cent. Financials rallied 4.8 per cent, up 3 per cent for the week. Regional banks propelled gains.Regions Financial rose 12.3 per cent to $4.37, its largest single-day rally since March 2010.The stock had fallen heavily on Tuesday despite a note from Credit Suisse advising clients to buy regional banks.Credit Suisse argued regional bank business models already price in low interest rates because most loans are made to businesses at floating rates.That note seemed to be having an impact on Wednesday. Midwest lender Fifth Third Bancorp recorded a second straight day of strong gains, up 7.2 per cent to $10.45. Synovus, which has branches across the southern states, rose 10.7 per cent to $1.45. Bank of America rose 7 per cent to $7.48 after a reshuffle of senior management at the much scrutinised bank.The S&P 500 rose 2.9 per cent to 1,198.62, within touching distance of the 1,200 level, which it butted up against for much of August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.5 per cent to 11,414.86 and the Nasdaq Composite index put on 3 per cent to 2,548.94.Yahoo gained 5.4 per cent as investors greeted the dismissal ofCarol Bartz, chief executive. At $13.61, shares are trading near the level they were at when Ms Bartz was appointed in late 2008.“Yahoo’s board has generally been viewed as slow-moving and more passive; any kind of shake-up here will suggest greater interest in value creation,” said Doug Anmuth, internet analyst at JPMorgan, in a note to explain the share price move.Apart from M&A hopes, the rally appeared to be driven by positive sentiment about global growth with highly cyclical semiconductor stocks performing strongly.Nvidia rose 8.1 per cent to $14.25 after the company forecast positive quarterly earnings .Micron Technology was also up 6.9 per cent to $6.06.Sentiment also drove steel shares. Materials rose 2.7 per cent with US Steel leading the way, up 9.2 per cent to $29.92, and AK Steel, up 10.2 per cent at $8.90, despite a fall in weekly steel production.“It’s a mixture of bargain-hunters coming in to the market, because steel stocks have been beat up so much, and also the talk that President Obama’s stimulus plan might divert idle construction workers to infrastructure projects, which are a source of demand for steel,” Charles Bradford at Bradford Research, said. “But I would not be moving back into steel stocks until there is a clear sign of a turnround,” he added.JPMorgan lowered its earnings per share forecast for FedEx Corporation. JPMorgan said the business-driven package delivery service would suffer from weak demand. FedEx shares rose 3.6 per cent to $76.27.Citigroup upgraded DR Horton to buy, citing the low share price and an expected seasonal upturn in construction for the homebuilder. DR Horton shares rose 4.5 per cent to $10.17, while homebuilder Pulte Group rose 8.8 per cent to $4.58.C&J Energy Services rose 2.3 per cent to $25.53 after JPMorgan initiated coverage with the equivalent of a buy recommendation and a $41 target price. Citigroup also initiated coverage with a buy-high risk rating and a $33 price target.Exchange shares were higher after Deutsche Bank upgraded Nasdaq OMX to buy.

21;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-09-06T18:06:33Z;US banks lead Wall Street lower;;US bank stocks fell sharply on Tuesday – following the lead of their European counterparts 24 hours earlier – as renewed fears about eurozone sovereign debt hit investors’ confidence as they returned from a long Labor Day weekend.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 led the market lower, with bank shares down 1.8 per cent as the S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,165.24.The broad index has now more than reversed the late August four-day rally, and is trading only 60 points above its year lows seen early last month.“There is no reason to think this ends anytime soon,” said Dan Greenhouse, chief strategist at BTIG, blaming European politicians for the falls in US equities.Morgan Stanley was the biggest faller among the big banks, off 4 per cent at $15.33. Citigroup fell 2.5 per cent to $27.70. Bank of America, the biggest faller in early trading, pared some losses to close down 3.6 per cent at $6.99.On top of bond market jitters about Italian sovereign debt, US banks had their own bad news to contend with, as federal lawsuits against big banks dominated US headlines over the holiday weekend. The possible settlement of one case concerning foreclosure practices was balanced by a new case announced on Friday over mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.But Nomura analyst Brian Foran held out hope for bank stocks, predicting mortgage refinancing revenue “will be big in the second half of 2011”.In a note to clients Mr Foran argued that as many as 75 per cent of US mortgage holders have an incentive to refinance at current record low interest rates. “Capacity constraints and pricing power,” mean banks are better placed than customers to benefit, as they can charge customers interest rates higher than banks’ own cost of funding.Mr Foran upgraded Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp – up 1.4 per cent at $9.75 – from hold to buy, because of its large mortgage book.Mr Foran also said big mortgage originators, Wells Fargo – down 1.2 per cent to $23.92 – and Bank of America should receive temporary revenue boosts from refinancing.Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, said another refinancing spike, “would be helpful but not a game changer”.Even at the peak of the last refinancing spike in the fourth quarter of last year, mortgage refinancing revenue only accounted for 14 per cent of revenue at Wells Fargo and 11 per cent at Fifth Third.Credit Suisse recommended clients buy regional bank stocks, arguing low interest rates are already priced into their business models because most regional bank lending is to commercial clients at variable rates.On the other hand, national banks are likely to see interest rate margins compress over time, as fixed rate consumer loans mature and are refinanced at lower rates.Analyst Craig Siegenthaler recommended buying Fifth Third, Zions and Synovus Financial.But Zions and Synovus both fell, down 1.2 per cent to $15.99 and 2.2 per cent to $1.31 respectively. Bellwether regional bank, Regions Financial was among the the biggest fallers in the S&P 500, down 5.8 per cent at $3.89.Consumer discretionary stocks fell 0.4 per cent, with Harley Davidson, down 2.4 per cent to $35.15, suffering after a survey of dealers by RBC Capital Markets found sales growth likely slowed in August.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 4 per cent to $4.21.But consumer staples were also off 0.4 per cent, and utilities were down 0.6 per cent as defensive stocks fared badly too.Netflix shares rose 2.7 per cent to $218.77, after the company announced its Latin American customers will have access to Miramax content.Netflix shares are still down almost 10 per cent for the month after the breakdown, last week, of contract renewal talks with the cable network Starz.International Paper Company, the largest US pulp and paper maker, was the biggest riser in the S&P 500. Its shares rose 8.9 per cent to $27.77 after the company successfully concluded its 3 month battle to acquire shipping-box manufacturer Temple InlandThe $3.7bn bid values Temple-Inland at $32 a share. Temple shares rose 25 per cent to $30.85.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, underwriters of Dunkin’ Brands summer IPO, both initiated coverage of the donut and coffee chain owner. Goldman told clients to sell the stock. Morgan Stanley rated it hold. Analysts at both banks said the potential for earnings growth was already reflected in the share price.Dunkin shares rose 0.1 per cent to $27.02Energy stocks were down 1.1 per cent, but Sunoco was up 5.3 per cent at $38.03, after the chemical manufacturer decided to shut its last two petroleum refineries.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off 0.9 per cent at 11,139.3, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent at 2,473.83.
22;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-09-02T20:57:39Z;Mortgage mis-selling cloud hangs heavy over banks;;Weak employment data and reports that a government regulator would bring mortgage-related lawsuits against US-based banks, reversed what had been a week of strong gains on Wall Street.By Wednesday the S&P 500 index had recorded four successive days of gains for the first time since late June, and by Monday the index had closed above 1,200 for the first time since August 4. But at midday Friday it was down 1.7 per cent on the day.Traders said the sell-off was driven by the payrolls data, which showed the economy failed to add any jobs in August. But they said the decision by a government regulator to bring lawsuits against banks, would exacerbate problems.“[The bank lawsuits] kind of shocks me. Why would the administration, which has control over these things, let a regulator sue the banks, when it’s trying to create jobs?” said Randy Warren, fund manager at Warren Financial Service.“The banks have been leading markets lower for three years, and now we could go back to the lows at the start of August,” he added.The S&P 500 index was at 1,183.58, up only 0.5 per cent for the week, far beneath the week high of 1,230 on Wednesday. Financial stocks in the index were down 2.8 per cent Friday, and off 0.7 per cent for the week.The lawsuit to be bought by the Federal Housing and Finance Agency will accuse banks of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, said the biggest US players in mortgage securitisation up to 2008 were Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.All three stocks fell on Friday. Bank of America, down 6.5 per cent on the day and 4.6 per cent lower for the week, was among the biggest fallers in the S&P 500.Goldman fell 4.6 per cent Friday to $106.96. The stock was down 4.3 per cent for the week and on course for its second day of big losses after the bank wrote down $53m of delinquent mortgage loans on Thursday as part of a deal over mortgage and foreclosure practices at its former subsidiary Litton Loan Servicing.JPMorgan shares were down 3.9 per cent at $34.90, a 3.6 per cent loss for the week. Regional banks, which originated many mortgages, but were less active in securitisation, fared slightly better. Regions Financial was down 2.2 per cent to $4.22 on Friday. But Citigroup, which Mr Staite said had not been active in securitising, was down 3.7 per cent on Friday and 3.2 per cent lower for the week at $28.90.“The lawsuit leaves huge uncertainty hanging over the whole sector,” Mr Staite said.“The fact that a regulator has filed a case may add credibility to private lawsuits that are already pending. And more suits could follow in the next year.”Mr Staite said bank stocks could remain volatile for some time, as investors have no real way of calculating either how much lawsuits will cost, or how able banks are to withstand losses.“There is no precedent for similar lawsuits, so investors don’t know how the courts will react. And banks have been reluctant to disclose the size of their legal reserves, because the people making claims might use the information to their advantage.”Netflix, the DVD and movie-streaming website, fell 9.3 per cent on Friday, down 4.9 per cent for the week at $211.70, after the cable network Starz broke off contract renewal talks over differences in pricing and packaging.“We believe Starz accounts for roughly 8 per cent of total NFLX viewing hours and the absence of the Starz content diminishes NFLX overall film content,” Credit Suisse analyst John Blackledge said.However he maintained his $310 target price and urged clients to buy while the share price was depressed.AT&T was down 2.9 per cent for the week at $28.19, after the government declared its intention to block the mobile network’s $39bn bid for smaller rival T Mobile, on competition grounds.Sprint, the third-largest network in the US, which would be dwarfed by both AT&T and Verizon, was the main beneficiary of the government’s move. Despite a 5 per cent fall Friday, Sprint shares were still up 9.2 per cent for the week at $3.55.Newmont Mining, was a top performer, up 2.7 per cent on Friday at $64.18. The stock was up 3.2 per cent for the week suggesting there was still plenty of appetite for counter-cyclical stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 0.3 per cent for the week at 11,315.53, but the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1 per cent to 2,505.22.
23;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-08-22T21:08:59Z;Wall Street buoyed by QE3 speculation;;US stocks ended the day almost flat after falling bank stocks put paid to an early rally, which had been driven by hopes of a further round of monetary stimulus.Bank of America suffered its fourth largest single-day loss of the year, at one point coming within touching distance of its year low of $6.31, as it struggled to manage bad news.Layla Peruzzi, equity derivatives head at Jefferies, said that “the market is forcing [Bank of America] into a capital raise” and predicted that the Charlotte-based lender would have to raise up to $50 billion through disposals or by issuing new shares.Separately the bank’s card unit agreed to pay $5 million and suspend arbitrations of consumer debt collections in California for two years, to settle a lawsuit brought by the state.The company’s plan to raise capital through disposals took a blow when Zhang Jianguo, president of China Construction Bank, said Bank of America had agreed to retain at least half its 10 per cent holding in CCB.Bank of America was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, its shares closing down 7.9 per cent at $6.42, as financials in the S&P 500 lost 1.3 per cent, more than any other sector.On Monday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said residential mortgage delinquencies during the second quarter rose by 0.1 of a percentage point to 12.9 per cent, after falling at the beginning of the year from last year.The KBW index of bank stocks hit a year low of 35.04 before closing down 1.1 per cent at 35.10.But regional banks rallied slightly. Regions Financial was up 0.5 per cent at $3.88, and bank stocks appeared to be trading on news rather than economics.Goldman Sachs lost 4.7 per cent in late trading to close at $106.51, after Reuters reported chief executive Lloyd Blankfein had hired high profile corporate defence lawyer Reid Weingarten, as the Justice Department continues to investigate the bank.“Mr Blankfein and other individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection with the Justice Department’s inquiry into certain matters raised in the [senate permanent subcommittee on investigations] report hired counsel at the outset,” Goldman Sachs told the Financial Times.The S&P 500 had been up as much as 2 per cent in early trade as investors looked to the Fed to signal another round of quantitative easing after four weeks of sustained losses.Fed chairman Ben Bernanke will speak on Friday in Jackson Hole. “The market is expecting another round of asset purchases and it will come,” said Matthias Jasper, head of equities at WGZ Bank AG.But the S&P 500 again closed near its year low of 1,101.54, up just 0.02 per cent on the day at 1,123.81. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent at 1,084.50.Hewlett-Packard gained 3.6 per cent to close at $24.45, reversing some of Friday’s big losses, helping the Nasdaq close up 0.2 per cent at 2,345.38.Colin Cieszynski, market strategist at CMC Markets, warned investors against relying on Mr Bernanke to prop up stock prices.“The higher markets rise this week on QE3 anticipation, the more vulnerable they may become should the street not get what it wants,” he said.With Brent crude easing, after rebel forces entered Tripoli, the SIG Oil Exploration and Production index fell 2.4 per cent to 400.79.“A lower oil price pressures the economics of upstream oil development,” said Hsulin Peng, senior analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. But if cheaper oil stimulates the global economy, “increased demand could offset price declines”.While Brent fell, West Texas Intermediate rose. That hurt refiners with strong access to WTI crude on fears that the rising price of inputs, coupled with weak demand for finished oil products, would erode margins.Marathon Petroleum was down 6.9 per cent to $32.58 as the stock’s newness and its dependence on WTI crude weighed on the share price.But Mark Gilman, refineries analyst at Benchmark, said: “The prices of finished oil products are quite properly tracking the price of Brent crude. US investors shouldn’t fixate on the price of WTI.”While investors were trading on sentiment, there was more bad news from the real economy.The Chicago Fed National Activity Index for July registered -0.06, the fourth successive month that the index has been negative.JPMorgan reduced its target price for FedEx 10 per cent to $105 and cut its 2012 earnings per share forecast for the company from $6.60 to $6.Performance at the business mail delivery service is watched as a gauge of overall economic strength. FedEx was down 0.2 per cent at $73.00.
24;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-08-10T20:56:48Z;US stocks resume downturn;;US equities once again fell sharply on Wednesday, wiping out a late-Tuesday rally that many had hoped would represent a bottom to August’s steep declines.Financials continued to lead the move lower, dropping 7.1 per cent as a sector by the close. Citigroup fell 10.5 per cent to $28.49, and Bank of America fell 6.8 per cent to $6.77.The major indices ended the session at the day’s lows, with S&P 500 index falling 4.4 per cent to 1,120.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.6 per cent to 10,719.48, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 4.1 per cent to 2,381.05.The chief executive of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, sought to allay fears. On Wednesday he said the bank would seek to pay a dividend as soon as possible, and said it would not seek new equity capital.But the two largest US financial institutions, seen as highly sensitive to a US economic slowdown, only endured further volatility. Wednesday’s losses wiped out the brief rally in the shares on Tuesday, bringing them back near their lows seen after a 20 per cent correction on Monday.Leading financial declines on Wednesday were regional banks. Regions Financial fell 11.5 per cent to $4.23, and SunTrust slipped 11.5 per cent to $5.80. Wells Fargo, seen as one of the better-capitalised banks, still fell 7.7 per cent, to $22.88.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets recommended that investors should keep buying bank stocks. “It is important to remember that bank fundamentals are strong and we believe they are getting stronger,” they wrote.However, they also warned that regulatory uncertainty was weighing on the stocks. “The Federal Reserve needs to provide the [systemically important financial institution] buffers and a timetable to reach them,” they wrote.The troubles of large European banks weighed as well. France’s credit rating, much as the US’s was earlier this week, is feared to be vulnerable as European countries are all called to fund bail-outs to “peripheral” economies such as Greece.Glenn Schorr, analyst at Nomura, said: “Despite the low valuations, we believe macro concerns will probably keep buyers on the sidelines in the near term”.There were gains in the sector, however, unlike in previous sessions. Capital One, the consumer lender and credit card group, agreed to acquire the US card businesses of HSBC for $30bn, which follows its earlier $9bn deal to buy ING’s US deposit unit. It is now among the five largest consumer depositaries in the US. The shares rose 0.7 per cent to $41.05.“This is a strong acquisition for Capital One and complements the ING acquisition,” said analysts at Citigroup.AvalonBay Communications, the property management group, was up 0.1 per cent to $125.67, after it was named as a possible buyer of rival Archstone, still owned by the bankrupt Lehman Brothers estate.The market had initially slipped to new lows on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold rates near zero until 2013, but did not extend any additional liquidity programmes.After the S&P 500 dropped to just above 1,100, many traders stepped in to close shorts, believing that the Fed’s promise of liquidity could be a catalyst for gains. But the market quickly resumed its initial move at Wednesday’s open.“The Fed did not commit to a third round [of quantitative easing] yesterday. Some traders seeking a bottom may have inferred they were likely to do so, but they didn’t do that,” said Clark Yingst, chief market strategist at Joseph Gunnar.Mr Yingst said that energy groups and other commodity-linked companies would benefit the most if investors believed “QE3” of some form was imminent. “Hard assets will be what people are seeking if there is ultimately going to be a round three of easing,” he said.ExxonMobil, the crude oil giant, was down 4.4 per cent at $68.03 on Wednesday, and Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was down 3.3 per cent at $43.55.Materials groups CF Industries, the fertiliser producer, and Newmont Mining, the gold producer, were among the market’s most resilient performers, as the sector outperformed, down 3.3 per cent. CF’s shares were off by 0.3 per cent at $149.59 and Newmont added 0.7 per cent to $55.81.Retailer Macy’s succumbed to the sell-off, dropping 3.6 per cent to $24.52, despite the department store chain raising its full-year earnings forecast from $2.45 to as much as $2.65 a share.Polo Ralph Lauren, the apparel designer, added 4.5 per cent to $125.28 after it topped analyst expectations by earning $1.90 for the quarter, versus forecasts of $1.47.Walt Disney fell 9.1 per cent to $31.54 as the entertainment and media group missed forecasts for its revenues this quarter. Sales totalled $1.62bn, versus $1.83bn that had been forecast.Analysts at Nomura lowered their price target from $45 to $42 a share. “The stock is likely to be range-bound unless the macro outlook brightens or earnings begin to beat expectations again,” they said.
25;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-04-15T18:15:43Z;Earnings leave Wall Street stocks flat;;Disappointing results from Bank of America and Google weighed on the financial and technology sectors, but strong manufacturing and consumer sentiment data left the wider markets higher in the final session of a lacklustre week for US equities.Bank of America reported a 36 per cent decline in first-quarter profit as the foreclosures crisis continued to squeeze its home loan business.Earnings came in at $2bn, or $0.17 per share, falling short of the $0.26 per share expected by analysts.This left the stock down 2.3 per cent to $12.83, with news that the bank had made a deal with Assured Guaranty to resolve all its mortgage repurchase claims serving to limit further losses on the stock.Bank of America shares have fallen 33.9 per cent in the past year, the worst-performing stock in the 24-company BKX banking index, thanks partly to worries over its mortgage liabilities.The results weighed slightly on the financial sector, with Capital One losing 0.4 per cent to $50.03 and Regions Financial falling 1 per cent to $7.17. The BKX banking index was down 0.2 per cent.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in Google dropped 8.3 per cent to $530.70 after the internet search group reported a 54 per cent jump in first-quarter operating costs.The news raised fears that Google was facing a deterioration in its underlying cost structure as it tried to maintain growth. The higher costs left profits below expectations, with pro forma earnings per share reaching $8.08, against the $8.13 analysts had forecast.These results dragged on the wider technology sector. Shares in Cognizant Technology Solutions were down 2.6 per cent to $78.72 while Yahoo lost 0.4 per cent to $16.62. The S&P technology index was down 0.4 per cent, the worst performing S&P sub-index.In spite of this, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,319.68 – down 0.6 per cent over the week – after the Empire State manufacturing survey showed that economic activity was expanding faster than expected in the New York area.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced that its manufacturing index rose to 21.7 in April, ahead of the 17 point reading expected by economists. A figure greater than zero signals expansion.The Empire State index is the first of several regional manufacturing gauges to be released each month, although that from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve is seen as the most significant as a gauge of the strength of the wider economy.The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index also came in slightly better than expected at 69.6. In other economic data, US prices rose 0.5 per cent in March according to the Labor Department. This was the ninth straight month of increases in the consumer price index, but it was in line with forecasts, and so did little to sway the markets.Overall, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent at 12,341.98 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 2,764.65. The indices have lost 0.3 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively in the past five days.The disappointing week on Wall Street began with sharp losses in energy and material stocks as commodity prices softened. This was partly due to Goldman Sachs advising clients to lock in profits on oil and other commodities.Lower than expected quarterly revenue from Alcoa, the first S&P company to report results, compounded negative sentiment in the material sector. Alcoa was down 7.8 per cent to $16.52 over the week while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 10.6 per cent to $51.17.The S&P material sector fell 2.3 per cent over the week while the energy sector lost 3.1 per cent.Towards the end of the week, financial stocks were in focus after the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations found that banks, including Goldman Sachs, had mis-sold mortgage-backed securities and misled investors and lawmakers. Shares in Goldman were down 3.6 per cent to $155.13 over the week while the S&P financial sector lost 2 per cent.JPMorgan Chase was down 4.2 per cent to $44.89, despite releasing quarterly results on Wednesday that beat forecasts.Arcos Dorados, the world’s largest McDonald’s franchisee, saw a strong opening week of trading, rising 25.5 per cent to $21.36. Zipcar, the web-based hourly car rental group, was similarly successful, trading at $27.16 – 52.6 per cent above where the IPO originally priced.
26;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-03-24T21:06:52Z;S&P 500 breaches 1,300 barrier;;Strong earnings numbers from Red Hat led the technology sector higher, while the wider markets ticked up as healthy employment data gave traders a new focus away from global political tensions.The developer of open-source software reported net profits up 43 per cent in the fourth quarter, topping analysts expectations and sending shares soaring 18.2 per cent to $47.26.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Micron Technology was up 8.4 per cent to $11.50 after the chipmaker reported better than expected revenue for its second quarter. The S&P technology index advanced 1.6 per cent, the best performing sector in the session.Those gains helped the S&P 500 benchmark index finish 0.9 per cent higher at 1,309.66, climbing past the psychologically significant 1,300 mark for the first time since the earthquake struck Japan two weeks ago.Sentiment on Wall Street was helped by employment data showing that the number of people in the US seeking jobless benefits had fallen by 5,000 to 382,000 last week. The four-week average of claims fell to its lowest point since July 2008.This helps to provide “strong evidence that the labour market recovery is for real,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, the consultancy.Optimism over the domestic economic recovery in the session outweighed more global concerns.“There is a tug-of-war going on in the markets at the moment,” said Douglas Godine, head of equities at Signal Hill. “On the one hand we have an improving economy, the Fed staying accommodating and strong company earnings. On the other there is uncertainty over Japan, the Middle East and, to a lesser extent, Portugal,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 12,171.17 in the session and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4 per cent to 2,736.42.The S&P 500, having cleared the 1,300 mark, is now 1.1 per cent higher than it was before the natural disaster in Japan, but still 2.5 per cent lower than before the eruption of conflict in north Africa and the Middle East.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility the market, was down 5.7 per cent in the session but was still up 10 per cent since before the tensions began in the Middle East.Retail stocks saw some of the strongest gains in a session where the domestic economy was in focus.GameStop, the video game retailer, was up 3 per cent to $21.74 after reporting a 10 per cent jump in fourth-quarter profits and issuing a forecast for the current quarter that beat expectations. Elsewhere in the sector, Walmart added 1.8 per cent to $52.59 while Costco was up 1.7 per cent to $72.11.The S&P consumer services index gained 0.8 per cent, one of the best performances among major S&P sub-indicesThe retail sector was weighed down by Best Buy, however, which lost 5.3 per cent to $30.15 after the electronics retailer reported earnings down 16 per cent in the fourth quarter due to restructuring costs and weak TV and entertainment hardware sales.In deal news, Walgreen, the pharmacy chain, said it would buy Drugstore.com, the online drug retailer, in a deal worth $429m. The news sent shares in Drugstore.com rocketing 113.1 per cent to $3.82, while Walgreen added 0.3 per cent to $39.96.Bank of America lost ground for the second day as investors continued to digest news that the Federal Reserve had “objected” to its proposed dividend hike. The stock was also hit by a number of rating downgrades and shares were down 1.3 per cent to $13.48, adding to the 1.7 per cent losses on Wednesday.Wells Fargo removed the bank from its “Priority Stock List,” citing slower dividend improvement as one reason for the decision.Elsewhere, Regions Financial was down 0.6 per cent to $7.13, adding to a 1.8 per cent loss in the previous session, but the financial sector as a whole was up. The BKX banking index rose 0.3 per cent, paring some of the 0.6 per cent in losses seen on Wednesday.Among the other stocks in focus, Imax, the operator of large-screen cinemas, climbed 12.4 per cent to $29.90 after Richard Gelfond, the chief executive officer, said they planned to open at least 100 theatres a year for the next two to three years.AT&T, the wireless carrier which recently announced a $39bn acquisition of T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom, was up 1.4 per cent to $28.54 after Bernstein upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “market perform”.
27;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-03-23T14:26:03Z;Financials weigh on Wall Street;;Bank of America lost ground after announcing that the Federal Reserve had “objected” to its planned dividend increase, while the wider markets edged lower for another day as oil prices tipped over $105 a barrel.The bank said it had submitted a plan to the Fed for a “modest increase” in its dividend for the second half of 2011 but that they had “objected to the proposed increase in capital distributions”. Shares were down 1.4 per cent to $13.68.Last Friday, financial stocks on Wall Street were given a boost following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders. But this news left the S&P financial index down 0.7 per cent, the worst performing sector of the session.JPMorgan Chase, which itself announced a dividend last Friday, was down 1 per cent to $45.01. Elsewhere, Zions Bancorporation fell 1.2 per cent to $23.11, while Regions Financial lost 1.8 per cent to $7.17. Goldman Sachs was 1.3 per cent lower to $158.65.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent to 1,289.25, adding to the 0.4 per cent loss in the previous session, as oil prices ticked up and traders continued to try and assess the impact of the conflict in Libya and the fallout from the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.Adobe Systems, the software developer, was down 3.2 per cent to $31.83 after lowering its second-quarter revenue forecast due to the Japanese earthquake.Japan is Adobe’s second-biggest market after the US and accounts for between 10 to 15 per cent of revenue each quarter. The company also reported an 85 per cent rise in fiscal first-quarter profit.The S&P technology sector was down 0.3 per cent with semiconductor stocks losing ground in spite of assurances from analysts that the supply chain disruptions from the Japanese disaster would not sprawl.“We believe the Japan earthquake will result in only a temporary disruption to the semiconductor supply chain and stock prices,” analysts at JPMorgan said. “As a result, we maintain our constructive stance on semiconductors,” the note continued.Investors remained nervous and Applied Materials lost 1.2 per cent to $14.93, while Rubicon Technology fell 2.8 per cent to $25.80. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.6 per cent, down 1.7 per cent overall since the natural disaster in Japan.Elsewhere in the technology sector Jabil Circuit, the world’s third-largest electronics manufacturing services company, was up 8.6 per cent to $20.58 after giving a third-quarter earnings forecast that exceeded analysts’ expectations.
28;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2011-01-21T03:32:54Z;Fifth Third raises funds to repay Tarp;;"Fifth Third, a leading Midwestern bank, sold $1.7bn in shares on Thursday to help repay funds the US Treasury lent it during the financial crisis.The US government invested $389bn in US financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 and $118.5bn of that is still outstanding, highlighting the struggle many banks face to stabilise their loan portfolios even as the broader economy shows signs of recovery.Four of the 19 banks that were subjected to government stress tests have not repaid funds to the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The group includes Fifth Third, KeyCorp, Regions Financial and SunTrust Financial.On Wednesday, Cincinnati-based Fifth Third said it was selling $1.7bn worth of shares in a secondary offering. The shares priced on Thursday at $14, a 4 per cent discount to their previous close. The bank said it would use the proceeds from the sale together with a five-year bond issue to repay $3.4bn in government loans.JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs were bookrunners. Bankers have competed fiercely for roles in share sales by bailed-out institutions, including the impending sale of shares in AIG. Anshu Jain, global head of Deutsche Bank’s investment bank, personally visited Cincinnati to pitch the plan, according to a source close to the deal.Also on Wednesday, Fifth Third reported that non-performing assets fell 8 per cent to $4.2bn in the fourth quarter from a year ago, versus total assets of $111bn. The improvement was driven by a pick-up in commercial business loans, leases and construction loans.Quarterly net income was $270m, versus a loss of $160m a year earlier, as the bank released $190m of reserve funds.Fifth Third’s shares fell 2.7 per cent to $14.22 on Thursday. ""The company still has significant credit issues to work through,” said Paul Miller, analyst at FBR Capital Markets.The Federal Reserve announced this month that it would begin a second round of stress tests, retesting the same 19 banks, as JPMorgan Chase and others face pressure from investors to begin returning capital.KeyCorp, based in Cleveland, Ohio, and SunTrust, based in Atlanta, Georgia, have also turned profits in recent quarters. SunTrust reports earnings on Friday, and KeyCorp next week. The two banks are also anticipated to announce capital raisings to repay Tarp in conjunction with the second round of stress tests.“We have already set aside the full amount of money to repay the Government’s investment,” said Michael McCoy, a spokesman for SunTrust. KeyCorp declined to comment.Regions Financial, based in Birmingham, Alabama, has not turned a profit since the second quarter of 2009. It reports earnings next week."
29;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2010-12-22T22:00:12Z;US stocks rally on economic data;;"US stocks closed at levels not seen since the crash of Lehman Brothers after data showed the US economy had grown faster than previously estimated in the third quarter.US economic growth rose at an annualised rate of 2.6 per cent, above the previous estimate of 2.5 per cent but below economist forecasts for an increase to 2.8 per cent. Investors chose to focus on the possibilities for future growth and Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, was optimistic about the prospects for growth in 2011.“At this stage, real GDP growth in the fourth quarter looks to be tracking at about a 3.5 per cent pace, and the first quarter is likely to enjoy even better growth owing to the initial beneficial effect of the payroll tax cut,” he said.He added that 3.5 per cent growth in the fourth quarter next year would not be “unreasonable”.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,258.82, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to close at 11,559.49 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,671.48.Financials continued to lead the rally and were up 1.1 per cent.“They have been laggards throughout the year but there’s been a pick-up in M&A [mergers and acquisitions] activity in financials,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, who added that larger banks would benefit from an improvement in the US economy and a steepening of the yield curve.JPMorgan surged 2.8 per cent to $42.16 and Bank of America jumped 3.1 per cent to $13.38. Regional banks continued to outperform their bigger brothers with Regions Financial soaring 7.1 per cent to $6.91, the most in the S&P 500, and Fifth Third Bancorp gaining 2.9 per cent to $14.71.Meanwhile, Nike was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, dropping 5.7 per cent to $877 after the sports brand’s future order figures were below analyst expectations, even though they forecast orders would rise 11 per cent. The company also said that it might have to increase prices on some items to offset the rising cost of cotton, labour and transport. But it added that while this would weigh on results in the second half of this fiscal year, the pressure should ease over the next 12 to 18 months.But earnings beat expectations in its second quarter. Analysts at FBR Capital Markets reiterated their “outperform” rating for the stock and raised its price target from $90 to $98.“Strong sales momentum and margin expansion continued in [the second quarter] as Nike exploits the power of its business model and brand strength to drive growth, not only through continued penetration of emerging global markets, its greatest opportunity, but also through impressive strength in mature markets,” they said.They added that the strength of the Nike brand should make it easier to pass along cost increases to the consumer.Walgreen jumped 5.5 per cent to $38.85 after the pharmacy chain posted a first-quarter profit that beat expectations. Prescription sales rose while the retailer opened stores at a slower pace, controlling costs.In technology, Dell edged higher by 0.3 per cent to $13.88 after it continued its expansion into cloud computing by buying medical archiving company InSite One for an undisclosed sum. Red Hat became the latest tech group to report its quarterly results. The seller of the Linux operating system slipped from its 52-week high, slumping
2.5 per cent to $46.70.Third-quarter revenue rose 21 per cent and earnings per share matched Wall Street’s expectations.The software maker followed Adobe and other technology companies and issued an optimistic outlook, forecasting profit and revenue above the average analyst expectationsElsewhere in technology, Microsoft said it was working on a version of its Windows operating systems for devices including tablet computers. Microsoft added 0.4 per cent to $28.19.But shares in Intel dipped 1 per cent to $20.89 because it was reported that Microsoft has plans to run the new version using chips from Intel’s UK rival Arm Holdings.

30;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2010-12-21T21:31:37Z;US tech stocks higher on Adobe earnings;;Strong earnings and an optimistic outlook from Adobe Systems helped the technology sector rise as US stocks closed just shy of highs not seen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Adobe jumped 6 per cent to $30.93 after the software maker forecast earnings far above analyst expectations.The optimistic outlook marks a turnround from more cautious guidance three months ago as sales of its Creative Suite 5 product rebounded from a dip earlier in the year. The software accounts for most of Adobe’s sales.The company forecast revenue in the first quarter of between $1bn and $1.05bn, above the average analyst projection of $991.9m.Adobe also exceeded expectations in its fourth quarter, with earnings per share of 56 cents compared with the 52 cents consensus.Analysts at FBR Capital Markets raised their price target for the company but maintained its “market perform” rating.“We believe upside potential is limited as we enter the back half of the CS5 product cycle [and] uncertainty surrounding the Flash franchise remains,” they said, adding that Adobe’s move to a recurring revenue model would be good for the longer term but was likely to be disruptive in the short term.Analysts at Citigroup said they preferred other software companies.“We believe that investors are better served owning other similarly or more-cheaply valued software companies … where we have a higher degree of confidence in near- to medium-term growth prospects [and] which are not as tied to specific industry verticals, and/or that are more leveraged to a rebound in corporate capital spending in the data centre.”The S&P 500 technology index gained 0.6 per cent and the wider market continued to hover around its two-year highs.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,254.61, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.5 per cent to close at 11,533.16 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.7 per cent higher at 2,667.61.Jabil Circuit was another technology company to beat expectations and raise forecasts. The electronics manufacturing services provider’s shares surged 10.7 per cent to $19.55, the most in the S&P 500, after it said it had seen strong growth across its divisions.The company forecast second-quarter earnings of 49 to 53 cents per share compared with the average 44 cents estimate.“While the quarter was strong, the bigger story remains how Jabil is moving upmarket to attack opportunities that offer a ‘less traditional’ and higher margin profile,” said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, who maintained an “outperform” rating.“We believe the multiple will continue to expand as investors get comfortable around Jabil’s business transformation that will drive sustainably higher revenues and margins going forward.”In contrast, CarMax tumbled 7.6 per cent to $33.17, the most in the S&P 500, even though the used car retailer reported better than expected earnings.Strong sales from its wholesale unit helped revenue rise 23 per cent but gross profit per vehicle was lower than some analysts had expected.Financials led the risers with the S&P 500 financials index gaining 1.6 per cent, Bank of America adding 2.9 per cent to $12.98, Wells Fargo gaining 2.4 per cent to $30.82 and AIG climbing 3.3 per cent to $55.18.Regional banks climbed even further, up 1.9 per cent, with Regions Financial rising 2.2 per cent to $6.45 and Zions Bancorp higher by 2.1 per cent to $23.02.End-of-year deal activity continued. Martek Biosciences soared 35.6 per cent to $31.67 after the baby food ingredients maker agreed to be bought by DSM, a Dutch group.DSM, which makes vitamins, is paying $1.1bn for the US company, which specialises in healthy, natural ingredients and algal technology.Massey Energy added 1.2 per cent to $52.45 after it was reported that the US coal producer had received an offer from rival Alpha Natural Resources. Shares in Alpha Natural Resources rose 2.8 per cent to $55.10.
31;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2010-12-19T19:48:47Z;Regional US banks looking to mergers;;"US regional banks are preparing for consolidation as the hangover from the financial crisis and the sluggish economic recovery put pressure on underperforming lenders to raise capital or sell to a rival.Bankers and their advisers say the next two years could witness several mergers among the 7,000-plus banks that make up the backbone of the US banking system.On Friday, Marshall & Ilsey, a troubled mid-western lender, agreed to a $4.1bn all-stock takeover by Bank of Montreal, a Canadian bank that avoided large losses during the crisis.Analysts say that this type of deal between struggling local lenders and healthier, bigger competitors could be a template for future takeovers.“We expect a wave of . . . bank consolidation to emerge within the next 12-18 months after a dearth of deals during and immediately after the financial crisis,” wrote Christopher McGratty, at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in a note to clients.With the “big three” national banks - JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo - still digesting the large acquisitions made during the turmoil, buyers are likely to be large regional players with solid balance sheets and robust earnings.KBW analysts said banks such as Pittsburgh-based PNC, US Bancorp, the fifth-largest commercial bank in the US, and BB&T, a North Carolina lender, were among the companies that could hit the takeover trail to boost profits.Canadian banks such as BMO and TD Bank Financial Group could also be among the ­acquirers.Bankers said potential targets included banks whose recovery from the crisis has been slow because of their exposure to soured mortgages and commercial real estate loans.Among the possible sellers, industry experts named Regions Financial Corporation, a loss-making lender with more than $130bn in assets and about 1,800 branches in the south and midwest of the US; Synovus, a smaller bank with exposure to the troubled real estate markets of Georgia and Florida; and Atlanta-based SunTrust.SunTrust and Regions are among the largest remaining recipients of government aid, with $4.9bn and $3.5bn outstanding under the Troubled Asset Relief Programme. The two are part of a group of banks undergoing “stress tests” by the Federal Reserve to determine whether they are healthy enough to repay Tarp.Regions, SunTrust and Synovus declined to comment.US banks have often been a fertile source of deals. Despite a raft of takeovers that helped create today’s financial powerhouses such as BofA, JPMorgan and Citigroup, the industry remains fragmented.Bank deals slowed to a crawl in 2008 as the crisis set in, with government-assisted takeovers of failing lenders the only source of activity. But as the worst of the downturn receded, many banks rebuilt their balance sheets and churned out higher profits. Their recovery has stood in stark relief to some banks still reeling from loan losses and tepid fee income."

The company predicted revenue in the current quarter would be between $5.5bn and $5.7bn, compared with analyst projections of $5.46bn and earnings per share would be between $1.74 and $1.80, more than the $1.61 predicted.But analysts at RBC Capital Markets, who class the stock as a “top pick”, still warned that fears over its competitiveness could hang over RIM in the short term.“Despite strong results, near-term sentiment is expected to remain polarised over RIM’s competitiveness (particularly ahead of a Verizon iPhone), pending visibility catalysts (spec-leading Smartphones, Playbook) which in our view should help re-establish investor confidence regarding RIM’s innovation and competitiveness,” they said.Shares in RIM, which also beat expectations this quarter, added 1.6 per cent to $60.20 and the wider technology sector gained 0.1 per cent.Meanwhile, concerns about Europe weighed on investor sentiment after
rating agency Moody’s downgraded Ireland’s credit rating by five notches.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 at 1,243.90 but was up 0.2 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.1 per cent to close at 11,491.91, higher by 0.8 per cent on the five days, while the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,642.97, almost flat over the week.The Vix, which measures expected volatility, fell 7.3 per cent to 16.12.Overnight the US House of Representatives approved the tax bill, which, once the president signs it, will extend Bush-era tax cuts.“The tax bill is a major positive for next year. I know some people say that it’s not that stimulative but it is that stimulative,” said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds. “Economic growth should step up a gear to 4 per cent.”In deals news, Marshall & Ilsley Corp jumped 18.3 per cent to $6.85 after the regional bank said it had agreed to be acquired by the Bank of Montreal in an all-stock transaction.“If you look at Canadian banks, we like the strength of their balance sheets, profits growth and the very strong Canadian economy and we think they will continue to be net buyers of troubled bank franchises in the US,” said John Pandtle, portfolio manager at Eagle Asset Management.Other regional banks rose as investors hoped for more deal activity in the sector. The S&P 500 regional bank index was up 1.5 per cent."
33;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

The average forecast for November had been a rise of 0.6 per cent.“It should not go unnoticed that retail sales are just a hair below the November 2007 high,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “[But] the report is not all roses and unicorns. Sales at furniture and electronics stores declined, both falling for the second consecutive month.”Some retail stocks edged up. Discounter Target added 0.5 per cent to $59.08, department store owner Macy’s rose 0.9 per cent to $25.18 and teen fashion chain Abercrombie & Fitch firmed 0.8 per cent to $55.14.Online retailers were mixed with Amazon nudging down 0.2 per cent to $173.94 and Ebay increasing 1.6 per cent to $30.75.US producer prices rose 0.8 per cent in November, above the average estimate of 0.6 per cent.

But AIG bucked the trend, surging 6.7 per cent to $51.77 after Steve Miller, chairman, said the success of the government in selling part of its stakes in Citigroup and General Motors signalled it will be able to divest its majority holding of the bailed-out insurer.Stocks were unchanged after the Federal Open Market Committee report which stuck with previous descriptions of its second round of quantitative easing, keeping the amount and pace of easing the same and maintaining interest rates.The Fed said the economic recovery was continuing but at a rate insufficient to bring down unemployment.“[Bernanke] has adopted a pattern [of communication] which is about as exciting and innovative as moss on a tree,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research. “[But] there is the clear idea that until unemployment goes down he’s not going to tighten unless there’s a huge inflationary spike, and maybe not even then.”Economists had widely predicted that the meeting would be uneventful. Jan Hatzius, chief US economist at Goldman Sachs, said it was likely to be “the least interesting of the year”.

On Tuesday shares in the industrial conglomerate declined after it forecast sales volumes at existing businesses would rise more slowly in 2011 than this year.Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation from “buy” to “neutral” and JPMorgan reiterated its “underweight” rating for 3M.“This is not about management as the durable 3M franchise is intact and has been enhanced through investment since chief executive [George] Buckley came aboard,” analysts at JP Morgan said. “This is more about an ongoing high level of expectations from a bullish sell side that has maintained stubbornly high estimates. We need to see some capitulation here.”In technology, Texas Instruments added 1 per cent to $33.75 after the US chipmaker narrowed its fourth-quarter profit and sales forecasts.

just 0.1 per cent at 1,187.76, after having slipped below its 50-day moving average earlier in the day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to close at 11,052.49, after earlier passing below the key 11,000 mark, and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.4 per cent lower at 2,525.22.“The market’s been moving up since 2.30pm when the Treasury bought $7.25bn bonds, which rallied everything, gave it some buoyancy,” said Stephen Carl, head equity trader at the Williams Capital Group.European Union finance ministers agreed an €85bn bail-out package for Ireland and approved the outlines of a new permanent mechanism for dealing with eurozone debt crises.But some analysts were concerned that the details indicated some eurozone countries, including Germany, were reluctant to support full-scale bail-outs.European bank stocks suffered but in the US the S&P 500 financials sector climbed during the afternoon, finishing up 0.6 per cent. The regional bank index rallied 1.1 per cent, with Regions Financial rising 2.3 per cent to $5.37.Wells Fargo jumped 2.1 per cent to $27.20 after analysts at RBC Capital Markets said they would expect the bank to be among the first group of banks allowed to increase their dividends next year.Bank of America surged 1.7 per cent to $11.31. and Citigroup gained 1 per cent to $4.15,Energy stocks added 0.5 per cent as the price of oil rose. Halliburton gained 3.6 per cent to $37.87 and Baker Hughes added 2 per cent to $50.78.Retail stocks were in focus as investors weighed up the success of the Black Friday sales and looked forward to further revenues from the busy online shopping day now dubbed “Cyber Monday”.Early signs showed that sales on the day after Thanksgiving had only been slightly stronger than last year. But the National Retail Federation reported that the average US shopper had spent 6.4 per cent more than last year over the whole weekend.“Unlike the past few years, when Black Friday saved the month, we think a strong start to November will be the key theme when the group reports comps [same-store sales for the period] on Thursday,” said analysts at JPMorgan, adding that they expected almost all of the retail stocks they followed to beat expectations by a wide
margin.But after climbing 3.5 per cent in the past two weeks, the S&P 500 retail index fell 0.7 per cent. Macy’s dropped 2.2 per cent to $25.42, JC Penney gained 0.7 per cent to $32.77 and Target fell 0.9 per cent to $56.33.Walmart and Amazon announced developments in their international expansion plans.“Retail companies are realising that growth is not so much here as overseas,” said Andrew Neale, portfolio manager at Fogel Neale Partners, who said that the US consumer would recover properly only with the housing market.Walmartbid $2.4bn for a majority stake in Massmart, the South African retailer which has stores in 13 other African countries.Walmart has scaled back its proposal after reticence from leading shareholders.

Hewlett-Packard rose 1.2 per cent to $44.25 after it was added to the UBS short term buy list.Analysts said holiday sales of computers and servers would drive fourth quarter results. But they kept its long term rating “neutral” on concerns of increasing competition.Intel was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” by UBS and given a price target of $25. Shares rose during the day but closed down 0.1 per cent at $21.23. Analysts predicted that the PC component inventory cycle had bottomed out and that the threat from tablet computers was included in the sales outlook.Amazon.com surged 0.7 per cent to $171.99 after the online retailer bought privately owned Quidsi, which owns diapers.com and soap.com. It paid $500m in cash for the company that will help it expand into baby care products.Yahoo rose 1.1 per cent to $16.44 after it was reported that the search engine operator could be exploring a tie-up with AOL. The latter’s shares climbed 4.7 per cent to $26.10.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,223.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.3 per cent to close at 11,406.84, but the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.1 at 2,580.05.Last week, stocks hit their highest levels in two years as investors cheered the Federal Reserve’s decision to extend quantitative easing and the Republican victory in the House of Representatives. David Bianco, head of US equity strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, comparing the market to last time the S&P 500 broke out above 1,200 in April, said: “There are many fundamental reasons for stocks to rally further.“Higher earnings per share has made the S&P cheaper today than in April. Currently, the S&P is trading at 13.8 times annualised third-quarter earnings per share compared with 15.2 times annualised first-quarter earnings per share in April.“We believe the rising likelihood of Congress passing a tax package before year-end can get the S&P close to 1,300.”Financials fell 0.8 per cent as regional banks continued to suffer since they reported their third-quarter results.The S&P 500 regional banking index slid 0.8 per cent with Regions Financial Corp losing 1.7 per cent to $6.34 and PNC Financial Services declining 1.3 per cent to $57.65.Analysts at Oppenheimer reaffirmed their “overweight” rating for the industrial sector but said they were selectively increasing risk exposure, looking at machinery and road and rail stocks. They said machinery stocks were attractive because they would benefit from new orders and construction spending trends. Analysts at Credit Suisse echoed this recommendation, saying the stocks were cheap.Oppenheimer analysts also said road and rail stocks were expected to increase their sales, earnings and margins at a higher rate than the overall sector in 2011 because of freight volumes and truck tonnage increasing significantly in recent months.The S&P 500 industrials sector lost 0.3 per cent.But manufacturing and construction company Fluor added 2.2 per cent to $55.72 and rail transport stocks CSX and Union Pacific both edged up.CSX rose 0.7 per cent to $62.23 and Union Pacific, which benefited from an upgrade at Credit Suisse, was up 0.8 per cent to $91.98. Also in industrials, Boeing shares fell in spite of a $3.3bn order from Saudi Arabian Airlines for 12 aircraft and were lower by
1.5 per cent at $70.21.In materials, General Steel Holdings fell 6.8 per cent to $2.76 after the Chinese group reported a surprise third-quarter loss as it suffered from higher prices of iron ore and coking coal.McDonald’s was almost flat at $79.31 after it reported its global sales in October. The rise of 6.5 per cent was helped in recent months by sales of smoothies and its dollar menu but the increase in the US was lower than analysts had forecast. Sysco, which distributes food for the food service industry, fell 2.7 per cent to $29.23 after it reported its earnings were squeezed by higher food and commodity costs."

Analysts at the credit rating agency said the government had “signalled its intent to limit support for individual banks” in a marked shift from policy in 2009.Zions Bancorporation declined by 1.3 per cent to $20.20, SunTrust Banks lost 1 per cent to $24.41 and Regions Financial Corp was lower by 1.8 per cent at $6.12.Regional banks have suffered since they reported third-quarter profits, falling 4 per cent in the earnings season compared with a rise of about 1 per cent rise in the broader indices, according to analysts at JPMorgan.“With loans declining again in the third quarter and yields on securities falling sharply, shareholders have less earnings in their pocket each quarter while they wait for loan growth to materialise, and the stocks have traded down accordingly,” said Steven Alexopoulos, an analyst at JPMorgan.But he added that while the lack of borrowing by consumers might be a fundamental issue, the hold-up for commercial borrowers seems to be more a lack of confidence, which might improve after the midterm elections.There was a spate of deal news in the technology sector, which rose by 0.9 per cent.Oracle announced it would buy Art Technology Group, an e-commerce software maker whose customers include Best Buy and Vodafone, for $1bn in cash.The $6 a share price is at a 46 per cent premium to ATG’s close on Monday. Shares in Oracle gained 1.4 per cent to $29.53 while ATG shares shot up 45.1 per cent to $5.95.But Dell nudged down 0.3 per cent to $14.37 after it bought Boomi, a cloud computing company, for an undisclosed price.The computer maker was locked in a bidding war in the summer with Hewlett-Packard for 3Par, another cloud computing group, a battle that HP won.Other cloud computing companies rose, with Rackspace Hosting adding 2.3 per cent to $25.95.In pharmaceuticals, Pfizer fell 1 per cent to $17.45 after reporting its quarterly results and raising its earnings forecast for the full year.The world’s largest drugmaker reported better than expected profits after it raised prices and cut jobs. Profits were also buoyed by adding products from its acquisition of Wyeth, helping compensate for declining sales of its cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor.In the energy sector, shares in Anadarko Petroleum and BP rose after the companies reported their quarterly results, even though both raised their estimates for the cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.Anadarko Petroleum, which owns a 25 per cent stake in the Macondo well, rose 1 per cent to $63.82, while the US-listed shares in BP advanced 1.6 per cent to $41.42.
42;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2010-07-23T18:47:17Z;Bankers overpaid by $1.6bn during crisis;;Citigroup, Bank of America and 15 other bailed-out financial services companies overpaid their top executives by $1.6bn during the height of the financial ­crisis, according to a review by the White House’s ­special master on Wall Street compensation.Kenneth Feinberg, who was appointed last year by Barack Obama, president, to oversee the pay policies at the companies that received the greatest government support, began in March his latest inquiry into top executives’ compensation from late 2008 to early 2009.While the payments were legal at the time, Mr Feinberg said on Friday, they would have fallen foul of restrictions the government set for participants in its troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).Citi topped the list on excessive pay, thanks in large part to the compensation of several star employees at the bank’s Phibro commodities trading unit, people familiar with the matter said. Citi sold the business to Occidental Petroleum last year.“Getting our compensation structure right is a priority for us,” a Citi spokeswoman said. “Since the crisis, we have done a lot of work to make sure it is performance-based and we look forward to reviewing the special master’s recommendations.”The other companies cited by the special master were: American Express, American International Group, Boston Private Financial Holdings, Capital One Financial, CIT Group, JPMorgan Chase. M&T Bank, Morgan Stanley, Regions Financial, SunTrust Banks, Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs, PNC Financial Services Group, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo.While Mr Feinberg no longer had the authority to police compensation at those that had paid back the government’s investment, he used a “look back” provision in the statute to ask for more information about their pay during a window between the start of the Tarp and when new restrictions on executive pay took effect.Mr Feinberg reviewed what the 419 companies that received government assistance before February 2009 had paid their top 25 executives. The institutions were required to submit details on employees who earned more than $500,000.Eleven of the 17 companies cited by the special master have repaid the government for its assistance during the crisis. And, while Mr Feinberg conceded that none of the retention awards, bonuses, golden parachutes and other payments that appear excessive today was “contrary to the public interest”, he proposed the companies adopt a new policy that would supersede pay guarantees granted to executives.Mr Feinberg implored companies to give their boards’ compensation committees the right to restructure, reduce or cancel payments to executives during times of crisis.In October, he had moved to slash the 2009 cash compensation of the top executives at the seven companies within his jurisdiction by an average of 90 per cent from a year earlier.In December, Mr Feinberg took aim at a second tier of managers, setting a $500,000 salary limit for hundreds of employees at the companies that were still under his thumb. The White House last month appointed Mr Feinberg as administrator of BP’s fund to pay claims from the oil company’s devastating spill. He will leave his current post as “pay tsar” in August.
43;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2010-07-06T20:47:14Z;Wall Street rebounds from 10-month low;;US stocks gave back most of their early gains on Tuesday, after sharply rebounding from a 10-month low at the open, as a weak services index number weighed on investor sentiment.Some analysts cautioned that the early rally might be a “dead cat bounce” from over-sold conditions.Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets said: “In the last two months, we have seen a number of days that started out strong and finished weak, indicating distribution. Because of this, today’s trading may be a key bellwether for markets heading into earnings season,” he added.The non-manufacturing ISM index unexpectedly fell to 53.8 last month from 55.4 in May. A reading over 50 indicates expansion.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent to 1,028.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 9,743.62 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,093.88.US-listed shares in BP added 8.7 per cent to $31.91 after the company said it could meet the costs of its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico without issuing new shares, rejecting recent speculation that it was seeking a bail-out from a strategic investor.The company has launched an appeal for support to Middle Eastern and other international investors, arguing that its shares are good value after their near-50 per cent fall since the Deepwater Horizon disaster on April 20.Chipmakers were higher after the Semiconductor Industry Association said global sales climbed 4.5 per cent in May from the previous month.Micron Technology was up 1.6 per cent to $8.35 and SanDisk added 0.7 per cent to $41.77.Goldman Sachs gained 0.9 per cent to $132.26 as the financial services giant was upgraded to “overweight” at JP Morgan. The way the bank measures risk and allocates capital should be seen as a model for other investment banks, the analysts said.Regional bank stocks were among the session’s strongest performers. Regions Financial climbed 2.7 per cent to $6.41, Fifth Third Bancorp was 1.9 per cent higher at $12.04 and PNC Financial gained 1.9 per cent to $56.74.Cliffs Natural Resources was down 5.1 per cent to $44.49 after North America’s largest iron ore producer agreed to buy the coal operations of privately held INR Energy for $757m.The energy sector was one of the strongest performers on Tuesday. Peabody Energy, the largest US coal company, added 3.3 per cent to $40.26, Massey Energy advanced 2.7 per cent to $27.02.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed maker by market value, was one of the session’s worst performers as it dropped 3.1 per cent to $45.12. The European Union’s highest court on Tuesday said the company cannot use the European patent on its Roundup Ready soyabeans variety to block Argentine soy meal imports into the EU. The decision is binding across the region and cannot be appealed.Oshkosh was up 1.3 per cent to $30.38 as the maker of speciality vehicles won contracts worth $691m to supply the US army with tactical trucks and trailers, the US defence department said late last Friday.Consumer staples stocks struggled to participate in the rally. The group was led lower by Best Buy, which dropped 2.2 per cent to $33.13. Home Depot fell 1.5 per cent to $27.34, Supervalu declined 1.3 per cent to $10.57 and Costco erased 0.4 per cent to $54.Walgreen, a drugstore chain, advanced 1 per cent to $26.62 after it said revenues at stores open at least a year increased 2 per cent last month, topping the 1.1 per cent rise expected by analysts on average.The company, which bought rival Duane Reade, earlier this year, said pharmacy same-store sales rose 1.8 per cent.The Vix index, a measure of volatility, was up 0.7 per cent to 30.33.Netflix, an online movie rental company, rallied 0.2 per cent to $107.27 after it said it had struck an agreement with Relativity Media, a film financing group that owns the rights to up-coming releases including Season of the Witch and The Fighter.Netflix will stream Relativity’s films after their DVD release, bypassing premium pay-television services such as HBO and Showtime.
44;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2010-04-20T20:55:10Z;Regional lenders’ earnings add to optimism;;Two large US regional banks reported strong first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, continuing the drumbeat of upbeat economic news from the financial sector.Bank of New York Mellon reported first-quarter earnings of $601m, or 49 cents a share, compared with $363m, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier.The bank, which provides financial services to money managers, corporations and wealthy individuals, said total assets under custody and administration in the period rose to $22,400bn, up 15 per cent from the prior year, but flat compared with December 2009.Provisions for credit losses decreased to $35m in the quarter, compared with $65m in the fourth quarter of 2009. Non-performing assets totalled $459m, down $91m, or 17 per cent, compared with the prior period.“The economic outlook is clearly improving as demonstrated by the performance of the equity and credit markets,” said Robert Kelly, chief executive.BNY Mellon put aside $164m, or 10 cents a share, in the quarter to cover litigation and other expenses related to restructuring and merger integration costs. The bank bought PNC Financial Services Group in February.Minneapolis-based US Bancorp’s first-quarter earnings jumped 27 per cent to $669m, or 34 cents a share, compared with $529m, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier, as lending picked up and provisions for bad loans decreased.The bank wrote $36.5bn of new loans in the period, including $13.3bn of mortgage products and $6.6bn of commercial real estate commitments. Provisions for bad loans fell for the second consecutive quarter to their lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2008.Early and late stage delinquencies as a percentage of ending loan balances also dropped in all major loan categories. The bank said it expected the level of charge-offs to remain stable in the second quarter.Richard Davis, US Bancorp’s chief executive, said the bank would like to raise its dividend, but will not take action until there is more evidence of a “sustainable economic recovery” and it gets more guidance from regulators on new capital requirements.Unlike their big Wall Street counterparts, which have large trading operations to offset a downturn in traditional lending and borrowing, regional banks have been among the hardest hit by the credit crisis.Although many of these banks started to turn the corner late last year, some are still mired in souring loans, especially from commercial real estate.Regions Financial Corp, for instance, reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss of $255m, or 21 cents a share, but still saw loan loss provisions grow in the first quarter to $770m, down from December, but up 81 per cent compared with a year ago. The loss compares with a profit of $26m, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier.
45;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2010-04-13T21:01:47Z;Wall St shrugs off Alcoa to close higher;;US stock prices closed higher on Tuesday as the market shrugged off Monday’s disappointing results from Alcoa, as well as the worse-than-expected trade deficit figures, and looked forward to a positive earnings season.The US trade gap increased to $39.7bn in February from $37bn in January as imports grew faster than exports.Small business owners in the US are less confident about the recovery, according to the small business optimist index from the National Federation of Independent Business, which fell 1.3 points to 88. It has been below 90 for 17 successive months. The index is calibrated from the 1986 level, which was given a value of 100.About 34 per cent of small business owners surveyed said weak sales were their biggest commercial problem.After the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,197.30, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 11,019.42 but the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent lower at 2,465.99.Alcoa, the US’s biggest aluminium producer, fell 1.6 per cent to $14.34 after it posted revenues for the first quarter that missed average expectations on Monday.It is the first company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to report its quarterly results and therefore a closely watched indicator of industrial earnings.“Alcoa’s disappointing sales result was poorly received by markets,” wrote Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank in a client note.The stock was downgraded at UBS to “neutral” from “buy”, and its target price cut to $16 from $17.Smartphone maker Palm pulled back 14.6 per cent to $5.16 on fears that the recent rally in the stock may be overdone. There were also reports that Palm had contacted China’s Huawei Technologies for preliminary acquisition talks.Regional banks were some of the biggest fallers in the S&P 500 index following a downgrade of several key stocks at UBS, which cited “additional headwinds” to the recovery in earnings. Mid-size bank stocks have been the second-fastest growing sub-sector of S&P 500 in 2010.“We continue to believe the pace of earnings recovery will fall well short of expectations,” wrote the analysts in a client note. “We think the recent rally and ensuing valuations are unsustainable, and the [sector] is poised for a meaningful pullback.”Huntington Bancshares led the sector lower, falling 5.7 per cent to $5.69 following UBS’s downgrade to “sell” from neutral. Keycorp, Regions Financial and TCF Financial were lowered to a “sell” from neutral, sending their prices down 2.4 per cent to $8.14, 4.6 per cent to $8.34 and 4 per cent to $16.31 respectively. Commerce Bancshares slipped 3 per cent to $40.80 as the stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “buy”.ConocoPhillips, the oil producer, was down 0.5 per cent to $55.67, even as China’s Sinopec said it would pay $4.65bn for ConocoPhillips’ nine per cent stake in oil-sands producer Syncrude Canada.The price is higher than many analysts had expected.Chipmaker Intel rallied 1 per cent to $22.77 ahead of its earnings announcement after the session’s close.Petrohawk Energyjumped 2.5 per cent to $23.18 as the oil and gas explorer agreed to sell half of its stake in the Haynesville midstream operations to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, a pipeline operator, for $875m.Avon Products, a direct seller of cosmetics, dived 8 per cent to $31.99 following reports that the company had suspended four executives in relation to bribery allegations at its China unit pending an internal investigation.DeVry, an operator of for-profit further eduction colleges, was one of the top performers in the S&P 500 index as the stock was raised to “outperform” from “neutral” at Credit Suisse, sending its shares 10.3 per cent higher to $71.73.Oil services stocks were hurt by the falling oil price. BJ Services fell 1.1 per cent to $21.96, Schlumberger was 1.2 per cent lower to $65.51 and Baker Hughes fell 1.3 per cent to $48.21.Do-it-yourself retailer Lowe’s was up 2.4 per cent to $26.22 as the company priced a note offering to raise $1bn in debt.Rival Home Depot was also higher, up 2.6 per cent to $34.34.
46;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2010-04-06T20:56:29Z;US stocks rise on bank takeover speculation;;"Shares in Massey Energy, the largest coal producer in the central Appalachian region of the US, dived more than 11 per cent yesterday following an explosion at a coal mine in West Virginia that killed at least 25 people.The disaster was the worst of its kind for fatalities in the US since 1984.Federal inspectors have already fined the company more than $382,000 for repeated serious violations involving its ventilation plan and equipment at the mine, the Associated Press reported yesterday.Massey’s shares sank 11.4 per cent to $48.45.Elsewhere, US stock prices fluctuated around the flat level yesterday for much of the session but swung modestly higher after the release of the latest Federal Open Market Committee minutes.Continuing Greek sovereign debt problems weighed on investor sentiment. However, takeover speculation among regional banks gave some support.“The market is on guard for a discount rate hike,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.Looking forward to next week’s start of the earnings season, Mr Kalivas said: “The market is pricing strong results, and the reaction to friendly news next week will provide insight into the market’s ability to move higher into May and June.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent at 1,189.44, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat to 10,969.99 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent higher at 2,436.81.The Vix index, closely-watched as a guide to risk aversion, fell 3.8 per cent to 16.4.Regional banks were some of the highest rising stocks in the S&P 500 index, helped by speculation that some may be takeover targets for overseas financial groups.Regions Financial led the group, rising 4.4 per cent to $8.55. Zions Bancorp rallied 4.6 per cent to $24.27, Keycorp was up 3.8 per cent to $8.47 and SunTrust Banks added 3.5 per cent to $28.71.CA, a leading maker of software for mainframe computers, fell 1.9 per cent to $23.40 as the company said it expected its profit in 2010 to be at the lower end of its forecast range.It also said it would cut about 1,000 jobs as part of a restructuring programme – 8 per cent of its workforce.The homebuilding sector was lower across the board as Daniel Oppenheim, an analyst at Credit Suisse, warned that the sector could underperform the wider market over the coming months as demand for houses falls after the US homebuyer tax credit expires at the end of the month.KB Home, a homebuilder that caters to first-time buyers, lost 2.8 per cent to $16.51 as the stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “outperform” by Credit Suisse.In a client note, Mr Oppenheim wrote that companies catering to the lower end of the housing market would be the most affected by the end of the tax credit.Rival NVR lost 1.4 per cent to $727.44 as the stock was also downgraded to “neutral” from “outperform” at Credit Suisse with a target price of $750 per share. Pulte Group lost 2.5 per cent to $11.16, and DR Horton fell 0.6 per cent to $12.52.Shares in Teekay Tankers, an oil tanker owner and operator, were down 6.8 per cent at $12.15 after the company said it would offer 7m shares of common stock as part of its plan to finance a $169m acquisition of three tankers from its affiliate.El Paso Corp, which owns the longest US natural gas pipeline network, rallied
1.6 per cent to $11.66 on news that Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure fund backed by Credit Suisse and General Electric, had agreed to invest up to $700m in the Ruby Pipeline project in the Rocky Mountain region of the US and take a 50 per cent stake in the project.China Information Security Technology was one of the top risers in the Russell 2000 index, a small-cap index, gaining 31.6 per cent to $7 on news that the software company had been chosen as one of two suppliers to State Grid Corporation of China to help build a nationwide electricity grid.Microsoft gained 0.2 per cent to $29.32. Reports suggested that it was set to launch its long-awaited “Project Pink” phones next week as part of its drive to gain share of the growing smartphone market."
47;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-08-13T21:24:52Z;Wall Street hits new highs for the year;;US stocks reluctantly joined the global equity rally on Thursday, staggering to new highs for the year after weak economic data hampered what could have been a stellar day of trade.Results from Wal-Mart added to pre-market optimism sparked by the unexpected return to growth in France and Germany.But the news that retail sales for July unexpectedly declined, while the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time last week rose, kept the lid on any major rally.“Retail sales were very disappointing,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “Consumption makes up 60-70 per cent of GDP, so a dive in consumption is more important than growth elsewhere.”But the promise of global growth meant equities rallied towards the close, ending in positive territory after a choppy day of trade.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.7 per cent to 1,012.73, its highest close for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 9,398.19 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.5 per cent to 2,009.35.“People are desperate for the party to start again, which means that stocks are rallying even though the underlying economy is still weak,” said George Feiger, chairman of Contango Capital Advisers.“They then gather momentum as investors chase the rally.”Consumer discretionary stocks were watched closely after the sales figures and Wal-Mart’s results.The world’s biggest retailer made better profits than expected and predicted comparable sales could rise 2 per cent in the next quarter. This helped boost the shares 2.7 per cent to $51.88 in spite of disappointing quarterly revenues.Drinks group Dr Pepper Snapplealso beat earnings expectations and, after the company raised its full-year forecast, the shares climbed 6.2 per cent to $24.98.Clothing retailer Urban Outfitters also impressed with its earnings after becoming one of the few in its sector to report a quarterly rise in sales, which helped lift profit above expectations and boost its shares 3 per cent to $29.06.Ford was another stand-out performer during the day after the company said the success of the “cash-for-clunkers” programme to encourage consumers to buy new cars would mean it had to increase production over the rest of the year. The shares gained 2.6 per cent to $7.90.A late bounce saw department store Kohl’s also find gains. The company raised its full-year forecast following the quarterly results, and its shares rose 0.2 per cent to $52.39 even though that forecast remains below analyst estimates.The rest of the consumer discretionary sector did not fare so well, however, and homebuilders were particularly badly hurt both by the retail sales numbers and by analyst downgrades.The recent run-up in share prices in the sector encouraged Citigroup to recommend selling shares in DR Horton while Raymond James rated KB Home at “underperform”.DR Horton fell 3.7 per cent to $12.95 while KB Home gave up 2.5 per cent to $17.83.But strength from materials stocks bolstered the market. Metals prices were higher on the promise of improved demand from abroad and shares in miners were especially strong.Newmont Mining picked up 2.5 per cent to $41.47 while rival gold miner Freeport McMoRan gained 4.9 per cent to $66.07.Financial stocks also showed some strength with several large banks benefiting from the news that Paulson & Co, the hedge fund controlled by John Paulson, who predicted the housing crash, had taken large positions in them. Paulson became the fourth-largest shareholder in Bank of America, which rose 6.7 per cent to $17, and the second-largest at Regions Financial, which gained 7.9 per cent to $5.20.This came on a morning when trading in BofA’s shares was delayed by technical issues, the second trading problem to hit the New York Stock Exchange this week.Technology stocks were helped by positive comments from analysts. Apple’s shares climbed 1.9 per cent to $168.42 after Barclays praised its product pipeline and put a price target on the stock of $208.
48;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-08-12T23:26:47Z;John Paulson bets on BofA with 2% stake;;John Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made billions of dollars betting against subprime mortgages and shorting bank stocks during the past two years, has bought close to 2 per cent of Bank of America in what appears to be a strong endorsement of a bellwether financial institution.The price of BofA stock nearly doubled in the second quarter – when Mr Paulson purchased 168m shares – making the billionaire investor’s holding in the bank worth $2.2bn as of June 30, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday.Shares in BofA, which is the recipient of $45bn of government aid, closed on Wednesday at $15.93, up 8 cents. In after-hours trading – following the disclosure of Mr Paulson’s purchase – BofA shares were up 3.3 per cent at $16.46.A spokesman for Mr Paulson declined to comment on the BofA purchase, but the size of the stake makes Mr Paulson the fourth-largest shareholder in the North Carolina bank.Mr Paulson has also been accumulating shares of other financial stocks. In the second quarter, he bought 2m shares of Goldman Sachs and 7m shares of JPMorgan Chase, as well as 35m shares of Regions Financial, 17m shares of Capital One Financial, 12m of Marshall & Ilsley, 5m shares of Fifth Third, and smaller amounts of State Street and SunTrust. Mr Paulson was also part of the consortium of financiers who acquired IndyMac several months ago.One analyst, who did not want to be named, said Mr Paulson had probably acquired his stake while BofA stock was below $10 per share. “He liked it at $9, but does he like it at $16, or $40?” the analyst said.Mr Paulson’s newly found interest in financial stocks comes on the heels of a profitable short bet last year against the Royal Bank of Scotland, from which he is said to have made more than £300m ($495m).According to earlier regulatory filings, Mr Paulson made a series of bets on bank stocks in late 2008, buying 83.5m shares of Wachovia while it was under agreement to be bought by Wells Fargo, and 15m shares of Merrill Lynch, which had reached an agreement to be acquired by BofA.BofA had no comment on Mr Paulson’s investment.
49;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-07-22T00:26:33Z;Quarterly loss for Regions Financial;;Shares in Regions Financial slumped by more than 15 per cent on Tuesday, to $3.42, following a second quarter loss of 28 cents per share and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s announcement of a lawsuit against Morgan Keegan, the bank’s securities arm, over the sale of auction rate securities.The bank’s non-performing loans jumped $977m, or 60 per cent, during the quarter, reversing hopes among investors that the Birmingham, Alabama institution had moved past the worst of the economic downturn.On top of the quarterly losses, the SEC action raises the prospect that the bank might have to spend precious capital if it enters into any kind of settlement in the matter.Regions’ second quarter loss cast doubt on the premise that mid-tier banks in the US might be rebounding from last year’s financial crisis and the implosion of the property market.“It threw a real dose of cold water on regional bank stock group”, said Kevin Fitzsimmons, managing director of Sandler O’Neill. “There were a few rays of hope out there that some companies showed a slowing pace of increases in problem loans. At Regions, there was a broadening of areas where problem loans cropped up”.The loss at Regions, which has received $3.5bn in funds from the government’s troubled asset relief programme (Tarp), comes just two months after a regulatory “stress test” determined that the bank needed to raise an additional $2.5bn to shore itself up against a possible worst-case economic scenario in the US.C. Dowd Ritter, chief executive of Regions, had criticised the severity of the government’s “stress test” but Regions raised more than $2bn in response to the regulators’ findings.Mr Fitzsimmons said the most worrying revelation in Regions earnings announcement was the disclosure of an “eye-popping inflow of new problem loans ($1.7bn), which reflected emerging stress” in commercial property.The SEC action against Morgan Keegan does not come as a surprise, since the firm had been sent a “Wells notice” by the regulator this year. In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Morgan Keegan misrepresented to customers that auction rate securities were safe, highly liquid investments along the lines of money market funds.Morgan Keegan received another Wells notice this month, concerning a probe of mutual funds that performed badly after investing in toxic mortgage-backed securities.“If it comes out that Regions does have to settle and pay restitution and a penalty, that, combined with the quarterly losses, eats away at precious capital”, says Mr Fitzsimmons.Morgan Keegan said it was “surprised and disappointed” with the SEC’s action, and that it has been “continually repurchasing” auction rate securities from customers this year.
50;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-07-21T20:49:08Z;Late rally lifts US stocks;;A late rally for US stocks saw the markets build on Monday’s impressive gains on Tuesday and set new highs for the year, spurred on by signs of growth in global demand from Caterpillar.The machinery maker led the markets throughout the day after it beat analysts’ expectations with its earnings, and said it saw signs of stabilisation.The shares closed 7.7 per cent higher at $39.46 after a dip from even higher opening levels following a warning during the morning conference call that the company might make a loss in the third quarter.Rival equipment maker Deere & Co also rose, climbing 1.9 per cent to $40.54.“Caterpillar is talking about global stimulus looking as if it is beginning to have an effect on demand,” said Quincy Krosby, the market strategist at Prudential Financial.“Investors are starting to look beyond the US consumer for sources of growth.” Late buying saw equities follow Caterpillar upwards, despite earlier caution triggered by concerns over the timing of the Federal Reserve’s exit from quantitative easing and renewed worries over the future of CIT Group.Fed chairman Ben Bernanke was addressing Congress in his semi-annual testimony to lawmakers, but he did not say when the Fed would start to reverse its extraordinary measures used to stimulate the economy.This led to uncertainty and early selling pressure on Wall Street.“Investors are cautious, and I’m not sure that people want to take a position during the Bernanke testimony,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.That nervousness added to fresh concerns for CITafter the struggling commercial lender warned the $3bn finance package it secured over the weekend might not save it from bankruptcy. Its shares fell 21.6 per cent to 98 cents.The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw the sharpest rise, supported by encouraging earnings from several of its component companies.Drugmaker Merck was a strong performer after it beat expectations, helped by a lower effective tax rate and tight cost controls. The shares rose 6.1 per cent to $29.65.Shares in Schering-Plough, the smaller rival Merck has agreed to buy, gained 3.8 per cent to $26.53 after net income jumped 45 per cent on strong sales of an anti-allergy inhaler and arthritis treatment, helping it to beat expectations.DuPont, the chemical maker, also saw cost controls help negate weaker revenues but the shares slipped a fraction to $28.32.The company’s corn and soybean sales improved in its agricultural unit, and that was enough to give a jolt to shares in Monsanto, the market leader in that field, which picked up 4.6 per cent to $80.08.The Dow closed 0.8 per cent up at 8,915.94, while the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index both rose 0.4 per cent to 954.58 and 1,916.20, respectively.Both the S&P and Nasdaq were at new closing highs for the year.Not every Dow component impressed with its earnings, however. Coca-Cola lost 1.3 per cent to $50.35 even after beating estimates as investors focused on disappointing revenues.United Technologies fell sharply after the company cut its forecast for full-year earnings, with demand for its building and aircraft equipment remaining low. The shares gave up 1.8 per cent to $53.97.Financial stocks were the worst performing sector on the S&P, as Regions Financial reported a wider loss than expected, with mounting losses on commercial and real estate taking their toll on the bank. The shares lost 15.4 per cent to $3.42.BlackRock, the asset manager poised to buy Barclays Global Investors, also fell, dropping 0.4 per cent to $184.14 even after it saw profits beat expectations.Meanwhile, profits at UnitedHealth jumped after higher unemployment led more customers to sign up for its government-backed Medicare insurance plans. Its shares were 3 per cent higher at $25.59.Elsewhere, NRG suddenly jumped during the morning after shareholders in effect ended a $7.7bn hostile bid from rival Exelon by rejecting its nominations for NRG’s board. The shares rose 5.4 per cent to $24.82.
51;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-06-11T20:37:57Z;Wall St adds to gains as oil prices surge;;US stocks closed at their highest level of the year on Thursday as the surging price of oil boosted energy stocks, which added to the impetus created by fresh data suggesting that the recession is abating.The figures showed that, since January, the fewest number of people claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, well below what analysts had forecast.Meanwhile, the climbing price of oil drove energy companies higher. Chevron gained 2.4 per cent to $71.90 while Schlumberger rose 4.9 per cent to $62.18.This helped markets open higher, and they extended the gains after an auction of 30-year Treasury notes was well received, easing fears that rising interest rates could start to hurt the US consumer.They dipped shortly before the close, but the benchmark S&P 500 index was still able to finish 0.6 per cent higher at 944.89, the highest closing price since November last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 8,770.92 and the Nasdaq Composite index also rose 0.5 per cent to 1,862.37.“Jobless claims are moving in the right direction, although we don’t know if we’ve seen the effect of the automotive plant shutdowns yet,” said John Canally, an economist at LPL Financial.Consumer staples received a boost from indications that retail sales rebounded in May following April’s surprise fall.Defensive stocks in household name consumer companies did well. Philip Morris gained 0.8 per cent to $43.88, while Coca-Cola climbed 1.2 per cent to $48.58.But economists warned the numbers were not as good as the headline figures suggested, with much of the rise coming on the back of escalating fuel prices.“Given the government’s large fiscal stimulus we would have hoped that maybe sales would have been even higher,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “But they have been kept lower by the sharp rise in the price of gasoline.” Retail stocks remained suppressed on the back of similar analysis from a number of experts. Target fell 2 per cent to $39.55 while Kohl’s declined 1.9 per cent to $45.92.Bank of America was one of the strongest performers in the financial sector after it was upgraded by analysts at KBW, who said the bank’s balance sheet was much stronger after its recent capital raising.Shares in the bank, whose chief executive Ken Lewis addressed Congress on Thursday morning on the details of the takeover of Merrill Lynch last year, advanced 8.3 per cent to $12.97.Two of the country’s largest regional banks also did well after being upgraded by Goldman Sachs, which saw relative value in the shares of Regions Financial and Fifth Third. Regions jumped 9.3 per cent to $4.37, while Fifth Third gained 5.9 per cent to $7.77.Elsewhere in the financial sector, BlackRock confirmed its $13bn purchase of Barclays Global Investors to create the world’s biggest money manager. Early reports of the deal have sent BlackRock’s shares up nearly 10 per cent this week, and they rose 2.3 per cent on Thursday to $182.60.Homebuilders suffered after news that the number of foreclosures in May was the third highest on record, dousing hopes that the housing market could be set for a swift recovery.Three of the largest US homebuilders fell sharply. Centex lost 5.4 per cent to $8.52, KB Home dropped 2.9 per cent to $14.45 and Pulte Homes gave up 5.7 per cent to $8.87.But steelmakers built on the week’s stellar gains as the price of steel continued to rise and the dollar continued to fall. US Steel picked up 4.2 per cent to $41.83 and AK Steel rose 5.2 per cent to $21.14.The battle for supremacy in the smartphone market took a new turn as Palm, which launched its Pre phone last weekend, appointed Jim Rubinstein, who helped develop the iMac and iPod at Apple, as chief executive. Palm’s shares climbed 12 per cent to $13.43 on the news.UnitedHealth was one of the S&P’s heaviest fallers, however, after Oppenheimer warned that the health insurer’s aggressive bids for Medicare contracts could hurt profit margins in 2010. Its shares lost 6.5 per cent to $24.05.
52;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-05-21T20:51:21Z;Wall Street slumps on economic fears;;"US stocks fell for a third consecutive session on Thursday on further signs that economic green shoots could wither before flowering into a recovery.Rumours circulated the market during the day that the US could be next after the UK to have the outlook on its sovereign debt downgraded, and fears over what this could mean for government policy sparked a sustained sell-off.“A similar move in the US is possible, and that would restrict stimulus efforts,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.Those worries exacerbated anxiousness over the economy after figures showed more people than expected claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, and the number continuing to claim hit a new high.Investors were also concerned that manufacturing in the Philadelphia area contracted at a sharper rate than analysts had predicted.The Vix index, a measure of implied volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, spiked back above 30 as the falls intensified over the afternoon. It climbed 8.1 per cent to 31.39, its biggest daily rise since April 20.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 1.7 per cent at 888.33, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5 per cent to 8,292.13 and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 1.9 per cent to 1,695.25.“The uptrend was broken a week and a half ago. It may feel like a major pull back but when you think that we rallied from 660 [on the S&P], it doesn’t look so big,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.Regional banks performed particularly badly, with three of the largest selling new shares to boost their capital positions.Regions Financial fell
16.2 per cent to $4.10 after the company priced the stock sale announced on Wednesday at $4, an 18 per cent discount to Wednesday’s closing price.Meanwhile, Fifth Thirdwhich the government said needed an extra $1.1bn to survive a severe recession, filed to sell $750m worth of new shares. The stock lost 9.9 per cent to $6.95.Huntington Bancshares also said it would issue new stock in an effort to raise $675m in “capital actions”. The shares dropped 10.8 per cent to $4.30.Three companies that provide technology to businesses all beat analysts’ estimates, giving a generally positive snapshot of how corporate America is faring compared with expectations.Intuit saw sales of its TurboTax tax preparation programme boost revenues and lift earnings above predicted levels. Its shares gained 8.1 per cent to $27.27.Meanwhile, Computer Sciences saw its profits more than double, even as revenue fell, helped by tax benefits. The shares climbed 7.5 per cent to $39.95.NetApp also beat earnings estimates and the stock rose 3.1 per cent to $17.88. The company also announced it would buy Data Domain, its rival data storage company, for $1.5bn. Shares in Data Domain surged 34 per cent to $24.There were some positive signs on consumer activity as Limited Brands and Hormel Foods reported better earnings than expected.Limited Brands made a surprise profit, and raised its full-year outlook, sending its shares up 0.9 per cent to $11.76. The company, which owns the Victoria’s Secret underwear line, said cost cuts had mitigated the impact of falling sales.Hormel Foods, which owns Spam and other food products, also beat analysts’ expectations with higher profits. The company said customers were choosing to eat at home rather than restaurants, which helped stabilise revenues. The shares gained 2.1 per cent to $33.65.But Gamestop, one of the world’s largest video game retailers, gave up 15.5 per cent to $22.38 after slumping sales caused the company to miss analysts’ estimates.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned investors should not get carried away with the marginally positive signs on consumer and corporate health. “Economic growth is not as strong as the market is pricing – the retail environment is still tough, and the industrial and technology sectors are uneven,” he wrote.General Motors jumped 32.4 per cent to $1.92 after the United Auto Workers Union agreed to cut its labour costs and changed the terms of $20bn in debt for retiree healthcare."
53;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-05-21T02:37:21Z;BofA capital raising lifts mood on Wall Street;;US stocks rebounded on Wednesday morning following moderate losses during the previous session as investors welcomed the news that Bank of America has successfully raised $13.5bn in recent days through issuing new stock.The bank’s shares fell overnight on reports that it was offering an extra 825m shares at $10 each, but rose again in early trade after the company said it had been successful in selling a total of 1.25bn shares at an average price of $10.77 since last Friday. This will go towards making up the $33.9bn in extra capital the government has asked the company to raise following the stress tests on bank balance sheets. After half an hour of trade, the stock was up 8 per cent at $12.15.Other banking stocks also performed well. Citigroup climbed 4 per cent to $3.92 while JPMorgan advanced 1.7 per cent to $36.40.PNC, meanwhile, rose 0.4 per cent to $43.44 after saying it would not rush to repay government bail-out money, but would do so “over the next couple of years”. This came in contrast to moves from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in recent days to pay back the government as soon as possible.But Wall Street was less encouraged by the news that Regions Financial wanted to raise $1.25bn through offering new stock in order to make up its shortfall following the government’s tests. Investors worried about stock dilution and the shares fell 3.8 per cent to $5.04.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global warned the stellar rises seen in financial stocks since the rally began in March might not last. “The bank shares have lost a catalyst to rally near term as news on TARP repayment may not be known until June 8, and the credit card bill of rights is likely to become law and create a headwind to profits,” he wrote.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.6 per cent to 92251 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to 8,576.56 points and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 1.5 per cent to 1,760.7 points.The markets were also supported by energy stocks after the price of oil rose back over $60 a barrel. In early trade, US crude was $1.61 higher at $61.26 per barrel. Shares in Chevron gained 1.4 per cent to $66.80 while Exxon Mobil picked up 0.9 per cent to $71.12.Hewlett Packard proved a drag on the Dow as it gave back the gains made during Tuesday’s trade after it reported earnings that were in line with analysts’ estimates. Its shares fell in early trade, losing 3.7 per cent to $35.22 after the company said sales in the third quarter would be below what Wall Street is currently expecting.Its rival Dell also suffered the effect of the negative outlook for the computer sales industry, and its shares fell 0.4 per cent to $11.51.But chip manufacturers lent strength to technology stocks after Analog Devices beat Wall Street’s estimates with its quarterly profits, and said it would also make more profit for the full year than currently predicted. The company said there had been strength in sales to telecoms infrastructure customers, and its shares jumped 13.5 per cent to $23.35.Rivals National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices also found gains on the positive comments from Analog, rising 9.2 per cent to $13.55 and 7.9 per cent to $4.74 respectively.Wall Street was also watching for signs on consumer activity as budget retailers Target and BJ’s both beat analysts’ expectations with their quarterly profits.Target’s shares gained 4.6 per cent to $43.85 after it made $0.69 in earnings per share on the back of tight cost controls and a profitabkle credit card business. Consensus estimates were for $0.60.BJ’s beat analysts’ predictions with its profits and raised its full-year profit outlook as consumers looked to cut costs by buying staples at wholesale prices. But the shares slipped 1 per cent to $37.70 as the company said it expected second quarter sales to fall.Procter & Gamble added to confidence over future consumer behaviour after Barclays upgraded the company, saying its sales stood to recover as and when the economy improved. The shares rose 2.4 per cent to $54.23.This gave some relief to the sector after figures released on Tuesday showed that consumer confidence unexpectedly fell last week.Meanwhile Deere & Co, which makes agricultural equipment, lost ground despite beating analysts’ expectations with its second quarter profits, after the company was forced to lower its full-year profit outlook as construction sales continue to drop. The shares were 4.9 per cent down at $45.96.European stocks were up early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was edged 0.1 per cent higher to 872.63 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, as the FTSE Asia-Pacific index gained 0.5 per cent to 189.19 points.Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell 2 basis points to 0.867 per cent while that on the 10-year Treasury note was flat at 2.243 per cent.The dollar continued to fall against major currencies early in New York, losing 1 per cent against the euro to $1.3766.Gold was trading $1.43 higher at $938.24 per troy ounce.
54;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-05-20T20:30:06Z;Fed forecast sours Wall Street mood;;"US stocks suffered a late sell-off on Wednesday as a downward revision to growth figures and the progress of a bill to overhaul credit card lending helped tip the markets into negative territory.Banks led the selling after the Fed’s open market committee released the minutes from its last meeting, in which it lowered its predictions for GDP and raised those for unemployement.They saw another dip on reports that President Barack Obama was ready to sign the credit card bill, which would limit fees and impose new restrictions on when lenders can raise interest rates for risky customers.American Express lost 3.3 per cent to $23.98, while JPMorgan, which also has a sizeable credit card lending arm, gave up 3.5 per cent to $34.55.Oher banks also fell back after participating in the early rally.Regions Financial said it wanted to raise $1.25bn by offering new stock in order to make up its shortfall following the government’s stress tests on banks.Investors worried about stock dilution and its shares fell 6.7 per cent to $4.89.PNC, meanwhile, fell 2.8 per cent to $42.06 after saying it would not rush to repay government bail-out money but do so “over the next couple of years”.This contrasted with statements from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in recent days that they would pay back the government as soon as possible.The falls reversed earlier earlier gains after the market took confidence from higher commodities prices and Bank of America’s success in raising capital.Bank of America’s shares rose after the company said it had sold a total of 1.25bn shares at an average price of $10.77 since last
Friday. The stock closed up 2.1 per cent at $11.49.“Bank of America’s rise is a kneejerk reaction and we are not seeing that replicated across the banking sector,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.5 per cent to 903.47, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average list 0.6 per cent to 8,422.04. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,727.84.Broader support came from energy stocks after the price of oil rose back over $60 a barrel following Department of Energy figures showing US oil inventories fell last week.Schlumberger gained 1.9 per cent to $55.04, while rival ConocoPhillips picked up
0.6 per cent to $46.19.A rise in general commodity prices and the falling dollar also boosted materials companies. Newmont Mining, which produces gold, gained 4.5 per cent to $45.55, while Freeport McMoRan, which mines gold and copper, rose 1 per cent to $50.Hewlett-Packard proved a drag on the Dow as it gave back the gains made during Tuesday’s trade after reporting earnings in line with analysts’ estimates.Its shares fell 5.2 per cent to $34.67 after the company said sales in the third quarter would be below current consensus predictions.Its rival, Dell, also suffered from the negative outlook for the computer sales industry and its shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $11.18.But chip manufacturers lent strength to the technology sector after Analog Devices’ profits beat Wall Street’s estimates and the company said it would earn more for the full year than currently predicted.The company said there had been strength in sales to telecommunications infrastructure customers and
its shares jumped 15.7 per cent to $23.80.Rivals National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices also found gains on the positive comments from Analog, rising 6.6 per cent to $13.23 and 2.5 per cent to $4.50, respectively.Investors also watched for signs on consumer activity as budget retailers Target and BJâ€™s both beat analysts’ expectations with their quarterly profits. Target’s shares gained 2.4 per cent to $42.94 after it beat expectations on the back of tight cost controls and a profitable credit card business.BJ’s also beat predictions as consumers looked to buy staples at wholesale prices. But its shares slipped 4.4 per cent to $36.37 after the company said it expected second-quarter sales to decline.On a quiet day with low volumes, however, most investors were not overly worried by the losses.“It looks like there has been a continual but moderate consolidation of the big gains on Monday,” said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo advisers."
55;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-05-08T18:53:09Z;Commercial real estate fears for regionals;;The Federal Reserve’s stress-test estimate that 19 leading US banks could face losses of $53bn on commercial real estate assets is raising fears that many smaller banks could be facing big losses on their loans to the sector.Experts anticipate that commercial real estate prices will drop another 20 per cent – on top of the 30 per cent drop so far. “There are two revaluations going on,” said Michael Pralle, a veteran real estate investor. “The risk premium is going up, the cost of debt is going up and the amount of leverage available is coming down.”The Fed predicts that under a “more adverse scenario” for the US economy, the 19 banks that it subjected to stress tests could lose a combined $53bn, or 8.5 per cent, of the $600bn or so of commercial real estate assets on their books.According to the Fed, the 19 banks differ considerably in their exposure to commercial real estate. For example, it said, Regions Financial, an Alabama-based regional bank with $146bn in assets, faces potential commercial real estate losses of $4.9bn, or 13.7 per cent, of its total loans to the sector.Regions said it does not believe the Fed estimate reflects the losses it faces, even in a bad economy. “The anticipated two-year cumulative loss ratio of 13.7 per cent is sharply higher than both Regions’ actual annualised loss ratio on this portfolio in the first quarter and sharply higher than that projected for the other banks,” it said.However, some investors and analysts said they suspect the problems for regional banks could be severe. They note that losses on commercial real estate loans can be difficult to track because different banks include different kinds of loans in the category.Regulators “are underestimating the weight of what will happen”, says Tom Barrack, head of real estate private equity firm Colony Capital, expressing particular concerns about lower-quality shopping mall developments. “The regional banks are where the TNT is buried.”Among bigger banks, Bank of America stands out as having a large commercial portfolio, with potential losses of $9.4bn, or 9.1 percent, of its loans.Bank of America also vigorously disputed the Fed’s conclusion, saying its forecast of actual losses was far lower than the Fed’s.Meanwhile, both Citigroup and Wells Fargo have portfolios that are expected to perform better than the average. JPMorgan, which has long been sceptical about the merits of commercial real estate lending, has a relative small exposure.In addition, private equity executives note that leveraged loans that financed transactions such as the $8bn sale of Blackstone’s Extended Stay hotel chain are still sitting on the balance sheets of the banks.
56;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-05-07T23:59:56Z;Stress tests show $75bn buffer needed;;US regulators on Thursday ordered 10 of the nation’s largest banks to add a total of $74.6bn in equity following the completion of stress tests, triggering a frenzy of activity as banks lined up to announce capital-raising plans.“These tests will help ensure that banks have a sufficient capital cushion to continue lending in a more adverse economic scenario,” Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, said.The US authorities said that the tests projected that losses at the top 19 banks over 2009 and 2010 would reach $599bn if the adverse scenario set out in the stress test materialised.They said that bank operating earnings would absorb $363bn of these losses under the stress scenario. They estimated that 10 of the 19 top banks would need a further $74.6bn in equity to be sufficiently well capitalised at the end of 2010 to cope with potential losses beyond that period.The regulators put the additional equity need at a much higher $185bn at the end of 2008, but said that actions taken by the banks subsequently had reduced that amount by $110bn.The long-awaited publication of the test results, which came after days of tense discussions between regulators and the banks, prompted a flurry of activity among lenders with Bank of America, which was found to have the biggest capital shortfall at $33.9bn, announcing plans to raise $17bn in equity. BofA said that it would add equity through a share sale and the conversion of preferred shares held by non-government investors. It also plans to raise the money through earnings and the possible sale of assets, including asset manager Columbia Management and First Republic Bank.Wells Fargo, which needs to plug a gap of $13.7bn, launched a $6bn equity issuance, while Morgan Stanley said that it would sell $2bn in shares and $3bn in non-government-backed debt to fill its $1.8bn capital requirement.Citigroup, which needs $5.5bn in additional equity, said that it would expand an existing offer to convert preferred shares.The stress tests could force the government to gain a large stake in a number of regional banks such as SunTrust, KeyCorp and Regions which might have to ask the government to convert its preferred shares into common stock unless they manage to sell enough shares to investors to meet the tests’ requirements.A number of banks, including Wells, BofA and Citi indicated that regulators had been very conservative in their assumptions and expressed confidence that their profits over the next two years would be better than the government’s projections.People close to the situation said that Citi convinced regulators to reduce their estimates of its capital shortfall, from an original $30bn-plus to just $5.5bn.
57;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-05-07T23:30:05Z;Banks turn to markets in effort to plug holes;;Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup quickly turned to the public markets on Thursday to fill a combined $21bn (€15.7bn, £14bn) capital shortfall identified by the government’s stress tests.Wells unveiled plans to raise $6bn of common equity shortly after stock markets closed, pre-empting news of its $13.7bn capital shortfall by almost an hour.Morgan Stanley followed minutes later with plans to raise $2bn in equity and sell $3bn in non-government-backed debt to plug its $1.8bn capital need and to repay the $10bn in federal aid it received last year.Citigroup confirmed it would plug its $5.5bn capital shortfall by expanding an existing plan to convert $52bn of preferred shares held by the government and other investors. Citi said it would add $5.5bn of trust preferred shares – a hybrid of debt and equity – held by non-government investors to the conversion plan, which is expected to be completed in the next few weeks. The expansion of the plan will reduce the stake to be held by the government in Citi from the 36 per cent originally expected to about 34 per cent.Solutions for some of the smaller banks were less clear, however, and could result in significant government ownership of Regions Financial, SunTrust and KeyCorp.These banks do not enjoy the same access to the public equity markets as some of the larger companies, and they lack sufficient private preferred shares to convert into common equity and plug their combined $6.5bn capital shortfall.For Regions, this could, in theory, result in the bank being more than 40 per cent government-owned, unless it can find other ways to raise the $2.5bn it needs. It is working on a plan to avoid a larger government stake, which it hopes to present by the June 9 deadline.At Wells, the capital shortfall identified by the government prompted protests from senior management, while the stress tests projected losses under an economic downturn that were similar to the bank’s own projections,Howard Atkins, the bank’s chief financial officer, said the Federal Reserve had used significantly different assumptions of the bank’s revenue generating ability.“The main reason the Federal Reserve has required Wells Fargo to hold an extra $13.7 billion in tier-one common equity is based on what we believe is their excessively conservative estimate of pre-provision net revenue in the adverse scenario,” said Mr Atkins.Wells’ planned $6bn common equity raise is expected to price on Friday.The bank bargained with the Fed to obtain credit for the difference between the Fed’s projected revenues and the bank’s actual revenues over the next 6 months, which it believes will be sufficient to plug the remaining gap.
58;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

60;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-05-06T20:30:27Z;US stocks jump ahead of stress tests;;"US banking stocks jumped on Wednesday amid a flurry of reports about how well companies had fared in the government’s stress tests on banks’ balance sheets, the results of which are due on Thursday.Reports said that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, American Express and Bank of New York Mellon would all pass the tests without needing to strengthen their balance sheets. That sent KBW index of banks up 10.8 per cent.Bloomberg reported that Citigroup needed $5bn, half the level reported on Monday. Its shares leapt 16.6 per cent to $3.86.Meanwhile, the New York Times said the government had asked Bank of Americato raise nearly $34bn, more than triple the figure previously reported.But the bank overcame this to find gains after Citigroup said it was unlikely to need to issue new shares. Its stock jumped 17.1 per cent to $12.69, taking its weekly gains above 45 per cent.Wells Fargo, which Bloomberg said would need $15bn, rose 15.6 per cent to $26.84.Regions Financial provided a microcosm of the volatility in the market, slumping 11 per cent in eight minutes after the Wall Street Journal said it also needed new capital. But its shares then surged, and closed
6.2 per cent up at $5.83.“The fact that Timothy Geithner [the Treasury secretary] waited three months after announcing the stress tests to give us more details worked out well. They have been able to come up with some solutions so banks are not going to have to go out and issue new shares,” said Andrew Wilkinson of Interactive Brokers.But Robert Loest, fund manager at Integrity Mutual, said: “Investors are deluded. The stress tests were done by the banks themselves, and any rational person would be suspicious of that.”The reports helped extend early gains which came after labour market data from ADP said that companies laid off nearly 25 per cent fewer workers in April than expected.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Lincoln National, the life insurer, soared after its quarterly results. The company made a loss after writing off some of the value of its annuity business, but investors focused on unexpectedly strong operating profits, sending its shares up 33 per cent to $15.57.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 1.7 per cent higher at 919.53 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to 8,512.28 points.But the Nasdaq Composite index, which has outperformed the other two this year, gained only 0.3 per cent to 1,759.10 points as some investors looked to bank profits.Energy companies were behind financial stocks as the day’s biggest gainers as the price of oil rose to new highs for the year. Chevron gained 3.6 per cent to $68.11.The better-than-expected data from ADP matched a report from outplacement group Challenger that also suggested the rise in unemployment was slowing.It also added to confidence the economy might be slowing its contraction after figures showed mortgage applications rose last week.But Pulte Homes and Centex, the rival homebuilders that are due to merge, announced heavier losses than expected amid rising unemployment and foreclosures. Pulte lost 8.1 per cent to $11.31, while Centex slid 8 per cent to $10.78.The homebuilding sector took another knock after a report from Zillow.com said nearly a quarter of US homeowners owe more than their properties are worth.There was some good news for consumer stocks however as Disney reported a narrower fall in earnings than expected. The company’s profits dropped as it had to offer discounts to attract visitors to its US theme parks, but the fall was not as bad as analysts had predicted, and its shares rose 11.8 per cent to $25.87.Dow Chemical also fell after it announced it was offering $1.63bn in common stock to pay back debt owed following its acquisition of rival Rohm & Haas. It slid 7 per cent to $15.19.General Motors was one of the day’s heaviest fallers ahead of its earnings report on Thursday. The company is expected to make an eighth straight quarterly loss, and is reportedly facing opposition to its restructuring plans from the United Auto Workers union. Its shares tumbled 10.3 per cent per cent to $1.66."
61;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-05-02T01:44:51Z;Bank objections delay stress tests;;US regulators will delay the release of stress test results for the country’s 19 biggest banks until next Thursday, after some lenders, including Citigroup and Bank of America, objected to government demands that they needed to raise billions in fresh capital.Citi, one of the biggest victims of the crisis that has already been bailed out three times by the government, is believed to have been told by regulators that it needs more than $5bn in fresh capital, while BofA might need to convert $45bn in government preferred shares into common equity.Both companies are still contesting the findings and might still persuade the government they need less, or no capital, according to people close to the situation. Citi’s own projections are believed to show the company will have hundreds of millions of dollars in excess capital.After a week of tense talks between regulators and the banks, government sources said the Treasury and the Federal Reserve were set to unveil the outcome of the tests after the market closes on May 7 – three days later than anticipated.The authorities’ decision to let the original timetable slip also reflects the widespread belief that, after months of speculation since the tests were first announced in February, their outcome has the potential to disturb the markets.Government sources said regulators were likely to release both aggregate and individual data for each of the 19 banks, detailing their losses and capital needs under adverse economic scenarios.Some of the banks will then supplement those data with regulatory filings and analysts’ calls. Bankers said a number of lenders had pleaded with regulators for more time to lay out plans to plug any capital shortfall identified in the stress tests, by raising equity from either the government or from the stock market.People familiar with the situation said that, despite their objections, Citi and BofA – and at least four more lenders – were almost certain to need more equity capital.Citi could boost its equity by expanding a planned conversion of preferred shares into common stock, or taking a further capital injection from the government.The latter move could increase the government stake in Citi beyond the 36 per cent it has already agreed to buy and could then, in turn, lead to the removal of chief executive Vikram Pandit.The move would give the authorities a sizeable stake in the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender and further undermine the position of its chief executive Ken Lewis, who was stripped of his role as chairman after a shareholder vote this week. That vote followed an organised campaign against Mr Lewis and a series of demonstrations across the US at his perceived greed and the bank’s ruthless practices. Analysts have suggested that at least four more banks could need capital injections.A recent note by Morgan Stanley identified SunTrust, KeyCorp and Regions Financial Corp, as regional banks that might require capital, while other experts have suggested Wells Fargo, the large San Francisco-lender could also need to raise more equity.The banks and regulators have not commented on the likely outcome of the tests.
62;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-04-21T23:05:04Z;US Bancorp bucks gloomy trend among regional banks;;US regional banks on Tuesday provided investors with a mixed picture of the state of the financial sector as stronger-than-expected earnings from US Bancorp helped counter the gloom resulting from big losses at Zions Bancorp.US Bancorp, based in Minnesota, reported net income of $529m, a 60 per cent increase over its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008, demonstrating that major regional players could benefit from the forces that helped generate last week’s profit announcements from the biggest US banks. But other regional banks, particularly smaller ones, did not fare as well.“I think there is some clear delineation between big healthy institutions and the plain-vanilla small-cap regional banks,” said analyst Andrew Marquardt of Fox-Pitt Kelton.“They’re having much worse results in terms of charge-offs and reserve builds.”Alabama-based Regions Financial, which cut its dividend to 1 cent per share last week, eked out a profit of 4 cents per share on earnings of $77m.Utah-based Zions surprised investors late Monday by announcing a loss of $832m, reflecting its exposure to commercial real estate.Analysts said they were impressed by US Bancorp’s increase in market share and its ability to build up reserves against future charge-offs. The bank’s stock was up 17 per cent to $18.65 in late trading.Mr Marquardt said US Bancorp’s credit reserves of $1.3bn, almost triple the amount reserved a year ago, is a healthy sign, compared with other regional banks, such as Comerica, which so far have not reserved against a similar percentage of loans.Zions was down 18 per cent in late trading.Sandler O’Neill slapped a sell rating on the stock, while Moody’s downgraded the bank’s debt ratings because of Zions’ large exposure to commercial real estate loans, as well as its portfolio of collateralised debt obligations.Mr Marquardt described KeyCorp’s results for the quarter as disappointing and questioned whether the Ohio bank would have to cut its dividend again.As for Regions, its earnings and outlook would be negatively affected in the near term by the recession, which is now hitting the south-eastern part of the US with particular ferocity, the analyst added.
63;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-04-17T20:52:31Z;Citi and GE set positive tone for Wall St;;US stocks gained further ground on Friday, completing their sixth straight week of rises for the first time since the market peaked in late 2007.Positive results from Citigroup and General Electric helped bolster confidence during a choppy morning’s trade on Friday, before positive words on the housing market from BB&T, the regional bank, gave the rally impetus.Citigroup reported a trading profit for the first time in six quarters. That translated into a loss per share after a reset in the price of convertible preferred stock in January but the loss was narrower than expected.Much of that performance appeared to have already been priced in, with Vikram Pandit, Citi chief executive, having said the company enjoyed a profitable January and February. Citi’s shares fell 9 per cent to $3.65.But other banks performed better as investors took their lead from BB&T, which surprised the market with its earnings.The company said housing markets in Florida, Georgia and Washington are stabilising, one of the key signs for improving health in financial companies.Its shares jumped 11.2 per cent to $23.42. This gave further momentum to the sector after Regions Financial surged in the previous session, having said it was profitable in the first quarter. Regions continued those gains on Friday, rising 7.9 per cent to $7.23.Bank of America, meanwhile, picked up 2.5 per cent to $10.60 and Wells Fargo gained 4.2 per cent to $20.26.JPMorgan continued Thursday’s advance after reporting better results than expected, rising 0.1 per cent to $33.26.General Electric unveiled a higher profit than expected, helped by good performance in its energy operations, which counteracted rising consumer defaults in its finance arm, GE Capital. GE’s shares erased early losses to end 1 per cent higher at $12.39.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 0.5 per cent to 869.60 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.1 per cent to 8,131.33 points. The Nasdaq Composite index erased early losses as the market digested results from Google, and closed 0.2 per cent up at 1,673.07 points.All three main market measures made weekly gains of between 0.5 and 1.6 per cent after a week of fluctuations as investors weighed results from some of the biggest US corporate names, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Intel.“If the majority of investors believe the rally has gone too far, it is sure to go further,” said David Kreinces, portfolio manager at ETF PM. “I think the S&P has a good shot at 900 before it sees some pull back.”Google rose sharply before the close in the previous session, with investors betting on better results than predicted. It continued those gains on Friday after profit was confirmed to have beaten forecasts. Its shares rose 0.9 per cent to $392.24.Other technology companies joined Thursday’s rally but many lost ground on Friday as investors accounted for the fact that Google’s performance came more from cost-cutting measures than strong revenues.Microsoft lost 2.8 per cent to $19.20 and Intel gave up 1.8 per cent to $15.60.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Biogen, the drug company, beat analysts’ expectations by recording a profit of $1.05 per share. But its shares fell 2.7 per cent to $50.09 as weak demand led to falling sales of its brand name drugs.Mattel, the toymaker, reported a heavier loss than predicted as retailers cut back on inventories amid falling consumer demand.However, its shares rose 15.2 per cent to $15.01 as investors took confidence from the company’s better profit margins.“There is still a fair amount of cash on the sidelines with hedge funds and institutional investors,” said Bill Knapp, investment strategist for MainStay Investments. “But for every day the rally continues, another investor joins in and makes it stronger.”
64;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-04-16T21:03:45Z;Tech and media stocks lift Wall Street;;Technology and media stocks staged a late rally on Thursday to take the equity markets higher after a day spent struggling for traction despite good results from JPMorgan.Investors bet on good results after the bell from Google, taking the company 2.4 per cent higher to $388.74. The company then reported better than expected profits. Google was joined by Apple, which rose 3.2 per cent to $121.45 and Microsoft, gaining 4.9 per cent to $19.76.Hewlett-Packard was another major gainer in the sector, rising 5 per cent to $36.60 after research firm IDC said the company had taken top spot in the US PC manufacturing market last quarter from Dell.Media companies also benefited from the bets on Google, as well as better than expected results from publisher Gannett.Gannett, which publishes USA Today, gained 3.2 per cent to $3.60 despite profits falling 60 per cent. Later in the day it was joined by bigger media conglomerates. Time Warner rose 6.8 per cent to $23.73 and Disney lifted 4 per cent to $20.51.“Media companies have been very beaten up and we would expect them to see some gains as the economic data improves,” said Tuna Amobii, an analyst at S&P.This helped take the Nasdaq Composite index to new highs for the year, up 2.7 per cent at 1,670.44 points. The benchmark S&P 500 index also rallied, rising 1.6 per cent to 865.30 points, as did the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which picked up 1.2 per cent to 8,125.43 points,.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Sun Microsystems bounced on news that it had asked IBMto resurrect takeover talks, but pared those gains when CNBC said IBM rejected the approach. Sun finished 4.4 per cent up at $6.40. IBM was 2.6 per cent higher at $101.43.Earlier, positive job figures and better than expected earnings from JPMorgan struggled to boost investor confidence.The country’s second-largest bank by assets reported earnings that beat expectations by about one-third, helping the stock gain 2.1 per cent to $33.24. But JPMorgan’s results were counterbalanced by Lincoln National after the insurer’s debt and financial-strength ratings were cut by Moody’s, which said it might downgrade the company again unless it received the $3bn in federal money it is seeking. The stock fell 4.6 per cent to $9.62.Figures showing US housing starts fell by 10.8 per cent in March, more than analysts had predicted, also weighed on financials.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said: “I think a lot of the gains from JPMorgan were already priced in and financials are focusing on the data on housing starts.”Regions Financial, the regional bank, surged 34 per cent to $6.70, however, after Dowd Ritter, the chief executive, said the company would make a profit for the first quarter, with analysts having previously predicted a loss.Data showing initial jobless claims fell less than expected in the week ending April 11 failed to spark a major rally. Investors were more concerned that the number continuing to claim such benefits had risen above 6m for the first time since records began.There was good news from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve which said that manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region had slowed its decline in April.But confidence was tempered when General Growth Properties, the second-largest US owner of shopping centres, filed for bankruptcy protection. This exacerbated fears that commercial property would be the next shock for the market. Real estate companies initially tumbled before being caught in the late buying. Prologis gained 1.9 per cent to $8.61.Harley Davidson made better earnings than expected and reaffirmed its full-year outlook on shipping numbers. Its shares rose 5.7 per cent to $18.11.Southwest Airlines took some of the sheen from the airline industry, however, after AMR’s narrower than expected losses. Southwest lost more than expected, as low demand took its toll. Its shares fell 7.1 per cent to $7.10.Rosetta Stone provided confidence for stocks after it beat estimates for its initial public offering. The language instruction company sold shares at $18 after expectations of a maximum $17, and then rose 39.6 per cent during the day to $25.12.
65;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-03-10T23:34:10Z;US companies pull out of retirement contributions;;"A wave of US companies are suspending payments to their staff 401(k) retirement plans in a bid to cut costs amid the economic downturn.Saks, General Motors, newspaper group McClatchy, clothing company J.Crew, FedEx, UPS, Coca-Cola Bottling, Reader’s Digest, Motorola, Regions Financial and Sprint Nextel are among the growing list of companies which have suspended contributions in recent months.Even the AARP, the influential advocacy group formerly known as the American Association for Retired Persons, will suspend contributions to its staff 401(k) plan from March 22 for the rest of the year.The growing number of suspensions appears to strike a blow against the viability of 401(k) plans, which were introduced 30 years ago as the main way that Americans should save for retirement, replacing defined benefit pension plans. Companies typically offered to match employee contributions up to 5 per cent of annual salary.The average 401(k) plan at the end of 2007 held about $65,000, but half of them held less than $19,000, according to a trade group, the Investment Companies Institute. They would hold much less today because of stock market falls. The suspensions mean that individuals can continue to contribute to their plans, but their companies will not.Adam Sohn, a spokesman for AARP, said his organisation, which has 40m members aged 50 and over, had fully matched staff contributions up to 3 per cent of annual salary.“We have taken a temporary suspension for the remainder of the year to help with cost containment measures,” he said. The AARP, whose revenue comes in part from investment income, also offers its 2,400 staff a defined benefit pension plan.In recent months, companies have also become increasingly less likely to enrol new workers automatically in their 401(k) plan, citing the costs as the main
reason, according to a study by Hewitt Associates, a human resources consultancy.“The continued bleak economic outlook is forcing many companies to make difficult decisions with respect to their retirement benefits,” said Pamela Hess, Hewitt’s director of retirement research, said in the study.Hewitt estimated that only 5 per cent of large companies would halt 401(k) contributions in 2009, but that could rise to more than 10 per cent in the next 12 to 18 months."
66;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-02-17T23:48:44Z;Barclays shuts Equifirst US mortgage lender;;Barclays Capital has put up the shutters on its US mortgage lending business because of “market conditions” less than two years after buying it.The decision to close Equifirst is embarrassing for Barclays, which bought the business from Alabama-based Regions Financial in a belated effort to break into the US mortgage market. The shutdown of Equifirst also marks the latest failure in a series of bank misadventures with acquisitions of high-risk mortgage lenders.Deutsche Bank in December closed MortgageIT, which it bought for $430m (£302m) in January 2007, Merrill Lynch last year shut First Franklin, for which it paid $1.3bn in September 2006, and Wachovia, now owned by Wells Fargo, notoriously overpaid for its $26bn 2006 acquisition of California-based Golden West.However, Barclays’ losses on the investment are lower than they might have been because the bank was able to cut the price it paid for Equifirst by two-thirds to $76m, between announcing the deal in January 2007 to closing it in April.Equifirst, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, was one of the 20 top US subprime mortgage lenders in 2006, originating more than $10bn of home loans a year, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.The company did not typically keep the loans it made on its own books but sold them on to investment banks that would package them into mortgage-backed securities for investors.As the US housing market began to slow and mortgage originations plummeted, banks such as Barclays and Merrill Lynch scurried to buy originators that would bring a reliable source of new mortgages in-house.But as the market for mortgage-backed securities began to evaporate amid rising late payments and defaults, many such deals foundered.In 2007, Equifirst originated $3.8bn of subprime home loans. By the second half of 2008, the lack of buyers for such mortgages prompted the lender to convert to making loans conforming to Federal Housing Administration standards.Just a few months ago Barclays executives were still pointing to Equifirst as providing the bank with a foothold in the market when it recovered.Equifirst has stopped accepting new applications, but will honour its outstanding commitments.Barclays’ mortgage servicing business, HomeEq, and mortgage-backed securities operations are not affected, the bank said.
67;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-02-11T22:34:47Z;US bank fears over stability plan;;Washington’s “financial stability plan” has fuelled some of the most volatile trading in recent history for US regional bank stocks.Investors’ high hopes for the plan, which led to soaring stock prices for regional banks last week, were spectacularly dashed on Tuesday by the lack of detail in the rescue initiative. Several regional bank stocks lost more than a quarter of their value amid fears that the plan would amount to a creeping nationalisation of the US banking system.Regional banks accounted for six of the 10 biggest falls in the S&P 500 following comments from Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, on Tuesday. Huntington Bancshares, Regions Financial, SunTrust Banks, KeyCorp, Fifth Third Bancorp and Marshall & Ilsley all lost more than 25 per cent. The stocks recovered a little in morning trade on Wednesday, swinging higher by between 5 and 15 per cent.Investors fear the Treasury’s new measures – the details of which are yet to be fleshed out – will not restore confidence in the banking industry, fall short of cleaning up balance sheets and prevent banks from raising private capital. But for the regional banks, in particular, there are fears that the plans could do more harm than good, say analysts.Much will depend on how the Treasury’s scheme values toxic assets that will be sold to a new $1,000bn public-private “bad bank”, the design of which is still unclear.Regional banks have continued to hold many troubled housing assets at valuations far above where the loans could be sold in the secondary market. Sales of such assets to the Treasury’s “bad bank” at severely distressed market prices could force banks to take severe markdowns on loans they have kept on their balance sheets. In turn this could erode regulatory capital.Investors also fear a regulatory stress test mandated by the Treasury’s plan will highlight new weaknesses in the balance sheet and loan portfolios of the banks, particularly if they are forced to take new markdowns on previously unimpaired assets.All banks with more than $100bn in assets will be required to undergo the stress test to determine whether large financial institutions have enough capital to continue lending and absorb potential losses in a more severe downturn.Banks that fail the stress test will be given additional capital in the form of convertible preferred securities, providing the government with a larger stake in the banks that could dilute existing shareholders and deter private capital.Many of the fears investors share would only materialise in a worst case scenario. Yet until there is clarity on the government’s plans, such a worst case could still materialise.
68;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-02-09T21:47:11Z;Wall Street flat after rescue delay;;US financial stocks enjoyed reasonable gains during the most subdued session of the year so far as traders remained reluctant to place bearish bets on banks before the Obama administration unveiled plans to shore up the stricken sector.Regional banks did particularly well, helped by an upbeat note on Regions Financialfrom Richard Bove, influential Ladenburg Thalmann analyst.He noted that current valuations suggested “investors do not believe that this company will survive”, yet went on to argue that “despite all of its faults and scars, this company has a dominant franchise in a good banking market and it should recover from the current economic downturn”. Regions Financial leapt 10.5 per cent to $4.64 while regional banks rallied 4 per cent overall.Some insurers also enjoyed strong gains and the sector added 1.8 per cent overall.The wider market struggled for momentum after it emerged that Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, would not disclose the bank rescue proposals until Tuesday.The market drifted between positive and negative territory during the narrowest trading range for the benchmark S&P 500 so far this year.Alan Ruskin, senior analyst at RBS’s global banking and markets division, wrote in a note to clients: “Because the devil will be in the detail of the newest measures, notably the purchase of toxic assets, I would expect that the rally in risk appetite we are seeing ahead of the plan will lack immediate serious follow-through.”The S&P 500 finished 0.2 per cent higher at 869.89 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.1 per cent lower at 8,270.87 and the Nasdaq Composite Index flat at 1,591.56.“Traders left their desks on Friday all bulled up over Monday’s line-up,” said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers. “The postponement of Mr Geithner’s plans until Tuesday doesn’t instill confidence that whatever his team’s plan delivers will be much more than a compromise.”Meanwhile, another round of downbeat earnings illustrated the toll that the recession was taking on US corporations.“The known uncertainties of earnings are now mixing with the unknowns of both the Treasury Department’s plan for the banking sector and the government’s stimulus package,” wrote Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.In financials, Nasdaq OMXwas hit in the fallout from poorly received fourth-quarter results from NYSE Euronext. Shares in the exchanges lost 6.3 per cent to $23.34 and 5.2 per cent to $21.71, respectively.Among the results elsewhere, Whirlpool added 2 per cent to $37.13 in choppy trade despite the appliance-maker unveiling a worse-than-expected 76 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profitThe energy sector, up 0.2 per cent overall, provided the market with some support early in the session but later tracked the oil price lower.Meanwhile in materials, Dow Chemical shed 2.1 per cent to $10.65 after HSBC said the group was likely to cut its dividend, downgraded its view of the stock to “underweight” and warned a debt-financed deal to buy Rohm & Haas could prompt a credit rating downgrade. For its part, Rohm & Haas – locked in a merger dispute with Dow – edged 0.1 per cent lower to $55.47 on glum fourth-quarter results.Coca-Cola was among the losers in soft drink stocks, down 2.9 per cent to $42.31 after Citigroup cut its price target from $53 to $51.“While headline risks remain for the US soft drink industry,” wrote Celso Sánchez, Citi analyst, several factors could “increasingly garner investor attention and support sector valuations”.Homebuilders came under pressure after Citigroup downgraded its view of Lennar, off 6.3 per cent to $8.71, to “hold”. The sector lost 4.9 per cent overall.Motorola bucked a downward trend in the telecoms sector, helped by news that its co-chief executives had snapped up battered shares in the group last week. Its shares climbed 7 per cent to $4.15.Also on the upside, General Electric was a key winner, bolstered by hopes that GE Capital would benefit from bank bail-out plans.GE shares rallied 13.9 per cent to $12.64, helping the industrial advance 2.6 per cent overall.
69;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-01-26T22:37:49Z;Pfizer deal offsets Wall St earnings gloom;;Hefty declines in financial shares weighed on Wall Street on Monday as the sector’s volatile run continued, although a rare piece of dealmaking propped up the wider market during more choppy trading.Financials rallied as much as 4.3 per cent overall to lead a bullish morning session as US investors took some comfort that European banks had reassured over the need for possible capital raisings.But the relief was short-lived. A sharp afternoon sell-off left the sector 2.1 per cent lower, as fears over more heavy writedowns and uncertainty over the new administration’s plans to rescue the stricken sector returned to the fore.Citigroup and Bank of America advanced as much as 8.1 per cent and 11.9 per cent, respectively, only to stand 4 per cent and 3.9 per cent lower by the close. They finished at $3.33 and $6, respectively.“We’re going to continue to see that volatility,” said Anthony Conroy, head of trading at BNYConvergEx.Regional banks were among the heaviest losers. A bearish note on Regions Financial from Richard Bove, influential analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, helped push the sector down 3.4 per cent overall.Shares in the southeast lender dropped 12 per cent to $4.10 after Mr Bove forecast it was likely to slash its dividend from 10 cents to a penny a share.American Express was another key loser among the bigger names, down 5 per cent to $15.20, but recovered 4.3 per cent in immediate after hours trade, when the credit card group disclosed a 79 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings.Heavy volatility has returned to Wall Street in recent sessions, due in large part to violent swings in financial stocks.Last week, the benchmark S&P 500 dived beneath a nadir reached last month, sparking concerns among technical analysts that another support level could be breached.The wider market finished off its highs on Monday, but still found positive territory as Pfizer’s deal to acquire Wyeth, a rival drugmaker, demonstrated that at least some deals could be struck during the recession and amid weak credit markets.The S&P finished up 0.6 per cent to 836.57, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.5 per cent higher at 8,116.03 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.8 per cent stronger at 1,489.46.The S&P had earlier rallied as much as 2.5 per cent.Although news of the Pfizer-Wyeth tie-up had leaked, its confirmation was reassuring for the wider market – especially given that Dow Chemical said it did not have the funds to complete the immediate takeover of Rohm and Haas, whose shares tumbled 13.3 per cent to $57.10.Shares in Dow, which cited the global financial crisis and the collapse of its joint venture with Kuwait, lost 7.6 per cent to $13.24 as its target launched a lawsuit.Pfizer dropped 10.3 per cent to $15.65 while Wyeth closed down 0.8 per cent to $43.39 after a strong run last week, when talk of the deal began to circulate.Elsewhere, homebuilders stood 2.9 per cent higher overall after National Association of Realtors data showed that sales of existing homes rose last month from a record low.Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said the jump in foreclosures – and subsequent drop in prices – had contributed in large part to the 6.5 per cent increase. Still, he noted after the figures were released: “The market wants to look on the bright side of risk…and this latest data will probably encourage the mild risk recovery seen so far.”The Conference Board’s index of leading economic indicators also unexpectedly rose in December.The market’s gains came in spite of glum assessments of corporate prospects and a harsh round of job cuts. The most high-profile, Caterpillar, dropped 8.4 per cent to $32.67. Among the raft of other companies to unveil plans for hefty job losses, Home Depot climbed 4.7 per cent to $22.73 and Sprint Nextel added 1.2 per cent to $2.49. Both companies said the moves would bring sizeable cost savings.Elsewhere, McDonald’s – which along with Wal-Mart was one of only two stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to end 2008 in positive territory – added 0.7 per cent to $58.40 after the release of results that topped forecasts.
70;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-01-20T21:45:49Z;US banks push financials to 14-year low;;More spectacular declines in US bank shares pushed the financial sector to its lowest level since 1995 during what was easily Wall Street’s worst ever inauguration day sell-off.The benchmark S&P 500 index dived beneath a nadir reached last month, a key support level, leaving it only 7 per cent away from an 11-year low hit in November.“The feeling is, ‘When’s it going to stop?’” said John Brady, head of hedge fund sales at MF Global, who said much of the selling was being driven by continued fears of outright nationalisation of key financial institutions.A slew of further analyst warnings of widening losses from bad loans, higher writedowns and dividend cuts sent the S&P 500 financials index down 16.7 per cent.Citigroup, down more than 40 per cent last week when the group disclosed a break-up plan, tumbled a further 20 per cent to $2.80 as several analysts widened their loss forecasts.Meredith Whitney of Oppenheimer said the group’s “core problem is that it simply doesn’t make money in any of its businesses except Smith Barney, which it is in the process of selling.”Jason Goldberg, analyst at Barclays, warned: “While its split into separate entities should help cosmetics, it doesn’t alter its risk profile.”Wells Fargo, which has yet to disclose fourth-quarter earnings, lost 23.8 per cent to $14.23 after FBR analysts became the latest to warn of higher credit losses and the threat of a dividend cut.“We would continue to avoid the shares until its balance sheet is better capitalised,” said the analysts, who noted Wells Fargo was the only one of the largest four banking stocks to trade above tangible book value.Bank of America, which also dropped by more than 40 per cent last week, shed a further 29 per cent to $5.10, while JPMorganChase lost 20.7 per cent to $18.09.A 71 per cent drop in fourth quarter profit and the scale of unrealised losses on investments at State Street, down 59 per cent to $14.89, spurred a sell-off in the custodian bank sector. Bank of New York Mellon sank 17.3 per cent to $19.Regional banks, too, did badly in the wake of results from Regions Financial, whose shares were pushed 24.2 per cent lower to $4.60 by a worse-than-expected fourth-quarter loss. PNC Financial Services was among the heaviest hit, down 41.4 per cent to $22.The S&P opened lower and sold off sharply throughout the session to close 5.3 per cent down at 805.22. The benchmark index lost 2.7 per cent after President Obama was sworn in at midday.The heaviest previous inauguration day sell-off was that of Lyndon B Johnson in 1963, when the S&P shed 2.8 per cent following the assassination of John F Kennedy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 4 per cent weaker at 7,949.09, below the psychologically significant 8,000 level, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 5.8 per cent lower at 1,440.86. The Vix, referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, leapt 23.9 per cent.Although the heaviest losses were among financials, which lost 8.8 per cent overall, several other sectors came under substanital selling pressure.The market’s sharp decline came in spite of hopes that the new president’s plan for a fresh stimulus package would give a boost to corporate earnings, particularly in the industrial and commodity sectors.Alcoa was among the heaviest hit blue chips outside the financial sector, down 11.5 per cent at $8.35 while materials lost 5.6 per cent overall. Industrials dropped 5 per cent.In addition to concern over the health of financial institutions, investors were also fearful over the prospect for corporate results in other sectors as fourth-quarter earnings season gets into full swing.Johnson & Johnson fell 1.2 per cent to $56.75 despite results that were slightly ahead of analyst expectations. The health care products group posted a 14 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profit but forecast flat earnings for 2009.Chipmakers came under heavy selling pressure ahead of results from International Business Machines, off 3.5 per cent to $81.98.Defensive sectors, although firmly in the red, outperformed as investors sought safety. The consumer staples, utilities and healthcare sectors were off 1.5 per cent, 1.9 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively.
71;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2009-01-07T21:46:00Z;Wall St falls on downbeat company news;;"Sweeping layoffs and profit warnings from a range of blue chips on Wednesday sparked the steepest Wall Street sell-off for more than a month and wiped out nearly all of the market’s new-year advance.All 10 of the S&P’s main sectors lost ground after glum corporate developments from the likes of Alcoa, Time Warner and Intel – coupled with a bleak labour market survey – heightened concerns that the year-long recession was deepening.The financial sector led the declines, down 5.1 per cent overall. Regional banks such as Regions Financial, off 10.4 per cent at $7.91, were among the hardest hit after Credit Suisse warned of the risk of more equity raising and dividend cuts. “The vast majority of regionals remain vulnerable to thinning core equity levels and outsized credit concentrations,” wrote Todd Hagerman, analyst.A rally in life insurance stocks came to an end after Keefe, Bruyette & Woods cut its price target on a host of companies in the sector. Lincoln National, which had rallied by about half over the prior month, gave up 14.4 per cent to $21.22.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley lost 4.8 per cent to $84.50 and 7.6 per cent to $18.10, respectively, after Sanford C Bernstein analysts highlighted expected lower revenue from lucrative equity underwriting both this year and next.“Virtually all the high-margin businesses of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are now declining or moribund – M&A, IPO, convert arbitrage, risk arbitrage, asset management and retail brokerage,” wrote the analysts, led by Brad Hintz.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 3 per cent at 906.65 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.7 per cent weaker at 8,769.70 points and the Nasdaq Composite index 3.2 per cent lower at 1,599.06 points.The Vix, a closely watched technical measure known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, which last week fell to its lowest level since September, leapt 12.5 per cent to above 40 for the first time this year. The technology sector was one of the worst performing after lower revenue and margin guidance from Intel, whose shares shed 6.1 per cent $14.44.In the previous session, technology stocks had led the S&P to its highest level since November as investors snapped up cash-rich names, but the sector lost 3.7 per cent overall.Material stocks were also in focus after Alcoa became the latest company to unveil plans for job cuts – it intends to cut about 15,000 positions to cope with the recession.The market came under pressure from the outset after a report by ADP Employer Services showed that private sector US companies cut an estimated 693,000 jobs last month.The worse-than-expected figures sparked fears that Friday’s closely-watched non-farm payrolls report would show greater losses than already bleak forecasts.Alcoa shares were the worst performing on the Dow, off 10.2 per cent to $10.89 after the materials group also disclosed its third production cut in as many months.Monsanto helped pare the losses in the materials sector when it lifted its full-year earnings outlook after first-quarter profit more than doubled.Its shares rose 17.7 per cent to $86.16, but although the materials sector outperformed the wider market, it still dipped 1.6 per cent.The energy sector tracked the oil price sharply lower to end an eight-session winning streak, down 3.9 per cent overall.Offshore drillers came under further pressure after Citigroup issued a more bearish view of the sector.Pride International and Hercules Offshore lost 6.4 per cent to $17.88 and
4.4 per cent to $5.50, respectively, as the broker recommended clients sell the shares.Media stocks came under pressure after Time Warner warned that it expected to suffer a non-cash impairment charge of about $25bn in the fourth quarter and slashed its full-year financial outlook for 2008.Its shares dropped 6.3 per cent to $10.29, while Viacomlost 4.6 per cent to $20.97.Elsewhere, Harley-Davidson shed 12.4 per cent to $17.35 after Raymond James downgraded its view on the motorcycle stock to “underperform” after the analysts surveyed dealers to gauge demand."

The Nasdaq Composite index was 3 per cent lower at 1,505.90 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.4 per cent at 8,175.77.Energy stocks were the biggest laggard, under pressure from oil’s fall to a fresh low for the year, down 5.7 per cent overall. ExxonMobil and Chevron, which report results later in the week, lost 4.3 per cent to $66.09 and 3.4 per cent to $61.71, respectively.Among the industrials, Caterpillar lost 1.6 per cent to $32.78, after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “buy” to “hold”.General Motors shed another 8.4 per cent to $5.45 after Moody’s downgraded its rating on the motor group.Meanwhile, reports emerged that the government was considering providing financial assistance in a possible merger between GM and Chrysler. Separate reports, however, suggested aid could be limited in a McCain administration.Technology came under pressure on reports that tech financing defaults rose sharply this year, down 2.5 per cent overall. IBM and Oracle fell 3 per cent to $79.66 and 2.7 per cent to $15.77, respectively.The market’s decline came as interest rate futures priced in total certainty that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, edged up 0.6 per cent, indicating continued signs of extreme distress.Elsewhere, Lowe’s fell 2 per cent to $16.85 after the diversified conglomerate’s third-quarter earnings slid into the red, hit by losses at its CNA insurance division, in which Lowe’s said it would inject $1.25bn.The market had clung on to positive territory for much of the day and rose as much as 1.9 per cent after figures showed an unexpected rise in sales of new single-family homes, which were lifted as prices hit a four-year low. Housebuilders were buoyed by the news but later retreated along with the wider market, down 3.3 per cent overall. Morgan Stanley said the housing market was helped briefly in September by the Treasury’s move to provide mortgage finance assistance.Elsewhere in property, CB Richard Ellis – hard hit in recent sessions – rose 4.7 per cent to $4.64 after William Blair upgraded its recommendation on the real estate services group to “outperform”.Among more institutions that accepted government cash under its banking recapitalisation programme, Fifth Third Bancorp and Regions Financia jumped 5 per cent to $8.47 and 11.3 per cent to $9.95, respectively, and were among the biggest winners in the S&P. The regional banking index was 1.6 per cent higher.Earlier in the session, sentiment was helped as further details emerged of the vast series of measures to help the banking sector. The Federal Reserve began buying the debt under its plan to shore up the commercial paper market.“We are starting to see the initial signs of a thaw [in credit markets], but it is going to take some time,” said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at The Hartford.Elsewhere in financials, Goldman Sachs lost 7.5 per cent to $92.88 after the Financial Times reported that its chief executive last month sought tie-up talks with Citigroup. Citi fell 3.4 per cent to $11.73.Telecoms was the only sector to find positive territory, up 1.6 per cent overall. It was helped by well received third-quarter results from Verizon Communications, which soared 10.1 per cent to $27.61.Analysts were divided as to how much attention investors were paying to company results amid unprecedented market volatility.Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to clients: “Emotions remain the primary driver of recent stock market performance, in our opinion. As a result, we believe fundamentals are being cast aside by investors.”
74;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-10-21T21:04:34Z;Higher loan losses hit US regional banks;;"Higher loan losses weighed on quarterly results at a clutch of US regional banks on Tuesday amid continued consumer weakness and turbulence in financial markets.Ohio’s largest banks all suffered losses. National City said it planned to cut about 4,000 jobs, or 14 per cent of its workforce, over the next three years after the bank posted a net loss of $729m, or 85 cents a share. Fifth Third reported a quarterly loss of $56m, or 61 cents per share, and KeyCorp lost $36m, or 10 cents per share.Profits fell at US Bancorp, which operates in the western two-thirds of the country, as well as at south-east bank Regions Financial and at M&T Bank, based in the mid-
Atlantic region. US Bancorp said profits dropped 47 per cent to $576m. Regions’ profits fell 80 per cent to $79.5m and profits at M&T Bank fell 54 per cent to $91.1m.All the banks more than doubled their reserves for loan losses from a year earlier, and net write-offs for bad loans also soared. “We have experienced the most severe financial crisis any of us has known in our business lifetime,” said Henry Meyer, chief executive of KeyCorp.The results echoed signs of deteriorating consumer credit and further housing weakness at big rivals such as Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, which have experienced losses on mortgages and credit card loans. Regional banks have suffered from losses on second mortgages and residential construction and development loans.Several regional banks reporting on Tuesday also suffered losses from holdings of preferred shares issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were virtually wiped out when the two US mortgage agencies were taken into government supervision last month. KeyCorp said it took $54m of charges related to market disruption caused by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.The Treasury last week revealed plans to inject $125bn into banks through the purchase of preferred shares and warrants as part of a $700bn industry bail-out that could include buying troubled loans and securities. Fifth Third, KeyCorp, US Bancorp and Regions said they were considering applications to participate in the scheme.National City said it was looking at details of the proposal but it was too soon to discuss participation. At 11 per cent, the Cleveland-based bank has one of the highest tier one capital ratios among US banks. The bank’s $21bn portfolio of troubled loans has fuelled speculation it might need to seek further capital."
75;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-10-21T20:59:11Z;Poor earnings reports unsettle Wall Street;;A glut of poor corporate earnings and warnings of reduced profitability next year overshadowed a further improvement in money markets and pushed US stocks lower.The S&P 500 closed down 3.1 per cent at 955.05 on what was nevertheless a relatively calm day following last week’s near-unprecedented volatility. The Nasdaq Composite Index was 4.1 per cent lower at 1,696.68, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5 per cent at 9,033.66.Downbeat figures from corporations in the industrial and technology as well as financial sectors demonstrated the toll that the credit crisis had already taken on profitability. Still, traders were more concerned by the generally downbeat mood among companies for the coming year.The technology sector was the biggest drag on the market, down 5.6 per cent overall. Texas Instruments fell 6.3 per cent to $16.85 after it disclosed worse-than-expected results after the bell on Monday.Sun Microsystems and Logitech sustained some of the heaviest losses, down 17.5 per cent to $4.77 and 15 per cent to $15.53, respectively, after updates indicated a downbeat outlook.Apple and Yahoolost 7.1 per cent to $91.49 and 6.1 per cent to $12.07 ahead of results due after the bell.Oracle was one of the few bright spots on plans for an $8bn share buyback but later fell back to stand 2.6 per cent lower at $17.69.A drop in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold profit, which lost 10.8 per cent at $32.74, also put downward pressure on materials, which stood 5.7 lower overall. AK Steel retreated 7.6 per cent to $13.96 after the group said prices would be down about 10 per cent towards the end of the year.DuPont lost 8 per cent to $33.28 after the chemicals company cut its full-year forecast.Lockheed Martin fell 9.7 per cent to $84.19 after the defence group reduced its guidance for next year on concerns of reduced military spending by the new administration.Caterpillar fell 5 per cent to $38.87 after the manufacturer reiterated its 2008 forecast but predicted no rise in revenues next year.However, some in the market downplayed the significance of earnings and argued developments in credit markets would remain centre stage“Earnings are going to be some what meaningless [this quarter],” said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial, who added that some signs in the credit markets were relatively reassuring.The Federal Reserve yesterday launched a new facility to restore liquidity for money market mutual funds and rates for inter-bank lending eased further.The regional banking sector, which stood 0.7 per cent higher, overcame a slew of grim results and was lifted into positive territory by plans to join the government’s $250bn recapitalisation scheme.For example, Regions Financial gained 6.1 per cent to $11.29 even though its earnings from continuing operations fell 76 per cent in the third quarter missing analyst forecasts.On the downside, Western Union sank 17.8 per cent to $16.75 after the group warned undershot Wall Street expectations and warned it could no longer forecast long-term profits.American Express, after the closing bell on Monday, reported a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings that nonetheless beat analyst forecasts. The shares rallied 8.4 per cent to $26.39 yesterday.Also bucking the downward trend, Pfizer was flat at $17.34 after the drug group’s results beat Wall Street’s expectations. 3M rose 4.4 per cent to $60.04, also on the back of well received figures.Energy stocks were also hit as crude fell on fears of a global recession.

79;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

81;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-09-26T21:04:43Z;Drawn-out rescue talks weigh on US stocks;;A week in which developments in Washington took precedence over those on the trading floor ended mixed for stocks as the political impasse over approving the Treasury’s $700bn financial rescue continued.Equity markets were in the red for much of Friday’s session even after President George W. Bush insisted a deal would be reached, but edged higher towards the close.Elsewhere, bleak developments throughout the week reinforced the high stakes posed by the financial crisis for a weakening economy.Regulators seized control of Washington Mutual, making it the biggest banking failure in US history, late on Thursday.Investors reeled further when a government report on Friday showed that the economy grew less in the second quarter than previously thought.In the wake of WaMu, other banks sustained heavy losses on Friday. In particular, Wachovia sank 27 per cent to $10 as the cost of insuring its debt rose sharply. The bank’s credit default swaps started trading on an upfront basis, a sign of extreme distress.Towards the end of the session, reports emerged that it was in deal talks in Citigroup, which rose 3.8 per cent at $20.15.JPMorgan Chase, which acquired the banking operations of WaMu in an emergency deal brokered by the US government, gained 10.2 per cent to close at $47.88.

The Nasdaq Composite index edged down 0.2 per cent at 2,183.34.For the week, that left the S&P lower by 3.3 per cent. The Dow was down 2.2 per cent while the Nasdaq lost 4 per cent. Mounting expectations during the week that Congress would speedily pass the proposed $700bn financial sector bail-out bolstered stocks.Separately, a $5bn investment in Goldman Sachs from Berkshire Hathaway, Mr Buffett’s investment vehicle, also gave a much-needed lift to fragile confidence. Goldman closed up 6.3 per cent higher at $137.99 for the week.Financials fell 7 per cent over a week in which money markets remained for the most part in a state of paralysis.Regional banks were among the hardest hit from mounting scepticism over the extent to which the Fed plan would revive the financial sector.Over the week, Regions Financial, Marshall & Ilsley and National City sank 29.3 per cent to $14, 20.1 per cent to $23.45 and 33.9 per cent to $3.71, respectively.Highlighting division among experts on the proposed bailout plan, Martin D. Weiss, president of Weiss Research, said: “There should be no illusion that the $700bn estimate proposed by the administration will be enough to end the crisis.”General Electric was 5.1 per cent lower for the week at $25.25 after after the world’s fourth largest company cut its third-quarter and full-year earnings forecast and suspended a share buy-back.Meanwhile, downbeat GDP data released on Friday followed a series of grim unemployment, housing and durable goods figures, casting a cloud over forthcoming guidance from companies when they start reporting quarterly earnings next month.Research in Motion sank 27.5 per cent to $70.76 after the maker of BlackBerry smartphones warned that quarterly profit would miss analysts’ forecasts.
82;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-09-23T20:57:52Z;Wall Street stocks fall amid volatility;;Developments in Washington took precedence over those on the trading floor on Tuesday, as investors’ attention turned to key congressional testimony on how to rescue the US financial system.Wall Street stocks swung in and out of negative territory throughout the hearing. A slide in oil prices and positive sentiment in the technology sector helped early on in the day to offset concerns over the likely success of the authorities’ proposed $700bn bail-out.Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary, received a cold reception when he appeared before the Senate committee, amid heightened investor anxiety that political wrangling could hamper the workings of the plan.Since the crisis worsened at the start of the month, the wider market has closely tracked the financial sector. Regional banks, among the hardest hit in the previous session, continued to weigh on Tuesday.Regions Financial fell 12,1 per cent to $13.72. Citigroup said: “While the proposed plan may put a floor on the ultimate risk facing the group, thereby lowering ‘systemic risk’, we do not believe the plan will relieve the near-term credit pressures facing RF and other banks. We expect the stock to come under selling pressure as investors refocus on operating fundamentals.”Citigroup also downgraded its recommendation on Zions Bancorporation from “buy” to “hold”. The shares in Zions fell 14.2 per cent to $40.54.General Electric fell 4.6 per cent to $24.95 after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “buy” to “neutral”, citing “growing fundamental pressures” at its GE Capital division.The broader markets, which opened just as the hearing began, initially rallied sharply higher.But by the close that upbeat tone had abated, with the S&P 500 down 1.6 per cent at 1,188.22. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.5 per cent lower at 10,854.17, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.2 per cent at 2,153.34.A report from Oppenheimer served as a reminder that the Wall Street crisis is likely to have a knock-on effect on Main Street.Analysts led by Meredith Whitney wrote in a note to clients: “Credit market disruption has had underappreciated consequences on the economy, in our view.“A virtual suction of liquidity has occurred in the credit and lending markets, and consumer and corporate credit is already showing the effects. What started last summer has accelerated and intensified so much so that we believe any government bail-out plan has little hope of improving core fundamentals over the near and medium term.”Meanwhile, seasonally adjusted data showed house purchase prices dropped 0.6 per cent in July from June.Among home builders, Lennar sank 7.5 per cent to $12.71 as it reported its sixth straight quarterly loss.The materials sector led the market declines, down 3.2 per cent. Air Products and Chemicals fell 8.8 per cent to $73.22 after the hydrogen producer cut its fourth-quarter earnings estimate. Early gains were led by the technology sector, which initially rose almost 2 per cent before falling back to stand down 0.8 per cent. A loss this month of 11.4 per cent has pushed its prospective price to earnings ratio below 20.Microsoft, which has raised its quarterly dividend and on Monday unveiled plans to buy back as much as $40bn of its stock, rose 0.2 per cent to $25.44.Google, which unveiled the first smartphone powered by its Android software, fell 0.2 per cent to $429.27.Elsewhere in the sector, 3Com rallied 3.4 per cent to $2.16 on the back of positive results, helped in part by a litigation settlement. Bed Bath & Beyond fell 1.2 per cent to $30.40 ahead of quarterly earnings from the home goods retailer due after the closing bell.The fall in oil prices helped airlines and automotive stocks. Bucking that trend, General Motors reversed an early gain of 4 per cent and was down 7.4 per cent at $10.72.In mergers and acquisitions news, Bristol-Myers Squibb raised from $60 to $62 a share its offer for the part of the biotechnology group ImClone Systems that it does not already own. Shares in ImClone rose 6.9 per cent to $63.51, while Bristol-Myers was down 1.8 per cent at $20.26.
83;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-09-22T20:44:09Z;US stocks plunge as scepticism grows;;Regional banks were among the hardest hit from mounting scepticism over the extent to which Washington’s proposed $700bn Wall Street bail-out would resuscitate the crisis-hit financial sector.Regions Financial, Marshall & Ilsley and Huntington – all of which surged last week when news of the government plan surfaced – sustained heavy losses, down 21.2 per cent at $15.60, 22.6 per cent at $22.82 and 23.1 per cent at $9.81 respectively.JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note to clients: “Our initial impression of the plan is that the benefits to the regional banks would be indirect in nature.”The broader market sank as anxiety over the details of the Treasury’s plan to mop up toxic mortgage assets replaced last week’s relief.Analysts at FBR Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients: “Important details of this plan remain unclear, including the pricing mechanism, the amount of mortgage assets that can be sold by each banking institution, and ultimately, the cost that these institutions would incur.”Oil’s extraordinary jump – at one point to $130 a barrel – sparked inflation concerns and hurt automotive, airline and consumer-facing stocks in particular. The rebound helped energy stocks escape the worst declines, although the sector still closed firmly in negative territory, down 1.1 per cent.Yet the market decline was once again led by financials, which fell 7.2 per cent amid uncertainty over the impact of its biggest restructuring since the Great Depression. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup fell, 13.2 per cent at $40.80, 8.9 per cent at $34.15 and 3.1 per cent at $20.01 respectively.In the latest in a series of of extraordinary developments, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are to abandon their investment bank model and become traditional bank holding companies. Morgan Stanley edged down down 0.4 per cent to $27.09 after Goldman, meanwhile, fell 7 per cent to $120.78The S&P 500 closed 3.8 per cent lower at 1,207.12. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3.3 per cent lower at 11,015.69 while the Nasdaq Composite index fell 4.2 per cent to 2,178.98.The prospect of a vast government intervention to stave off a deepening financial crisis led to a two-day rally at the end of last week, helped by a temporary ban on shorting some financial stocks.“Armageddon appears to have been avoided but are the events of the past week to be seen as an armistice or a plain simple truce? I’ll go for an armistice, mindful that history tells us that not even these always hold,” said Howard Wheeldon, strategist at BGC Brokers.Outside financials, Real Estate Investment Trusts and homebuilders sustained particularly heavy losses. General Growth Properties sank 25 per cent to $16.08 after saying it may need to raise capital.General Motors’ inclusion on the short ban list afforded the stock scant comfort. Fitch downgraded its junk debt rating even further, pushing the shares down 11.5 per cent at $11.58.General Electric and American Express also slid, in spite of their addition to the SEC list. They fell 1.2 per cent at $26.15 and 7.7 per cent at $37.29 respectively.Among the few brightspots, Microsoft edged up 1 per cent to $25.40 after the software group raised its quarterly dividend and unveiled plans to buy back as much as $40bn of its stock.Yet Nike and Hewlett-Packard’s share buy-backs failed to lift those stocks into positive territory. Nike fell 0.9 per cent to $63.15 in spite of news of a $5bn repurchase programme. Hewlett-Packard increased its share buy-back programme by $8bn, although the shares lost 2.3 per cent at $47.16.Also in technology, Morgan Stanley cut its price target on several hardware stocks, including Apple and Cisco. They fell 7 per to $131.05 per cent and 4.9 per cent to $23.11 respectively.Morgan Stanley cited the dollar and “additional signs of slowing global demand . . . We expect companies to guide to worse than normal revenue growth for the December quarter”.Amazon.com fell 7.5 per cent to $37.29 and Priceline.com 7.7 per cent to $82.15 after Citigroup said the two were the internet stocks most exposed to dollar appreciation.
84;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-09-09T19:09:36Z;In search of a floor: Is America’s house price crash at last bottoming out?;;For Leon Belenky, the low came at the beginning of summer. “Everybody was sitting on the sidelines,” says the Florida real estate broker. “They were waiting to see what was going to happen and no one was buying.”But Mr Belenky, a former software consultant who moved from New York in the mid-1990s to deal in beachfront condominiums and other high-end homes, says he recently detected an improvement. That came even before the cautious optimism generated by the government takeover at the weekend of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two mortgage giants.He says American buyers seem ready to move back into the market, whereas previously interest was confined to foreigners trying to take advantage of the weak dollar. At Jade Beach, a luxury high-rise development just north of Miami, clients are following through on commitments to buy several units. Mr Belenky had been nervous they might back out. “Although we are still seeing some turbulence on Wall Street, I think the worst is already behind us,” he says.Property professionals are famously optimistic. But there are very tentative signs that the US housing slump could be in the first stages of moderating, after battering the global banking industry and dragging the US economy to its knees. The pace of decline is no longer growing worse and may indeed be decelerating.Across the global financial system, the search for a floor in US housing is being followed closely. Even if prices continued to decline for a while at a declining pace, reduced uncertainty as to where they would end up stabilising would allow banks to put a firmer price tag on their losses and start generating credit again. In turn, that could help bolster other troubled housing markets, notably in the UK.Across metropolitan America, the drop in house prices has eased from a monthly rate of 2.2 per cent six months ago to 0.5 per cent in June, according to the latest Standard & Poor’s Case-Shiller index. Over the same period in Miami, Mr Belenky’s market, the pace of house price declines slowed from 4.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent.Meanwhile, the volume of new and existing home sales has stabilised – at a low level – across the US, after dropping considerably in the first half-year or so of the credit crisis. According to the most optimistic predictions, these trends could be mutually reinforcing this autumn, paving the way for a recovery early next year. But there are a lot of time- lags in the housebuying process. Some analysts fear that the problems at Fannie and Freddie between June and August – which pushed up mortgage rates over that period – will soon show up in weaker home sales.That is not the only problem, as Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, points out. “The expected stabilisation in the mortgage markets resulting from the US government’s action will help bring down mortgage rates,” he says. “But they do not solve the problem of rising foreclosures and falling house prices.”Still, the government rescue of the twin mortgage funders should guarantee the supply of affordable home loans in the coming months. That could ensure that any weak patch in sales is relatively short-lived, locking in one necessary condition for any recovery: stable turnover.If sales remain at present levels – a big “if” – inventories of unsold new homes could decline rapidly in the final months of this year and early next year, as the effect of past drops in home starts finally feeds through to home completions. That would still leave a large inventory of existing homes available for sale.Frank Blake, chief executive of Home Depot, the second largest US retailer, was nonetheless seeing light at the end of the tunnel even before the Fannie-Freddie move. “We don’t think we’re at the bottom yet – but we think you can see it from here,” he says. Investors also seem keener than before to wager on a recovery. Shares in Regions Financial, Alabama’s biggest bank, rose more than 15 per cent last week after it took over the branches of Georgia-based Integrity, which collapsed at the end of August because of the mortgage crisis and was seized by regulators.But for all the glimmers of hope, a rapid turnround in America’s housing market looks unlikely. For many economists, its return to vigour will be long and agonising – and they warn that any progress could quickly unravel. It is hard to believe we are at the bottom. Several indicators of the health of the housing market are still troubling. According to RealtyTrac, a property website, one out of every 464 households received a foreclosure filing in July, compared with one in 557 in February. Foreclosures are not likely to peak until the first quarter of 2009, according to analysts at Lehman Brothers.Last week, Fitch Ratings sounded another alarm bell, saying as much as $96bn (£54bn, €68bn) in home loans sold with initial flexible payments will switch to more stringent terms, probably forcing even more borrowers into foreclosures. Delinquency rates on prime loans, as well as subprime and other exotic mortgages, are climbing.Rising foreclosures prevent a reduction in the inventories of unsold homes and raise the danger of local foreclosure “spirals” as fire sales depress prices of other homes in the neighbourhood. As of July, the National Association of Realtors says, it would take a record 11.2 months to work through the supply of previously owned homes.The mortgage crisis has repeatedly disappointed policymakers since it began 18 months ago. House prices remain elevated on some measures, such as price-to-rent ratios. Moreover, efforts to arrange economically efficient restructurings of mortgage debts – and thereby minimise unnecessary foreclosures – remain an uphill struggle. That is due in large part to the fragmented investor base, with numerous institutions owning a slice of a securitised mortgage.Looking ahead, one main concern is the interplay between housing and the wider US economy, in particular the jobs market. Unemployment has jumped from 4.9 per cent of the workforce in January to 6.1 per cent, amid eight consecutive months of job losses. As more Americans struggle to keep their jobs, it will be harder for them to buy property, no matter how cheap it looks.This year’s jump in the price of petrol could also damp the potential for a housing recovery. Many of the neighbourhoods with the biggest oversupply of homes are on the distant fringes of US cities. These areas have been made less attractive by the much higher costs of commuting by car. Furthermore, with the mortgage markets under strain, lenders have raised the bar for prospective buyers, which is making sales harder to clinch and putting further downward pressure on prices.“Risk-averse lenders are requiring buyers to bring more equity and higher [credit] scores. Even those who qualify are finding it tough to get properties to appraise” – in other words, to have the proposed purchase price endorsed by the lender’s valuer – “or to obtain mortgage insurance, as the entire industry has become more cautious”, says Paul Miller, analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey, a property investment group.With the subprime sector all but evaporated and the jumbo market (for loans into the millions of dollars) barely alive, about three-quarters of mortgage loans are now guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Prior to their takeover, risk spreads on their debt and on their mortgage-backed securities were at near record levels, while the companies were tightening underwriting standards and raising fees to preserve their own capital. That helped keep mortgage rates higher than they were a year ago, in spite of 325 basis points of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.Now, as risk-spreads on Fannie and Freddie paper narrow again and the fees they charge are under downward pressure, a significant decline in mortgage rates finally comes into prospect. That would improve affordability and should at least result in house prices falling less than they otherwise would have done. Over time, the move could also entice buyers away from the sidelines, because the guarantee of an ongoing supply of affordable home loans reduces the risk of a truly catastrophic decline in house prices.The problem is that employment and incomes could push the other way – resulting in a more traditional housing downturn driven by recessionary conditions in the broad economy rather than overvaluation and a credit shock.“We are keeping a watchful eye on residential real estate, to be sure – especially the inventory-to-sales ratio and home prices and the impact of this latest policy intervention,” says David Rosenberg, chief US economist at Merrill Lynch, referring to the federal rescue of Fannie and Freddie. But even if the market begins to bottom soon, “the lead time to the end of the consumer recession is likely a year away at a minimum”.That in itself would limit the number of Florida home hunters arriving at Mr Belenky’s door.WAR GAMES DEPLOYED AS EUROPE FRETS OVER BANKSBy Nikki Tait, Ralph Atkins and Peter Thal LarsenFor European policymakers, the woes of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have given fresh impetus to a question that has dogged them for a year,: what if one of the continent’s own big cross-border institutions ran into trouble?What, for example, if the Northern Rockcustomers (pictured) had been queuing not just outside the UK mortgage lender’s branches in places such as Golders Green and Sunderland but also in Gothenberg and Seville? What if it had not been Germany’s WestLBthat needed a bail-out but instead a bigger organisation with cross-border operations such as Deutsche Bank, UniCredit or UBS?The grim realisation that mechanisms for dealing with the failure of a big multinational banking group might be inadequate has sent policymakers scurrying back to their drawing boards. It is an issue that will feature prominently over the next two days, when European Union finance ministers gather for informal discussions in Nice while regulators and financial service industry heavyweights hold a conference next door.It is not just policymakers who are troubled by the issue. Banks, which have been frustrated for years by the balkanised nature of Europe’s approach to financial regulation, worry about the lack of clarity over the allocation of responsibilities among so-called “home” and “host” regulators. “There is still confusion about who to call if there is a problem,” says one banker.Some action has already been taken. This year, the European Central Bank, EU central banks and finance ministries agreed in principle to improve co-operative procedures. In a memorandum, the three sides noted that financial integration “increases the scope for cross-border and cross-sector contagion” and thus the likelihood of a “systemic crisis affecting more than one state”. As a result, it added, it was important to have EU-level “common principles, procedures and practical arrangements concerning co-operation among the authorities responsible for preserving financial stability”.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is separately drawing up guidelines for managing banks’ liquidity requirements. A pan-European framework for protecting bank depositors has also been discussed.The European Commission has been active, too. In draft proposals it has called for the establishment of “colleges” of supervisors to oversee all cross-border banking groups. This proposal reflects the fact that Brussels has had to frame its response within a roadmap agreed by finance ministers last autumn that ruled out any shift towards an EU super-regulator or common EU standards.The Commission envisages that rules governing information flows and decision-making responsibilities would be beefed up. Brussels is expected to produce formal legislative proposals at the beginning of next month. The shape these will take is thought to be very fluid at present – but already the Commission’sthinking has run into political difficulties.Some smaller member states worry that subsidiaries of cross-border groups will be held to a different standard from purely domestic companies. Another concern, shared by some regulators, is how rescue costs would be divided up or how assets needed to meet local liquidity needs might be transferred. What if a failing bank were seen as no systemic risk to its home market but had relatively greater importance in another national jurisdiction?The ECB meanwhile remains worried about legal obstacles that might hinder the flow of information between regulators and central banks.Regulators are also having to reconsider their reluctance to spell out their exact response to any future crisis for fear of encouraging greater risk-taking by banks – what Sir Eddie George, former governor of the Bank of England, called “constructive ambiguity”. The recent crisis has shown the limitations of an approach that lacks clarity which institutions were deemed too big to fail.Regulators remain concerned that the system is untested. Eurozone officials are currently understood to be planning a discreet global “war game” – an exercise in which crises are simulated. It would include institutions outside the EU.
85;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-09-08T20:59:19Z;Wall St rises after government takover;;Lehman Brothers was a notable outlier from a strong rally in financials on Monday, as investors focused on the embattled investment bank’s internal woes.Although at one stage up as much as 9.4 per cent, the shares closed down 12.7 per cent at $14.15 after analysts – ahead of its much-anticipated third quarter figures – predicted larger writedowns.The sell-off came even as Lehman, which has been in talks with Korea Development Bank over a possible capital injection, said “key strategic initiatives’’ would accompany its results next week.Financial stocks led Wall Street higher on hopes the effective nationalisation of Freddie Mac and Fannie would provide a long-term fillip to the sector.Banks with exposure to the mortgage market fared particularly well. Wachovia jumped 13.4 per cent to $18.99, Bank of America climbed 7.8 per cent to $34.73 and Citigroup gained 6.6 per cent $20.32 respectively.However, institutions with large stakes in Fannie and Freddie suffered as the market capitalisation of the pair collapsed. Gateway Financial lost 24.7 per cent at $5.35, Sovereign Bancorp slid 6.6 per cent to $9.02 and Midwest Banc slipped 24.6 per cent to $4.48.Still, the sector – and the wider market – pared some of its early gains, as more bearish investors noted the government intervention was no panacea to underlying ills.As if to underscore the point, Oppenheimer issued a bearish outlook on investment banks before their third-quarter earnings.As well as Lehman, it lowered its third-quarter earnings estimates for Goldman and Merrill Lynch, which said on Monday it expected a pre-tax loss of between $300m and $350m from a plan to buy back auction-rate securities. Still, their shares edged up 4 per cent to $169.73 and gained 3.2 per cent to $27.59 respectively.Meanwhile, Regions Financial climbed 10.4 per cent to $12.24 after Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co upgraded the Alabama bank from “``underperform” to “market perform’’.It said: “We anticipate that recent credit performance will take a back seat with investors until the euphoria passes.”Meanwhile, Washington Mutual fell 3.5 per cent to $4.12 after the bank was put under special regulatory supervision and named Alan Fishman as its new chief executive. He will succeed Kerry Killinger, who will retire after 18 years.In the broader market, the S&P 500 was up 2.1 per cent at 1,267.79 points by the close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 2.6 per cent higher at 11,510.74 points.David Buik, analyst at BGC Partners, said: “Had Freddie and Fannie defaulted without the assistance of the Treasury and the Fed, the US economy would have fallen into the vortex of recession for at least five years…This action is a confidence booster.”Last week, the S&P 500 suffered its worst weekly loss since February as mounting concerns about the health of the global economy battered sentiment.Homebuilding stocks took particular comfort from the intervention on Monday and were one of the few sectors to hold on to their gains consistently throughout the session. KB Homes, Pulte Homes and Lennar climbed 14.2 per cent to $23.54, 11.3 per cent to $16.22 and 10.3 per cent to $14.95.Earlier in the day, all 10 sector groups boasted gains although by the close energy and materials had edged into negative territory.Technology also struggled to enjoy large gains. Semiconductors suffered amid concerns they were among the most vulnerable stocks to a global slowdown.UBS downgraded its recommendation on NVidia from “neutral” to “sell” and cut its price target from $12 to $11. The shares fell 4.1 per cent to $11.19.UBS also cut its earnings estimate on SanDisk, pushing the shares down 5.9 per cent to $16.60. It said an oversupply of flash memory made it unlikely that prices would recover until the second half of next year.Elsewhere, UAL, parent of United Airlines, tumbled 11.2 per cent to $10.92 after denying a report in the Chicago Tribune newspaper about a possible bankruptcy filing.Altria edged up 0.1 per cent to $20.97 after agreeing to buy UST, a move that will create the largest US producer of smokeless tobacco.

Crude oil fell as much as $8 a barrel before paring early losses.ExxonMobil dropped 3.4 per cent to $77.32 while ConocoPhillips dipped 4.3 per cent to $79. and refiner Tesoro slid 6.9 per cent to $17.28. Coal companies were particularly hard hit. Massey Energy dropped 10 per cent to $59.35, Arch Coal slid 14.8 per cent to $46.19 and Consol Energy lost 8.55 per cent to $61.92. So far this quarter, energy has been the worst performing sector, down 18.7 per cent. The materials sector, down 9.2 per cent over the period, shed another 2.5 per cent on Tuesday.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dipped 7 per cent to $83.05, Monsanto fell 4.3 per cent to $109.34 and US Steel lost 10.3 per cent to $119.39.Airline, automaker and consumer discretionary stocks helped the S&P 500 briefly break through the psychologically important 1,300 mark.However, the broader market gave up early gains. By the close however, the broader index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,277.55.Richard Parker, managing director of institutional equity trading at Stanford Financial said the morning rally “didn’t have an a awful lot of legs to it”.Analysts at JPMorgan’s Private Bank said: “Investors return from their summer holidays facing the same uncertainties as when they left . . . [Still] the current investor caution makes us think that equity prices may already be discounting many of the risks we’ve been concerned about.”Financials lost steam as the day progressed, although most banks held on to some modest gains. Bank of America climbed 3.4 per cent to $32.20 after Goldman Sachs recommended buying the shares on the basis of “long-term earnings power” and near-term capital options which could help it avoid issuing common equity.Lehman Brothers, the embattled investment bank, briefly advanced after reports that Korea Development Bank was in talks to buy a stake in the securities firm. At the close, Lehman shares were up 0.3 per cent to $16.13.Citigroup added 0.6 per cent to $19.11 while JPMorgan rose 1.3 per cent to $38.99 and the S&P 500 financials sector rose 1.8 per cent.Regions Financial also made progress, jumping 19.2 per cent to $11.05. The Alabama-based bank said it had assumed about $900m in total deposits from Integrity Bank, a failed bank.Meanwhile, the weaker-than-expected impact of Hurricane Gustav gave other energy-sensitive stocks a boost. Airline companies UAL, Delta and AMR soared 11.7 per cent to $12.41, 12.8 per cent to $9.17 and 11.3 per cent to $11.50.Automakers General Motors and Ford added 6.5 per cent to $10.65 and 1.12 per cent to $4.51.The broader consumer discretionary sector also made strong gains, led by consumer services and retail stocks as investors bet that falling oil prices would boost spending power.Carnival, the cruise operator, rose 5.6 per cent to $39.13, while Lowe’s added 6.9 per cent to $26.33. The sector as a whole rose 1.8 per cent.That, early positive momentum helped markets to glide past some weak macroeconomic data released in the mid-morning, showing a stagnant manufacturing sector and a further decline in construction spending.Since its low point on July 15, the benchmark S&P 500 index has bounced about
5.2 per cent, partly because of a 24.3 per cent drop in the price of oil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 2.1 per cent in early trading before giving up those gains to close at 11,516.92, down 0.2 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,349.24.In technology, Xerox climbed 3.1 per cent to $14.36 after Citi initiated coverage with a “buy” recommendation and a $20 price target.The office equipment maker had “perhaps the most compelling enterprise services portfolio of any company in the market”, Citi said.News that Google released its own internet browser initially helped the stock advance. But the moves were not enough to keep the sector in the black and it swung to losses of 1.4 per cent. Google shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $465.25."
87;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-07-22T20:49:24Z;Wall Street rallies as oil price drops sharply;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday as a sharp drop in oil prices boosted consumer-facing stocks while a plan to turn round Wachovia helped investors shrug off some disappointing earnings reports.Most eyes were focused on the financial sector, which staged a remarkable midday volte-face to gain 6.6 per cent as investors skipped over a series of weak earnings results to focus on the positive.Overnight, American Express reported second-quarter earnings that missed estimates and withdrew its full-year earnings forecast. The credit card company’s shares tumbled 7.1 per cent to $37.99 while peer Discover Financial lost 3.8 per cent to $14.62.An $8.9bn loss from Wachovia and some depressing results from regional banks, including Regions Financial and Keycorp, initially added to the sour mood.But by midday investors had shrugged off the bad news, focusing instead on a strategy from Robert Steel, Wachovia’s new chief executive, to cut $2bn of expenses by the end of 2009, sell assets and slash jobs and the dividend at the bank.Wachovia shares swung from an 11.6 per cent loss to a 27.4 per cent gain at $16.79. Regions Financial and Keycorp overturned early losses to gain 9.6 per cent to $11.40 and 4.3 per cent to $11.99, respectively.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim, an online brokerage, said: “Wachovia presented a plan this morning, they cut their dividend – they are doing something. This credit crisis is not going away in a month, but if we have a plan to get ourselves out of it in a year that makes the market feel good.”There were some more consistent bright spots. Western Union advanced 8.6 per cent to $27.23 after the money-transfer company said second-quarter profit had risen 13 per cent, thanks to international revenues, and raised its 2008 profit forecast.SunTrust Banks said second-quarter earnings had slumped 21 per cent. But that was a smaller fall than expected and the shares rallied 17.1 per cent to $39.97 after the bank ruled out a capital raising or dividend cut.CME Group, which runs futures exchanges, said second-quarter profit had risen 60 per cent to $201m thanks to its purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade. CME shares rose 12.5 per cent to $366.27.By the close, the benchmark S&P 500 had shaken off early losses and was up 1.4 per cent at 1,277.01 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent higher at 11,602.5 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was ahead 1.1 per cent at 2,303.96 points.The day began in downbeat fashion after Apple forecast fourth-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ projections. The news, and speculation about the health of Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, sent shares in the iPod maker down 2.6 per cent to $162.02.Texas Instruments and SanDisk also disappointed investors in the technology sector. The semiconductor makers both predicted earnings that trailed analysts’ expectations. Texas shares fell 14.2 per cent to $24.48, SanDisk dropped 24 per cent to $13.62, while an index of semiconductor stocks slipped 2.8 per cent.A $4 drop in oil prices took the sting out of the worst results. Consumer staples and discretionary stocks were among the best performers, adding 2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart added 3.1 per cent to $59.06 while Starbucks rose 7.4 per cent to $15.13.In industrials, some solid earnings news helped steady investor concerns about the health of the economy. Caterpillar, the heavy goods maker, Lockheed Martin, the defence company, Paccar, the truckmaker, and United Parcel Service, each met or beat analysts’ expectations for their quarterly results.Caterpillar shares rose 2.4 per cent to $74.98, Lockheed Martin added 2.3 per cent to $103.88, Paccar climbed 4.4 per cent to $44.60 and UPS advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.11.Energy was the best performing sector on Monday, but that trend petered out on Tuesday as oil prices slipped back below $130 a barrel and some decent results from the services sub-industry left investors unmoved. BJ Services and Baker Hughes rose 6.6 per cent to $31.99, and 3.2 per cent to $87.06, respectively.
88;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-07-22T19:21:25Z;SunTrust sells stake in Coke;;SunTrust on Tuesday completed the sale of a coveted stake in Coca-Cola that the Atlanta-based bank has owned for almost 90 years, allowing the bank to prop up its capital position after mounting mortgage losses led to sharply weaker second-quarter earnings for the bank.News of the SunTrust disposal came as the deepening housing slump and slowing economy weighed on second-quarter earnings for banks including North Carolina’s Wachovia , Ohio’s Fifth Third and KeyCorp and Alabama’s Regions Financial.Wachovia, the fourth-largest US bank by assets, posted an $8.9bn loss, slashed its dividend for the second time this year and announced 10,700 job cuts. Net charge-offs at the bank increased more than eightfold from last year.SunTrust’s sale of 43.6m shares in the world’s largest soft drinks company, executed through three different transactions and valued at about $2bn, was used to prop up the bank’s capital position after higher credit losses tied to real estate led to a 21 per cent decline in second-quarter earnings to $535m. SunTrust, which holds the Coke secret formula in one of its safe deposit boxes, has held Coke shares since 1919, when predecessor bank Trust Company of Georgia helped take the company public. The stake has long been regarded as equivalent to the SunTrust family silver, and its sale is emblematic of the declining fortunes of US banks.The Coca-Cola transactions boosted the bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio to around 7.95 per cent – compared with the 6 per cent statutory minimum. In one of the transactions, SunTrust will dispose of 30m shares in the next seven years, while collecting part of the money now. “It is timely to reiterate that the impetus for the transactions announced today was exclusively related to SunTrust’s own capital optimisation goals,” said James Wells, chairman and chief executive of SunTrust, adding that the bank retained “the highest degree of institutional respect” for Coca-Cola.Wachovia, Fifth Third, KeyCorp and Regions reported higher losses on consumer debt and mounting problems on construction loans tied to residential real estate.Home equity losses accelerated amid borrower stress and falling home prices, particularly in the boom-and-bust regions of California and Florida and older industrial areas such as Michigan and Ohio, the banks said.Fifth Third posted a $202m loss while writing off $167m of consumer debts, almost a third of which were home equity loans. Losses tied to residential construction loans also mounted for Fifth Third and Regions.KeyCorp suffered in previous quarters from losses on residential construction loans, but has been trying to reduce its exposure.
89;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-07-20T19:47:24Z;Regional US banks in fears of cash calls;;US regional banks will draw scrutiny during earnings season this week amid fears that losses on home equity and residential construction loans may force some to raise fresh capital or put themselves up for sale in turbulent markets.Shares of regional lenders have come under heavy pressure on fears about the ability of smaller institutions to ride out the turmoil in the banking sector.Such fears were thrown into stark relief last week after US banking regulators took over California-based IndyMac, making it the second-largest banking failure in US history, and leading to queues of anxious depositors outside branches.After mixed earnings reports from regional lenders thus far, a flurry of banks with large portfolios of real-estate loans will report their second-quarter results on Tuesday, including SunTrust, Regions Financial, Fifth Third and KeyCorp, while National City will follow on Thursday.Last week, Pittsburgh-based PNC and Ohio-based Huntington BancShares were the only two banks to report higher profits in the second quarter.While financial services ended last week as the second-biggest boosters of the S&P 500, regional banks were one of the heaviest drags. The S&P regional banks index ended Friday’s session down 0.8 per cent.Keith Horowitz, banking analyst at Citigroup, said that as losses from portfolios of home equity and residential construction loans mount, “a number of banks will be forced to come to seek their first, or in some cases second or third rounds of capital, and as time progresses it will be increasingly difficult and more costly to raise”.However, investors fear that many regional lenders, particularly banks with smaller deposit bases or less strategic attraction for private equity funds, could struggle to raise new capital.Many larger banks with stronger brands have already tapped investors for fresh funds and the value of those investments has deteriorated amid the recent slide in bank stocks.Analysts say consolidation in the sector – the traditional escape hatch for pressurised regional banks – may also be less realistic in the current crisis.David Hendler, analyst at CreditSights, a research provider, said: “Even relatively healthier banks are for the most part now saddled with their own credit problems and/or merger integrations …they are therefore less likely to rescue banks which may need a saviour.”New accounting rules that force an acquirer to value a target’s portfolio at current market prices may also stand in the way of consolidation for troubled regional banks, as potential buyers may be deterred until there is evidence that credit deterioration has slowed or access to fresh capital is more readily available.
90;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-06-20T01:45:57Z;Small lenders expected to slash pay-outs;;Investors are betting mounting credit costs could force US regional banks such as SunTrust and PNC to slash dividends to preserve cash.A spike in the volume of equity options trades on Atlanta-based SunTrust in recent days shows investors now expect the bank to cut its dividend by half, according to research from Deutsche Bank. The option-implied dividend for PNC is 20 per cent below its last announced dividend.The volume of options trades on the regional banks has spiked to between four and five times the daily average in recent days.The sharp increase in such options bets comes after Ohio-based banks KeyCorp and Fifth Third both announced substantial dividend cuts and plans to raise capital. Bank analysts are now widely predicting that as credit costs continue to mount, other regional banks will not be far behind.Equity options prices suggest investors are betting on dividend cuts that will save banks around $22bn a year, according to Deutsche’s analysis of the 95 financial institutions listed in the XLF, XBD and BKX indices.Such fears have prompted sharp falls in the share prices of several regional banks in recent days. On Thursday, the sell-off pushed the BKX banking index to a five-year low, led by falls for Huntington Bancshares, SunTrust and Regions Financial.Shares of SunTrust, which on Thursday traded as low as $33.22, are at their lowest since 1996. Scott Valentin, analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey, said in a research note there was a lack of positive catalysts to support a turnround in SunTrust’s shares due to “uncertainty surrounding ultimate credit costs and the sustainability of the dividend, along with SunTrust’s lack of desire to sell the company at the current depressed valuation”.BB&T, which had been as much as 12 per cent lower on Thursday on fears it might cut its dividend, recovered in late trading after the bank said it still expected to make some increase to its dividend in 2008. Options markets had been betting the bank would cut its dividend by up to 27 per cent, according to Deutsche.Once beloved by investors for their generous dividend yields, regional banks have in recent months come under growing regulatory pressure to cut back on pay-outs to shareholders and bolster their balance sheets with fresh capital.Fifth Third on Wednesday slashed its dividend by two-thirds and said it planned to raise $2bn of capital in preferred shares and through asset sales. KeyCorp said last week it planned to raise $1.5bn and slashed its quarterly dividend in half.National City raised $7bn in May from outside investors led by Corsair Capital, the buy-out firm.
91;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-06-18T20:34:48Z;US stocks fall as oil prices surge;;US stocks fell for a second session on Wednesday as oil prices surged in late trading while poor results from FedEx underscored the challenges of rising energy prices and crumbling profitability facing the broader economy and equity markets.FedEx said it had lost $241m in the fourth quarter after rising fuel costs and a writedown on FedEx Kinko, its copy centre unit, took their toll. The company’s outlook statement for 2009 was also downbeat.The results will further heighten fears about the impact of elevated oil prices on the wider economy.The parcel delivery firm is often seen as a bellwether because its business depends on the levels of activity in the economy.FedEx shares fell 2.1 per cent to $82.60 while rival UPS lost 2.3 per cent to $65.80, dragging the industrials sector down 1 per cent.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said profit dropped 57 per cent in the second quarter due to weak performances at its trading and investment banking units. The stock initially fell as much as 7.8 per cent, weighing on sentiment, only to swing back into the black in late trading.Still, the rally had little effect on the broader financial sector.On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs undermined market sentiment, in spite of posting better-than-expected results, after its analysts warned that US banks might have to raise as much as $65bn in additional capital to shore up balance sheets weakened by the mortgage crisis.As if to confirm those predictions, Fifth Third Bancorp said on Wednesday that it would raise $2bn by selling shares and assets to shore up its balance sheet after nine quarters of declining profit. The Ohio-based bank will also cut its dividend.Morgan added 0.5 per cent to $40.80, Goldman rose 1.9 per cent to $182.77 but Fifth Third slumped 27.3 per cent to $9.26.The S&P 500 financials sector slipped 1.2 per cent while the KBW banking index hit a six-year low.By the close, the S&P 500 was down 1 per cent at 1,337.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 1.1 per cent to 12,029.06, hitting a three-month low, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,429.71.On Tuesday, equity markets ended a weak three-day rally, led lower by the financial sector and economic data that triggered further worries about inflation and the housing market.Regional bank shares were sold particularly hard after some negative analyst comments. That trend continued on Wednesday as Fifth Third’s capital-raising weighed on the sector.SunTrust Banks fell 9 per cent to $36.95, Regions Financial dropped 10.4 per cent to $11.40 while Huntington Bancshares slipped 9.5 per cent to $5.52.The FedEx results cast a pall over equity markets and by the end of the day, all 10 leading industrial groups on the S&P 500 retreated into the red.A rise in oil prices did little to help, and the consumer discretionary and staples sectors were among the leading fallers, dropping 1.9 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively.Carmakers led the way down after analysts predicted that US vehicle sales could slump to their lowest in more than 15 years this month as buyers shun the gas-guzzling vehicles that are their bread and butter. General Motors lost 5.9 per cent to $14.89 while Ford slid 5.8 per cent to $6.22.Tyson Foods, the chicken producer, also fell back, slumping 8.2 per cent to $13.68 after Fitch cut its debt to non-investment grade.In other corporate news, MF Global, the broker of exchange-traded futures contracts, tumbled 41 per cent to $7.83 after it said revenues would come in below analysts’ estimates. It added that it planned to sell shares to pay down debt.There were bright spots. Union Pacific said in the week that flooding in the Midwest had disrupted services and damaged its infrastructure – it estimated that the weather would trim second-quarter earnings. However, its shares still rose 4.6 per cent to $75.82 on Wednesday following an upbeat report from Morgan Stanley said rising productivity would offset higher oil prices and boost profit.Peer CSX added 1.3 per cent to $64.20 while trucking company YRC Worldwide added 5.4 per cent to $17.68 after reaffirming its second- quarter guidance.
92;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-05-28T22:57:28Z;KeyCorp plunge sparks fears for smaller lenders;;Shares of US regional banks slumped Wednesday after KeyCorp, the third-largest bank in Ohio, doubled its forecast for loan losses and prompted concerns that small US banks may have underestimated the cost of the housing slump.KeyCorp plunged 10.4 per cent, and was down as much as 12 per cent in intraday trading, after the bank said in a regulatory filing that it might have to write off up to 1.3 per cent of its total loans this year.It said that second-quarter and potentially third-quarter net charge-offs could be even higher than the new estimate, citing exposure to residential homebuilders, education and home improvement loans. KeyCorp’s revision to its loan loss estimates is its second in as many months.The news dragged shares of other regional banks lower amid concerns that similar revisions could be looming elsewhere as US house prices continue to fall, putting pressure on all housing-related loans, many of which have stayed on regional bank balance sheets.“Things are going to get significantly worse before they are going to get better for KeyCorp and the banking industry,” said Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital Markets in a note to clients.Shares in Regions Financial, the largest bank in Alabama, fell by more than 5 per cent, Texas-based Comerica fell by 3.8 per cent, and Cincinatti-based Fifth Third fell by 3.58 per cent.The selling pushed the BKX banking index to a five-year low in intraday trading, before it recouped some of its loss to close 1.7 per cent lower.KeyCorp said last year that it would exit troubled lines of business such as lending to homebuilders and dealer-originated home improvement loans outside its regional base in areas such as Southern California, Arizona and Nevada.However, such loans remain on KeyCorp’s books and have been the epicentre of losses for the bank.Rising credit problems have caused many US regional banks substantially to increase their provisions to cover loan losses, as declining home prices have spread credit deterioration beyond subprime mortgages and complex structured mortgage assets to affect prime mortgages, home equity and residential construction exposure. The pace of losses in these asset classes accelerated in the first quarter.David Hendler, banking analyst at CreditSights, a research company, said: “The current credit cycle has been surprising in the pace and severity of deterioration, with banks repeatedly caught off guard by the rapid increases in credit quality deterioration.”
93;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-05-28T20:41:19Z;US stocks climb in volatile session;;Wall Street stocks climbed for a second session on Wednesday, after a stop-start day of trading that featured bad news from regional banks, a lurch in oil prices that boosted related stocks but trimmed advances elsewhere and a steady rally in materials.A drop in crude prices initially sent markets into positive territory, a trend reinforced by data showing an unexpected rise in orders for core durable goods in April.By mid-afternoon in New York, oil prices had made an abrupt U-turn, retracing earlier declines. This combined with a sell-off in financials to forestall the positive momentum - but only temporarily.A rally in materials stocks, which followed some commodity prices higher, helped kick the broader equity markets back into the black in late afternoon.By the end of the day, materials had added 2.8 per cent, breaking a four session loosing streak and powering to their biggest one day gains in a month.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,390.87, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 0.4 per cent at 12,594.03. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 2,486.70.On Tuesday, falling crude prices and some post-holiday cheer helped markets bounce back from their biggest weekly fall in three months. The momentum carried investors through another round of dismal housing statistics and a survey showing languishing consumer confidence.The consumer discretionary sector held onto narrow gains on Wednesday, adding 0.4 per cent thanks to decent results from American Eagle Outfitters and Polo Ralph Lauren.American Eagle shares, which have lost 36 per cent of their value over the last year, clawed back 8.1 per cent to $18.61.Polo Ralph Lauren surged 11.7 per cent to $69 after the clothing brand reported an unexpected increase in fourth-quarter profit, helped by its new line for JC Penney and sales in Europe.Expedia also made ground, advancing 4.7 per cent to $22.75 on speculation that chairman Barry Diller might attempt to take the internet travel agency private.Despite pockets of outperformance, the picture for retailers remains bleak. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, weekly chain store sales stalled last week as gasoline prices continued to drag on consumer spending.Investment banks were in the spotlight again on Wednesday after JPMorgan became the latest brokerage to cut its earnings estimates for the sector, citing Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley in particular.JPMorgan analysts argued that less effective hedges, slowing client activity and yet more write-offs would hurt results. The group advised investors to steer clear of the sector.The sector swung between gains and losses during the day before settling up 0.4 per cent. Lehman slipped 1 per cent to $36.84, hit also by suggestions it might need to raise more capital, while Goldman and Morgan added 0.5 per cent to $174.83 and 1.3 per cent to $42.77 respectively.AIG, the insurance group, was among the sector’s biggest fallers, dropping 4.7 per cent to $34.91 after a Citi analyst suggested it might need more capital on top of the $20.3bn it has raised.Regional commercial banks also came under pressure after KeyCorp, the third-largest bank in Ohio, doubled its forecast for loans that are unlikely to be repaid.KeyCorp slumped 10.4 per cent to $19.66 and was followed down by Regions Financial and Huntington Bancshares, which dropped 5 per cent to $18.08 and 4.9 per cent to $9.04 respectively.Commercial banks, as measured by the KBW index, have lost over 12 per cent of their value since the start of the month and are down about 37 per cent since their highs in February 2007.Energy-sensitive stocks such as carmakers swung from profits to losses as energy prices rebounded above $130. Ford fell 0.3 per cent to $6.78 while General Motors lost 1.6 per cent to $17.15.The volte-face in oil prices also helped energy groups overturn early losses and snap a four-session losing streak. Chevron rose 0.8 per cent to $100.42, ConocoPhillips added 2.1 per cent to $92.56, while the sector as a whole rose 1.5 per cent.In materials, Ashland, Allegheny Technologies and Monsanto were among the leading gainers, advancing 5.2 per cent to $58.19, 5.1 per cent to $76.73 and 5.3 per cent to $125.32.
94;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-05-16T17:59:58Z;US energy stocks race ahead;;Wall Street stocks slipped back on Friday but remained ahead for the week as resurgent oil prices boosted energy stocks but threatened to squeeze already weak consumer spending and financials lost ground.Energy stocks were in sharp focus again. Oil prices hit record highs after analysts at Goldman Sachs raised their oil price forecast for the second half of 2008 from $107 to $141 a barrel.ConocoPhillips shares rose 2.1 per cent to $91.19, Chevron added 1.4 per cent to $99.88 and an index of energy stocks advanced 1.5 per cent.As oil moved higher, consumer discretionary stocks shrank back. The sector slipped 1.5 per cent in early trading, led down by Liz Claiborne, which fell 6.7 per cent to $18.24 and Jones Apparel, which dropped 5.7 per cent to $16.68.The sector was not helped by the latest Reuters/University of Michigan index that showed consumer confidence this month slumped to the lowest level in 28 years.Financials also proved a weak spot, slumping 1.7 per cent after Merrill Lynch analysts recommended selling regional banks and Nobel Prize winner Myron Scholes said the worst of the credit crisis may not be over.KeyCorp and Regions Financial led the sector lower, dropping 5.1 per cent to $23.80 and 5.4 per cent to $20.16, respectively.By lunchtime in New York, the benchmark S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent to 1,416.66 yesterday but up 2.1 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent lower at 12,904.32 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,512.90.The technology sector was notably active this week. Hewlett-Packard, started the ball rolling on Tuesday when it tabled a $13.9bn deal to buy Electronic Data Systems. HP shares fell 5.2 per cent to $46.60 over the week while EDS was among the weeks leading gainers, rising 29 per cent to $24.33.Equities were surprisingly jaunty this week and markets are on course for their best performance since mid-April. Of the leading S&P 500 industrial groups, the energy and material sectors were the standouts, adding 3.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively.Earnings from retailers that were not as bad as feared and the stimulating prospects of government rebates played a part in that rally. Consumer discretionary stocks added 3.1 per cent over the week.On Wednesday, Macy’s reiterated its annual forecasts, in spite of tough trading conditions, and saw its share prices bounce. That picture of weak but better-than-expected results has been a hallmark of the first- quarter earnings season and some analysts expect the pattern to sustain equity markets.Analysts at UBS said: “We think the S&P 500 should continue rallying from here as investor’s price in resilience and sustainability in earnings.”The outlook for financials is less rosy. Meredith Whitney, at Oppenheimer, slash- ed her earnings forecasts for brokers this week, citing accounting changes, weakness in the capital markets and reduced revenues.But over the week, financial stocks rose 0.8 per cent on the back of some positive news. On Wednesday, for example, Freddie Mac posted a smaller-than-expected loss.In the background, the saga surrounding Yahoo and its decision to reject a take-over offer from software giant Microsoft trundled on.Yahoo is now fighting efforts by billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn to replace its board and force the company back into negotiations with Microsoft. Over the week, Yahoo shares rose 7.3 per cent to $27.80 and Microsoft shares added 2.2 per cent to $30.05.Homebuilders were also in focus as dismal data and earnings from the sector continued to pour out.But stocks maintained their composure, taking solace from news of efforts in Congress to address the housing slump. Lennar and Centex added 7.1 per cent to $19.71 and 7.2 per cent to $22.90, respectively, over the week.
95;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2008-04-15T20:47:44Z;US stocks edge up in volatile session;;"Wall Street stocks climbed on Tuesday for the first time in three days as advances by financial and energy companies offset declines in healthcare stocks in a temperamental session of trading.The S&P 500 financials index swung between gains and losses but by mid-
afternoon bank and brokerage stocks had recovered thanks to a rare spot of good news from a pair of regional banks.Regions Financial, the biggest bank in Alabama, and M&T Bank, part-owned by Berkshire Hathaway, said gains from selling their stakes in Visa and increased fee income had enhanced first-quarter results.Regions shares rose 8.4 per cent to $20.12 while M&T added 6.3 per cent to $85.86, pushing broader indices into the black.That news helped offset revelations that State Street, the money manager for institutions, could be forced to bail out a number of mortgage-backed debt funds, or “conduits”, that have already incurred $1.49bn in unrealised mark-to-market losses. State Street fell 9.9 per cent to $69.23 after rising as much as 4 per cent earlier in the day after the company had reported a 69 per cent increase in first-quarter earnings.“If you are looking to see if we have turned a corner with financials, then the answer is probably no,” said Thomas Nyheim vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust. “They are going to keep coming out with mixed numbers, but it seems to be priced into the market.”The financials sector was among the leading gainers in the broader S&P 500, with the financials index up 1.1 per cent, snapping a five-day losing streak.Throughout the day the markets struggled to find a clear direction as investors were hit with a raft of conflicting data including reports showing rising inflation, stabilising manufacturing activity in New York state and a slightly more optimistic outlook among homebuilders.By the close, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,334.44.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 2,286.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also added 0.5 per cent, to 12,362.47.Still, the S&P 500 has fallen in four out of the past six sessions, as a string of disappointing first-quarter earnings results from the likes of Wachovia, and expectations of worse to come, weighed on investor confidence.Markets started on Tuesday in a positive mood after better-than-expected results from healthcare sector bellwether Johnson & Johnson.The group’s profits jumped in the first quarter, breaking the run of bad earnings news from major US corporations that has undermined sentiment in the past two weeks.But the results left investors largely unmoved once trading began and the shares fell 0.1 per cent to $65.65 while an index of healthcare stocks fell 0.2 per cent.Technology companies also suffered after a series of earnings downgrades by analysts worried that a slowdown will hit profits. An index of technology stocks shed as much as 0.9 per cent before rallying towards the close.Computer component makers EMC and Emulex led the fallers, dropping 3.2 per cent to $14.17 and 6.3 per cent to $12.74 respectively after Citigroup downgraded the stocks.Cisco and IBM also lost ground, falling 0.9 per cent to $23.11 and 0.1 per cent to $117.17 respectively.First-quarter results from Intel, the leading semiconductor manufacturer and industry bellwether, should help reassure investors spooked by disappointing results from arch-rival AMD last week however. Intel said profits fell 12 per cent to $1.44bn but first quarter sales rose 9.3 per cent to $9.67bn. The shares fell 0.9 per cent to $20.75 in after-hours trading.Record oil prices and buoyant commodity prices lifted oil producers, material stocks and wider indices. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips added 1.2 per cent to $90.80 and 1.8 per cent to $81.24 respectively.Airline companies, however, fared poorly as analysts and investors worried that rising fuel costs would eat up any benefits from recent moves to consolidate the industry.Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines jumped in pre-market trading after they agreed to a $3.63bn merger, but by the close Delta shares were down 12.6 per cent to $9.66. Northwest fell 8.4 per cent to $10.28."
96;RF;Regions Financial Corp;2007-11-04T19:34:59Z;Survivor leaders at big banks;;"It will go down as the week that shook Wall Street.Stan O’Neal at Merrill Lynch and Chuck Prince at Citigroup have fallen victim to the credit squeeze and questionable decision-making.A third chief executive, Jimmy Cayne of Bear Stearns, holds on uneasily.Who’s next?Will the credit squeeze, now in its powerful second wave, wash away all of Wall Street’s top executives and usher in a new era of diminished risk-taking?Will it rival the late 1980s, when the savings and loan crisis, the collapse in commercial real estate prices and Latin American turmoil cost scores of top bank executives their jobs?At this early stage, the answer appears to be probably not. In fact, heads of some of Wall Street’s other big banks seem still to be in a strong position.Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has thus far steered the group through the credit squeeze in fairly good health.The bank reported record third-quarter earnings and took relatively small markdowns on collateralised debt obligation positions.Rather than playing defence, some analysts believe JPMorgan will use weakness in other banks’ share prices to make a big acquisition.Dick Bove, analyst at Punk Ziegel, says he expects Mr Dimon will try to buy Sun Trust or Regions Financial in the southern US or Keycorp or National City in the Midwest.Morgan Stanley suffered some embarrassing trading lapses, especially in its quantitative strategies group, but its third-quarter earnings decline of 7 per cent was fairly small and the group is performing well in most areas.John Mack has increased the bank’s risk appetite and expanded the use of its own capital.Morgan Stanley shares have risen more than 20 per cent since his return to the bank in June of 2005.Like other banks, Morgan Stanley is making cuts in leveraged finance and securitised products.But there has been no indication that it plans to return to the lower-risk strategy employed by Phil Purcell, who was ousted as chief executive in 2005.Dick Fuld, Lehman Brothers chief executive, has emerged triumphantly from the squeeze. Aggressive hedging and a long-running campaign of diversification into equities and foreign markets helped cushion the blow from a big decline in revenue in fixed income, historically Lehman’s biggest business.If anything, the credit squeeze has now made clear that Lehman and Bear, which is still heavily reliant on domestic fixed income, can no longer be viewed as comparable
organisations.Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, has continued its dazzling run of bumper profits, demonstrating to the consternation of rivals that it is the savviest trader on Wall Street, master of even the most treacherous and volatile markets.Goldmans critics suggest its rude health may be the result of clever manipulation of information gleaned from clients. Goldman dismisses such anonymous sniping as sour grapes from rivals.Of course, the chief executive carnage could continue if credit markets deteriorate and the values of mortgage-related securities continue to plummet.Analysts do expect further writedowns in the fourth quarter, but the biggest
are expected to come from two banks that have already bid farewell to the their chief executives, Citi and Merrill.The changes at those two banks are due to unusual circumstances.At Citi, frustration had been brewing for many months over Mr Prince’s leadership and the bank’s languishing stock price. The writedowns were the tipping point.Mr O’Neal suffered because he made Merrill the biggest player in creating collateralised debt obligations and the bank continued to put CDOs together even as the market for their underlying mortgage-backed securities was disappearing. Outside structured credit, Merrill was performing fairly well.
