0;RJF;Raymond James Financial;2012-12-16T03:17:31Z;Advisory chief aims to regain public trust in financial world;Chet Helck says transparency will favour Raymond James;"This may be the season of goodwill to all men but, if Chet Helck is correct, it may not prove to be a happy new year for many of the UK’s army of independent financial advisers.Mr Helck, chief executive of the global private client group at Raymond James Financial, a US-headquartered advisory group with $380bn of client assets, foresees some rather testy conversations between IFAs and their clients.From January 1, under the terms of the UK’s Retail Distribution Review, advisers can no longer be remunerated by commission payments from fund providers, and will instead have to charge clients a fee for their services. This new-found transparency will shine a light on a hitherto murky system of payments that involved investors paying over the odds for funds in order to underwrite these commission payments, a fact many clients may have had only a hazy understanding of.“People are waking up to the fact that they were paying fees for 20 years without knowing,” says Mr Helck. “Some may forgive [their advisers], others will say ‘I don’t think that was fair to do that for 20 years without telling me’ and will look for another adviser.”Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr Helck sees this as a golden opportunity for his employer, which already conducts the “vast majority” of its business on a fee basis, with the fee a proportion of assets under management. “Clients will be re-evaluating their relationship with advisers. Transparency favours us.”Florida-headquartered Raymond James is celebrating its 50th year, but is best known in the UK for a rather more recent spat with Towry, the wealth manager.Earlier this year, Towry lost a High Court case against seven IFAs, which it accused of unlawfully soliciting almost 400 clients when they left Towry to join Raymond James.In many ways this was a clash of business models; while many advisory groups fight tooth-and-nail to stop advisers taking clients with them when they leave, Raymond James is perfectly happy for them to do so. Indeed, it is scathing of restrictive covenants that mean a client is essentially “owned” by an advisory firm, rather than by a specific adviser with whom they may have built up a strong relationship.“If your adviser leaves the firm, you can use anybody you want but the adviser you had before. The retail customer is bound by a contract they are not privy to,” says Peter Moores, chief executive of Raymond James’ UK private client group.Mr Helck sums it up more directly. “It’s not putting customers’ interests first. If you are the only [adviser] who knows my wife has a terrible illness and will die in two years and you have based liquidity around that, I shouldn’t have to tell someone else. You have to remember that the money belongs to the client, not the firm.”He accepts Raymond James’ free agent model carries a degree of commercial risk, given that “our advisers can walk away with all their clients”.But Mr Helck claims an attrition rate of less than 3 per cent in the US, where the majority of Raymond James’ 6,300 advisers and 2m clients are based, which “compares tremendously favourably with anyone in the industry”.He cites two main corporate benefits of this approach. First, it should improve standards by reducing the risk of short- termism by advisers, as they see the benefit of cultivating a potentially career-long relationship. Second, it obviates the need for continual, and costly, legal action.To this end, more than 800 advisory firms in the US have signed up to a protocol designed to facilitate the orderly transfer of advisers between groups and reduce litigation, which is now largely restricted to cases of “raiding”, when one group poaches the bulk of advisers in someone else’s office.Mr Helck would love to see a similar protocol adopted in the UK, and in September such a move was discussed at a meeting of the 120-member strong Tax Incentivised Savings Association. He sees this as an urgent task, given the wave of takeovers likely to ensue from the reshaping of the UK industry by the RDR.“Our case cost Towry £2.3m. That’s for a relatively small portion of business,” he says.Although Wall Street-listed Raymond James Financial is also involved in investment and commercial banking and asset management, Mr Helck’s global private client group is the dominant division, accounting for 63.5 per cent of the company’s $2.8bn of revenues in the nine months to June 30 and 46.1 per cent of its $347m of pre-tax income.Nevertheless, the fact that Raymond James does manufacture its own investment products creates a potential conflict of interest for its advisers.Mr Helck says there are no conflicts in practice, with in-house products not promoted unduly. “They have to earn their entry into clients’ portfolios if they can,” he says, pointing out that proprietary mutual funds account for less than 5 per cent of the portfolios of US clients.He does, however, believe that the use of in-house funds can sometimes be justified. “If a doctor advising you on an injury recommends surgery and carries out that surgery themselves, most people trust that. It’s possible to abuse that trust, but it’s possible to uphold it,” says Mr Helck.Outside the US these potential conflicts melt away. Although Raymond James has asset management joint ventures in France and Latin America, they are aimed purely at institutional investors, and it has no proprietary products in the UK.Mr Helck is himself not frightened of a challenge. He was recently named chairman of Sifma, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which represents US securities firms, banks and asset managers, where he has set himself a tough task.“The biggest issue the world is facing is a loss of public confidence in financial markets and institutions. My number one objective is to work on regaining public trust and confidence,” he says.……………………………………………………………..Curriculum vitae

1;RJF;Raymond James Financial;2012-11-13T20:13:10Z;RJF throws in the towel on Brazil;;"Anyone who has ever worked in Brazil, set up a company or in fact tried to do anything in the country will feel their pain. Raymond James Financial said on Tuesday that it was shutting down its equity research unit in Brazil because of tax and regulatory hurdles.This from the US-based brokerage/investment bank:After careful consideration, Raymond James is closing its affiliated Brazilian equity research operation in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and will likely eliminate a small number of supporting Latin American Institutional Sales and Trading positions in New York / London. The firm has concluded that the costs, structural impediments, and complex legal, tax, and regulatory environments are impeding sufficient return on invested capital. This decision is specific to the Brazilian operation and Raymond James continues to maintain its affiliated operations in Argentina and Uruguay, in addition to its global operations in the US, Canada, and Europe. We are deeply grateful for the outstanding work accomplished by our associates.The fact that they have decided it is easier to operate in Argentina than in Brazil is particularly telling.Companies in Brazil frequently complain about the so-called “Brazil cost” – a combination of infrastructure problems, high taxes and red tape – and it’s no surprise.There are now almost 90 different taxes in Brazil, which are changed on a frequent basis and often vary from one town to the next. According to the World Bank, it takes a company in Brazil 2,600 hours a year on average to fill in tax returns.However, it’s not just taxes. Even things that should be simple just aren’t.For example, when the founders of Dafiti, Brazil’s answer to Asos or Zappos, set up the company almost two years ago, one of their first problems was getting the shape of their tables right.After buying standard desks for the whole office at a local furniture store, they were informed by health and safety regulators that the edges were not sufficiently round enough and forced to get rid of them. Equally ridiculous stories are not hard to find.In the case of Raymond James, though, problems in Brazil’s equity market are also likely to have played a role. After all, every company has to deal with tax and regulatory issues in Brazil but very few decide to exit the country altogether.Brazil’s recent economic slowdown, the country’s relatively high interest rates and government intervention in key companies have prompted a mass exodus from the stock market. And fewer investors means fewer people reading research reports.According to Bloomberg, foreign money managers sold a net $2.6bn of equities in the São Paulo exchange over the past two months, the biggest outflow since Lehman Brothers’s collapse in 2008.Related reading:

2;RJF;Raymond James Financial;2012-06-03T03:41:11Z;Sensible to break the ties that bind;Restrictive covenants that prevent moving money should be banned;"The financial services industry sometimes forgets the “services” part of its description. There should be a sign up in every office reminding people they are there to serve their customers, and nobody owes them a living. The money they look after belongs to the client. And the client does not belong to anyone, much though some advisory firms might like to think otherwise.The concept of client “ownership” was under discussion in the UK last week, with suggestions the UK should introduce a type of agreement that has worked well in the US and prevented expensive legal arguments when advisers switch firms and their clients follow.The very idea that clients may be prevented from moving their money to follow an adviser when he or she changes firms is bizarre. But it is alive and well in some advisory firms.A survey by Faegre Baker Daniels, a law firm, shows widespread use of restrictive covenants in the UK financial services sector, particularly of the non-solicitation type (used by 63 per cent of respondents). Also in use, though, are non-dealing covenants, which seek to prevent clients moving with an adviser who changes firms. Nearly half (46.5 per cent) of respondents reported using such covenants.The firm best known for using non-dealing covenants is Towry, which lost a court case against Raymond James and seven former Edward Jones advisers in February. Edward Jones was taken over by Towry, but a number of advisers resigned while still under the terms of the Edward Jones non-solicitation covenant, including the seven who joined Raymond James. Nearly 400 of the 50,000 customers that Towry took over followed the seven to Raymond James.Towry alleged the customers were solicited and wanted £6m in damages. The judge found no evidence of solicitation and dismissed the case.The case did not test whether non-dealing restrictive covenants could be enforced, but this is a question that deserves consideration.Advisers like Towry argue that their clients benefit from the whole package – brand, infrastructure and team; the individual adviser’s contribution is a relatively minor one. That may be true, and if clients do not have strong relationships with particular advisers, there is unlikely to be an issue when an adviser leaves.But the likelihood of further consolidation in the UK IFA market means disputes of the type seen in the Raymond James case could become increasingly common. Firms look to buy an income stream from renewal commission or asset-based advice fees when they take over books of business. If that business can easily walk out the door, there are implications for the valuation of an IFA firm.The risk is greater when the type of service offered by the business for sale is materially different from that of the buyer.It is easy to see why advisory businesses see non-dealing covenants as essential protection.But they are a travesty: how can clients be bound by contracts they have not signed or even been made aware of?Peter Moores, chief executive of Raymond James (part of a US group) says his firm does not impose any restrictive covenants on advisers. He is an advocate for adoption of a protocol introduced in the US in 2004 and since adopted by 826 advisory firms there.The move away from restrictive covenants in the US began when the regulator for the sector issued a notice in 2002 saying firms could not take legal action to prevent a client moving with their adviser to a new firm. Such action was “inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade”, it said.Firms continued to sue each other over solicitation issues, and in 2004, three of the biggest (Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch and UBS) came up with the Broker Recruitment Protocol. Mike Alford, deputy general counsel for Raymond James Financial, based in Florida, says the protocol “sets forth a blueprint for the orderly transition of registered advisers from one member firm to another”.The UK regulator has not so far got involved in the issue of restrictive covenants. But according to the Financial Services Authority’s Treating Customers Fairly rules, consumers should “not face unreasonable post-sale barriers imposed by firms” when they want to change product or switch provider.The question is whether a non-dealing covenant constitutes an unreasonable barrier. The US regulator clearly thinks it does. And there is an appetite for change among advisers: most of the attendees at the Tax Incentivised Savings Association event where the protocol was discussed last week believed it could work in the UK. If advisers make any claim to be on the side of the customer, they must abandon restrictive covenants.pauline.skypala@ft.com"
3;RJF;Raymond James Financial;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Greek worries weigh on Wall Street;Disappointing earnings stall rally;Shares in Lazard fell 4.2 per cent to $27.65 after the largest independent US merger adviser posted fourth-quarter earnings per share of just 1 cent.That was a further sign that the slowdown in capital markets is hitting investment banking bottom lines.With January numbers available, analysts are struggling to pick winners and losers from the shake-out that saw the value of announced M&A deals fall by a third from December to January.Data from Goldman Sachs suggests smaller firms have been taking market share.Stifel Nicolaus, Raymond James and Greenhill & Co all saw healthy year-on-year growth in the value of completed M&A deals in January, while large-caps Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley all saw January deal value fall at least 60 per cent compared with 2011.But that is yet to show up in share price performance. Stifel is up 19.3 per cent to $38.25, and Raymond James has gained 14.8 per cent to $35.54 so far this year, but only Greenhill, whose shares have surged 33 per cent to $48.40, is matching the 25 per cent plus returns of BofA, Citi, Morgan Stanley and Goldman.Although banks have been among the leaders in the US equity rally so far this year, other stocks linked directly to capital markets have underperformed. Exchanges are lagging the S&P 500 by 5.5 per cent while trust banks have underperformed by 4.2 per cent.On Monday, Craig Siegenthaler at Credit Suisse also warned clients not to be tempted by shares in asset managers, as the strong equity market rally has not been matched by significant mutual fund inflows.“We see valuations remaining at depressed levels due to continued weak long-term flows in 2012,” he told clients.Money managers Franklin Resources and Federated Investors were both off 0.2 per cent to $116.22 and $18.65, respectively.Elsewhere, US stocks opened sharply lower, following the lead of global indices, which had sold off as a breakdown in negotiations once again raised fears of a Greek default.But, not for the first time this year, US stocks rallied once European markets closed, and the S&P 500 closed off just 0.04 per cent at 1,344.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,845.2, and the blue-chip heavy index remains close to its three-year high hit Friday.While Greece dominated headlines, disappointing earnings continued to weigh on individual stocks.Food wholesaler Sysco fell 3.6 per cent to $29.79. Quarterly profits fell slightly as the company absorbed food cost inflation of 6.3 per cent, almost 2 percentage points higher than in the year-ago period.Humana fell 5.4 per cent to $85.25 after the company, which provides healthcare to seniors under the government’s Medicare scheme, disappointed analysts with its earnings guidance for 2012.With the majority of S&P 500 fourth-quarter results reported, negative guidance for the current quarter has outpaced positive guidance two to one.That has raised concern among analysts for the sustainability of the rally, which has seen the S&P 500 climb 6.9 per cent this year.“Some improvement from the macroeconomic or earnings outlook will be needed to support a continued rally in equities,” Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital, told clients.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch surged 8.1 per cent to $43.78. But despite the temporary lull in selling pressure, the clothing retailer, which saw a year on year fall in holiday same store sales, remains the weakest performer in the S&P 500’s current bull run. Shares are down 26 per cent since October 3.Pharmacy benefits manager Medco Health Solutions fell 6.3 per cent to $59.62 on reports the company’s acquisition by rival Express Scripts may be blocked. Express Scripts shares also fell 4 per cent to $50.00.Social media stocks, which enjoyed a two-day Facebook filing-fuelled surge on Thursday and Friday, gave back some of their gains.Offers website Groupon fell 3.8 per cent to $23.51 and professional networking website LinkedIn fell 0.2 per cent to $79.76.Zynga, whose online games accounted for 12 per cent of Facebook revenue in 2011, fell 4.6 per cent to $12.77. The stock remains 35 per cent up for the year after a 33 per cent surge last week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index remained at levels not seen since the dotcom bubble 11 years ago, despite slipping 0.1 per cent to 2,901.99.
4;RJF;Raymond James Financial;2012-01-11T23:09:06Z;Raymond James to buy Morgan Keegan;;Regions Financial will sell Morgan Keegan, its brokerage business, to Raymond James for $930m, ending a protracted sale process that began last summer but faltered amid market turbulence caused by the European sovereign debt crisis.Alabama-based Regions said on Wednesday that Morgan Keegan would also pay its parent a dividend of $250m before the deal closed, lifting the total consideration to $1.18bn.It added the disposal would improve capital ratios, generate additional liquidity and strengthen focus on its core banking business. Regions and Raymond James, which will have more than 6,000 financial advisers following the deal’s close, will maintain a partnership and referral agreement after the sale.When Regions first said it would explore a sale of the business last June, people familiar with the matter said that Morgan Keegan could fetch about $1.5bn. The business, which makes about half its $1.1bn revenues in retail brokerage, has more than 1,000 financial advisers and offices in 20 states.The unit was expected to go to a private equity buyer, people familiar with the process had previously said, after strategic buyers were sidelined. Morgan Keegan’s management team was reluctant to be sold to another bank, they added.However, discussions with two groups of buy-out funds ran aground last autumn, as markets gyrated on concerns about the eurozone. On-off negotiations have since continued with Raymond James, and rival bidder Stifel Financial.Regions shares dropped about 1 per cent in after-market trading following the deal’s announcement, to $4.75. Goldman Sachs advised Regions on the sale, while JPMorgan worked with Raymond James.Analysts at Barclays Capital noted that the deal is expected to only increase Regions’ Tier 1 common capital ratio by 9 basis points. The bank remains among the lowest on that measure among its peers, Barclays added.Regions has yet to repay the US Treasury’s $3.5bn crisis-time investment in the bank through the Troubled Asset Relief Programme.Regions will record a charge of $575m to $745m in its results for the fourth quarter of last year on goodwill held in its investment banking, brokerage and trust segment. The bank now expects to record a net loss for the quarter of between $432m to $633m, or $0.34 to $0.50 per share.Analysts had previously thought that Regions would make a small profit in the quarter, which the bank confirmed it was on track to do before the impairment charge on Wednesday.John Carson, Morgan Keegan’s chief executive, will join Raymond James as president and will oversee fixed income and public finance.
5;RJF;Raymond James Financial;2011-08-30T13:18:12Z;Rapid Addition wins US broker deal;;Rapid Addition, a UK trading technology company, has signed its largest US contract to date in a deal to supply Raymond James, one of the largest independent US broker-dealers, with software to monitor trading.The US group will use it to report over-the-counter secondary market transactions in credit markets to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra), the US regulator.It marks another major contract for the UK group after it secured a deal in July to provide technology to Johnson Investment Counsel, a US-based wealth management firm. Last year it also won a mandate to provide part of the technology for Mercado Intergado Latino Americano (Mila), the new Latin American bourse.“We have certainly solidified our expansion into the American marketplace and are committed to building our business wherever the demand takes us,” said Toby Corballis, chief executive at Rapid Addition.The deal also reflects how the US financial services industry has had to adjust to tough new regulations concerning the monitoring of futures and swaps trades. A greater burden of responsibility being pushed on to the industry and many have been unprepared.The first of dozens of new derivatives regulations required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, the anti-fraud provisions broadened the rules to include swaps and made it easier for the commission to win cases by allowing it to punish attempted frauds and reckless behaviour, in addition to wilful, successful price manipulation. Banks, interdealer brokers and retail brokers have been targeted as they are seen as the gateway to order flow.
6;RJF;Raymond James Financial;2011-05-03T09:20:26Z;Nasdaq and ICE to go hostile on NYSE bid;;Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange have confirmed they plan to make a hostile bid for NYSE Euronext, as the pair attempts to derail the US exchange’s agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.Nasdaq and ICE said on Monday that they intended to launch an offer for the exchange this month, and that the two boards had approved a plan to take its $11bn cash-and-stock break-up bid directly to NYSE shareholders.In April, the exchanges proposed to split the NYSE’s equities and futures businesses, just weeks after NYSE Euronext had agreed an all-stock merger with Deutsche Börse. NYSE’s board has twice rejected the rival proposal, which offers a higher price than the Deutsche Börse bid, calling it an “empty vessel”.Nasdaq and ICE are offering $14.24 in cash, 0.4069 shares of Nasdaq OMX common stock and 0.1436 shares of ICE common stock for each share in NYSE Euronext.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, said: “The NYSE Euronext board has continually challenged the seriousness of our proposal and refused to engage us in discussion despite the positive feedback we have received from their stockholders.”The US bourse on Monday noted that the Nasdaq-ICE’s offer would be launched on the same terms as previously proposed, adding that these had been “unanimously rejected” by its board.People close to the NYSE camp played down the significance of their rivals’ move, arguing that shareholders were already aware of the choice they faced in considering the two proposals ahead of a July vote on the Deutsche Börse deal.As a publicly listed exchange, the NYSE has certain limits on ownership and voting rights, which could make it difficult for Nasdaq and ICE to close a hostile offer, the people added.One party cannot own more than 20 per cent of the exchange, or have more than 10 per cent of the outstanding votes. As the limits must be waived by the board, they impose a condition on Nasdaq/ICE’s exchange offer, effectively functioning as a type of poison pill.Analysts at Raymond James noted this and other conditions to the Nasdaq/ICE offer. “We believe the laundry list of conditions attached to the offer virtually guarantee that it will never be executed,” they wrote.Once Nasdaq and ICE start their offer, the NYSE board will be legally obliged to respond, perhaps offering in more detail its reasons for rejecting the counterbid.Launching the offer could also mean Nasdaq and ICE will have to disclose more information about their bid.The pair have not yet made public the details of their financing commitments.People familiar with Nasdaq’s thinking said the formal launch of the offer would take some time to execute, perhaps a week or two.Yet, the company wanted to make clear its intentions ahead of a deadline this week that will determine who can vote in July on the Deutsche Börse deal.
7;RJF;Raymond James Financial;2011-01-20T23:11:21Z;US brokerages rebound on equity rally;;US brokerages on Thursday unveiled further evidence of a rebound after the “flash crash” and fears of a double-dip recession caused an exodus of investors from US markets last year.Volumes dropped in 2010 after the the May 6 flash crash, when the S&P 500 index fell 6 per cent in 20 minutes before rebounding, sparking inquiries by lawmakers into the stability of the US market structure.However, a surge in US stock prices in the most recent quarter, which has begun to draw traders back to the market, has benefited the brokers, some of which reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.At Knight Capital, the largest US electronic trading group, revenues increased 8 per cent from the third quarter to $259m, although they were still down 14.5 per cent from a year ago. The strongest growth in the quarter was in trading revenues, which rose 21 per cent.Raymond James, the US investment bank, also reported an uptick in capital markets activity, led by mergers and acquisitions and retail customer trading. Investment banking revenue added 12 per cent quarter-over-quarter, to $59m, while trading commissions were up 7 per cent, to $534m.Income from private clients, or individual traders, was up 5 per cent in the quarter as retail traders took more aggressive bets and used higher margin, said Douglas Sipkin, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities. Overall net income was up 18 per cent quarter-over-quarter, to $81.7m.Meanwhile, Knight’s trading volumes outpaced the broader market’s, as its platforms increasingly attracted investors who use trading algorithms rather than going directly to exchanges.In the fourth quarter, Knight’s average daily dollar volume of trading increased 4.9 per cent over the third quarter, versus a 4.6 per cent decline in average daily volume for the broader US market, according to figures from Sandler O’Neill.Knight’s aggressive expansion earlier in the financial crisis continued to hurt results, however, following the trading slowdown. Knight’s net income fell 79 per cent year-over-year to $9.23m in the fourth quarter, for earnings of 10 cents per share, below consensus of 20 cents, as compensation costs exceeded estimates.Interactive Brokers Group, a market maker and electronic brokerage, reported after the market close a decline in earnings before income taxes in quarter versus a year ago, from $52.2m to $41.9m, as its market making group struggled to compete with high-frequency traders. However, its brokerage business saw quarterly commissions 10 per cent year-over-year, as trading volumes increased 5 per cent.Knight’s shares were up 7.7 per cent on Thursday, to $14.24, while Raymond James shares added 5.2 per cent to $35.34.Keefe Bruyette & Woods’s Capital Markets index, comprised of US brokerage and trading groups, is up 21.1 per cent over the past six months, while the S&P 500 index is up 17.7 per cent.
8;RJF;Raymond James Financial;2010-06-28T13:41:48Z;Deals, or no deals?;;"The chaotic conditions in global markets the past two years resulted in a sharp decline in merger and acquisition activity. The return of growth in most major economies should result in sufficient stability to propel a return to a more robust deal making environment.But could the recent increase in government supervision of most major economies thwart future deal making? Or will anemic growth and cheap money prove more important in setting the pace.Frederick C. Lane, Vice Chairman, Investment Banking at Raymond James Financial, says clarity of regulation will help M&A grow. Send Frederick your questions on the current outlook for mergers large and small to ask@ft.com, or via the form below. His answers to a selection of the best readers’ questions will be published here shortly.………………………………………………………………………………………………..Morgan Stanley says Russia is the new top tip for investment, replacing China. What do you think about the conditions for exposure to M&A there? Isn’t Russian politics still bit too “dangerous” to deal with?
Benedict Anderson, LondonFred Lane: There’s no question investors have a keen but cautious interest in investing in Russia.Given its natural resources and increasingly Western outlook, Russia is a tempting place for asset allocation. However, Russia has, from an investor’s perspective, the least transparency among the four BRIC countries.If and when it becomes a more cooperative member of the group of global powers, it will have intriguing investment potential.That said, Raymond James already has corporate clients entering the Russian market. In advising our corporate clients about M&A opportunities in Russia, we urge them to structure deals which protect their interests through creating functional and technological co-dependencies.…………………………………………………………………………………………….What is your view onthe UK proposal to raise shareholder approval threshold for deals from 50 per cent to two-thirds?
Andrew Cowell, DerbyFL: A two-thirds shareholder vote requirement generally serves to strengthen shareholder rights in approving mergers or other corporate reorganizations.Ironically, a two-thirds vote can thwart activist investors’ efforts.Several years ago, I advised an activist group in their efforts to gain control of the board of a woefully mismanaged multibillion dollar media company.The impressive 49 per cent of the vote we received in support of our dissident slate fell painfully short of 50 per cent. A two-thirds hurdle would have made our efforts an impossible challenge. (The happy post script to this story: the incumbent directors “listened” and the company was sold 5 months later.)…………………………………………………………………………………..What do you think the effect of more regulation to protect domestic companies will be overall? How far have things changed from the once-established consensus that protectionism is bad?
Helen Scott, LondonFL: Turbulent economic times such as these are fertile ground for protectionist legislation.In most cases, these regulations and the associated economic stimulus, while potentially saving jobs in the short term, may serve to postpone the inevitable and necessary trauma of change and adaptation.No country can provide long-term support for non-competitive industries or inefficient business practices. As unpleasant as it may be, these companies will eventually face the unavoidable task of adapting in order to compete or accepting the adverse consequences of not doing so.……………………………………………………………………………You say clarity of regulation will help M&A levels recover - do you think there will be a form of regulatory arbitrage making deal-making in one region easier than in others, and if so, where are the best places to do deals?
Mark Hughes, YorkshireFL:Clarity of government regulation is a positive factor for merger and acquisition activity (as well as stock prices).Raymond James’ Healthcare Banking practice has seen a significant upswing in activity in the last quarter as the impacts of the just enacted US Healthcare Reform bill can now be evaluated.Similarly, we have been advising on potential mergers involving several clients whose businesses are affected by provisions of the Financial Reform bill. Increasing clarity on the various provisions should enable us to reach agreement on merger terms.…………………………………………………………………………..How big an impact do currency movements have in international deal-making - is it the most important factor? If so, do you think ripples caused by the European sovereign debt crisis will make transatlantic mergers more common when confidence returns?
Alain Beau, BrusselsFL: Currency stability is an important factor in evaluating M & A transactions.Three other related factors that are critical to currency stability are conservative fiscal policies, political stability; and the level of regulatory burden around doing business.In our M&A advisory work, we are often told by U.K. and European companies how much they value the US’ for our political and currency stability; our strong work ethic, and productivity; and relatively low cost nature of our work force.…………………………………………………………………………….Do you think there will come a time when Chinese companies start seeking out targets in the West? Will that test the free market ideology of the US to breaking point?
Richard Hamilton, Sussex, UKFL: We have already seen and will continue to see Chinese corporations acquiring US companies – think Lenovo’s acquistion of IBM’s PC business – Chinese acquisition activity outside of China will focus on sectors where the chinese cannot build it: natural resources, technology, distribution, etc.Alibaba’s acquisition of California based Vendio last week is representative of this buy-versus-build trade off. Vendio immediately provides Alibaba an online distribution platform to serve small businesses seeking to sell through Amazon, eBay, and others, strengthening Alibaba’s leadership position in China.…………………………………………………………………………..Which sectors do you think are ripe for consolidation? In the UK it looks like there will be more dealmaking in the insurance sector, what are your top picks for potential activity elsewhere?
Jonathan Stevens, LondonFL: In the UK, as in the US, the sectors most ripe for consolidation are ones where change, especially disruptive and chaotic change, forces consolidation responsive to overcapacity, unanticipated capital requirements, and technology disruption (think newspapers, music, TV).At Raymond James, our Financial Institutions Group, our Real Estate group, our Technology Group, and of course our Restructuring Group are all experiencing significant upswings in M&A activity due to the challenging economic conditions.Consistently the drivers of strategic M&A activity are industrial logic (compelling strategic rationale as opposed to diversification for its own sake), and relative cost of capital. At present, the large global corporations have unprecedented levels of liquidity, low levels of debt, and ample availability of debt capital. Strategic M&A activity will continue to cut across many sectors as these large corporations bolster their revenue growth through complementary acquisitions.………………………………………………………………………How can the design of M&A deals be improved with the purpose to help all the involved buyers and sellers to capture value from M&A transaction in time of economic downturn?

Ledenyov, UkraineFL: Your question brings to mind the adage, “Deals only get done at the level of buyer’s and seller’s mutual discomfort.”In a steep and prolonged economic downturn, there are many distressed deals where creditors’ demands drive the deal more than the interests of shareholders or management. The dynamic in distressed M&A is all about getting the best price for the asset now.Even in difficult economic conditions, however, most M&A transactions are based upon the same fundamentals as in better times. The buyers see sufficient inherent value to pay a price to satisfy seller’s needs and motivations, which might include, beyond price, some continuing ownership (think stock for stock deals); continuing employment; the satisfaction of seeing the company grow more quickly, and be in trusted hands.M&A deals are not only about getting the top price. At the margin, qualitative factors are important too.What are the possible hidden problems connected with initial valuation of M&A transaction in conditions of weak capital markets?
Viktor O. Ledenyov, UkraineFL: In a weak economy, the financial projections underlying the valuation expectations of buyer and seller can be difficult to reconcile. This poses a special problem where the availability of substantial debt financing is critical to achieving price.Initial valuation expectations can be dashed if there is a contraction in credit markets. The paucity of large going private transactions by large private equity firms is in part the result of lack of debt to finance these deals.We have been advising a potential buyer in a several billion dollar acquisition where the seller’s lofty price expectations were predicated upon a staple-on debt financing commitment from seller’s bankers. The recent retreat in credit markets resulted in the withdrawal of that commitment, reducing the likely achievable valuation._______________________________________________"
9;RJF;Raymond James Financial;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

Shares in Wachovia fell 0.7 per cent to $54.19, while AG Edwards jumped 14.3 per cent to $88.16. The deal will make Wachovia the second largest US retail brokerage after Merrill Lynch. Shares in Raymond James, a regional brokerage, surged 7.3 per cent to $33.31.In after-hours trade on Thursday, shares of Dell jumped 6.2 per cent to $28.58 after a rise of 2.6 per cent to $26.91 in regular trade. The computer maker announced a 10 per cent cut in its workforce after its first quarter earnings fell slightly from a year ago.On Thursday, the benchmark indices recorded their third straight monthly rise, but blue chips lapsed into negative territory on the day. The S&P 500 barely made a new record close as some investors consolidated recent gains. Investors were also mindful of the May employment report, inflation and manufacturing data due on Friday. Analysts cautioned the market could face pressure if employers failed to create at least 100,000 jobs in May, or if inflation did not moderate as expected.In contrast, solid data could boost the current sense among some investors that the economy is entering summer on an upswing.“People are saying, how can you keep stocks down when the economy is doing better than expected?” asked Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. He said investors had taken heart from the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes from May, released on Wednesday, as it appeared policy makers believed economic growth would hold up.The S&P closed 0.03 per cent higher at a new record close of 1,530.62. The benchmark nudged above Wednesday’s historic mark of 1,530.23, that finally eclipsed its previous March 2000 closing high. The June S&P futures contract settled at 1,533.30, after it had set a new lifetime high of 1,537.70 earlier on Thursday.Within the S&P, industrials and materials were the leading industry groups, while energy and financials loitered in negative territory. Wednesday’s record close for the S&P came after a gap of more than seven years. The industry groups that have driven the rebound from its nadir of 776.76 in October 2002 have been energy and materials.“On an aggregate basis, the full market recovery has officially arrived, with 75 per cent of the issues trading higher now than where they were in March 2000,” said David Blitzer, managing director at Standard & Poor’s.Technology stocks were off their highs for the day, but closed in positive territory with semiconductor stocks rising 1.5 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to close at 2,604.47, and set a fresh six-year closing high.Dendreon, jumped 26.9 per cent to $8.55, after regulators approved its experimental prostate vaccine.Blue chips turned lower after they initially built on their record close from Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.04 per cent lower at 13,627.64, after setting a record intra-day high of 13,673.07. United Technologies, up 1.6 per cent at $70.55, led Dow stocks.Citigroup fell 1.3 per cent at $54.49 after Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who holds 4 per cent of the stock, gave a ”vote of confidence” to Chuck Prince, chief executive, and said the company should be given ”some time to perform”. The comments, in an interview with Institutional Investor magazine, contrast with his criticism last year of Citigroup’s rising costs. Citigroup’s shares rose sharply last month after the disclosure that Eddie Lampert’s hedge fund had built a 0.3 per cent stake prompting speculation that he might press for a shake-up.Citi set a 52-week high of $57 late last year, and is 2.2 per cent lower so far in 2007. The bank is one of only five stocks in the Dow that are negative performers to date this year.In other deal news, Morgan Stanley announced it was buying Investa Property Group, the Australia-based real estate investment trust, for $3.9bn. Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $85.04.Ceridian, an information services company, agreed to a private equity deal worth $5.3bn and its shares rose 3.45 per cent at $35.37.Google slipped 0.1 per cent to $497.91, and off a high of $508.78, after it released details about its new Gears technology that will enable people to browse internet services, including e-mail, either online, offline or intermittently connected to a network.Shares in Adobe rose 1.9 per cent to $44.06 on news the software designer will incorporate Google’s new gears.In earnings news, Ciena recorded its third straight quarterly profit and raised its sales forecast. Shares in the network equipment maker jumped 17.2 per cent to $34.32 and boosted other telecoms stocks. JDS Uniphase rose 3.6 per cent to $13.09. Sears Holdings fell 1.8 per cent to $180.02 after its first-quarter earnings rose 20 per cent, but missed expectations.Novell rose 6.25 per cent to $7.82 after the network software company reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results.HJ Heinz reported an 8 per cent rise in its fourth quarter profit and beat estimates. It shares were a fraction higher at $47.58.Tiffany & Co, the jeweller, rose 0.2 per cent to $52.57, after a 15 per cent rise in its fiscal first-quarter profit, just beating estimates.Motorola lost 0.5 per cent to $18.19, after it said it intended cutting a further 4,000 jobs this year, raising total redundancies to 7,500 in 2007.
11;RJF;Raymond James Financial;2007-05-31T17:51:21Z;Wachovia to buy AG Edwards for $6.8bn;;Wachovia, the fourth largest US bank, on Thursday continued its push to become a dominant retail financial services provider by agreeing to pay $6.8bn for regional brokerage firm AG Edwards.The deal will give Wachovia nearly 15,000 financial advisers and $1,100bn in client assets, making it the second largest US broker after Merrill Lynch.For Wachovia, the deal provides an opportunity to sell higher-margin banking products to a larger number of affluent brokerage clients. For AG Edwards, which has long been courted by bigger banks, the sale reflects the growing reality that fixed costs in the regional brokerage industry are too high - and profit margins too slim - to remain independent.AG Edwards and other independent brokers have also seen many top financial advisors leave for higher paying banks such as Morgan Stanley and Citigroup.As part of the deal, the combined brokerage company will be based in AG Edwards’ home of St Louis, rather than in North Carolina, where Wachovia is based.The AG Edwards sale could herald a number of other regional brokerage transactions. Florida-based Raymond James, which has 4,600 financial advisors, is considered the second most attractive target after AG Edwards. Raymond James shares soared 9 per cent to $33.88 in midday trade.“The industry is ripe for further consolidations,” said Mike Poulos, head of North American retail banking at consultancy Oliver Wyman. “Scale has become very important. And Wachovia now will be able to migrate customers from traditional brokerage products into structured investments and other higher margin products.”Under terms of the deal, Wachovia will offer 0.9844 shares of Wachovia stock and $35.80 in cash for each AG Edwards share for a total of $89.50 per share based on Wednesday’s closing prices. The deal offers AG Edwards shareholders a 16 per cent premium and represents a multiple of about 21 times AG Edwards’ expected 2007 earnings.Wachovia said it expected the deal to add to earnings in the first year after closing and to create $395m in annual after tax cost savings by 2009.Credit Suisse and Wachovia Securities advised Wachovia. Goldman Sachs advised AG Edwards.The deal followed direct negotiations between AG Edwards and Wachovia and was not the result of an auction. However, analysts said the friendly nature of the transaction and fairly rich valuation meant other bidders were not likely to emerge.Wachovia shares dropped less than 1 per cent to $54.21 in midday New York, indicating that investors were not concerned about integration risk. Wachovia has purchased six brokers since since 1998, including a joint venture with Prudential in 2003. Prudential owns 38 per cent of Wachovia Securities.Wachovia is also integrating its $26bn purchase last year of Golden West, the California mortgage lender.
