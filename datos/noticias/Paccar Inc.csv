0;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2014-07-03T17:11:50Z;Utility stocks cool with temperatures;;Energy utility company stocks cooled along with US midwest and east coast weather forecasts, with natural gas prices trading near their three-month lows.The price of gas fell to $4.36 midweek from a spike to a high of $6.15 in February following the severe winter weather patterns. In the past three days, the price had fallen sharply from $4.60, said Travis Miller, a Morningstar analyst.The drop was the consequence of cooler than expected weather forecasts, and demand for power to run air conditioners and fans fell.“This is the biggest drop since February after the polar vortex,” Mr Miller said. “Utilities had a big run in gas prices after the polar vortex. It had a big spike and a big drop.”It was not unusual to see investors rotating their funds from utilities into more growth-oriented sectors, particularly in a rallying market, he noted.The fallers in the S&P 500 were led by Public Service Enterprise Group, the New Jersey-based utility company, down 3 per cent to $38.16.The Tampa-based TECO Energy fell 2 per cent to 17.71. New Orleans-based Entergy fell 2 per cent to $76.97, and North Carolina’s Duke Energy fell 1 per cent to $71.39. Chicago-based Exelon fell 2 per cent to $33.97.By contrast, the S&P 500 gainers were led by Petsmart, the US’s largest retailer of pet items, rising 13 per cent to $67.28 after hedge fund Jana Partners expressed interest in buying the company.Jana Partners on Thursday disclosed a 9.9 per cent stake in Petsmart and pushed management to examine options for the company.Jana, run by Barry Rosenstein, amassed its stake after a difficult first quarter for Petsmart in which sales missed expectations.Shares in the company have fallen roughly 12 per cent over the past year.A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made clear that, with its almost 10 per cent stake, Jana expected Petsmart to look at options including a sale, better operating performance and a return of capital to investors.Shares in tobacco groups Lorillard and Reynolds American jumped on merger speculation, after a CNBC report that the two were nearing a deal, following on rumours of talks earlier this year.Shares in Lorillard, maker of Newport and other brands, jumped 5 per cent to $64.41. Shares in Reynolds, maker of Camel, Pall Mall, Winston and others, rose 2 per cent to $61.56.Shares in truck manufacturer Paccar added 5 per cent to $67.25 after Volkswagen denied claims it was interested in making a bid for the company.Speculation of a potential bid for Paccar surfaced late on Wednesday after analysts at Sanford Bernstein said that the head of Daimler’s truck division had told investors that Volkswagen was eyeing a bid for the US truckmaker.Washington-based Paccar had been seen as offering the potential for VW to gain a foothold in the North American market where it lacks a presence.Volkswagen has been trying to integrate its truck operations more closely as it says that could help it achieve extra synergies of at least €650m annually within the next 10 to 15 years.That will help it boost its challenge to rivals Daimler and Volvo. VW’s truck assets comprise Scania, MAN and VW commercial vehicles.Christine Ritz, a VW spokeswoman, denied the reports to media outlets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to breach the 17,000 level for the first time, reaching 17,068.26 by close, buoyed by a much stronger than expected employment report.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,985.44 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 4,485.92.
1;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2013-03-05T18:27:24Z;America’s truckmakers run into soft patch;;On Van Brunt Street in Brooklyn, by New York Harbour, it is easy to appreciate the role of trucks as the lifeblood of the US economy.When a ship calls at Red Hook container terminal, waiting trucks line up along the street ready to decant the contents, their radiator grilles proclaiming them “International” or “Freightliner” products. Trucks roll to and from warehouses in neighbouring streets, some belonging to YRC and Old Dominion – two of the US’s biggest truck operators.While the lifeblood continues to pump through Red Hook’s streets, the flow seems to have slowed sharply at the end of last year. John Wiehoff, chief executive of CH Robinson, a significant operator, last month told investors on its fourth-quarter conference call that December had finished “very poorly” and the beginning of January was “very weak” both in volumes and profit margins.Sandy Cutler, chief executive of Eaton Corporation, the diversified industrial group, says the trucking weakness reflects consumers’ concerns over the potential impact of fiscal cliff tax rises and spending cuts.The question for trucking companies and truckmakers is how long-lasting the downturn will be and how severe its effects.North American truck production fell 23 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter of last year, according to Eaton. Daimler Trucks North America, the North American truck arm of Germany’s Daimler, which makes Freightliner trucks, announced on January 30 it might lay off 1,300 workers because of the downturn.“Consumers are starting to really come to grips with what this tough economy and wage situation mean,” Mr Cutler says.The long-term picture remains far from clear. Martin Daum, chief executive of Daimler Trucks North America, says that in October he was confident the North American market for large trucks would grow further in 2013 after 2012’s 13.6 per cent year-on-year figure. But by late January he was sure 2013 would be 10 per cent down on 2012. The market has subsequently recovered slightly.“Ultimately, 2013 will be between minus 10 per cent and plus 10 per cent,” Mr Daum says. “I can’t even tell you which way.”Trucking groups’ year-end results all painted a similarly gloomy picture of demand in December. Mr Wiehoff told investors that many of CH Robinson’s customers appeared to have undertaken unusually long year-end shutdowns, followed by slower-than-normal production ramp-ups in January. Both YRC and Old Dominion Freight Line sounded similarly gloomy about December’s figures.“Our hope is that that was a big part of what we were seeing – just diminished year-end activity that carried over into January,” Mr Wiehoff says.Yet truckmakers mostly remain confident that demand will hold up better than in 2009, when year-on-year demand for trucks fell by 50 per cent.Paccar, maker of the Kenworth and Peterbilt brands, and North America’s second-biggest truckmaker by sales, says it expects overall heavy truck sales in the US and Canada this year to total between 210,000 and 240,000 vehicles, compared with 225,000 in 2012. Robin Easton, Paccar’s treasurer, says that is around the level required to replace trucks at the end of their life.Several manufacturers are optimistic that the record average age of the North American truck fleet – about eight years – means many customers have no choice but to replace them with ones that consume less fuel and meet new, higher environmental standards.“In this economic environment, our customers are willing and capable of replacing their fleets,” Mr Easton says. “It’s just that at this particular time there are not that many that are willing to grow their fleet.”Navistar International, maker of International brand trucks, saw its share of the US heavy truck market fall from 18 per cent in the year to the end of October from 28 per cent in the same period of 2011, partly because of its initial failure to produce an engine that met the latest US environmental requirements.Mr Daum predicts that this replacement trend will lead to a growing divide between small operators – who run many of the trucks in Red Hook – and larger, better-financed ones.Daimler’s latest trucks, Mr Daum points out, consumed 14 per cent less fuel than their equivalents as recently as 2009.Many small operators, their margins squeezed because they use older, less fuel-efficient trucks, struggle to raise the finance to buy newer vehicles.That gives large, well-financed operators like Old Dominion or YRC that run modern fleets “a huge operational cost advantage”, Mr Daum says. The advantage affects businesses’ most basic running costs.“I’m not talking [just] maintenance and reliability costs,” Mr Daum says of the advantages. “I mean hard cash fuel running through that engine.”
2;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2012-10-17T16:05:01Z;The lure of antisocial behaviour;Despite the push for companies to use social media, some businesses are thriving by avoiding it, writes Rhymer Rigby;"“There are tons of organisations that shouldn’t be on Twitter,” says Seth Godin, the marketing expert and author. “At one end you have the independent author, singer or craftsman who can’t do what they do and tweet all the time – and at the other you have some institutions which would be better off using a good website.“I couldn’t do what I do I and be on Twitter the whole time – and I couldn’t get somebody else to do it because it would have to be me. That is why I’m not on Twitter or Facebook.”For all the excitement about social media, it is still possible to find companies that do not really do it.A smaller business that gives social media a pass is James Purdey & Sons, the high-end London shotgun makers. It has a website, but no buttons to follow on Twitter and no Facebook page. As the company says: “We’re a near 200-year-old gunmaker and know each and every one of our customers, so the inclination to poke or tweet doesn’t readily present itself.”A much larger organisation that is less social than might be expected is Apple. The company has a Facebook page and its app store has a Twitter account, but a quick search for an official Twitter account brings up little more than a lot of discussion about why Apple doesn’t appear to have an official Twitter account.The company may be unusual as a non-tweeting technology giant, but there are plenty of big companies that avoid social media. According to a 2012 University of Massachusetts Dartmouth study of social media use in the Fortune 500, 93 per cent of Fortune 500 food consumer products businesses had corporate Twitter accounts, while only 44 per cent of motor vehicles and parts companies did.Other businesses, meanwhile, have a social media presence but engage with it only sporadically. San Diego-based Sempra Energy, for example, has produced a mere 85 tweets since September 2009.Unsurprisingly, the companies that embrace social media tend to be those that are customer facing and have long been good at communicating with consumers. Business-to-business organisations that, for instance, make highly specialised parts for power stations, just do not have the same kind of relationship with their customers.Mr Godin points out, businesses may simply not be able to devote resources to make it worthwhile. “You need to ask yourself if there’s a benefit in you participating – what are the benefits and what are your resources?”There are also certain industries where the use of social media is difficult for legal reasons.Kevin Pho, a doctor based in New Hampshire and an influential blogger on healthcare, points to the pharmaceutical industry. “In the US, a lot of drug companies are hesitant to engage in social media because the FDA hasn’t given concrete guidelines. While the majors have some sort of presence, it’s promotional rather than conversational in nature.”Dr Pho adds that the peculiarities of the industry do not help either. “Healthcare has always been hierarchical in nature,” he says. “You do what your doctor says; both physicians and the industry are finding social media difficult to wrap their heads around.”While not engaging fully with all forms of social media has not hampered some companies, managers need to be clear about why they are not doing it.“What you need to do is not embrace social media as a strategy,” says Julien Smith, co-author of the The Impact Equation: Are You Making Things Happen or Just Making Noise? “You might actually have a Twitter account or Facebook page or a Pinterest board, but all it will say is ‘We’re not about this. Here is what we do instead.’ If I was running a gym, for instance, I might have a Facebook page or Twitter account that said, ‘The internet won’t make you fit. Come to our gym.’”Matthew Yeomans, co-founder of Custom Communication, a social media strategy consultancy, and co-author of #Fail: The 50 Greatest Social Media Screw-Ups, agrees. “There are two ways of looking at this. The easy way is that there are times and organisations that don’t need things like Twitter and Facebook. The complex answer is that social media has changed the way everyone communicates – and that even if you don’t use it externally, you might use it internally. It’s really a change of business philosophy.”● Think about social media as a series of channels or publishing platforms. Which ones are right for your company and enable it to reach the right audience – and which ones don’t?● Consider how much effort you will need to put into maintaining your social media presence. Platforms such as Twitter are very time-consuming – and if you are a business that is unable or unwilling to devote the necessary resources to maintain an active presence, it can do more harm than good to the business.● Look at legal and regulatory issues. These can constrain how organisations react to customers and what information they can release publicly.● If you are going to make a decision not to be on some or all forms of social media, try to define why rather than avoiding such channels out of inertia or laziness.Also, be sure to review this decision regularly because social media is fast changing and morphing and may become appropriate for you.● Remember that if your brand or organisation is well known, it will probably be discussed on social media whether you are there or not.He adds that businesses need to ask themselves if “they have anything of value to add to the audience or community they want to talk to? If you are selling electrical widgets, you probably don’t want to be on Pinterest. But to take a real example, in the forest fires of 2007-08, the California fire department bypassed traditional media and went straight to Twitter, which was ideal for what they wanted to communicate.”If you decide that social media is important, he adds, it usually becomes a question of how you use it. “If you think of social media as just a set of channels, which include Facebook and Twitter, they’re effectively major media networks. And there are plenty of brands and companies that don’t need to be on certain networks.”…Mr Godin points to Tina Roth Eisenberg, an influential designer who tweets as @swissmiss. Recently, she tried to talk to Kitchen Aid, the homeware company, via its @KitchenAidUSA Twitter handle about a problem with her freezer. Her nearly 326,000 followers saw a series of tweets such as “It bums me out when a brand I actually like disappoints with horrific customer support. In my case it’s @KitchenAidUSA. #brokenfreezer”.Ms Eisenberg says KitchenAid has not responded. “I’m baffled that a company like this doesn’t seem to care and doesn’t take Twitter seriously as part of the customer support landscape. If you look at their feed, they just seem to pick and choose what they respond to.”Perhaps it is better not to engage in social media if you do it badly. Mr Godin says social media means that conversations about your business will take place whether you are active or not, so “it’s better not to do it than to disappoint”.But, he adds, the pull may be too trendy to resist. “If you look at organisational politics, social media is still very sexy. It’s exciting to have a high-level meeting about Twitter strategy.”"
3;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2012-01-11T21:50:50Z;Paccar joins the Brazil carry trade;;"Another year, another investment in Brazil’s truck industry. Paccar, the US-based truck maker, announced a $200m plant to build its DAF heavy vehicles in Ponta Grossa, in Brazil’s southern Paraná state.Paccar chairman and CEO Mark Pigott was on the scene for the ground-breaking ceremony this week.He said the facility “is designed to assemble the premium quality DAF XF, CF and LF vehicles and the industry-leading PACCAR MX engine. It will produce DAF trucks for Brazil and the entire Latin American market. The DAF trucks will be distributed through a network of independent DAF dealers”.Brazil’s truck industry is one of the world’s most promising. New vehicle registrations of locally made and imported heavy trucks rose 2.2 per cent last year compared with a year earlier and up to 16.9 per cent for semi-heavy and lighter vehicles.But the market, which features all of the major producers from Scania to Ford, MAN, Mercedes-Benz and Iveco, had a tough time in the final stages of last year. New vehicle registrations, locally built and imported, fell 20.8 per cent for heavy trucks in December compared with a year earlier and were lower for most other categories.Local manufacturers too are facing growing competition from imports, although new government regulations to raise taxes on foreign-made vehicles may reverse some of this trend.The industry also faces other headwinds, such as changes in emissions rules, but by the time Paccar’s DAFs hit the assembly line in 2013, things should be looking up. As Credit Suisse puts it:As some of the key risks to the heavy vehicle industry start to ease, namely credit availability and fuel distribution, we could expect the downturn in industry production not to be as aggressive as initially anticipated by some OEMs (20 per cent -30 per cent production decline). For next year, we work with the base-case scenario of a drop in production of about 15 per cent, a 10 per cent decline in sales of trucks, a drop in production of about 10 per cent, and a 5 per cent decline in sales of buses.Related links

4;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2011-10-20T15:04:48Z;Trucks: Skittish US operators begin to buy again;In spite of good reasons to place orders, operators are spooked by the economy, writes Bernard Simon;The economy is heading south. New trucks are in short supply, and so are drivers to operate them. Costs have risen steeply. Could this possibly be a good time for US fleet owners to replace their vehicles?Until recently, the answer for many has been no. The average age of the US heavy truck fleet has lengthened from six years prior to the last recession to 6.7 years now, according to Indiana-based ACT Research, an industry consultancy.“It’s as old as it’s ever been,” says Kenny Vieth, ACT’s president, noting that the average masks the reality that the oldest vehicles on the road are now about 18 months longer in the tooth than they were four years ago.Noel Perry, principal of Transport Fundamentals, a Pennsylvania-based consultancy, explains that “even though the marketplace is pretty good right now, [fleet owners] are still being bombarded by news of how poorly the economy is doing. They’re really gun-shy about expanding.”Nonetheless, some have begun to reconsider. “Everything together just makes it a better time to purchase right now,” says Joe Fiorelli, safety manager at Gulfeagle Supply, a distributor of roofing and building products based in Tampa, Florida, which operates a 300-unit fleet. Gulfeagle recently bought 23 new trucks.One reason for the change of heart is that an ageing fleet creates an array of headaches for truck operators.Older vehicles invariably mean higher maintenance costs. According to Rob Stowers, senior vice-president in the truck division of PHH Arval, a fleet management consultancy, “controlling expenses is the biggest cause of loss of sleep” among PHH customers.Bottlenecks at some critical parts makers have disrupted truckmakers’ production, causing long delivery delays. Paccar, the Seattle-based maker of Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks, has singled out tyres and chassis components among those in short supply. Used-truck prices have risen sharply.Speaking in early October, Mr Fiorelli said he doubted that he could order a new truck and take delivery before the end of the year.According to Mr Stowers, “if you wait for (a truck) to break and then try to replace it, you’re …hard-pressed to find a replacement vehicle”.On another front, the US Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) implemented strict new rules last December that require heightened awareness of drivers’ performance and the condition of vehicles.Under the new rules, drivers and carriers accumulate points – and ultimately penalties – for infractions, big and small. Missing marker lights have been one of the main violations. National-security laws have put trucks carrying hazardous materials under especially heavy scrutiny.According to Mr Vieth, “from a liability standpoint, you’d probably be better served to have younger trucks than older trucks”. He cites anecdotal evidence suggesting that a growing number of drivers are insisting they be assigned to newer vehicles.On the plus side, Mr Stowers says that the new regulations have helped improve driver behaviour, offsetting the extra administrative burden. Keeping drivers happy has become a high priority for fleet owners. Truck drivers are in short supply because of factors including new FMCSA regulations and youngsters’ reluctance to make truck-driving a career. “It looks like the shortages will be sustained for 2-3 years”, Mr Perry says. In particular, he cites the impact on productivity of another raft of FMCSA proposals, known as hours-of-service rules, that would tighten limits on drivers’ working hours.The most contentious provision would require drivers to complete all work-related duties within 13 hours instead of the current 14, curtailing the time they can spend behind the wheel. The final rules are expected soon.For the time being, fleet owners not only have a string of incentives to buy new vehicles, but also the wherewithal. According to Mr Vieth, freight rates are still climbing and corporate profits are buoyant.Mr Stowers adds: “We advise our customers to understand what the optimum replacement time is for each class of vehicle, and we encourage them to stick to it regardless of the economic situation.” The only exception would be unusually low usage.Truck owners have access to a burgeoning array of electronic and wireless monitoring devices to improve efficiency and hold down costs.Previously used mostly to streamline delivery schedules and track driver performance, telematics technology is increasingly used to prevent breakdowns and parts failures. Consolidation among hardware and software suppliers is helping to accelerate the introduction of more sophisticated but also more streamlined systems.Mr Stowers predicts that truckmakers will increasingly incorporate telematics devices into vehicles.It is by no means certain, however, that fleet owners will heed advice to keep buying vehicles in the face of a softening economy.Mr Stowers estimates that the average cost of a rig has climbed from $75,000 to $110,000 in the past seven years, mainly due to tougher diesel emissions standards that took effect in 2007 and earlier this year.According to Mr Fiorelli at Gulfeagle, “It costs money to go green. Most companies are still most concerned about red and black.”ACT has twice in recent months cut its estimate of North American production of big Class 8 rigs in 2012. As of early October, it projected output of about 290,000 units, up from 251,000 this year and still well above the 2009 trough of 118,400 units.But the latest estimate is 12 per cent lower than its forecast earlier this year. If the economy continues to sputter, fleet owners’ fear of slowing freight volumes – and consequently lower rates and shrinking profits –is likely to trump advice from outsiders to keep buying new trucks.
5;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2011-08-15T17:38:31Z;Parts shortage to hinder US truck industry;;US heavy truck sales are set to grow more slowly than expected due to economic uncertainty and bottlenecks at parts suppliers.Indiana-based ACT Re­search, an industry consultancy, has cut its estimate of North American production of big Class 8 rigs to about 300,000 units in 2012, up from 251,000 this year, but below its previous forecast of 330,000. ACT expects that the US will account for almost all the reduction.Chris Kemmer, publisher of the Fleet Sentiment Report, told investors last week that she expects 2012 Class 8 sales as low as 250,000 units. The industry is starting to see “a little bit of pullback”, she said. The extent will depend on freight demand over the next few months.Truck freight activity is normally considered one of the most reliable indicators of overall economic activity, because of the quantity and variety of goods transported by truck.Kenny Vieth, an ACT partner, said that the upheavals of the past few weeks in financial markets would undoubtedly damage industry sentiment. “The question is, does it go on for one, three, six or 12 months?” he added.Kristine Kubacki, analyst at Avondale Partners, said that credit availability would play a big role in future truck orders. “Only big fleets can use their balance sheets right now.”The 2008-09 crisis among Detroit carmakers, which share suppliers with the truck industry, forced some critical suppliers to scale back operations. They have subsequently struggled to meet the surge in demand since production bottomed at just 118,400 units in 2009.Paccar, the Seattle-based maker of Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks, singled out tyres and chassis components among those in short supply. It declined to identify suppliers, but said that the problems involved “not just one or two”.Paccar recently lowered its estimate of 2011 sales, but said it was too early to assess demand next year: “We’re not going to know till we see how September pans out.” Pascar said that operations in Europe, centred on its DAF brand, had not been affected by supply constraints.Hopes for robust orders had been buoyed by an abnormally old fleet, resulting from slow replacement of vehicles during the recession. Used truck prices are unusually high, reflecting growing replacement demand.Fleet operators have posted better second-quarter earnings. The American Trucking Association’s truck-tonnage index, which measures truck freight volumes, was 6.8 per cent higher in June than a year earlier.Even so, many truckers remain in fragile financial condition. Judy McReynolds, chief executive of Arkansas Best, which swung to a $5.3m second-quarter profit from a year-earlier loss and boosted revenues by 21 per cent, cautioned that “the progress made so far does not produce sufficient returns for our shareholders nor does it allow us to adequately recapitalise our business”.
6;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2011-07-26T21:04:58Z;New York stocks down on debt worries;;US stocks stumbled for a second straight session on Tuesday as investors waded through a heavy volume of quarterly earnings reports amid continuing anxiety over the US federal debt limit.The S&P 500 stock index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,331.94 in New York.The benchmark was weighed down by the industrials sector, off 1.9 per cent, and materials, which declined by 1 per cent, while technology shares offset the gloom.Illinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, ended the day down 8.2 per cent at $52.34 after profits missed analysts’ forecasts. 3M, which produces goods from Post-it notes to stethoscopes, dropped 5.4 per cent to $89.93. Paccar, the maker of truck brands Peterbilt and Kenworth, fell 10.7 per cent to $45.02 after profits disappointed analysts,United Parcel Service, the global package shipping company, declined 3.3 per cent to $71.59. While second-quarter sales beat expectations thanks to price increases and a continued recovery in its supply chain business, chief executive Scott Davis noted that high US unemployment was braking demand for services and imports.Mr Davis also warned of ill effects from the political stalemate over raising the $14,300bn federal debt ceiling in Washington. The US Congress showed little progress towards a compromise before the August 2 deadline imposed by the Treasury.On Monday, Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, and John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, offered separate plans to resolve the borrowing limit issue.The White House threatened a presidential veto of Mr Boehner’s legislation Tuesday.“To move significantly one way or another, we’re going to need news on a deal out of Washington. It’s just another check point you need to get beyond,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4 basis points to 4.284 per cent, suggesting continued demand despite the political uncertainty.Janney Montgomery Scott noted the situation seemed to have strengthened correlations among asset classes. “Given that the traditional safe haven asset class, Treasuries, is the source of capital markets uncertainty, we can expect this relationship between risk assets and Treasuries to remain off-kilter until Washington better wraps its hands around the debt ceiling and deficit problems or the government faces a credit event,” the broker-dealer said.Not every industrial stock lagged. Cummins, the diesel engine maker, rose 3.9 per cent to $110.82 after surpassing profit expectations. Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company by revenues, rose 1.9 per cent to $80.82 as sales rose and executives raised their outlook for the year.Ford Motor lost 1.8 per cent to $12.94 after announcing a drop in second-quarter earnings. The Detroit-based carmaker said that pre-tax operating profit and cash flow for the year as a whole would be higher than in 2010.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,501.30.Second-quarter results have revealed a “pretty good earnings season so far”, said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet Research Systems. Through Monday, almost a third of the 500 companies in the S&P index had reported quarterly numbers, and 83 per cent had beaten Wall Street estimates of earnings per share, he said.“The sector where we have seen the biggest surprise is in the technology sector,” he said. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite held its ground, closing 0.1 per cent lower at 2,839.96.Broadcom, which makes chips for wireless devices, jumped 9.4 per cent to $38.20, after issuing a positive revenue outlook. Lexmark International, which supplies computer printers, gained 17.7 per cent to $33.93. Texas Instruments rose 0.3 per cent to $31.57, though executives foreshadowed a lacklustre holiday season.However, Netflix, the DVD and online video streaming service, tumbled 5.2 per cent to $266.91 after warning that a recent price rise would prompt some customers to downgrade or cancel subscriptions.The company, which was reporting second-quarter results, also indicated that revenues would “only grow slightly on a sequential basis” following the price change, which separates DVD and streaming into different subscription packages.After the New York market closed, Amazon reported second-quarter net profit of $191m, or 41 cents per share, sliding from $207m, or 45 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected the online emporium to earn 34 cents per share.
7;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2011-04-05T21:21:19Z;Brussels plans crackdown on directorships;;New rules for Europe’s banking sector are expected to severely restrict the number of boardroom positions directors can hold.European Union officials in Brussels are understood to be considering limiting the number of boardroom seats which directors – notably non-executives– of banks and credit institutions can hold, possibly to as few as two or three.The restriction would be contained in a special section on corporate governance in the latest round of changes to the EU’s Capital Requirements Directive (CRDIV), which sets out capital and other prudential rules for the sector.The current round of changes, the fourth set of amendments to the directive, have been under preparation by Brussels for months and are aimed mainly at implementing the new Basel III banking framework across the 27-country EU bloc.The Brussels package is due to be unveiled this summer and will need approval from member states and the European Parliament.EU officials stressed on Tuesday that no final decisions had yet been taken on the CRDIV and acknowledged privately that boardroom restrictions, which would apply only to banks and credit institutions and not to other financial institutions such as insurers, could be controversial.But, assuming these go ahead, they could have a particularly marked impact in some smaller EU countries, where the pool of available directors has traditionally been limited and multiple directorships are commonplace.Even in much larger markets, such as the UK, it is common for directors on the boards of financial services companies to hold several posts, with some of the highest levels of concentration among banking veterans as well as highly prized female directors.Alison Carnwath, for example, who joined Barclays as a non-executive director last August, also serves as chairman of Land Securities, the UK’s largest property company, and sits on the boards of Man Group, the world’s second-largest hedge fund, Paccar, the heavy-duty truckmaker, and Isis private equity.A comprehensive report into improving UK bank governance published in 2009 by Sir David Walker, the former chairman of Morgan Stanley International, recommended increasing the overall time commitment of a proportion of non-executive directors to between 30 and 36 days.It also urged regulators to toughen up on the vetting process for potential directors, to ensure that only qualified candidates with relevant experience are appointed.However, it did not suggest limiting the total number of directorships held at any one time, as EU officials are considering.

Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

10;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Engine of growth set to fire on all cylinders;;Manufacturing has become fashionable in the UK again, but in the north-west of England it never fell out of favour. It is part of the DNA of a region that invented the spinning jenny, produced the first computer and where Mr Rolls met Mr Royce.In spite of years of decline as Britain embraced a retail and bank-driven boom from the 1980s onwards, the sector still comprises 20 per cent of the region’s gross domestic product, well above the national average of 13 per cent.Since the financial crisis, the government has pledged to rebalance the UK economy away from services – even designing an industrial strategy. The idea had been buried for 30 years after its policy of picking winners proved disastrous.The region’s factories help power – and safely land – aircraft, pump oil and gas, prevent hospital infection and build nuclear submarines. Its aerospace sector, which began with Avro triplanes and now includes parts of Airbuses and Eurofighters, is the biggest in the UK, as is its food and drink sector. Pilkington, the glass maker acquired by Japan’s NSG Group in 2006, still has a big presence in St Helens, Merseyside.Even after the worst recession since before the second world war, the region’s manufacturing sector employs some 400,000 people and contributes £19.6bn ($29.7bn) to the economy. Annually, each job creates about £45,000 in gross added value.Steve Broomhead, chief executive of the Northwest Regional Development Agency (NWDA), the state-funded body fostering economic development, says: “Manufacturing is critical to the north-west. The sector is the biggest of any English region and remains a major driver for economic growth.”However, for the past 18 months it has been a drag on growth. The recession in the region has been deeper than the national average and is expected to persist until the third quarter of 2010, according to a recent report from the Commission for the New Economy, a branch of local government.The jolt has been huge, as witnessed by Leyland Trucks in Lancashire. A chronic sufferer from the “British disease” of strikes in the 1970s, it fell into receivership in 1993. A management buy-out revived the brand and then Paccar of the US bought it in 1998. It invested heavily and exports grew by 123 per cent between 2006 and 2009, as trucks were sold to 44 countries as far afield as Mexico and Australia.Production hit record levels, sharply increasing output to about 24,700 units in 2008, from 13,000 units in 2002, while the workforce grew by a fifth to 1,300. As late as March 2008, the company was taking on 80 staff, introducing a night shift and expecting annual production of 25,000 trucks. By December that year, it was announcing 250 job cuts.Now, however, aided by the fall in sterling, manufacturing is recovering. It will be a long, hard road. Mike Damms, chief executive of the chamber of commerce in East Lancashire, says: “The challenge is that in manufacturing, we have become so productive and efficient that we have had jobless growth.”Take the car industry. The north-west accounts for 12 per cent of UK car output, with big brands such as Land Rover and Vauxhall leading the way. While turnover of its companies increased by more than a third between 2002 and 2007, employment levels remained about the same, at around 23,000.However, there are grounds for optimism, say business leaders. Jürgen Maier, the Manchester-based head of the industrial division for the UK at Siemens, says: “The trend towards offshoring is slowing. Labour costs are rising, shipping costs are rising. There is the quality issue also.”An EEF/BDO Stoy Hayward report last year found that one in seven UK manufacturers had repatriated production lines over past two years.Mr Maier also argues that foreign ownership of British companies – about 70 per cent of manufacturers nationwide – is positive.British management, often answerable to the City of London, frequently chased short-term profit over innovation and sustainability. “There is a different attitude towards investment,” says Mr Maier. “[Foreign owners] are prepared to put the money in and ensure the rewards are achieved over time.”Chris Rowlands, head of manufacturing at the NWDA, says: “We have been very good at attracting inward investment.” Only London and the south-east have been more successful.As bank finance remains tough, it is foreign or privately-owned conservative companies, of which there are many in the north-west, that can seize markets from rivals.Michael Oliver, owner of Oliver Valves, in Knutsford, Cheshire, says: “We have little debt and plenty of cash. We concentrate on gross margin.” He commands a market niche – high quality valves for subsea operations – which makes it hard for rivals to compete and he can sell worldwide to blue chip clients such as BP and Petrobras.“We go to our customers and ask them what they will need in two to four years’ time and then try to design it for them. A lot of British manufacturers suffered because they came up with a great product then found no one wanted it,” says Mr Oliver.This trend for customer service is mirrored by Ener-g. Originally a spin-out from what was then the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist), it was bought by entrepreneur Tim Scott in 1997. It builds combined heat and power plants and also makes waste-to-energy plants and anaerobic digestion facilities that replace landfill for waste. It employs 230 in the north-west.Derek Duffill, managing director, says: “Private ownership allows us to plan long-term.”For example, the company pays the capital cost of new plants and then allows customers to pay for them through the energy savings they make over its lifetime. About 10 per cent of revenues come from long-term service contracts, another trend among manufacturing companies looking to add a stable income stream to smooth out demand.Tony Wilson, of Klarius, a car components maker, has built a big empire quickly. When buying companies he disposes of any parts that do not have market-leading capability.“Our aim is to outdistance the competition. We don’t want to be top of our league – we want to be in a league of our own,” he says, arguing that too many companies settle for less.One threat to all these companies’ growth is a skills shortage.Many engineering graduates are to be found in the City working for investment banks designing financial products rather than solid ones. While manufacturers hope such people can be now be wooed, it is hard to compete with salaries elsewhere.There is a big push to improve the industry’s image. The Manufacturing Institute, a Manchester-based charity, has produced a myth-busting brochure and is setting up the UK’s first Fab Lab, where people can design their own products.Whereas in many countries, Engineer is a formal title as respected as Doctor, in the UK it conjures up images of greasy rags, gloomy mill chimneys and shuttered factories.“There is no instantly identifiable role model for manufacturing, which is part of the problem, but when asked what their image of an engineer is, many people say: ‘Kevin Webster from Coronation Street’,” says Mr Rowlands. The TV soap opera character is a car mechanic best known for moaning about the world as he downs several pints of beer in the local pub, and lists his dislike as “ambition”.Mr Wilson says some company bosses bring the doom-laden image upon themselves. “Too many of them whinge. They are looking for help or handouts when they should be updating or changing their products to give customers what they want.”That is what Verna Group in Bolton has done for 50 years. It began by using waste paper from the Bolton News to develop single-use pulp products, such as bedpans and urinals, that would save nurses time.It makes macerators, which shred the waste and neutralise its chemicals. That creates new business in maintenance and new demand – as it cuts hospital infection. The machines are used in 90 per cent of UK hospital and 43 countries worldwide.Lesley Webster, an ex-nurse and Verna’s UK director, says: “We have to innovate constantly and improve our products. There are plenty of other companies out there that would like to copy them and they have a lower cost base. We are winning on innovation and quality.”
11;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2009-07-08T17:26:08Z;Paccar instigates ‘prudent’ dividend cut;;Paccar, the Seattle-based maker of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF trucks, has cut its dividend for the first time in half a century, underlining the depth of the downturn in the global truck industry.Mark Pigott, chairman and chief executive of the family controlled company, said that “we recognise the importance of the dividend to our shareholders and the significance of this decision”. But he described the halving in the quarterly pay-out, from 18 cents to nine cents a share, as “a prudent business measure in response to the global challenges affecting all industries”.The trucking sector, widely viewed as a leading indicator of overall economic activity, has been hit by lower volumes, fierce price competition and a drive by many users, such as retail chains, to rationalise their distribution networks.Worldwide heavy truck production is expected to slide to about 1m vehicles this year from 1.67m in 2008, according to JD Power and Associates, a consultancy.Paccar’s total volumes are projected to more than halve to 45,200 vehicles, from 104,700 last year. ACT, a truck-data service, estimates that North American heavy truck output slumped by 58 per cent in the first five months of this year, compared with January-May 2008.Analysts forecast an upturn later this year on the basis of a gradual economic recovery and orders ahead of tighter US diesel-engine emission standards due to take effect next January. The slump has accelerated industry consolidation. Germany’s Daimler, the market leader, has closed two North American plants and announced a series of belt-tightening measures in May at Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus, a Japan-based subsidiary. Mitsubishi Fuso aims to halve the number of its models by the end of next year.Paccar has pushed back by a year the expected opening of a diesel-engine plant in Mississippi. Its global workforce has shrunk by more than a fifth in the past year to 17,000.With revenues of $15bn last year, Paccar is the third-biggest heavy truck maker in North America, after Daimler and Navistar, and ranks sixth out of 16 in western Europe.First-quarter earnings sank to $26.3m from $292.3m a year earlier. Revenues halved to $2bn. Known for its conservative management, Paccar – the name is a compression of the original Pacific Car and Foundry – has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.Members of the Pigott family have controlled the company over four generations. Mark Pigott, the founder’s great-grandson, said in an interview with the Financial Times last year that “there are always business fads, the hottest new thing. We don’t get involved in that. We know who we are, we know where we’re gong. That stability is a great bedrock that really strengthens this company”.

The company also forecast full-year profit ahead of previous expectations and the shares rose 7.1 per cent to $51.70.JC Penney also cheered investors with a smaller- than-expected decline in
second-quarter profit. JC Penney shares rose 8.4 per cent to $39.94.Meanwhile, Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen-focused clothing retailer, and Nordstrom, the department store chain, posted less impressive results but investors were resilient. Abercrombie held steady at $52.59 while Nordstrom rose 4.4 per cent to $31.54.The consumer discretionary sector added 1 per cent. Retailers have outperformed this earnings season, with S&P 500 constituents posting profit declines of about 5 per cent on average. That compares with an average drop of 23 per cent for S&P 500 companies.The leading equity indices received a boost from a sharp fall in commodity prices. Oil fell as much as $3 while gold dropped well below $800.Bijal Shah, global chief economist at Société Générale, said: “US consumer firepower, which had been decimated by the sharp rise in energy prices into the summer months . . . is likely to recover over the coming months.”In consumer staples, Wal-Mart Stores added 2.2 per cent to $59.37 and Procter & Gambleclimbed 2.7 per cent to $71.60, helping the sector to advance 1 per cent.Reports showing a small uptick in consumer confidence and a bump in manufacturing activity in New York state in August also lifted sentiment.General Electric shares rose 1 per cent to $29.80 while Manitowoc added 4.5 per cent to $24.96 and Paccar climbed 4.8 per cent to $44.81.Eight of the 10 leading industry groups gained ground, helping the benchmark S&P 500 advance 0.4 per cent to 1,298.2.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 11,659.9 and the Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.1 per cent to 2,452.52.Over another volatile week in which oil prices ticked higher before resuming their retreat, the S&P 500 fought its way to a 0.1 per cent gain – its third in a row. The Dow fell 0.7 per cent while the Nasdaq added 1.4 per cent.Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performers this week, adding 2.4 per cent, thanks to some solid earnings reports from the likes of Estée Lauder.Financials were the biggest losers after another round of writedowns and analyst downgrades and further developments in the auction rate securities fiasco.Goldman Sachs fell 7.5 per cent to $163.18 over the week while JPMorgan lost 8.2 per cent to $38.07 and Bank of America slid 5.6 per cent to $30.70.On Friday, banks fared better after S&P affirmed the credit ratings of the two largest bond insurers. MBIA and Ambac added 8.7 per cent to $11.22 and 24.6 per cent to $5.68, respectively, while the sector added 1.1 per cent.Jim Smigiel, head of investment strategy at SEI, said: “The Ambacs and MBIAs of the world are going to survive - that is how low the bar is at this point. Valuations are such that you don’t have to paint the rosiest picture to make gains in this market.”The pullback in commodities was less kind to energy and materials stocks.On Friday, Newmont Mining slid 3.2 per cent to $41.51, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 2.8 per cent to $84.39 while US Steel fell 3 per cent to $130.88.The energy sector fell back 1.8 per cent and has now lost ground in seven of the past eight sessions. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips gave up 0.5 per cent to $77.07 and 2.2 per cent to $77.66, respectively."
13;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2008-07-22T20:49:24Z;Wall Street rallies as oil price drops sharply;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday as a sharp drop in oil prices boosted consumer-facing stocks while a plan to turn round Wachovia helped investors shrug off some disappointing earnings reports.Most eyes were focused on the financial sector, which staged a remarkable midday volte-face to gain 6.6 per cent as investors skipped over a series of weak earnings results to focus on the positive.Overnight, American Express reported second-quarter earnings that missed estimates and withdrew its full-year earnings forecast. The credit card company’s shares tumbled 7.1 per cent to $37.99 while peer Discover Financial lost 3.8 per cent to $14.62.An $8.9bn loss from Wachovia and some depressing results from regional banks, including Regions Financial and Keycorp, initially added to the sour mood.But by midday investors had shrugged off the bad news, focusing instead on a strategy from Robert Steel, Wachovia’s new chief executive, to cut $2bn of expenses by the end of 2009, sell assets and slash jobs and the dividend at the bank.Wachovia shares swung from an 11.6 per cent loss to a 27.4 per cent gain at $16.79. Regions Financial and Keycorp overturned early losses to gain 9.6 per cent to $11.40 and 4.3 per cent to $11.99, respectively.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim, an online brokerage, said: “Wachovia presented a plan this morning, they cut their dividend – they are doing something. This credit crisis is not going away in a month, but if we have a plan to get ourselves out of it in a year that makes the market feel good.”There were some more consistent bright spots. Western Union advanced 8.6 per cent to $27.23 after the money-transfer company said second-quarter profit had risen 13 per cent, thanks to international revenues, and raised its 2008 profit forecast.SunTrust Banks said second-quarter earnings had slumped 21 per cent. But that was a smaller fall than expected and the shares rallied 17.1 per cent to $39.97 after the bank ruled out a capital raising or dividend cut.CME Group, which runs futures exchanges, said second-quarter profit had risen 60 per cent to $201m thanks to its purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade. CME shares rose 12.5 per cent to $366.27.By the close, the benchmark S&P 500 had shaken off early losses and was up 1.4 per cent at 1,277.01 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent higher at 11,602.5 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was ahead 1.1 per cent at 2,303.96 points.The day began in downbeat fashion after Apple forecast fourth-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ projections. The news, and speculation about the health of Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, sent shares in the iPod maker down 2.6 per cent to $162.02.Texas Instruments and SanDisk also disappointed investors in the technology sector. The semiconductor makers both predicted earnings that trailed analysts’ expectations. Texas shares fell 14.2 per cent to $24.48, SanDisk dropped 24 per cent to $13.62, while an index of semiconductor stocks slipped 2.8 per cent.A $4 drop in oil prices took the sting out of the worst results. Consumer staples and discretionary stocks were among the best performers, adding 2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart added 3.1 per cent to $59.06 while Starbucks rose 7.4 per cent to $15.13.In industrials, some solid earnings news helped steady investor concerns about the health of the economy. Caterpillar, the heavy goods maker, Lockheed Martin, the defence company, Paccar, the truckmaker, and United Parcel Service, each met or beat analysts’ expectations for their quarterly results.Caterpillar shares rose 2.4 per cent to $74.98, Lockheed Martin added 2.3 per cent to $103.88, Paccar climbed 4.4 per cent to $44.60 and UPS advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.11.Energy was the best performing sector on Monday, but that trend petered out on Tuesday as oil prices slipped back below $130 a barrel and some decent results from the services sub-industry left investors unmoved. BJ Services and Baker Hughes rose 6.6 per cent to $31.99, and 3.2 per cent to $87.06, respectively.
14;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2008-07-03T18:51:36Z;Wall Street shrugs off US jobs data;;US equity markets made tentative gains on Thursday but only pared losses for the week after shrugging off data showing that the US shed jobs for a sixth straight month in June and the services sector contracted unexpectedly.According to the US Department of Labor, 62,000 jobs were eliminated last month, largely in line with analysts’ expectations.Analysts noted that there was little cause for optimism on the economy. The unemployment rate, which in May jumped by the most in two decades, remained at 5.5 per cent and non-farm payrolls have now fallen by 438,000 in the first half of the year.Separately, data showed initial jobless claims hit a three-month high last week, while the Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index fell sharply in June.But equity markets proved resilient as traders bet that the poor jobs data would reduce the chance of an interest rate hike from the Fed.Industrial and material stocks were among the leading gainers, adding 1.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively as investors bought back into some of the most heavily sold sectors.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim.com, an online brokerage, said: “Historically, we tend to rally before a patriotic holiday. The major players have already gone home, volumes are light and the path of least resistance is up.”Markets closed early on Thursday and are shut on Friday for the Independence Day holiday. The benchmark S&P 500 ended the day 0.1 per cent higher at 1,262.90 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 at 11,288.54 points while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,245.38 points.Over the shortened week, higher oil prices knocked markets. The Dow and Nasdaq slumped into bear market territory before the Dow recovered slightly, while the S&P 500 touched its lowest level since July 2006.The S&P 500 lost 1.2 per cent over the week and has now declined for five weeks in a row. The Dow Jones fell 0.5 per cent over the week.Technical analysts warned that, having broken through the psychological support of the March lows, the S&P 500 could retest its 2002 depths.Kevin Edgeley, a technical analyst with Goldman Sachs, said: “US markets have been oversold since early June but, in an impulsive trend like this, give no reason to buy.”But investors did just that by, in particular, picking up beaten-down industrial stocks. Ingersoll-Rand added 2.9 per cent to $36.65 while Paccar climbed 2.4 per cent to $40.80.Materials snapped a three- day losing streak as steel producers bounced back. US Steel rose 1.6 per cent to $155.80 and Nucor added 1 per cent to $62.54.Even consumer-facing stocks seemed unfazed by the macroeconomic data. Consumer discretionary stocks added 0.3 per cent while consumer staple stocks rose 0.7 per cent.Safeway and Campbell Soup rose 2.5 per cent to $28.74 and 2.5 per cent to $34.68, respectively, while Kohl’s and Whirlpool climbed 3.4 per cent to $42.52 and 3 per cent to $62.69.Energy stocks were among the biggest fallers however, dropping 0.5 per cent, with refiners taking some punishment. Sunoco fell 3 per cent to $39.69 while Tesoro lost 1.6 per cent to $18.98.In corporate news, NVIDIA tumbled 30.7 per cent to $12.49 after the visual computing technologies provider said second quarter sales would be well below analysts’ estimates.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said that there were some encouraging signs that equity markets might be nearing a bottom. The volatility index has moved higher in recent days, the percentage of stocks trading at or below their 200 day moving averages has increased, and energy and materials stocks have come under pressure.“While this may be seen as a problem for investors,” Mr Levkovich said, “we would stress that any weakness in the commodity and energy space can be helpful to other areas that have been crowded out by momentum-driven trading.”Still, Mr Kinahan warned that there were more losses to come. “This has been the most orderly down move of all time. Wednesday was the first sign of panic. We have further to go on the downside as we have never set a bottom until people have said ‘I have to get out at any price’.”
15;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2008-07-02T20:38:07Z;US blue chips buckle under latest oil blow;;Surging oil prices sent US stocks into a tailspin on Wednesday, knocking the S&P 500 below its March lows for the first time and sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average scuttling into bear market territory - down 20 per cent from its recent peak.The benchmark S&P 500 wobbled between gains and losses but closed the day 1.8 per cent lower at 1,261.53 points - its lowest level since July 2006.Technical analysts have warned that a break through the ‘Bear Stearns’ bottom could lead to further sustained weakness with the index retesting its 2002 lows.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.8 per cent to 11,215.51 while the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.5 per cent to 2,292.94. Both are now down more than 20 per cent from their recent peaks.Oil prices smashed through $143 a barrel after a government inventory report showed a sharp drop in crude oil supplies, knocking all ten leading industry groups on the S&P500 into the red.Rising oil prices have been a constant scourge for equity markets in recent months, raising the spectre of spiralling input costs and tumbling corporate profits.The biggest faller on Wednesday was the material sector, which lost 5.3 per cent - its biggest one day fall since March.Energy intensive steel producers fell for a third day. US Steel lost 12.5 per cent to $153.40 and Nucor dropped 14.2 per cent to $61.94.Gold miners also fell back as gold prices dropped. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 6.9 per cent to $107.57 while Newmont Mining lost 4.5 per cent to $50.99.The energy sector also dragged. Coal stocks were the weak link, tumbling as European prices fell the most since 2005. Massey Energy and Consol Energy fell 18.9 per cent to $74.87 and 14.6 per cent to $95.57 respectively.In industrials, transport-related stocks suffered. CSX fell 6.4 per cent to $57.06 while Paccar lost 7 per cent to $39.86.The day began in a positive fashion after European banks dismissed speculation that they would have to raise more cash, bolstering their US peers.But gains were erased after another rash of analyst downgrades while comments by Hank Paulson also took their toll. The Treasury secretary proposed the president should have to approve any use of taxpayer funds to aid a financial company in trouble.Citigroup fell 1.7 per cent to $16.84 while Merrill lost 3.4 per cent to $31.15. The financial sector as a whole slipped 1.4 per cent.Macroeconomic news did little to improve the mood. New data from the Commerce Department showed US factory orders climbed a faster-than-expected 0.6 per cent in May for a third monthly increase.Any positive momentum was curtailed by the ADP Employer Services report, which showed private companies cut jobs at four times the expected rate in June.Carmakers came under renewed pressure after analysts at Merrill Lynch punctured the euphoria surrounding General Motors sales figures, which were released on Tuesday.The brokerage downgraded GM from “buy” to “underperform” and cut its 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates, citing lower forecasts for US car sales and noting that “bankruptcy is not impossible.”GM fell 15.1 per cent to $9.98 while Ford dipped 7.4 per cent to $4.36.The consumer discretionary sector also slipped back 1.7 per cent as oil prices rose. Liz Claibornlost 6.6 per cent to $13.08 while Staplesfell 4.9 per cent to $23.12.Starbucks clung to a 0.4 per cent gain at $15.68, buoyed by plans to cut 7 per cent of its workforce and close 600 stores as part of efforts to revitalise the coffee chain.Blockbuster rose 5.8 per cent to $2.65 after it dropped a $1.35bn bid for Circuit City Stores the lossmaking electronics retailer. Circuit City shares slumped 9 per cent to $2.32.The technology sector was volatile. Semiconductors were the worst performing subsector, while software and services companies followed close behind.But there were exceptions. Yahoo climbed 3.4 per cent to $20.88 after the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft had approached media companies about teaming up for a break-up deal. Microsoft fell 3.7 per cent to $25.88.Meanwhile, Dell shares rallied 2. per cent to $23.70 after chief executive Michael Dell revealed he had bought 4.5m shares in the company at between $21.89 and $22.39 since June 27.
16;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2008-06-12T18:54:36Z;Caterpillar to quit US engine market;;The shake-up in the global truck industry took another step forward on Thursday, as Caterpillar announced its withdrawal as a supplier of engines to US truck makers and said it would pursue a global joint venture with Navistar International.The two companies plan to produce medium and heavy-duty commercial trucks outside North America. But Caterpillar will in future focus its North American truck business on the joint development of a “severe service” off-highway vehicle used for road construction, large infrastructure projects and oil development.Questions have hung over Caterpillar’s North American truck-engine business for some time. Its market share has declined and one of its biggest customers, Paccar, builder of the Peterbilt and Kenworth brands, is currently building its own engine plant in Mississippi.The slowing US economy has severely dented demand for new trucks, and truck makers face heavy investments to comply with tighter US diesel emission regulations that take effect in 2010.Caterpillar does not disclose engine sales volumes. Sales to truck makers made up 9 per cent of its worldwide total last year, behind industrial, power-generation, oilfield and marine users. Caterpillar also produces engines for its own construction and mining equipment.Caterpillar’s planned withdrawal from the US on-highway truck market boosted shares of Cummins, one of its chief rivals, by 14 per cent in early trading on Thursday.Navistar said that the joint venture would combine its expertise in truck design, development and manufacturing, with Caterpillar’s 4,700 distributors around the world.Navistar has a significant presence in Mexico, Chile and South Africa, as well as a manufacturing joint venture with India’s Mahindra & Mahindra. But it has lacked resources to expand into other parts of the world.The latest deal “allows us to reach the entire world using Caterpillar’s distribution base”, Dan Ustian, Navistar’s chief executive, said on Thursday. “Maybe China will be the first place”, he added.The two companies have set up teams to assess truck and engine opportunities.Navistar said that the deal with Caterpillar would have no impact on its project with Germany’s MAN to build heavy-duty truck engines at a plant now under construction in Alabama.Volkswagen owns 30 per cent of MAN. Oliver Dixon, a truck-industry consultant, suggested that the German carmaker might at some point consider selling its stake to Caterpillar and Navistar.Caterpillar shares gained 2.7 per cent to $81.06 in early trading. Navistar was almost 4 per cent higher at $74.70.The consolidation of the truck industry is already well advanced in other parts of the world. A prolonged takeover battle for Sweden’s Scania, one of the industry’s most profitable players, ended in March, with Volkwagen buying a stake previously held by the Wallenberg family.
17;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2008-04-11T20:34:23Z;Wall Street soured by poor GE results;;Wall Street stocks slumped on Friday and were down for the week after results from industrial bellwether General Electric missed estimates, re-igniting concerns that corporate profits would not escape financial market turmoil.GE blamed disruptions in global capital markets for poor performance at its finance divisions, which had the sharpest first-quarter profit declines.Investors and analysts were unimpressed. Goldman Sachs downgraded GE’s shares, saying the decline in profit raised “credibility concerns”, given that the chief executive reassured the market that the company was on target in mid-March.GE was the leading faller in the S&P500, sliding 12.8 per cent, its biggest one-day drop since 1987, to $32.05.The results were particularly unnerving for investors who bought into diversified and globalised industrial conglomerates in the hope that they would offer a haven from the problems of the US economy.Tyco International fell 3.5 per cent to $44.28, while United Technologies lost 3.2 per cent to $69.53 and Paccar, the truck manufacturer, sagged 3.7 per cent to $44.63. Those losses made industrials the worst performing sector of the week.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 2 per cent lower at 1,332.86 points and lost 2.7 per cent over the week, its worst performance in over a month.The Nasdaq Composite lost 2.6 per cent on Friday, and 3.4 per cent over the week, to 2,290.24 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2 per cent, and 2.3 per cent over the week, to 12,325.59 points.GE’s results squashed any lingering optimism after improved forecasts by Wal-Mart helped stocks to rally on Thursday.Randy Frederick, director or derivatives at Charles Schwab, said: “Much as some economists would like to believe that the Fed has solved all of these problems and that the worst is over, I am not convinced. I think this earnings season is going to be fairly weak.”“Volatility indices have been trickling lower but eventually bad news will compound and markets won’t be able to shrug it off any more. I think you have seen the start of that with GE’s results today.”Over the week, an index of financials fell 4.6 per cent.Washington Mutual, the largest US savings and loan group, secured a $7bn dollar capital infusion but also forecast $1.1bn first-quarter losses.WaMu fell on Friday, slipping 4.1 per cent after Goldman Sachs analysts cut their earnings estimates for the bank and recommended selling the shares short.But the stock ended the week 7.7 per cent ahead at $10.95.An index of investment banking stocks was down 6.3 per cent over the week, led by Lehman Brothers, which fell 9.5 per cent in the period to $39.87.The first-quarter earnings season kicked off with disappointing results from Alcoa, the aluminium producer, on Monday.It worsened on Wednesday, when United Parcel Service, another bellwether of the US economy, predicted that profits would fall as a domestic slowdown took effect and rising energy prices increased costs.Alcoa fell 9.9 per cent to $35.15 over the week, while UPS’s shares gave up 4.7 per cent to $71.89 and dragged down related stocks such a transport companies.Since the new year analysts have consistently revised down their forecasts but at the start of the week they were still predicting earnings growth of about 7 per cent for the S&P 500, excluding financials.In a week light on data, what emerged was mostly negative. Consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan, dropped again and in March sales at comparable chain stores fell 0.5 per cent, while clothing and department store sales tumbled by much more.Gap lost 5.8 per cent to $17.95, Dillards shed 8.9 per cent to $20.07, while Bed Bath & Beyond, which reported disappointing forecasts earlier in the week, slipped 4.3 per cent to $30.23 over the week.Still, there were winners. Wal-Mart shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $54.80 over the week after the world’s biggest retailer announced improved sales and forecasts as consumers downshifted to value-brands.Energy stocks were only ones to find a modicum of consistent growth however, as oil hit new record prices before easing back and coal producers pushed through significant price increases.Over the week, Peabody Energy added, 7 per cent to $61.07 while Halliburton climbed 6 per cent to $43.52 and Apache rose 4.4 per cent to $131.93.Semiconductor firms Micron Technology and LSI held their ground after upgrades and news that a competitor had successfully increased its prices.Micron added 2.1 per cent to $6.90 over the weekwhile LSI slipped 0.5 per cent to $5.46.
18;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2007-12-10T07:01:45Z;Opinion: lessons from 25 supply chain leaders;;"Chief executives own final accountability. Shareholders want strong profit growth and minimum volatility. Regulators and the press expect social and environmental responsibility. Customers demand someone deliver on promises made to them. Supply chain management has become the key to meeting all of these commitments.Most companies, especially in manufacturing and retail, but increasingly in the energy, entertainment, and healthcare sectors, have seen supply chain management gain strategic importance in recent years. For those wondering what good supply chain management is and how leading companies exploit it, AMR Research has published, yearly since 2004, a report titled, “The Supply Chain Top 25”.This list features leading companies that have advanced supply chain from its roots in logistics, material handling, and purchasing toward the modern, demand-driven value network needed in our globalised, Internet-enabled, 21st century business environment.Twentieth century business was largely built on a manufacturing economy of big assets tied up in factories and production equipment. Supply chain management in this context meant feeding the factory and shipping finished goods, acting only as a support function to the real business of making basic products for customers.Today’s customers want goods that depend primarily on intellectual property (lifesaving molecules, entertainment electronics, creative design) and are built by companies tapping a global network of specialists to bring innovative things to people whose homes are already full of refrigerators, shoes, and shaving foam.This demand-driven value network approach is exemplified by companies such as Nike (No. 18 in 2007), which innovates with a brand and total consumer experience that supports high prices while keeping a close eye on operations across a global manufacturing and distribution network. For those who think Nike is all about marketing, consider that its supply chain has increased operating margins in each of the last four years: 2003, 10.5 per cent; 2004, 11.8 per cent; 2005, 13.5 per cent; and 2006, 14.3 per cent.The same can be said of Nokia, with the top supply chain in the world, which excels at supplier collaboration while still pushing technology and design innovation that reaches almost 1bn people worldwide. Along with Nike, Procter & Gamble (No. 3), Coca Cola (No. 13), and all the other consumer products companies on the list, Nokia’s supply chain serves the chief executive’s first master, shareholders, by doing more than just cutting costs.Nokia orchestrates the constant collaboration between supply, demand, and product management groups that brings profitable new products to market. Nokia’s share price has doubled in the past 12 months.The principle does not only apply to companies selling to consumers. IBM (No. 4), Cisco Systems (No. 11), Johnson Controls (No. 16), and Paccar (No. 24) sell almost exclusively to corporate customers. All, however, also depend on the successful orchestration of supply (manufacturing, sourcing, logistics), demand (sales, marketing, service), and product (R&D, engineering).Each company has succeeded for shareholders by integrating processes that allow them to operate as demand-driven value networks: orchestrating players up and down the supply chain with a combination of information, visibility, cross-cutting metrics, and market discipline.Paccar, for example, uses streamlined information systems and super lean assembly plants to deliver custom-built vehicles in as little as two weeks. The customer is happy. And shareholders? Paccar’s operating margins for the last five years through 2006: 7.6 per cent, 9.3 per cent, 11.5 per cent, 12.2 per cent, 12.7 per cent.Chief executives need to think of the supply chain not as a cost centre but as the orchestrator of a value network. Supply chain executives are accustomed to being measured and are often the best suited to devise and maintain metrics for operational and innovation excellence that can define a value network’s performance. Such metrics may be a better way to communicate with investors about future prospects and justify a higher price-to-earnings multiple.Our Top 25 has outperformed broader stock market indices by almost 100 per cent the 12 months following release of the report each year indicating at least some link between good supply chain management and increasing shareholder value.Another important worry for chief executives is also fundamentally a supply chain management issue: social and environmental responsibility (SER). A decade ago this might have been seen as merely public relations. Today, chief executives pressed to go green or get rid of sweatshops will find that almost 100 per cent of the meaningful action that can be taken depends on their supply chain executives. They are the ones burning the fossil fuels, processing the materials, and hiring and firing the people. They are also the ones who collect the data that shows whether these things are being done responsibly or not.Some of the most important pioneering work in sustainability is happening in supply chains where leaders such as Hewlett-Packard (No. 21), Wal-Mart (No. 6), and Tesco (No. 8) are taking a mega-scale view of their global footprint. HP, for example, uses recycled material for about 60 per cent of its metals consumption in manufacturing.Finally, consider accountability to the customer. Supply chains of the 20th century were inward looking, concerned primarily with factory throughput and cost control. It took a decade of leadership from the likes of Toyota (No. 5) to teach supply chains about quality. Today’s best are looking for the next level to become truly demand-driven. No. 3 Procter & Gamble calls it the “moment of truth” when a consumer chooses to buy and then use a product. Everything in P&G’s global value network is based on winning at this moment of truth.Supply chain management has evolved from a low impact cost centre to the essential means to drive shareholder value, global reputation, and customer satisfaction. CEOs interested in leaving a great legacy had better understand how this change is happening and what they can do about it. For a start, look to these Top 25 leaders to see how their supply chain management strategies are evolving and why they are stealing the lead from those who are still stuck in the 20th century.Kevin O’Marah is chief strategy officer for AMR Research."
19;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2007-09-11T07:13:22Z;Commercial vehicles: Truckmakers circle the wagons;;"While carmakers worry about fickle markets and tightening regulation in Europe, most commercial vehicle producers are on a roll. In a market with fewer players and a more predictable customer base than for cars, truck sales on the continent have been ticking over well.Surging demand for commercial vehicles in central and eastern Europe in particular is buoying the sector. Manufacturers are investing heavily in new capacity in the east amid a boom in construction and shipping in the new EU member states and the former Soviet Union.PACCAR, the Seattle-based, New York-listed group that owns Europe’s DAF brand, is projecting record or near-record growth in demand from eastern Europe this year. The company is building a new parts distribution centre in Budapest to serve its customers in the region. “In central Europe five years ago, there was about 10,000 units’ demand for heavy-duty trucks; now there’s about 50,000,” says Mark Pigott, chairman and chief executive officer. “Three to five years out, it could be 100,000.”Demand for new large trucks in the region is forecast to double over the next four years, according to a Standard & Poor’s report published last month. The ratings agency forecast that demand would double to 101,000 by 2010, driven by high investments in infrastructure in new EU members and trucks’ increasing use over other freight transportation. “The east European market has become the hotspot for most of the manufacturers,” says Kelvin Briggs, segment leader for transportation with GE Capital, a leading financier of the sector. “There’s an almost insatiable demand for trucks right now.”The growth in the east has coincided with a recent spike in demand for heavy trucks in the UK, France and Germany. Upgrading of emissions levels on trucks to meet Euro 4 standards led many buyers to bring forward their buying programmes. “New truck lead times have reached an all-time high,” says Mr Briggs.This temporary embarrassment of riches in Europe underscores the truck segment’s notoriously cyclical nature, which makes for volatile earnings at the big players. “We’re seeing peaks and troughs with differences of sometimes more than 50 per cent,” Emmanuel Bulle of Fitch Ratings says of the sector’s earnings.After a rush in new orders in western Europe spurred by the new regulations, demand has slowed down. Part of the slowdown has been compensated for by sales in Central and Eastern Europe, says Mr Bulle.In North America, meanwhile, truck sales have been sagging, eating away some of the gains producers are making in Europe. Volvo AB’s deliveries in the US were down 60 per cent for the year to end-July. The truckmaker, which owns the Mack, Nissan Diesel, and Renault Trucks brands in addition to its own, blamed excess dealer inventories, lower freight volumes, and weakness in the housing market for the drop. DaimlerChrysler’s truck group sold 20,300 fewer units in the second quarter than a year ago. The world’s largest producer attributed the slump primarily to stricter emission regulations in North America and Japan, although its quarterly earnings were up year on year, thanks in part to increased sales in Europe and Latin America.Even in booming central Europe, the commercial vehicle companies are prone to a risk common among carmakers: when chasing hot new market or products, they sometimes have a tendency to overinvest in capacity. S&P analyst Werner Staeblein warned that “in their rush for a slice of the cake” in Eastern Europe, manufacturers “could be tempted to increase their individual capacity to a level that will lead to an imbalance of supply and demand, and therefore to overcapacity in the industry.”Supply and demand for trucks in Europe were balanced in 2006, he added, with production capacity of 318,00 new trucks, against 312,000 sold. But by 2010 S&P forecasts that western truckmakers will have excess capacity of 19,000 units in European plants.Commercial vehicle companies share another concern with carmakers: the high cost of compliance with increasingly stringent emissions legislation. Last year’s changes in western Europe raised the cost of engines by $5,000 to $8,000 per vehicle, says PACCAR’s Mr Pigott.Mr Bulle of Fitch puts the costs of compliance with new emissions standards higher, at €6,000 to €8,000 per vehicle. As with passenger car producers, these costs are driving truckmakers to pool development costs.In June Fiat and DaimlerChrysler’s truck division reached agreement on a deal to develop engines for the Canter light commercial vehicle produced by Mitsubishi Fuso, of which the German producer owns 85 per cent. The agreement will see Fiat’s engine division supply about 80,000 light-duty diesel engines per year to Fuso, with the numbers set to rise in later years.As the truck producers seek scale and savings, full-scale mergers and acquisitions are not off the agenda, although MAN’s failed play for Scania has cooled consolidation talk somewhat. Sector analysts and participants describe a tie-up between the companies, possibly brokered by Volkswagen, as a continuing likelihood. “It’s hard to imagine there won’t be more mergers over the next few years,” says GE Capital’s Mr Briggs.Mr Pigott says “consolidation is pretty well set” in North America and Europe, where the number of major players has dropped to about seven, from about 40 in the 1960s. “Where the consolidation will occur in the next 15 to 20 years will be in Asia, where there are about 40 manufacturers,” he says."
20;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2006-09-21T08:35:12Z;MAN bid for Scania ‘at wrong point in truck cycle’;;"MAN’s €9.6bn ($12.1bn) hostile bid for Scania comes at the wrong point in the truck cycle and will allow competitors to steal market share, according to rival chief executives of truckmakers.In a series of interviews with the FT at an international truck show in Hanover, managers expressed their surprise at the move, which comes at the peak of the cycle when companies’ valuations are normally more fully priced.Andreas Renschler, head of commercial vehicles at the world’s largest truckmaker, DaimlerChrysler, said: “In my opinion you should buy in bad times and sell in good times.”Kerry McDonagh, head of sales and marketing at DAF, the European truckmaker owned by Paccar of the US, said: “If MAN and Scania are busy bringing themselves together, that strengthens our business and could allow us to raise our market share.”Paolo Monferino, head of Iveco, the truckmaker owned by Fiat, said: “When you integrate two companies you have disruption and in the short term you are going to focus on the company and lose a bit of sight of your customers.”The bid for Scania by the German truckmaker has been rejected not only by
the company but also its two biggest shareholders, Volkswagen and Investor, who hold more than half of the voting rights.MAN’s advisers believe winning them over is only a question of price but people close to Investor have suggested the differences are more fundamental and that they do not approve of the corporate governance of a German group.The lack of support of the two large shareholders was sharply criticised by executives and bankers.“It would be the same as buying BMW without first asking the Quandts [who own nearly 50 per cent],” said one chief executive.The head of an investment bank said: “Who has ever heard of a hostile deal launched against two majority shareholders without their agreement? This could go horribly wrong and if it does it will leave MAN horribly weak.”The head of a large truckmaker confirmed the view of some MAN non-executive directors that a failed bid would put the German group in play itself: “MAN could be a target. It is the cheap
one in the industry. But I don’t know whether a European should buy it. Maybe
a Chinese manufacturer could.”Anton Weinmann, head of MAN’s trucks division, said it was taking Chinese manufacturers seriously and that they would come to Europe soon. But he added: “MAN is no takeover candidate. We are a strong company.” On buying at the peak of the cycle, he said: “We think now is the right time. We see truck consolidation coming. We think volume is important.”MAN believes, even without Scania, that it can expand its trucks business organically despite any downturn."
21;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2006-09-18T14:09:24Z;Scania shareholders reject MAN bid;;MAN launched a €9.6bn offer for Scania on Monday but it ran into immediate difficulties as the Swedish truckmaker and its two largest shareholders rejected the offer.The German truckmaker is offering SKr442 per Scania share in a cash-heavy bid to create Europe’s largest commercial vehicles manufacturer.“This combination will deliver significant value to both Scania and MAN shareholders,” said Håkan Samuelsson, MAN’s chief executive, in a statement issued on Monday morning. “The enlarged group will be able to increase its competitiveness, whilst also securing jobs in Germany and Sweden.”But Volkswagen, the German automotive group which has 34 per cent of the voting rights in Scania, rejected the bid. “Accepting the takeover offer for Scania presented today by MAN would not be in the group’s industrial interest. Thus the Volkswagen group rejects the acceptance and will not sell its stake,” VW said in a statement.Investor, the Swedish group that holds 19.3 per cent of voting rights, also rejected the deal. It said the offer “did not reflect the fair value and potential of Scania”.Investor, the investment arm of Sweden’s powerful Wallenberg family, said it “has serious reservations” about being a minority shareholder in a German company, people close to the group said.Investor does not admire German corporate governance rules or the curtailed influence that supervisory boards can exert over a company’s operations, they said.Investor is understood to be actively considering options, including a rival bid from a non-German company that would allow it to retain a stake in the enlarged entity. MAN is targeting at least €500m in synergies, a figure that is “conservative”, according to Mr Samuelsson.MAN has already bought Renault’s stake in Scania, representing 5.2 per cent of voting rights. But people close to the company have said they were afraid of the possibility of a counter-bid, possibly from Paccar of the US.Based on the average price in the three months to September 11, the day before Scania’s announcement that it was expecting a bid to come from MAN, the bid represents a 39 per cent premium over Scania’s A shares’ and a 36 per cent premium to its B shares.The offer also values Scania at 16 times expected 2006 earnings, below the global average for commercial vehicle makers of 18 but a premium to the PE of 11 for larger rival Volvo.MAN is advised by Greenhill, Handelsbanken and Citigroup while Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank acted for Scania.Shares in MAN fell 4.8 per cent to €60.94 in afternoon Frankfurt trading. VW shares were 20 euro cents lower at €64.64. Shares in Scania, which have also doubled since the beginning of the year, climbed another 5.1 per cent to SKr446.50.
22;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2006-09-13T21:07:39Z;Wheels of change pick up pace;;When Volvo bid for Scania in 1999, Leif Östling, chief executive of the smaller Swedish truckmaker, was resolute in his rejection. But Håkan Samuelsson, his then head of production and development, saw it differently: sharing engineering and components could lead to big savings, he pointed out.The two did not fall out over the issue, colleagues say. But after Mr Östling fought off Volvo with the help of an antitrust ruling from the European Commission, Mr Samuelsson stayed only three more months before climbing into the cab of the trucks business of German rival MAN.Now chief executive at MAN, Mr Samuelsson is turning the tables on his former boss, drawing up a bid for Scania that is expected to be launched early next week.The arguments are the same as seven years ago. Mr Östling is repeating his anti-merger mantra, insisting that in the motor industry “one plus one is less than two”. Mr Samuelsson still believes the economies of scale available from purchasing commodities such as steel and sharing expensive technology for engines, gearboxes and axles are big enough to justify the risks of a mega-deal.This time, though, Mr Samuelsson appears to be winning. Scania shares have risen almost 20 per cent in two days on the expectation that the company’s two biggest shareholders, Volkswagen and the Wallenberg family’s Investor holding company, will support a MAN cash-and-shares bid. According to people familiar with the talks, VW is broadly in favour of a deal, although Wallenberg support is much less certain.“A merger/takeover is possible and would make sense,” said Julia Varesko, analyst at JPMorgan, on Wednesday.The argument in favour is simple. Put together Scania, maker of premium-priced trucks, and MAN, and the combined company would have revenues of about €22bn ($28bn) and leapfrog market leaders Volvo and DaimlerChrysler to take a 28.6 per cent share of the European market.At present, MAN, with 15.6 per cent, and Scania, with 13 per cent, are well behind the leaders, who benefit from US operations that both MAN and Scania lack.“We think it is important to be bigger,” Mr Samuelsson told the FT last month. “The critical size in this industry is going up.”In all, MAN’s internal calculations put the savings at more than €500m a year.Financial analysts are more cautious. Morgan Stanley, in a note released shortly before the bank was taken on as an adviser to Scania, estimated the savings at €300m. Even so, it estimated an 80 per cent cash offer at SKr450 – above the SKr422 closing price on Wednesday, itself up 8.3 per cent – would be about neutral for earnings per share before the savings.The counter-argument from Mr Östling is equally clear. On its own, Scania produces margins consistently higher than bigger competitors. Furthermore, mergers and takeovers inevitably distract managers, sometimes with massive culture clashes that risk the future of the new company, as happened after Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler of the US to create DaimlerChrysler.In this case, though, Mr Samuelsson is confident of avoiding a culture clash. He spent 23 years at Scania and brought several former colleagues to MAN.“Between Samuelsson and those four, they know the entire management of Scania. It is a completely one-off situation. They know both companies inside out,” said a senior MAN director.Observers see intervention by other sub-scale heavy truckmakers – which include Fiat’s Iveco, Navistar and Paccar of the US, and Isuzu and Hino of Japan – as unlikely, although they may feel pressured to look for their own alliances by MAN’s move. Indeed, Mr Samuelsson has already begun to look beyond the purchase of Scania to a further deal, possibly rekindling an approach to Navistar abandoned this year when the US company was plunged into crisis by accounting issues.“In a next step we can go into another constellation. Navistar is a definite possibility but it needs to do its homework first,” says the MAN director.The outcome of the clash between Mr Samuelsson and Mr Östling will be determined not by pure industrial logic: Bernd Pischetsrieder, VW chief executive and Scania chairman, is described by people involved in the deal as “kingmaker”.As well as getting a good price for its 34 per cent voting stake in Scania, VW needs scale for its Brazilian heavy trucks business, and wants a partner to distribute its vans in Europe. The purchase of VW’s Brazil business is already being considered as what one MAN insider called a “stage two” of the deal.A person familiar with VW’s thinking says: “Pischetsrieder said trucks remained ‘strategic’ for VW and this would definitely be strategic although nothing is decided yet.”
23;PCAR;Paccar Inc;2004-09-17T17:08:12Z;New appetite develops for euro bonds;;"A growing number of companies are entering the euro bond market for the first time, encouraged by the opportunity to reach new investors with low financing costs.The market for new bond issues has sprung to life in the past two weeks after bankers and investors returned to their desks from summer holidays.Overall, the issuance of corporate bonds is down 40 per cent from last year because companies have focused on reducing debt, but the market has not been as favourable to borrowers for more than five years.The aggregate credit spread - the premium over government bonds that investors demand to own corporate bonds - is at its lowest level since 2000, boosted by improving company balance sheets while demand for new bonds has outstripped demand since the start of the year.These conditions have tempted several companies to enter the euro market for the first time.This week BAA, the operator of Heathrow and six other airports in the UK, raised €750m ($913m) from its first euro-denominated bond.The 10-year deal attracted €4.5bn worth of orders, allowing the company to price the bonds at a yield spread of 37 basis points above the benchmark interest rate swap level. That was at the tight end of the 37bp-40bp price guidance indicated by the issuer.""This deal gave the company access to capital at a similar cost to what it could have done in sterling,"" said Jean-Marc Mercier at HSBC's corporate syndicate desk, which managed the deal with BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank.""In addition, two-thirds of the investors in the deal were new to the company,"" he added.Diversifying the investor base is important for companies, as it increases their flexibility to raise capital when they need to.In the financial sector, Chelsea Building Society also issued its first euro bond last week, raising €600m by selling five-year bonds.Other companies that are about to access the euro market for the first time include Cargill, the US food trader and producer, and Tchibo, Germany's biggest supplier of roasted coffee, which is issuing its first bond altogether.Paccar, the second-biggest truck manufacturer in the US, and EWE, the German utility company, are also preparing their first entry into the euro bond market.The transactions are expected to be launched in the next couple of weeks."
